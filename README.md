# Scrapers

Web scrapers. See `column-descrtiption.csv` for a description of the columns.

Put your scrapped data in the data directory. Once everything has been scrapped run the `data-merger.py` script to merge all the data into one file (normally done only once).



List:
- The BFD
- Carbon Sense
- Cato Institute
- Clexit
- CO2 Coalition
- FOS
- No tricks
