The World Travel and Tourism Council meeting in Buenos Aires has announced a formal partnership with the UNFCCC to jointly tackle climate damage caused by global tourism.
WTTC AND UN CLIMATE CHANGE IN NEW PARTNERSHIP TO TACKLE GLOBAL WARMING
APRIL 26, 2018
ENVIRONMENT / TOURISM
The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN Climate Change) have agreed a common agenda for climate action in tourism.
Agreed at the WTTC Global Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina last week, the partnership backs goals  set by the Paris Agreement to maintain temperature levels at 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and the economic importance of tourism to the world’s economy (10% of GDP and one in 10 jobs), the Common Agenda sets out a framework for the two organisations to recognise and address the linkages between tourism and climate change.
Announcing the agreement, Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change advised “this is the first time the tourism sector has actively engaged on a global level with the UN Climate agenda.
“We recognise that tourism has a huge role to play in addressing climate change. While climate change itself poses significant risks to some tourism destinations, in many of the most high-risk areas, tourism can provide opportunities for communities to build resilience to its impacts. At the same time, as a fast-growing sector, tourism has a responsibility to ensure this growth is sustainable and sits within the parameters set by the Paris Agreement.

The WTTC press release is available here
Sadly this partnership may add to the moral burden of climate scientists, who already accumulate substantial air miles attending conferences in exotic holiday destinations like Paris, Cancun and Davos.
Personal inspections of environmentally endangered eco-tourist hotspots will likely be required, maybe even a rota of permanent monitoring in the most sensitive locations, to ensure places of special ecological significance are properly preserved.

The Climate Change Act CCA) commits the U.K. to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050, and sets a framework for the setting of rolling five-year carbon “budgets”. Parliament approved the Fifth Carbon Budget in 2017, for the period 2028-32 at a 57% reduction on 1990 levels. According to the U.K Committee on Climate Change (CCC), U.K. emissions were 42% below 1990 levels in 2016. The first carbon budget (2008-2012) has been met and the country is on track to meet the goals of the second (2013 to 2017), and the third (2018 to 2022). It is not on track to meet the goals of the fourth, from 2023 to 2027. Most of the reductions have occurred in the industry and power sectors. The U.K. government has come increasingly under pressure from both industry and consumers because of the high costs of the emissions reduction efforts. Accordingly, it commissioned a review led by Professor Dieter Helm of Oxford University with a mandate to review and report on how to meet four competing objectives: To continue making emissions reduction in line with the carbon budgets;To ensure security of electricity supply;To attain the lowest electricity costs in Europe for households and businesses; andTo do this at minimum cost and without imposing further costs on the exchequer (i.e. on taxpayers). The Helm Report was finalized and published in October, 2017, and can be seen here: http://www.biee.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/Cost_of_Energy_Review.pdf Dieter Helm is an economist specializing in utilities, infrastructure, regulation and the environment. He has a reputation as a skeptic about renewable energy, but his recent book, The Endgame for Fossil Fuels, makes it clear that he is even more skeptical concerning the benefits of oil, natural gas and coal. From reading the report, one can conclude that he also is extremely optimistic concerning the pace at which new energy technologies will be proven in research, quickly commercialized and disseminated at much lower costs than current energy technologies. Main Findings and Recommendations Professor Helm’s main findings and conclusions and recommendations are these: “The cost of energy is too high, and higher than necessary to meet the Climate Change Act (CCA) target and the carbon budgets… Prices should be falling, and they should go on falling into the medium and longer terms. The scale of the multiple (government) interventions in the electricity market is now so great that few if any could even list them all, and their interactions are poorly understood. Complexity is itself a major cause of rising costs, and tinkering with policies and regulations is unlikely to reduce costs. Indeed, each successive intervention layers on new costs and unintended consequences. It should be the central aim of government to radically simplify the interventions and to get government back out of many of its current detailed roles. The legacy costs from the Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), the feed-in-tariffs and low carbon contracts for difference (CfDs) are a major contributor to rising final prices, and should be separated out, ring-fenced, and placed in a “legacy bank”. They should be charged separately and explicitly on customer bills. Industrial customers should be exempt.  The most efficient way to meet the CCA target and the carbon budget is to set a universal carbon price on a common basis across the whole economy, harmonizing the multiple carbon taxes and prices currently in place. This price should vary so as to meet the carbon targets. It would be significantly lower than the cost of the current multiple interventions. There should be a border carbon price (i.e. an import tariff equal in effect to the domestic carbon price) to address the consequences of the UK adopting a unilateral carbon production target. The FITs and other low carbon CfDs should be phased out and merged into a unified equivalent firm power (EFP) auction. The costs of intermittency will then rest with those who cause them, and there will be a major incentive for the intermittent generators to contract with and invest in the demand side, storage and back-up plants. The balancing and flexibility of markets should be significantly encouraged.”  He goes on to recommend major changes in the institutions (i.e. utilities, system operators, and regulatory bodies) that now manage the UK electrical energy system. In the body of his report and in the Executive Summary, Professor Helm offers strong criticism of the way past and present British governments have managed the electricity system, criticism that will sound familiar to those who have witnessed recent “Green Energy” policies in Canada. “In the current decade, the government has moved from mainly market-determined investments to a new context in which almost all new electricity investments are determined by the state through direct and often technology-specific contracts. Government has got into the business of ‘picking winners’. Unfortunately, losers are good at picking governments, and inevitably – as in most such picking-winners strategies – the results end up being vulnerable to lobbying, to the general detriment of household and industrial customers.  In determining not just the level of new capacity, but also the composition of the low-carbon portfolio, the government started out with some of the most expensive technologies first, and it could be argued that since then it has at times been exploring even more expensive options. The result is that British households and businesses are locked into higher renewables and other low-carbon generation costs than they need to be to achieve the decarbonization objectives for the decades to come.” Comments In effect, what British governments have done through their complex schemes of subsidizing solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies for electricity generation has been to finance the large scale deployment of largely immature technologies. They did so by awarding each technology a price for the electricity it generates high enough to make it profitable, then guaranteeing that price, indexed to inflation, usually for 15 years (Ontario has followed a similar practice only for 20-year contracts). The people advising the civil servants on the price required to make each technology profitable were often the businesses backing that technology. The standard excuse for going straight to full-scale deployment of immature wind and solar technologies is that it was necessary to bring down costs. Yet, as Peter Lilley of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the UK pointed out, “most new technologies – computers, mobile phones, gas turbines and, perhaps most telling, fracking – have rapidly reduced their costs without government subsidizing large-scale deployment. Making it profitable to deploy immature forms of wind and solar may have slowed, rather than accelerated, cost reduction.” One of the most interesting of Helms’ recommendations is that in future renewables suppliers be required to go through a competitive bidding process in which they are not given an unfair competitive advantage over suppliers of firm electricity supplies. He proposes that they be required to bid on an “equivalent firm power basis” – in other words, they must contract with a generator or storage company able to provide electricity when there is no wind or sun. The “system costs” imposed by intermittent energy sources would be removed from other suppliers and ratepayers and placed squarely on their own shoulders. That would impose a true test of “grid parity” pricing. Those skeptical about the thesis that humans are causing catastrophic global warming will find much to disagree with in Professor Helm’s approach. Given his mandate, he did not question the underlying science. He accepted without question that the UK government should make a unilateral commitment to massively reduce emissions at great cost with no assurance that the developing countries, where all of the global emissions growth is occurring, will do the same. He offered a means a protect British businesses from competition from foreign suppliers that do not face carbon taxes, but ignored the effect of carbon taxes and other climate policy-related costs on the British firms that must export to survive. He took as given that several new technologies that would radically reduce emissions or solve the intermittency problem – like system scale battery storage – are just around the corner and will be rapidly developed and disseminated. He implicitly trusts governments to make good use of the hundreds of billions of pounds that they would take in through carbon taxes rather than spending it on politically favoured causes, groups and industries. For all that, his clear articulation of an alternative approach to managing energy transitions in the power sector should be welcomed. He offers a market-based approach that would be far superior to the one currently followed in the UK (and in Ontario and Alberta for that matter). His preference for simpler policy approaches using fewer policy instruments with less likelihood of duplication and unintended effects should be welcomed by all who value greater transparency and less waste in public administration.  His attacks on the special favours and privileges granted to the wind and solar industries, part of the “climate industrial complex”, were on target but certainly not welcomed by the firms in those industries. It may come as no surprise, then, that the Helm report has met with deafening silence in the media and in the UK Parliament. The status quo, while far from cost-effective, has far too many defenders. Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)",2020-12-19T16:16:02.890112Z,1

awsdoccano,2020-12-12T21:17:55.021665Z,336,119,3830,"Share this...FacebookTwitterState parliamentarian Wolfgang Greilich led an FDP delegation on a visit to the German Weather Service (DWD) in his home-state of Hesse.The German Weather Service said it’s time to get back to the facts and away from hysteria. Hat-tip: Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt.
Here’s the press release issued by the FDP Free Democratic Party:
=========================
Visit of the German Weather Service / Greilich: climate debate must be factual and conducted without horror scenarios
“It is of fundamental importance to understand which climate risks (mid-term and long-term) represent a possible danger for our state. It is the duty of politicians to be informed about the current facts concerning climate change so that the appropriate measures can be implemented to weaken the risks from natural catastrophes for the good of the public,“ explained Wolfgang Greilich, Chairman of the FDP faction of the state parliament in Hesse during a visit to the German Weather Service in Offenbach.
“We put a lot of value on drawing conclusions for measures against climate change by using facts instead of myths,“ René Rock, vice faction chairman and climate political spokesman of the state parliament in Hesse. Prof. Dr. Gerhard Adrian, President of the German Weather Service, extensively informed the FDP politicians during over the latest findings concerning weather and climate research during their visit. He reminded that it is necessary to return to the facts and emphasized the importance of scientifically addressing the highly complex issues surrounding weather and climate. The statistics of the German Weather Service show climate fluctuations and their impacts going far back into the last century. One of many examples is the blossom of apple trees, which is currently almost 14 days earlier. Deriving a climate catastrophe from this is, however, false,” said Prof. Dr. Adrian in a discussion with the FDP delegation. After all, strong fluctuations have been shown to always exist. It has been shown that there have always been warm periods with high CO2 concentrations. “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss,“ explained Dr. Becker.

Another point of discussion was the various methods of measurement that scientific meteorology employs. “Political circles using climate and weather storms to fan the fears of people are foolishly putting their own credibility at stake. An active climate and environmental protection is the task at hand. Necessary for this are valid facts and data for example like those collected and scientifically assessed by the German Weather Service,“ Greilich concluded.

==========================================
Getting getting back to the facts and away from hysteria is a good idea. But then they go on about “protecting the climate”, which is utter nonsense. How does one protect the temperature? The humidity? What does a psychiatrist do? Does he protect the behaviour of his patient? When someone talks about protecting the climate, then it’s a sure sign he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Dr. Becker then says, “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss.” Maybe some, but there are many that still need to be answered and we’ve been waiting a long time: 1) Storms are not increasing. 2) The 800-year CO2 lag behind temperature 3) 15 years without global warming. 4) Antarctic sea ice increasing in size. 5) Weather events following the cycles of the sun. 6) A host of questions on the failures of the climate models, just to name a few.
Overall, though, the direction of the visit was correct.

We don’t shell out multimillion‐​dollar grants to people who say something isn’t a problem. Recipients of this largess peer‐​review each other’s papers. There’s a lot of incentive to give a bad review to a manuscript downplaying the issue and to give a great one to the paper describing an upcoming apocalypse.



Anyone who disagrees with this should spend some time reading the “climategate” e‐​mails purloined from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in November 2009.



Transport yourself from the biased world of peer‐​reviewed science to the biased world of amateur climatology on the Internet. They really aren’t very different; they’re just symmetrically opposite.



In the Internet world where the flatliners live, there’s no such thing as global warming. Where the hotheads reside, it’s everywhere and all the time. Some flatliners even doubt the whole notion of the greenhouse effect — the recycling of infrared radiation by water vapor and carbon dioxide (and a few other things) — that keeps the lower atmosphere about 60 degrees warmer than it would otherwise be.



Both groups are delusional. Hotheads are _convinced, mind you_ that the Koch Brothers are behind the flatliners, and flatliners are _convinced, mind you_ that there’s a hothead conspiracy coordinated by George Soros. Both view each other as murderers of the world: Hotheads will kill the economy, while flatliners will destroy civilization.



Here is the flatliner Holy Picture:





This is the global surface temperature departure from the 1961–1990 average, also from the CRU at East Anglia. (Despite all the climategate hubbub, this is still the reference standard in the business). It’s obviously flat, giving rise to the flatliner mantra: “No warming in 14 years — the same time in which the greatest increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide occurred.” Or, put in more stark terms, “Global warming is a commie plot.”



The flatline argument happens to be popular because it is occurring now, and few people outside of Aspie climate guys like me can remember the weather more than a year or two back.



Here’s a little secret about global warming. The central tendency of computer models using input that pretty much mimics the observed changes in carbon dioxide is to produce a constant (not an increasing) rate of warming.



There are many reasons for this. The response of surface temperature to an increment of carbon dioxide is logarithmic. So for every part per million (ppm) increase, a little less warming is generated. But the actual increase in its atmospheric concentration is a low exponent. When we started monitoring it at Mauna Loa in 1957, CO2 was growing at about 0.75 ppm annually. Now it’s growing at around 2 ppm.



The addition of a logarithmic response to an exponential increase in the cause of something can in fact add up to a straight line, which is very obvious in a suite of the temperature projections made by our friends at the U.N.



There are two warming periods in our recent history. One, in the early 20th century, could not have been caused by carbon dioxide, because we simply hadn’t put very much in the air back then. The second one, which begins in the mid‐​1970s, is much more suspicious because it has been accompanied by a cooling of the stratosphere and is accentuated at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and in the winter, which is what one would expect from increasing CO2.



Here’s the East Anglia history since then, with a straight line fit to the data:





The fit of a constant trend to the overall data is striking, despite the fact that indeed there is no net warming in the last 14 years. In fact, fitting any simple curve to the data does no better than the straight line.



So much for the flatliners. They have lived in fortuitous times. Stay tuned for an analysis of the lukewarmers.",2020-12-13T12:01:22.078195Z,1

,2020-12-18T17:19:37.791669Z,342,119,935,"Once again, the taxpayer-funded ABC has proved both that it is irredeemably biased, and that so-called “fact-checkers” are in reality invariably left-wing propaganda.



The ABC and its “fact-checking” unit have teamed up to “fact-check” Scott Morrison’s speech to the UN. Morrison hit back at the UN for banning Australia (along with other nations) from its latest climate gabfest – while handing a platform to mega-polluters like China and India, to demand more and more of our money.



To their obvious chagrin, Morrison was right on every major point. Except the ABC can’t bring themselves to plainly admit as much, so they resort to their usual gambit: fudge and mislead.



Prime Minister Scott Morrison has taken to the international stage to hammer the message that Australia is “taking real action on climate change and we are getting results […]the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution”.



Which is the worst possible heresy, to the far-green-left, anti-Australian ABC.



Here is our take on some of the key claims made by Mr Morrison in his speech.



 **“Australia is taking real action on climate change and we are getting results.”**



[…]As Fact Check has previously noted, the Coalition’s “Direct Action” emissions reduction fund has played a positive, albeit modest, part in keeping a lid on emissions.



So Morrison is correct.



 **Scott Morrison 1, ABC 0.**



 **“By 2020, Australia will have overachieved on our Kyoto commitments, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 367 million tonnes more than required to meet our 2020 Kyoto target.”**



The [Department of the Environment and Energy] has estimated Australia will have reduced its emissions by some 376 million tonnes more than required over the eight years to 2020, thereby meeting its Kyoto obligations. This is consistent with Mr Morrison’s claim.



But Australia’s success has had little to do with Coalition policies.



 **Morrison never said that it did.** He simply, correctly, stated that Australia is exceeding its Kyoto target.



This is the most common gambit “fact-checkers” use to deceive: taking something their target **didn’t** say, and “fact-checking” that, instead of what they **actually** said.



 **Scott Morrison 2, ABC 0.**



 **“Our latest estimates show both emissions per person and the emissions intensity of the economy are at their lowest levels in 29 years.”**



This is correct. Because Australia’s population has been increasing, emissions per capita have been falling, and are currently at the lowest levels since 1990.



Again, all Morrison said that Australia’s per capita emissions have fallen – which is correct.



In fact, look how the ABC tries to have an each-way bet, while deliberately deceiving its readers.



As experts have previously told Fact Check, what counts as far as the Earth’s atmosphere — and international agreements — are concerned is the total level of emissions […] Moreover, while Australia’s emissions per capita have fallen, they remain among the highest in the world.



So, which matter? Per capita, or total? If it’s total emissions, then why do the ABC and their watermelon chums continually hype Australia’s per capita emissions? Because Australia’s total emissions are **minuscule**. Australia accounts for just over 1% of the world’s emissions. China emits more carbon dioxide in 20 days than Australia does in a year.



 **Scott Morrison 3, ABC 0.**



 **“Australia’s electricity sector is producing less emissions. In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia’s electricity sector were 15.7 per cent lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.”**



This is correct, but it has little to do with the policies of the Morrison Government.



Once again, that is not something that Morrison actually said. Stick to what he said, ABC watermelons, and stop trying to distract attention by attacking things he **didn’t** say.



 **Indeed, the ABC grudgingly concedes that Morrison didn’t actually go far enough in highlighting Australia’s progress:**



Using the raw data […]this was, as Mr Morrison points out, 15.7 per cent lower than the 211.3 million tonnes produced over the year to June 2009.



(If the seasonally adjusted, “weather normalised” data is used, the decline is even bigger).



 **So, it’s game, set and match, with Scott Morrison 4, ABC 0.**



It just kills these taxpayer-funded watermelons to admit that a conservative prime minister is right and that [Australia is doing more for the environment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/) than any number of sour-faced Swedish brats.

Over the past months we’ve seen great media hype in Germany surrounding climate alarmist youngsters like Greta, FFF and more recently Rezo, who have played major roles in stirring up a lot of climate hysteria, all aided and abetted by the established media.
But apparently in Germany there are a few young, hip persons pushing back on all the climate hype and hysteria with their own videos, which have since gone viral.
“Join the Skeptical Movement”
The latest video comes from young German teen Naomi Seibt, who has decided to think for herself and check what’s really behind the climate “science” and hysteria.

Since she uploaded what she calls her “most elaborate project to date” on July 1st, her video — dubbed “Climate change – All hot air? — has been viewed more than 75,000 times and gotten over 8000 thumbs up.
YouTube takes Naomi down – temporarily
She writes at YouTube: “If you want to join the skeptical movement, please share this video.”
In her video Naomi explains how many large factors are at play in the climate system, how the UN IPCC is playing it loose with the facts and that politicians are attempting to use the issue to gain control over every aspect of our individual lives. The 18-year demonstrates an impressive knowledge on the subject, rarely seen among today’s youth.

Naomi’s success apparently has taken the climate activists by surprise and caused them to panic. Die kalte Sonne here reports how YouTube actually took down her video, before reinstating it.
JasonHD: “Manipulations and untruths”
Another spectacularly successful climate hysteria skeptical video was recently produced by German JasonHD on May 24th. In it he takes down climate alarmist and leftist political agitator Rezo (mentioned above) point by point.
JasonHD dismantles the “manipulations and untruths concerning climate change”.

So far JasonHD’s thoughtful video has racked up 190,000 views.
Rapper: “Climate Change – Climate Lies, Climate Swindle”
One of the earlier pioneers of German youth climate-hysteria pushback is Austrian rapper Kilez More, who already in 2011 uploaded his rap song “Climate Change – Climate Lies, Climate Swindle” song on YouTube.

As of today it’s been viewed some 209,000 times.
We need to get these young leaders at the climate conferences in place of the usual old, crusty figures. They’re well connected and are reaching their generation.

Glasgow, Strathclyde, Edinburgh, Stirling, Dundee and Queen Margaret are recalling a total of 56 students.
The University of Aberdeen is also recalling 10 of its students in Hong Kong as a result of the disruption.
The University of St Andrews said it was in regular contact with its students there.
The move to recall students follows escalating anti-government protests in recent days including violent clashes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
All schools and kindergartens were closed by the education bureau on Wednesday.
On Thursday a notice was posted on the University of Hong Kong website which effectively closed the campus down. It said it would only maintain ""essential and emergency"" services on campus.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not advise against travel to Hong Kong but warns of the potential for ""clashes between police and protesters involving significant violence.""
BBC Scotland has found that:
Meanwhile the University of St Andrews would not confirm the exact number of its students and staff in Hong Kong but said it was in contact with them and will ""continue to monitor the situation.""
Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests.
The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police.

17 November 2009
The entire basis for the concept of global warming being caused by CO2 emissions is both predicated and dependent on the answer to a simple question:
“How much of the thermal radiation energy from the Earth in the band centred on the 14.77micron wavelength that is resonant with the vibrational mode of CO2 has already been affected by the current atmospheric CO2 concentration and how much energy remains to be affected?”
This question was never addressed by Svante Arrhenius in his seminal 1896 paper because that paper predates quantum physics and he was not aware that the process by which thermal energy is affected by CO2 is limited to a single vibrational mode with a resonant wavelength of 14.77microns.

,2020-12-12T21:19:46.743635Z,348,120,614,"LONDON  —   As American allies across Europe and Asia brace for President Trump, Britain stands out for the degree to which it is proceeding as if little has changed. The country, consumed with managing “Brexit” and its associated domestic political dramas, appears to have taken relatively few steps to prepare for the geopolitical earthquakes that Mr. Trump could bring to the international and European orders on which Britain relies, and that his proposals would undermine. “The people at the top of our system, whether they’re politicians or officials or journalists or think tankers like me, we’re all totally focused on Brexit,” said Charles Grant, who heads the   Center for European Reform. “We haven’t thought about Trump as much as we should have. ” It is possible that Prime Minister Theresa May, by throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, could ride out any changes to the international order. But if that approach does not succeed, it could have severe consequences both for her nation and for the world that Britain plays a role in keeping together. Mrs. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump, whom she will visit this week, just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability. “The British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff, like who Trump spoke to before May, and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the   European Council on Foreign Relations.   Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, wrote in a column this week for the German newspaper Bild that, with Mr. Trump’s election, “the old world of the 20th century is gone” and that Germany could confront drastic changes. François Hollande, the French president, said last month that Mr. Trump’s election “opens a period of uncertainty. ” British leaders, Mr. Leonard said, have not accepted the view, growing in other European governments, “that our prosperity and security are based on an international architecture that’s now being threatened. ” “There’s an assumption that’s all going to remain,” he continued. Since Britain’s decline from a global power in the years just after World War II, the country’s foreign policy has rested on two pillars. First is the   partnership, which allows Britain to project its power and safeguard its interests globally. Second is European unity, which is essential for Britain’s economic prosperity and, by removing the   diversions of European conflict, frees up Britain to act on the world stage. But both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of European populism, Russian resurgence and particularly Mr. Trump’s threats to step away from Europe. Britain’s challenge is not just that each of those elements is coming under strain. Mr. Trump’s avowed opposition to the European Union has put them in direct conflict. For instance, Mr. Trump offered to reward Britain’s exit from the European Union with a speedy trade deal. But this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration. The resulting turmoil on the Continent, which includes several top British trading partners, could risk harming Britain’s economy far more than an American trade deal would help. Mr. Trump’s proposed alignment with Russia poses a similar quandary. Germany and other leading European powers oppose such a realignment, which they fear would open the way for Russia to dominate Eastern Europe, breaking the Continent’s unity on security matters. Mrs. May remains hawkish on Russia. But it is unclear whether she would oppose Mr. Trump on the matter, particularly as she more fully ties her fate to the alliance. “If America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel,” said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a   think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mrs. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the world’s largest economy and military power. Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Mrs. May has been more forgiving. For example, she overlooked Mr. Trump’s decision to meet with Nigel Farage, a former leader of the fringe U. K. Independence Party, before speaking with her. Even if Mrs. May succeeds in upholding the alliance, it is unclear that her government is preparing for the range of more seismic changes that Mr. Trump’s election and other events could bring. Jeremy Shapiro, an American and the research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said he had struggled to convince British officials that the old order is “eroding all around them. ” Mr. Shapiro paraphrased the “dominant” British view of Mr. Trump as, “We didn’t want him, but pressures of the presidency, checks and balances, our expert tutelage will socialize him, and it’ll be O. K. ” British hopes, he added, often rest on Senator John McCain’s persuading of Mr. Trump to drop his controversial plans and revert to traditional positions such as upholding European unity. Mr. Shapiro said he had been unable to convince British officials that Mr. McCain, whom Mr. Trump has publicly mocked, was an unlikely savior. Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said there was a simple reason that British leaders never seemed to discuss their backup plan should they fail to moderate Mr. Trump. “There isn’t a Plan B,” he said. Preparing for life without American support, British leaders worry, could send the message that the United States can safely withdraw, risking exactly the outcome Britain wishes to avoid. “This has always been the problem,” Mr. Freedman said, because it leaves Britain unprepared for a situation that could be deeply destabilizing  —   much as it failed to prepare for Brexit. Brexit has focused attention inward, on    political dramas and on the countless challenges of negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union. “We’re going through a very solipsistic moment,” Mr. Leonard said. This has led the British to behave “as if the only independent variable is Britain leaving the E. U. and the manner in which it’s done. ” This is shaping British foreign policy in other ways. “There’s always going to be a question of whether we’re better off using our political capital to advance the international security order or to try to get a good trade deal,” Mr. Leonard said. Britain’s party politics also distract. Mrs. May is only barely holding together the governing Conservative Party, leaving her overwhelmingly focused on managing divisions that are mostly about Brexit and migration. Both she and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have spent their careers focused on domestic issues. The opposition Labour Party is riven by its own divisions. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tends to be skeptical toward Britain’s global role. As a result, there are no major voices in British politics who have an interest, either ideological or political, in addressing the country’s foreign policy challenges. Britons’ view of their country as a pillar of a European and world order, rooted in their experience of standing up to fascism and militarism in World War II, is also shifting. “Until quite recently, we saw ourselves as   of the European order, but we don’t sort of see ourselves in that way anymore,” said Mr. Freedman, the King’s College professor. This has accelerated with the enmity toward immigration, which has focused politics inward and portrayed the outside world as something to guard against rather than to protect and uphold. That has ramifications beyond Britain. Even after Brexit, the country remains important for upholding the postwar order in Europe, where it is the largest economy after Germany and the biggest military spender after Russia. If its horizons continue to narrow, that will contribute to the Continent’s continuing fracturing on economics and opposition to Russian power. Mr. Niblett, the Chatham House chief, said he was worried Britain would become the “weak link” on European sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea. “The U. K. which traditionally sees itself as upholding the spine of Europe toward Russia, is pulling itself out of that role,” Mr. Niblett said. Other European states are already preparing for the possibility that the Continent can no longer rely on Britain, Mr. Leonard said, on issues from Russia to the Iran nuclear deal to global free trade. “They don’t know if Britain’s going to be there or not,” he said.",2020-12-12T21:19:46.743665Z,1
,2020-12-13T10:30:43.602504Z,349,120,98,"**A cancer charity is urging the Scottish government and grocery stores to step up efforts to ensure the most vulnerable people in Scotland have access to online delivery slots.**
Blood Cancer UK said delays in setting up a system ""could cost lives"".
The Scottish government said it was working to ensure people were supported.
About 30,000 people in the most vulnerable ""shielded"" group have registered for priority deliveries.
In recent days supermarkets have been receiving batches of Scottish government data detailing those registering for the scheme.
Blood Cancer UK chief executive Gemma Peters said: ""We fear that the time it is taking to give people at very high risk, priority for online deliveries could cost lives.
""We are now at the point where some people are being forced to choose between going hungry and making a trip to the supermarket that could be fatal if they pick up the coronavirus there.
""People with blood cancer are already scared about the virus and daunted by the prospect of spending so long without leaving their home. Not being able to get food is an extra worry they do not need.""
The system is running along different lines from that in England, where a single list of shielded people has been compiled, and the Scottish system has been slower to get started
Tesco and Sainsbury's have begun offering delivery slots to some vulnerable customers, but of the five retailers involved in the scheme so far, most say few slots have been reserved.
Tesco said those in the ""shielded"" category should be able to see slots online that were reserved only for them. Others have not made distinct slots available.
Sainsbury's said it had already sent out 10,000 offers to those who registered, but there was little evidence that delivery slots were available on anything like that scale.
Some retailers, including Asda and Waitrose, are emphasising the use of store cards allocated to voluntary helpers, who do shopping for those unable to get out of their homes.
Blood Cancer UK said the patients it represented were unable to get deliveries and were struggling to get food.
Its chief executive has written to the Deputy First Minister John Swinney calling on the Scottish government to take urgent action, as well as the chief executives of six major retailers.
The charity said ""many people with blood cancer in Scotland still have not received a letter from their doctors saying that they are at a higher risk of serious illness or death than the general population if they get coronavirus"".
However, Nicola Sturgeon told a virtual First Minister's Questions on Thursday that everyone regarded as ""shielded"" had now been notified, totalling 157,000 Scots.
In response to a question from Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw, Ms Sturgeon emphasised that the list was drawn up by medical experts.
Mr Carlaw has criticised the handling of the grocery delivery system and said: ""The SNP dithered and eventually came up with a convoluted system, which hasn't worked properly, and resulted in a pitiful number of shielded people receiving the help they need"".
Blood Cancer UK said about 10,000 people in Scotland have blood cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma.
Going through treatment, they have very low immunity and natural protection against disease.
Others in the ""shielded"" category include people going through treatment for other forms of cancer, taking drugs that suppress immunity, organ transplant recipients, those with some lung or chest conditions or diseases, and some pregnant women with heart disease.
Those regarded as shielded should have received a letter, explaining precautions they should take for their health, along with pointers to advice and offers of help.
By sending a short text message to a given number, they can register to be kept in touch for the initial 12-week period they are to stay at home or have limited contact with those they live with.
Another code registers them for free weekly boxes of groceries. A further code, sent by text message, puts them on the list of people wanting priority access for supermarket home deliveries of groceries.
Tranches of data from that supermarket delivery list are in the process of being handed over to the five retailers now working with the Scottish government on the scheme.
Those companies, which already have one of these people registered as customer, are getting in touch by email to explain how they can access the service. However, that is no guarantee of a delivery slot. Not all retailers are reserving spaces for this group, or are able to through the software they use.
The Scottish government is being notified of those vulnerable people who have no previous record of ordering groceries for home delivery. However, it seems that list is still being prepared for one or several retailers to make approaches. The process has been delayed by concerns about data and privacy protection.
The Scottish government has set up a text message service to communicate with those in the shielded category.
More than 60,000 have so far been in touch to say they want to use it. Of them, 30,000 have taken up the offer of a free, weekly delivery of a box of food and household necessities, supplied by wholesaler Brakes.
So far, 48,000 boxes have been delivered.
A spokesman said: ""We will continue to add to the central list to ensure people are supported to shield. If people have not received a letter but feel they should be in the shielding group, they should speak to their GP or specialist clinician.
""Our free-of-charge grocery packages have been delivered directly to doorsteps since 3 April. While not everyone who is shielding needs assistance with groceries, so far 60,000 people have registered for the shielding text message service, and over 30,000 people have signed up for these regular box deliveries.
""We are also working with the main supermarkets so that they can prioritise delivery slots for those who are shielding.""",2020-12-13T10:30:43.602535Z,1

If there was a pictorial calendar of watermelons, Farrelly would be its cover girl. Her simpering, head-tilted smirk is the epitome of complacent leftist ignorance. From the rarified confines of inner Sydney, architecture critic (for such is the only trade she is actually qualified for) Farrelly deigns to grace the rest of us with her views on everything from inconvenient tradesmen (she abuses at them, should they dare let their work intrude on her cycling progress) to [how to manage the nation’s farms](https://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/forgiving-land-clearers-because-of-drought-is-like-comforting-a-fat-child-with-chocolate-20190808-p52f64.html).



As farmer Tom Marland (with dual degrees in environmental management and law) says:



One thing I enjoy is being lectured to by urban media on how farmers should manage their land and environment.



[Elizabeth Farrelly] is your typical modern day urban environmental weekend warrior. She was late getting her article in because she was out planting trees. She has planted 70 this year!



That’s nothing – the rumour is that she only took **one** overseas holiday this year. Take that, greenhouse gases!



The reality is that the net gain of those trees would be wiped out by one of her commutes to work and wouldn’t even cover the food miles for the imported coffee beans at her favourite coffee shop. But don’t let facts get in the way of a good hack job.



After planting a few trees, she felt qualified to stray from her specialisation as an “architecture critic” to share with us her extensive knowledge of vegetation management and the benefits of trees she found in a google search.



I hate to play one-upmanship but my family manages somewhere around 10 million trees on our freehold country plus another 10 million in our national park. We didn’t plant any of them – they just grow naturally – in the millions…I rarely get the time to “hug” my trees unless I’ve been wiped off my horse by one of them chasing cattle. But I understand that to maintain a healthy forest you have to “manage it”. Whether by fire, axe or chain it needs to be selectively cared for to ensure it’s not choked out by woody weeds, lantana and noxious weeds. You can’t just “lock it up” other wise a bushfire will eventually come along and destroy the lot.



Michael Crichton rams home the same point in his excellent _State of Fear_ : the environmentalist fantasy of nature’s “balance” is just that – a fantasy. The delusion of “environmentalists” who live as far from the natural environment as it’s possible to be. The Australian landscape has been managed for the benefit of humans for tens of thousands of years.



Like most urban environmentalists, the article starts off by painting all farmers as environmental vandals who are roaming around the bush on bulldozers chanting “Kill more trees, cut them off at the knees, kill more trees.” I’m not offended by that statement – it just demonstrates the ignorance of someone who has no idea what they are talking about…I’m not sure if she has actually read the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. I have and it is hardly a puff piece. NSW vegetation laws are overly officious, technically confusing and inconsistent with extensive enforcement powers and heavy penalties.



Ask the farmer from Garah who stick raked previously cultivated wheat paddocks and was fined $350,000 for “clearing” 500 hectares of “native vegetation” regrowth about how “soft” NSW vegetation laws are.



But an “environmentalist” from the concrete jungle of inner Sydney thinks she knows better.



Sydney…[doesn’t] have to worry about vegetation management laws – the remaining vegetation are in parks or in pot plants.



It’s easy to moralise about vegetation management when it is someone’s problem and livelihood.



It’s easy to point the finger when someone else is picking up the tab.



It’s easy to have an opinion when the cost of that opinion is nil. That accordingly is also its value…I wonder if the author actually had to pay a farmer for the vegetation on their land rather than just take it for free whether she would be so eager to pontificate about the virtues of vegetation.



I doubt it.

Today we look at the mean annual temperatures of western USA stations that have a Brightness Index (BI) of 0, meaning they are not subjected to urban heat island impacts.
Many people are claiming that temperatures worldwide are rising due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.
First we begin with the station located at the town of Fort Bragg in California. Using NASA data, we plot the annual temperatures going back to 1935!

Data source: NASA GISS 
Above we plot the V4 unadjusted versus the V4 adjusted data. Neither show any warming since 1935. The adjusted data, however, turns a cooling trend into one of no cooling.
Recently I tweeted an animation that compares the v4 unadjusted data to the V4 adjusted data for the Beowawe station in the state of Nevada:

GHCN V4 Unadjusted data show Beowawe, State of Nevada has had a cooling trend since 1891!Needless to say, NASA changed the data by a large margin.https://t.co/XfEZRXWoFl~#地球温暖化? #温暖化？ #気候変動 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/bDIleXLYuB
— キリエ (@KiryeNet) May 10, 2020

Note how the Beowawe data of the past was substantially altered (reduced) in order to create a warming trend from a previously cooling trend. Here the warming is man made – but statistically by researchers at NASA.
The story is similar for 4 other stations located in the western US.

At the Manti station in Utah, modest warming was adjusted to created more warming:

Data source: NASA GISS
The same is true for the Seligman, Arizona station:

Data source: NASA GISS. 
The mean annual temperatures measured by the Cheesman, Colorado station used to show a cooling trend since 1903, before NASA tampered with the data and changed them into a warming trend: 

Data source: NASA GISS.
Finally we look at the data from the station for Hachita, New Mexico:

Data source: NASA GISS.
Here for Hachita, NASA changed the data so that modest warming was changed to produce greater warming.
Why do the new, adjusted data plots always end up warmer and never cooler? This seems to be Deep State science, and not real science which the public expects to get and is owed.

,2020-12-12T21:20:22.331467Z,354,120,703,"Over the past decade, Christians in the United States have grown increasingly alarmed about the persecution of other Christians overseas, especially in the Middle East. With each priest kidnapped in Syria, each Christian family attacked in Iraq or each Coptic church bombed in Egypt, the clamor for action rose. During the campaign, Donald J. Trump picked up on these fears, speaking frequently of Christians who were refused entry to the United States and beheaded by terrorists of the Islamic State: “If you’re a Christian, you have no chance,” he said in Ohio in November. Now, President Trump has followed through on his campaign promise to rescue Christians who are suffering. The executive order he signed on Friday gives preference to refugees who belong to a religious minority in their country, and have been persecuted for their religion. The president detailed his intentions during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, saying his administration is giving priority to Christians because they had suffered “more so” than others, “so we are going to help them. ” But if Mr. Trump had hoped for Christian leaders to break out in cheers, that is, for the most part, not what he has heard so far. A broad array of clergy members has strongly denounced Mr. Trump’s order as discriminatory, misguided and inhumane. Outrage has also come from some of the evangelical, Roman Catholic and mainline Protestant leaders who represent the churches most active in trying to aid persecuted Christians. By giving preference to Christians over Muslims, religious leaders have said the executive order pits one faith against another. By barring any refugees from entering the United States for nearly four months, it leaves people to suffer longer in camps, and prevents families from reuniting. Also, many religious leaders have said that putting an indefinite freeze on refugees from Syria, and cutting the total number of refugees admitted this year by 60, 000, shuts the door to those most in need. “We believe in assisting all, regardless of their religious beliefs,” said Bishop Joe S. Vásquez, the chairman of the committee on migration for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program of Church World Service, a ministry affiliated with dozens of Christian denominations, called Friday a “shameful day” in United States history. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s executive order will find more support in the pews. During the campaign, Mr. Trump successfully mined many voters’ concern about national security and fear of Muslims. He earned the votes of four out of every five white evangelical Christians, and a majority of white Catholics, exit polls showed. In interviews on Sunday, churchgoers in several cities were sharply divided on the issue, including on whether Christian teachings supported giving priority to Christians. “Love thy neighbor” was cited more than once, and by both sides: It was seen as both a commandment to embrace all peoples and to defend one’s actual neighbors from harm. “You look at a city like Mosul, which is one of the oldest Christian populations in the world,” said Mark Tanner, 52, a worshiper at Buckhead Church, an evangelical church in Atlanta, referring to the besieged Iraqi city. “There’s a remnant there that want to stay there to be a Christian witness. ” “So yeah,” he continued. “We should reach out to everyone, but we have to be real about it and as far as who you let come into the country. ” Nmachi Abengowe, 62, a native of Nigeria who attends Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas, cited    violence in Africa in defending Mr. Trump’s preference for Christian refugees. “They believe in jihad,” he said of Muslims. “They don’t have peace. Peace comes from Jesus Christ. ” That was not the view of Makeisha Robey, 39, who was at the Atlanta church. “I think that is just completely opposite what it means to be a Christian,” she said. “God’s love was not for you specifically. It’s actually for everyone, and it’s our job as Christians to kind of enforce that on this planet, to bring God’s love to everyone. ” John and Noreen Yarwood, who attended Mass at the   of St. Joseph, a Catholic church in Brooklyn, said they feared that a policy of preference for Christians could in practice become a preference for certain denominations of Christianity over others. “What does this administration mean by Christian?” Mr. Yarwood, 37, asked. He said that refugees are deserving of help and mercy “because of desperation and poverty,” not because of their religion. “This is not grace,” he said of the president’s order. “It doesn’t follow Christian teachings. ” Christian leaders who defended Mr. Trump’s executive order were rare this weekend. One of the few was the Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of the evangelist Billy Graham and the president of Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical aid organization. Mr. Graham has long denounced Islam as “evil,” and in July 2015 proposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States as a solution to domestic terrorism, months before Mr. Trump made his first call for the same. In a statement on Saturday, Mr. Graham said of refugees, “We need to be sure their philosophies related to freedom and liberty are in line with ours. ” He added that those who followed Sharia law  —   a set of beliefs at the core of Islam  —   hold notions “ultimately incompatible with the Constitution of this nation. ” Jim Jacobson, the president of Christian Freedom International, which advocates for persecuted Christians, applauded the executive order and said, “The Trump administration has given hope to persecuted Christians that their cases will finally be considered. ” Among the claims Mr. Trump made at his campaign rallies was that the Obama administration had denied refugee status to Christians, and had given preference to Muslims. “How unfair is that? How bad is that?” he told supporters at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, interlaced with boasts about his “tremendous evangelical support. ” The contention was consistent with the conspiracy theories held by some conservative Christians that Mr. Obama was secretly a Muslim, and that he was turning a blind eye to the suffering of Christians while using the reins of government to increase the Muslim population of the United States. But the claim is simply untrue. In 2016, the United States admitted almost as many Christian refugees (37, 521) as Muslim refugees (38, 901) according to the Pew Research Center. While only about one percent of the refugees from Syria resettled in the United States last year were Christian, the population of that country is 93 percent Muslim and only 5 percent Christian, according to Pew. And leaders of several refugee resettlement organizations said during interviews that it took 18 months to three years for most refugees to go through the vetting process to get into the United States. Many Syrian Christians got into the pipeline more recently. “We have no evidence that would support a belief that the Obama administration was discriminating against Christian populations,” said the Rev. Scott Arbeiter, the president of World Relief, the humanitarian arm of National Association of Evangelicals. His organization has resettled thousands of Muslim refugees, with the help of a network of 1, 200 evangelical churches. Mr. Arbeiter said that World Relief is opposed to “any measure that would discriminate against the most vulnerable people in the world based on ethnicity, country of origin, religion, gender or gender identity. Our commitment is to serve vulnerable people without regard to those factors, or any others. ” He said that World Relief had already gathered 12, 000 signatures from evangelical Christians for a petition opposing Mr. Trump’s executive order. “We’re going to call out to our network, the 1, 200 churches that are actively involved,” he said, “and ask them to use their voices to change the narrative, to challenge the facts that drive the fear so high that people would accept this executive order. ”",2020-12-12T21:20:22.331498Z,1

All staff at the 2 Sisters chicken factory, in Llangefni are self-isolating after 61 workers tested positive.
Classrooms across Wales are due to reopen on Monday 29 June, for pupils to check in with their teachers.
But the council said the safety of children and teachers was its priority.
It comes after Public Health Wales statistics showed a growing number of positive cases of Covid-19 on Anglesey in recent days.
Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said the increasing number of cases and the outbreak at the factory had caused a ""great deal of uncertainty and concern on the island"".Â ""It is, of course, possible that we could see an increase in community transmission of the virus,"" she said.
""I am not, at present, willing to see classrooms reopened to Anglesey children.""Â ""Given the current uncertainty, I believe that this is the right course of action, and the best decision in respect of the safety of our children, all school staff and wider communities.""Â
She earlier told BBC Radio Wales the island may not be ready to reopen to visitors on 6 July - the date the Welsh Government has indicated the ""stay local"" restrictions will be lifted.
2 Sisters is one of the largest food producers in the UK and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day.
It has suspended production and closed the factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak.
Public Health Wales said staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, had been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and all staff would be contacted by the company for testing.
Meanwhile in Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which supplies supermarkets.
The company, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"".
Public Health Wales said an outbreak ""has not been declared at the site"", and investigations were ongoing as to the ""possible cause of the cluster, and no firm conclusions can be reached at this early stage"".
An army testing unit is being set up in Wrexham to help test workers for Covid-19.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said the virus at the Anglesey factory was down to its internal organisation, but it had been brought into the Wrexham factory.
2 Sisters said it had no agency workers at the Llangefni plant, and ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business.
It added: ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility.""
Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""What we're being told is that there's a different explanation in Wrexham and a different explanation on the island of Anglesey.
""On Anglesey, we think it may be to do with the internal organisation of the factory and the challenges of maintaining social distance.
""In Wrexham, so far the science is saying that wasn't the cause, it's not internal to the factory. It's just that the disease was brought in by people who would become infected outside the factory so there's not just one explanation for both.""
He said ministers did not believe the Wrexham factory had found social distancing a challenge.
In Wales, employers are required by law to do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120.
The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness.
Anglesey MP Virginia Crosbie said she was ""hugely concerned"" by what had happened at 2 Sisters.
""This situation highlights the risks faced by people working in this sector and we should all be hugely grateful for the contribution that the 2 Sisters employees have made, and the courage that they have demonstrated, in supporting the fight against Covid-19,"" she said.
She said she was liaising with the management at the plant to ensure that ""none of the workers are left without pay during the duration of the plant's closure"".
Anywhere cold, damp and indoors is an ideal environment for the coronavirus to thrive.
It survives best on cool surfaces, especially if there's no dry breeze to get rid of the moisture or any ultraviolet light from the sun to kill it off.
Add to that the challenges of social distancing on a busy production line, together with loud machinery forcing staff to raise their voices.
Researchers know that situations where people sing - or have to shout - increases the chances of them projecting the virus to others nearby.
According to Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Liverpool, and an adviser to the government, meat processing plants can be ""a perfect environment for the virus to persist on surfaces and in the air.""",2020-12-13T10:31:05.323256Z,1

Regrettably the editors screwed up and inserted the wrong English text in the video and misidentified the participants as well. The discussion is in fact about CO2 being the sole real driver of global climate. Moreover, the talk round took place in London, and not Egypt.
This is not fake news, but merely a case of human error on the part of the Independent. It happens. 🙂
As a public service, we at NTZ have corrected the article by the Independent (below). Again, pay no attention to the erroneous English text in the video, which is really about a climate skeptic, James Delingpole, at a Talkshow presenting an alternative theory on why the globe is warming a bit.
================================
Corrected version of the Independent article: 
Climate denialist kicked off live Climate TV show for ‘inappropriate’ ideas: ‘Go straight to a psychiatric hospital’
‘We cannot promote such destructive ideas…you set a very bad example for the World’s youth’

A climate skeptic has been kicked off a live TV show taped in London after the host accused him of being ‘confused and unreliable’ and being in need of psychiatric treatment.
James Delingpole was presenting his reasons for being climate science skeptic on Current TV (co-founded by Al Gore) when host George Abd Al-Halim Monbiot told him he was being ‘inappropriate’.

Sheikh of Al Mahmoud Gore, who was also on the programme, agreed, telling him: ‘Look dear James, you need psychiatric treatment. Many young people today suffer from mental illnesses due to material or mental circumstances.’
When Delingpole suggested ‘the sun‘ as an explanation for climate change, George Abd Al-Halim Monbiot exploded and demanded that he ‘stop using difficult words’ and reminded him that he was ‘addressing simple people and to not use big words for no reason’.
George Abd Al-Halim Monbiot then accused James: ‘You deny the existence of CO2 as the climate driver and reject our religion and science.’
Next Mr. Al-Halim Monbiot demanded Mr. Delingpole to leave, saying: ‘We cannot promote such destructive ideas…you set a very bad example for the world’s youth.’
He added: ‘I advise you to leave the studio and go straight to a psychiatric hospital.’
Blasphemy and denialism are illegal in climate science, and prosecution is routinely recommended by NASA GISS, PIK and NOAA if people should insult or defame Climatism and CO2 under proposed climate science RICO laws.

We at NoTricksZone are glad to have been able to get this cleared up. As you can see, the video now makes perfect sense.

Graham Williamson
July 2016
The UN, having spent  more than half a $trillion in 70 years, is an undemocratic, unaccountable international policeman that is in the business of inventing ‘global problems’ which can only be ‘solved’ by a transfer of power and money from nation states to the UN. It has been elevated to this status by cooperative national governments.  As noted by Peter Faris QC, thanks to the eager cooperation of successive Australian governments “laws are imported (as some sort of universal truths) from the UN.”
On 27th September 2015 the UN continued their campaign of global control and undemocratic interference in the affairs of nations around the world with their ‘Transforming Our World‘ 2030 SDG agenda which was  signed by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on behalf of all Australians. With a predicted  annual price tag of $2-3 trillion, the agenda is to be sold to the people as ‘voluntary’, although  the people will be given no choice, and essential provisions will be undemocratically enforced by national governments. Although both major Parties refused to mention this during the recent election campaign, implementation of this undemocratic bipartisan supported agenda commenced in Australia on 1st January 2016.
The 2030 agenda is a UN driven “master plan” or “roadmap to global socialism” aimed at controlling the planet, including so called ‘climate change’, and the life styles and energy consumption of all people and all countries.  Their 15 year goals include:


Redistributing the wealth of Australia and other Western nations, under the control of the UN, to poorer countries, especially impoverished dictatorships, around the world. According to the 2030 Agenda, ‘poverty’ can only be addressed by undemocratically giving money and power to the UN.


 The  COP21 Paris climate change agreement, comprising SDG 13, is just one part of the 2030 Agenda. The UN version of climate change though,  is about global power and money. As UNFCCC chief  Christiana Figueres pointed out, the aim of the UN is to bring about a “centralized transformation“… “one that is going to make the life of everyone on the planet very different.”  Figueres continues: “global society, is moving to the point where we are going to need more and more global governance muscle… Climate change is only the first of the major, major planetary challenges that we are being given, almost as a playground… to go into that playground and exercise our global governance capacity”


Controlling lifestyles, energy use, and consumption by defining which activities are accepted by the UN as being ‘sustainable’. Only the UN can control ‘sustainability’.


Controlling education around the globe to ensure all children become activists promoting the UN sustainability agenda.


Moving towards global enforcement by developing global monitoring, accountability mechanisms, and surveillance systems so “no one is left behind”.


The UN 2030 agenda is completely open ended, stating no total costs, and stating no limits as far as loss of sovereignty and enforcement mechanisms are concerned.


The American Society of Interior Designers (ASID) advances the interior design profession and communicates the impact of design on the human experience. Laurel & Wolf interior designers in Banglore specialize in every design style, space type and specification. See designer portfolios and styles here!
 The people have been betrayed. The 2030 Agenda is all about  betrayal, UN control, and global socialism, and  expanding global law. The United Nations has “conned governments, citizens andbusiness into adopting the 2030 Agenda“, but “business does not understand” that it will destroy “Capitalism and Free Enterprise.” And all this has been made possible by the Australian government, and governments of other ‘democratic’ countries, who invite the UN to interfere in the domestic affairs of their respective countries  WITHOUT the democratic approval of the people.
The choice is clear: do you want UN control and interference, or do you want democracy, freedom and prosperity? Should our destiny be decided by us, or by the dictators that comprise the UN?  Do you want democratic Australian laws, or foreign laws dictated by the UN?

Just a few miles away from my hometown, Green Mountain Electric Power Company of Vermont and Quebec’s Gaz Metro are now building a monster mountain-top wind park that will be home (for 25 years) to twenty one 135-meter tall turbines that will go into operation by the end of next year.
To build the windpark they are now busily deforesting acre after acre and literally blasting off the top of the mountain, thus permanently disfiguring in a matter of weeks what took nature and the ice ages (climate change) hundreds of thousands of years to sculpture. Suddenly the environmentalists are fuming mad. Not this way, they insist.
Protesters even launched a website called Mountain Talk and are now making their presence known on the mountain.
Last week two protesters were arrested by the police for allegedly trespassing on the site. The two are reported to be students from nearby Sterling College, which according to its website is a “small, progressive, liberal arts college” that is committed “to grassroots sustainability”.
Were once enthusiastic supporters of renewable energy
What’s strange is that for years Vermont environmentalists railed against carbon based fuels and pressured legislators to produce “clean” energy. Never mind that over 90% of Vermont’s electric power was CO2-free to start with (hydro from Quebec and nuclear from Vermont Yankee). Vermont even elected Obama, giving him a whopping 68% of the vote. Let’s go green was the message. Now windparks are naturally getting installed on Vermont’s beautiful ridgelines. Doing that, though, isn’t easy. It involves massive deforestation to clear land for access roads and the windpark itself. Because Vermont mountains are ruggedly uneven, a good amount of dynamiting is part of it.
Suddenly environmentalists have woken up and are fuming mad about what they had for years enthusiastically endorsed. Many will deny this and claim that they never supported wind turbines. But looking at the website of Sterling College, where the two protesters attend, we see the following under Global Field Studies:


“Research environmental and cultural sustainability by comparing current ecological practices in Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Local scholars and experts serve as guides as we explore alternative energy sites, investigate eco-villages and industries featuring green technology, and study…”
 Either the protesters in Vermont are just plain hypocritical, or terribly confused. Sterling students even went to Japan (by plane) and saw this:

“Explore environmentally sustainable practices on the northern island of Hokkaido through visits to managed forests, organic farms, native Ainu communities, and  Zen gardens. Conversations with students and professors at Hokkaido and Obihiro  Universities lead to in-depth investigations into land use practices.”

That’s sure some amazing land-use in the photo above, wouldn’t you all say?
Protesters blame corporations and not the lawmakers for all the mountain mutilation
Okay, the protesters woke up awhile back and now realize that the green dream is in fact a nightmare. You’d think they’d vent their anger at the politicians who cleared the way for this energy transition. You’d be wrong. Throughout the Mountain Talk website, all you hear is a lot of whining and moaning aimed at…the corporations. At this point, I’d say they are confused.
If these protesters ever sat down down with energy managers, the first thing they’d hear is that there are lots of other cheaper, easier, cleaner ways of generating electricity than to blow up mountains and install monster turbines. Windmills and solar are hardly at the top of the power company’s wishlist for ways of generating electricity. They aren’t blowing the tops off mountains because they want to, but because they are being regulated to do so.
It’s too bad the protesters can’t get that through their skulls.
Protesters are turning to the politicians, begging them to stop the evil corporations. Pardon me, but it’s the politicians with the zany green ideas that need to be stopped. Mountain Talk quotes US Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders here:
We are trying to save the world.”
In trying to “save the world” from a scientifically unsubstantiated doomsday, they are all ruining Vermont.
I truly do hope that the protesters succeed in stopping future mountain top windparks. If they pull it off, it’ll be what I like to call “One stupidity killing another.” Nowadays you have to take the victories anyway you can.

,2020-12-13T10:31:39.584720Z,361,120,1021,"On the same day that my article [Coverage of Free Speech Trial Illustrates Media Bias](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/coverage-of-free-speech-trial-illustrates-media-bias/) was published, Karl du Fresne[ ](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/)on his blog tackled the same topic. His article had the headline [Activism disguised as journalism](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/2019/09/activism-disguised-as-journalism.html), and it analysed the Radio NZ hit jobs against both Pregnancy Counselling Services and the Free Speech Coalition.



Radio New Zealand continues to exhibit utter contempt for its obligation of impartiality.   
[…] on the RNZ website yesterday under the headline _NZ’s right wing turn up in force for controversial free speech case_ , reporter Matthew Theunissen painted a lurid picture of “notable right-wing figures” turning up at the Auckland High Court, where the Free Speech Coalition was challenging Auckland Council’s right to deny a public speaking venue to Canadians Lauren Southern and Stephan Molyneux. 



Theunissen reported that Don Brash, “the man behind the Orewa speech”, made an appearance and Jordan Williams from the Taxpayers’ Union was listening intently in the gallery, “a few seats down from a man wearing a MAGA (Make Ardern Go Away) hat”.   
He added that “old” Conservative Party leader Colin Craig (I think Theunissen meant “former”, but hey – who expects journalists to have a command of correct English?) “poked his head around the door at one point”. 



There you have it, then: as sinister a collection of shadowy right-wing rogues and conspiratorial schemers as you could wish for. **Theunissen seemed intent on making it sound like a clandestine meeting of the Ku Klux Klan** […]  
  
Theunissen went on to describe one of the applicants appearing in support of the Free Speech Coalition’s case as “would-be Dunedin mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer […] (whose name Theunissen misspelt, but hey – who cares about getting names right when it’s the sneering tone that matters?).   
The relevance of […] views on climate change and Donald Trump wasn’t clear, but never mind; the important thing was **to convey the impression that this was a court action brought by a bunch of crazy and possibly dangerous old men.**



Even Jack Hodder QC, who represented the Free Speech Coalition, didn’t escape. Theunissen’s assiduous research had established that Hodder also acted for the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners in opposing aspects of the recent changes to the gun laws.   
No further evidence needed, then. It was left to readers of Theunissen’s piece to conclude that the disreputable figures congregating in the Auckland High Court were racists […], religious cranks […], champions of heartless free-market capitalism […] and probably white supremacists […]. Oh, and possibly gun nuts too […]. 



The unmistakeable **purpose of the article was to denigrate** those involved in the Free Speech Coalition’s case and by doing so, to discredit the court action.[…]  
RNZ followed that up […]with the results of an obviously laborious investigation (pun not deliberate) into Pregnancy Counselling Services, an organisation that offers support to pregnant women facing a choice between having an abortion or carrying their baby to full term. 



It’s no secret that PCS is loosely affiliated with Christian churches and tries to encourage women to at least consider having a baby rather than immediately taking the abortion option, so that was hardly a “stop the presses” exclusive. RNZ reporter Susan Strongman concentrated instead on portraying PCS as dishonest in the way it promotes its services and highlighting the fact that it has received modest financial support under the government’s Community Organisations Grants Schemes (Cogs). 



Trouble was, Strongman’s credibility as an impartial journalist was fatally compromised when **she was sprung collaborating with pro-abortion activist group ALRANZ.** As reported on this blog last month, Strongman used the ALRANZ Facebook page to seek information from women who had sought counselling from PCS “only to find they [the counsellors] are pushing a pro-life agenda”.[…]  
  
It’s one thing for journalists to use contacts to go on a fishing expedition for information, but another to align themselves so closely with one side of a divisive and contentious political debate, especially when the reporter is working for **a state-funded broadcaster with an obligation of neutrality.**  
Certainly, pro-life groups were convinced that Strongman was out to do a hatchet job on PCS **with the aim of cutting off an important source of funding**.   
[…] there’s no concealing the article’s partisanship. As with Theunissen’s piece on the Free Speech Coalition’s court action, it can only reinforce concerns about the increasing incidence of activism disguised as journalism, and further undermine public confidence in Radio New Zealand as an impartial source of information on matters of vital public interest.

,2020-12-13T12:03:49.908332Z,362,123,476,"From the missed target department and STANFORD’S SCHOOL OF EARTH, ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
Without a significant effort to reduce greenhouse gases, including an accelerated deployment of technologies for capturing atmospheric carbon and storing it underground, and sustained growth in renewables such as wind and solar, the world could miss a key global temperature target set by the Paris Agreement and the long-term goal of net-zero climate pollution.
The finding, published in the Jan. 30 issue of the journal Nature Climate Change, is part of a new study that aims to track the progress and compare emission pledges of more than 150 nations that signed the Paris Agreement, a 2015 United Nations convention that aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels — the threshold that scientists have marked as the point of no return for catastrophic warming.
“The good news is that fossil fuel emissions have been flat for three years in a row,” said Robert Jackson, chair of the Department of Earth System Science at Stanford’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences. “Now we need actual reductions in global emissions and careful tracking of emission pledges and country-level statistics.”
In the new study, Jackson and his colleagues developed a nested family of metrics that can be used to track different national emissions pledges and thus global progress toward the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
Applying their method to the recent past, the researchers found that global carbon dioxide emissions have remained steady at around 36 gigatons of carbon dioxide for the third year in a row in 2016.
“The rapid deployment of wind and solar is starting to have an effect globally, and in key players such as China, the U.S. and the European Union,” said Glen Peters, senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo (CICERO) and lead author for the study. “The challenge is to substantially accelerate the new additions of wind and solar, and find solutions for effectively integrating these into existing electricity networks.”
However, wind and solar alone won’t be sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. When the researchers examined the drivers behind the recent slowdown, they found that most of them boiled down to economic factors and reduced coal use, mostly in China but also the United States.
In China, the decline in coal use was driven by reduced output of cement, steel and other energy-intensive products, as well as a dire need to alleviate outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for more than 1 million premature deaths annually.
The reasons for the decline in the United States were more complex, driven not only by a decline in coal use but also by gains in energy efficiency in the industrial sector and the rapid rise of natural gas and wind and solar power. “2016 was the first year that natural gas surpassed coal for electricity generation,” said Jackson, who is also chair of the Global Carbon Project, which tracks the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by humans each year.
Looking to the future, the researchers predict that the greatest challenge to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement is the slower than expected rollout of carbon capture and storage technologies. Most scenarios suggest the need for thousands of facilities with carbon capture and storage by 2030, the researchers say, far below the tens that are currently proposed.
Jackson notes that carbon capture and storage technology will prove even more crucial if President Donald Trump follows through with his campaign pledge of resuscitating the nation’s struggling coal industry.
“There’s no way to reduce the carbon emissions associated with coal without carbon capture and storage,” Jackson said.

,2020-12-21T17:32:54.021096Z,363,120,1017,"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.",2020-12-21T17:32:54.021137Z,1

I notice someone running advertisements saying that as livestock are greenhouse emitters, we should all become vegetarians.
But this business about blaming livestock for greenhouse gas emissions is nonsense. It’s true that livestock do emit CO2 and/or methane (CH4) – but that’s only part of the story. From where does the carbon come that comprises that CO2 or CH4? From the food that the livestock eat. That is plants, which extract CO2 from the atmosphere. So animals don’t generate carbon products – they simply recycle them. In short, livestock are already carbon neutral. Likewise, so are humans (as far as our eating, burping and farting goes) – we eat either carbon neutral animals, or plants.
In fact if the vegetarians claim livestock are bad with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, then becoming vegetarian makes themselves no better than those animals, because livestock are vegetarians, too!",2020-12-12T21:22:48.839565Z,1

,2020-12-13T12:04:17.347426Z,368,120,460,"**A minister has accused the EU of holding up post-Brexit trade talks with its ""ideological approach"" as the UK publishes legal texts for negotiations.**
Michael Gove said the third round of talks with the bloc - which ended on Friday - were ""constructive"".
But he said there were ""significant differences of principle"", and it ""remained difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement"".
The EU's chief negotiator has warned the UK's demands are ""not realistic"".
Speaking on Friday, Michel Barnier said he was ""still determined but not optimistic"" about agreeing a deal.
The UK left the EU on 31 January, entering an 11-month transition period, where the country continues to follow a number of the bloc's rules while negotiating a trade deal.
The government has repeatedly ruled out extending the transition period, and has said it will go onto trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules comes 2021 if no agreement has been reached.
But critics have said this could damage the UK economy.
On Tuesday, the government published 13 documents ""setting out our approach to our future relationship with the European Union"", including its outline of a free trade agreement - which ""draws on previous EU agreements"" with the likes of Canada, Japan and South Korea.
It has also proposed a separate agreement on fisheries, on law enforcement, and in technical areas covering aviation, energy and civil nuclear cooperation.
It said its approach was based on ""friendly cooperation between sovereign equals"" and ""represents our clear and unwavering view that the UK will always have control of its own laws, political life and rules.""
But Mr Barnier has said the EU is not prepared to ""copy and paste"" aspects of existing agreements with other countries or do sector-by-sector deals ""rooted in past precedents"".
In a letter to Mr Barnier on Tuesday, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said the UK's proposals were similar to agreements the EU had reached with other countries and that it was ""perplexing"" the EU was ""insisting on additional, unbalanced, and unprecedented provisions in a range of areas, as a precondition for agreement between us"".
""Overall, we find it hard to see what makes the UK, uniquely among your trading partners, so unworthy of being offered the kind of well-precedented arrangements commonplace in modern FTAs [free trade agreements].
""Your text contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards.""
He adds: ""It does not have to be like this.
""I remain convinced that it would be very straightforward for us to agree a modern and high-quality FTA and other separate agreements, like those you have agreed with other close partners around the world, and that we could do so quickly.""
The sense of urgency around these negotiations, which have had to take place in the midst of the pandemic, is increasing.
The UK has now published its draft legal text of a future free trade agreement with the EU - the European Commission published its version two months ago.
The differences between the two sides are well known and both will have to give some ground if progress is to be made before a summit to review the negotiations takes place next month.
The government has also published a new tariff schedule for countries with which it doesn't have a free trade deal, to take effect at the end of the post-Brexit transition period.
A variety of imported products - from garden shears to dishwashers to mirrors - will be cheaper after 1 January. The government says tariffs will be scrapped altogether on Â£30bn of imports.
But if no deal is done with the EU, then the price of cars and food imported from Europe will suddenly become considerably more expensive.
Answering an urgent question from Labour on last week's discussions with the EU, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Mr Gove said there remained differences between the two sides - notably on fisheries and the so-called ""level-playing field"" rules.
A level-playing field is a term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals and gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries.
Mr Gove told MPs: ""The EU essentially wants us to obey the rules of their club, even though we are no longer members, and they want the same access to our fishing grounds as they currently have, while restricting our access to their markets.
""It remains difficult to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while the EU maintains such an ideological approach.""
But the minister said he believed with ""flexibility"" from the bloc, an agreement could be reached before the deadline.
The SNP's Pete Wishart accused the government of ""wilfully piling on a second hammer blow to an economy already shattered by Covid in its obsessive pursuit of its hard Brexit agenda"".
He added: ""This government is doing nothing but playing political games with the future of millions of people by pursuing this anti-EU agenda at all costs.""
On Sunday, the SNP wrote a joint letter with the leaders of the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SDLP, the Green Party and the Alliance Party, appealing to Mr Barnier for a two-year extension to the transition period to allow time for ""detailed and defining negotiations"" after the coronavirus crisis.
However, Labour has not joined the call.
Asking the question to Mr Gove in the Commons, the shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, said: ""It was always a tight timetable but the government has made it clear that they are sticking to it, and we need them to get it right.
""We must not have uncertainty already being experienced right now.""",2020-12-13T12:04:17.347460Z,1

Her turn as a crack addict in the lauded “Moonlight” earned her supporting actress nods for the Critics’ Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes, on Sunday. So, too, her red carpet style will keep you guessing. Friend to cutouts, splashy prints, allover sequins, tuxedos and plunging necklines, Ms. Harris seems determined to avoid being typecast. And the fashion establishment appears to love her chameleonic quality. She sat front row at Christian Dior and Michael Kors, and she attended the Met Gala with Burberry. Of course, Ms. Harris doesn’t accomplish her sartorial variety on her own. She has been working with Nola Singer, also a close friend, for the last five years. “She loves to experiment,” Ms. Singer said of their choices. “It’s not so serious. If I tell her someone is a new designer, she gets excited. She gets that this is a kind of freedom. That’s beautiful about her. ” Ms. Singer, who is based in Los Angeles, styled many of Ms. Harris’s looks over the past year, but the actress also worked with Micaela Erlanger, Lupita Nyong’o’s   for her “Collateral Beauty” press tour. With Ms. Singer, Ms. Harris has favored simple fitted silhouettes but often lets color do the talking. Witness a sequined goldenrod Ralph Lauren halterneck dress worn to the Hollywood Foreign Press   cocktail party in November. “Every actress was at that event, and she really stood out, not because she was trying but because of that color, and because it flattered her figure  —   her arms!  —   without showing too much skin,” Ms. Singer said. No   triceps dips were needed for the visual statement made by a Gucci silver metallic tuxedo at the Hollywood Film Awards the same month. Ms. Singer said the outfit, with its sharp tailoring and lion embroidered on the back, was a nod to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “It was about women being empowered,” she said. Though Ms. Harris knows her way around a pantsuit (see also a white Emanuel Ungaro option at Variety’s Women of Power Luncheon, and a white   Dolce  Gabbana number worn to the TimesTalks event for “Moonlight”) occasionally she likes to go retro. In the navy Carolina Herrera ball gown she wore (with Christian Louboutin flats) to the Governors Awards in November, she was having an Old Hollywood meets modern practicalities moment. Less successful are her quirky moments. An orange Gucci minidress with a frilly black neckline that she wore at the British Independent Film Awards and a brown print Rodarte with    white bust at the “Collateral Beauty” London premiere read   on her lithe frame. Ms. Erlanger’s choice for the “Collateral Beauty” New York premiere was more on point: a neon floral Rosie Assoulin dress that ended above the ankle with Dick   pumps. Sure it was December, but what’s a little   chill when an   campaign is at stake? More unexpected picks with Ms. Erlanger included an offbeat (perhaps dated?) Stella McCartney strapless black bodice with sheer skirt design for the Critics’ Choice Awards last month, and a winning gold sequined tunic and pants by Monse at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November. And if her predictability is in her unpredictability, Ms. Harris is throwing another wrench in for awards season. She is going back to Ms. Singer but adding the New York stylist Laura Jones, known for her work with Alicia Keys, to her team. It will be Ms. Harris’s first time working with Ms. Jones.",2020-12-13T10:32:41.305445Z,1

For example, the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) mission was launched in January 2009 and will make a series of five flights over three years covering more than 24,000 miles to sample the atmosphere in some of the most inaccessible regions of the world. Read HIPPO background here.
The goal of the mission is the first-ever, global, real-time sampling of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases across a wide range of altitudes in the atmosphere, from pole-to-pole.
Professor Mark Zondlo of Princeton University has taken measurements of water vapour in the atmosphere, from 14 km high to just above the sea ice, using a vertical cavity surface mini laser hydrometer.
Watch Zondlo video here.

Here are some of Professor Zondlo’s observations so far:
We don’t really know how clouds are formed. Water vapour impacts the climate more than any other gas.
What we are finding is surprising. Large plumes of water vapour exist in areas we never expected to find them.
Learning how this fits into the puzzle is crucial for predicting climate and making smart policy decisions.
What does that mean? It means the climate models used so far were nothing more than junk, thus the same applies for their predictions. They completely neglected the water vapour factor (and who knows what other factors).
Climate forecasting is best left to real forecasters, and not tainted modelers.

This does not come as any surprise to those who ignore the warming hysteria in the media and follow the observed data. Today, according to the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here, data from the DWD German national weather service shows that winters in Germany have been cooling significantly and in parallel with those in Austria for close to three decades – despite rising CO2 emissions. If Co2 has a warming effect, it hasn’t been seen in Central Europe since James Hansen testified before Congress in 1988!

Germany’s mean winter temperature has been falling since NASA scientist James Hansen warned in 1988 of a rapidly warming planet. Chart: Josef Kowatsch, EIKE.
EIKE also presents a mean winter temperature chart for Germany since 1882. Here we see the long-term trend is modestly upward.

Germany mean winter temperature, based on DWD data.
But EIKE adds that there is a good explanation for this modest warming:
The reason for this heat is mainly the consequence of the urban heat island effect. During the above period, Germany has changed profoundly. Compared to the much smaller and far less frequent heat islands back then, today’s heat islands are far more expansive and involve heat zones. And the surface measurement stations in 2014 are sited differently than they were 130 years ago. Forest chalets at the edge of wilderness and unheated monasteries no longer exist. The surface measurement stations, often under the same name, have been moved to inside heat islands where people live and heat mightily in the wintertime. And also the weather stations next to the landing strips of our airports in conjunction with the hot exhaust of jet engines did not exist 130 years ago. All homes are heated entirely today, and not just 2 or 3 rooms like 50 years ago. This applies to both Germany and Austria. Today’s thermometers are simply measuring man’s additional heat along with that of nature.”

,2020-12-13T10:33:15.853634Z,379,120,867,"Indonesia has much to celebrate. The world’s most populous Islamic nation surmounted the Suharto dictatorship to create a democratic and increasingly prosperous state. If it can overcome secessionist pressures in what remains an artificial country, Indonesia may become an important counterweight to China in Southeast Asia.



Indonesians also could encourage Islam to move in a more tolerant direction. The population is 88 percent Muslim, 9 percent Christian, 2 percent Hindu, and 1 percent Buddhist. Despite the size of its Muslim population, Indonesia’s politics traditionally have been secular. The Islam practiced by most of its adherents is moderate. In its new report, “In Religion’s Name: Abuses against Religious Minorities in Indonesia,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) noted that “Indonesia is rightly touted for its religious diversity and tolerance.”



Yet like Iraq, Tunisia, and Egypt, the end of dictatorship in Indonesia has loosed intolerant religious forces. Observed HRW, increased freedom has encouraged a number of “long repressed” viewpoints, including “religious militancy.” The success of Islamic radicals, in particular, “stands in stark contrast to the Indonesian government’s claims of adherence to the country’s constitutional guarantee of religious freedom,” noted Phelim Kine, deputy director of HRW’s Asia division.



The victims are many. Reported HRW: “Targets have included Ahmadis (the Ahmadihay), Baha’is, Christians, and Shias, among others.” Offenses range from state discrimination to social bullying to mob violence. Although religious minorities have not been without blame in areas where they dominate, “In most cases, the perpetrators of the intimidation and violence have been Sunni militant groups… at times acting with the tacit, or occasionally open, support of government officials and police.”



As the most populous religious minority, Christians are most often the targets of intolerance and violence. Indeed, warned the group International Christian Concern, “anti‐​Christian hostility is only escalating in a country which lacks the political will to enforce the values of its constitution.” Explained ICC, the shift of power from Jakarta after Suharto’s fall “empowered local leaders to let conflicts simmer and delay, if not entirely dismiss the rule of law, so that Christians fall prey to all manner of religious oppression, ranging from denial of building permits to bombings, threats, killings and forced conversions.”



One problem area, explained HRW, is that religious minorities “have difficulties obtaining permits to build places of worship and, in the worst cases, become targets of violence.” From 2005 and 2010, for instance, 430 churches were forcibly closed.



HRW found “at least 12 cases in which militant groups have used [the regulations issued in 2006] to block the establishment of new houses of worship and to close 31 existing houses of worship.” Moreover, “Even in cases where a permit is issued for a house of worship, vociferous responses from militant groups have caused local officials to rescind them or the groups prevent the applicants from constructing or using the building. The Indonesian government and local authorities routinely fail to take measures against the Islamist groups.” Local officials, whether out of conviction or fear, sometimes take up the radicals’ “call to encourage minority congregations to move to different areas.”



The report detailed “sustained campaigns against two high‐​profile Christian churches, that of the GKI Yasmin church in Bogor, and the HKBP Filadelfia church in Bekasi, West Java. Both of these churches had not only secured all administrative documents and political approvals, but won Supreme Court challenges to secure their building permits. Despite these favorable court decisions, local government authorities denied building permits to the two churches.” Then Jakarta failed to enforce the judicial rulings.



Sunni fundamentalists also have targeted Hindus and even Shia communities. HRW found one case when Christians in a predominantly Christian area used similar tactics to build a mosque, and the group suspects that there are other instances. Although religious liberty should be respected in all cases, the position of Rev. Judith Nunuhitu‐​Folabessy reflects a certain logic: “Our Christian brothers and sisters in Java have to obey the 2006 regulation. We want that regulation to be implemented here as well. If we don’t want to follow that regulation to the letter, then it should not be implemented that way in other parts of Indonesia.”



Moreover, HRW pointed to the use of blasphemy and conversion laws “to impose criminal penalties on members of religious minorities in violation of their rights to freedom of religion and expression.” Such abuses are common in Pakistan, where violent jihadist sentiments are strong. All religious minorities, as well as atheists, are at risk.



Expansive state control gives government many other avenues for discrimination if not persecution. HRW reported: “state discrimination on the basis of religion extends beyond the building of churches, mosques, and temples. Various government regulations discriminate against religious minorities, ranging from the provision of ID cards, birth and marriage certificates, and access to other government services.”



For instance, officials refuse to register marriages if the government doesn’t recognize the religion of one of the parties. Without registration children are not issued birth certificates listing both parents. National ID cards are required, but sometimes cannot be obtained without choosing among five officially recognized religions. Refusing to list a religion can lead to charges of atheism and blasphemy.



Many of the problems faced by religious minorities result from flawed laws. Reported HRW: “The harassment and violence directed at minority religious groups is facilitated by a legal architecture in Indonesia that purports to maintain ‘religious harmony,’ but in practice undermines religious freedom.”



Indonesia’s constitution recognizes religious liberty and Jakarta has signed international agreements affirming this fundamental right. However, even the United Nations, hardly a hotbed of freedom of conscience, cited Indonesia’s “tendency to discriminate against any religion or belief for any reason” and laws which “can violate freedom of religion or belief.” The ever‐​diplomatic State Department in its latest report on religious liberty in Indonesia acknowledged that “some laws and regulations restrict religious freedom.”



The HRW report cited several measures which undermine religious liberty. One is a constitutional amendment from 2000 which requires citizens “to accept the limitations determined by law” in order to promote other social ends. Explained HRW: “The latter provision has been and continues to be invoked to demand that religious minorities cater to the demands of the religious majority. By 2010, Indonesia had at least 156 statutes, regulations, decrees, and by‐​laws that restrict religious freedom, many of them justified by reference to” this constitutional article.



The 1965 blasphemy statute, enacted under Suharto’s predecessor, was approved under “Pressure from Muslim conservatives.” In contrast to Pakistan, at least, the punishment prescribed is prison rather than death. Two government ministers defended the law in court; reported HRW, “They said Muslim mobs would probably attack religious minorities if the blasphemy law were overturned, believing it their duty to defend their religion if Islam is being tarnished.”



Two decrees regarding the construction of houses of worship restrict “the construction of houses of worship.” The measures require the approval of local authorities and support of local communities. No surprise, noted HRW, “These regulation have especially been used to discriminate against Christians who seek to build churches.”



Laws and decrees covering proselytizing, child protection, and the Ahmadiyah also have been used to directly interfere with religious liberty. These measures are backed by “various governmental and quasi‐​governmental institutions [which] have played a key role in promoting a Sunni Islamic identity in Indonesia at the expense of minority religions.” Although the Ministry of Religious Affairs nominally addresses all faiths, its current head, Suryadharma Ali, explained HRW, “has been outspoken against religious minorities.” Despite his image as a modernizer, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has allied himself with some of Indonesia’s most retrograde elements.



Misuse of legal rules and processes to hinder religious practice is bad enough. Worse is the government’s failure to protect religious minorities from violence. Such attacks, while not exactly common, are not unusual either, and are becoming more frequent. The Indonesian human rights group, the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace, reported 264 violent attacks in 2012, up from 244 and 216 incidents, respectively, in 2011 and 2010.



Over the years I visited a church and Bible school destroyed by mobs, as well as a church which was bombed — costing the pastor’s wife a leg. In none of these cases were the culprits apprehended, let alone punished.



The violence continues. ICC pointed to an attack in January by Islamic radicals on the minister of a Protestant church in West Java while he was leading a worship service. None of the thugs were arrested, but two days later the pastor was charged for acting without a building permit. Earlier this year Setara’s deputy chairman Bonar Tigor Naipospos observed that “Cases of intolerance against Christians remained high in the country.”



Although Christians are targeted for violence most often, they are not alone. The State Department reported on Ahmadiyas displaced by mob violence in 2006 who remained displaced, essentially refugees in their own country. HRW cited a 2011 attack on a Shiaboarding school in which “more than 200 Sunni militants entered [the facility] and destroyed school property. In the course of defending themselves, nine teenage students were injured.”



The authorities rarely do act. HRW reported on “incidents in which police failed to take action to prevent violence against religious minorities or provided no assistance in the aftermath of such incidents. Police all too often have been unwilling to properly investigate reports of violence against religious minorities, suggesting complicity with the perpetrators. Nor has the justice system proven to be a defender of religious minorities. In the few cases of violence that have gone to the courts, prosecutors have sought ridiculously lenient sentences for the perpetrators of serious crimes, which the judges seem content to oblige.”



In this way the Indonesian government is not fulfilling its most basic responsibility. Even State reported that “Due to inaction the government sometimes failed to prevent violence, abuse, and discrimination against individuals based on their religious belief.”



The examples are many, well documented by HRW. Explained the organization: “In some instances, police actively collude with the attackers for religious, economic, or political reasons; in other instances, they lack clear instructions from above or feel outnumbered by militants. In all cases, the poor police response reflects institutional failure to uphold the law and hold perpetrators of violent crimes to account.” Prosecutorial and judicial failures reinforce the refusal to protect the most vulnerable in Indonesia.



And the problem is not just occasional and episodic. Noted HRW: “In some areas of Indonesia, the intimidation and threats against religious communities by Islamist groups have persisted over time, with little effort from government officials to curtail the violations. Of particular note is the continued coddling of the Islamic Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, FPI), which has engaged repeatedly in acts of violent vigilantism.” Government and police officials even have appeared at FPI events and called the organization a partner in preserving law and order. The International Crisis Group noted that “Taking on allies known for their intolerance is not the way to inculcate religious harmony.”



Not that the Indonesian government appears to be concerned. Bahrul Hayal, Indonesia’s Secretary General of Religious Affairs, acknowledged “one or two cases” of violence, “but I want to say that the achievements [in responding] are better and getting better and I expect that the maturity of the people will also improve over time.”



One can only hope. Last year the State Department warned of “some deterioration in the protection of the right to religious freedom” in Indonesia. Moreover, noted HRW, Jakarta’s failure to respond decisively when “intolerance is expressed through acts of harassment, intimidation, and violence” is “creating a climate in which more such attacks can be expected.”



Indonesia has the potential to become a regional and even global leader. It could become the model of a tolerant Islamic democracy. But not if it continues to deny many of its citizens the most basic right to practice their faith. If the Indonesian government wants to lead, it must take the nation’s constitution and international human rights norms seriously. And treat its religious minorities as equals to its Sunni Muslim citizens.",2020-12-13T10:33:15.853667Z,1

Among them is the stop in global warming, which Spiegel describes as “the mysterious temperature development of the past years“. In the sub-heading Spiegel writes:
An unexpected development has been occupying the attention of climate scientists: The air appears not to have warmed up in the last 16 years. Obviously natural phenomena are covering the increasing impact of greenhouse gases.”
Here Spiegel appears to be very confused by the science, admitting that natural factors are running the show but at the same time illogically claiming that the impact of greenhouse gases is increasing! Spiegel then writes that skeptics should not be so sure that the warming has stopped, claiming that there’s “a variety of plausible explanations for the unexpected development“.
Spiegel then cites ocean cycles, weak solar activity, and both natural and manmade aerosols, which is amazing because except for aerosols, these are precisely the factors that skeptics have been claiming and alarmists dismissing from the get-go.
So whatever excuses or wordsmithing Spiegel tries to employ to save face from having been a grand believer of the AGW dogma since the very start, two things are clear: 1) the warming has definitely stopped, and 2) natural factors are really much more important than assumed and that the skeptics were right all along.
It’s time to completely revamp the models so that they start to resemble reality. It’s also time for the media to rethink their position on the issue rather than trying to hopelessly prop it up.

Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. Almost 100 U. S. companies  —   including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  —   filed a legal brief arguing that the order is unconstitutional. President Trump’s confrontation with the courts may foreshadow years of legal battles, and in Congress   debates have turned into proxy battles over a combative president. Here’s what to watch for this week. _____ • Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington after military briefings in Florida, has rejected criticism.

At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique. He rose to fame in the ’30s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed. Instead, his fame  —   and the popularity of an officially discredited art form  —   may have saved him. “The Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax,” said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer. “Jazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see Jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe. ” Reinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?

,2020-12-12T21:27:51.120171Z,384,120,980,"MOSCOW  —   A Russian court on Wednesday effectively derailed a presidential run by Aleksei A. Navalny  —   the only opposition candidate with a broad, enthusiastic popular following  —   by reviving a    criminal conviction. The decision by the district court was widely viewed as a move by President Vladimir V. Putin to eliminate his only viable rival in an election scheduled for March 2018. Although Mr. Putin has been coy about his decision to run for a fourth term, there is little question that he will. Some observers had speculated that the president would want a weighty opponent to lend legitimacy to his next victory. The best chance for a competitive race came to a screeching halt on Wednesday, however, when a district court in the small city of Kirov, nearly 500 miles northeast of Moscow, pronounced Mr. Navalny guilty of defrauding a state company. Russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office. Since he first came to power in January 2000, Mr. Putin and his allies have gone to great lengths to silence or undermine all critical voices in Russia. It has been almost two years since the   assassination of Boris Nemtsov, another charismatic opposition figure, on the doorstep of the Kremlin. His is the most recent in a string of killings of prominent critics  —   politicians, journalists and human rights activists  —   that remain unsolved. Russian television is largely back under government control, as it was during Soviet times, along with most formerly independent news agencies. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment, civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared “foreign agents,” forcing many to close. Mr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin. He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption, exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary. In recent years, Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics. In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday, he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art, and he was caught up in yet another case involving the death of an elk. While he spent much of 2014 under house arrest, his younger brother Oleg was sent to jail for three and a half years. Mr. Navalny, who called the Kirov fraud charges baseless and politically motivated, responded to the latest judgment against him with defiance. “Putin and his gang of thieves are afraid to face us in elections,” he wrote on Twitter. “Rightly so: We will win. ” In a longer statement, he vowed to continue his presidential run. “We do not recognize this verdict. It will be overturned,” he said. “According to the Constitution, I have a full right to take part in elections, and I will do this. I will continue to represent the interests of people who want to see Russia as a normal, honest, uncorrupt country. ” The Kirov court’s ruling followed almost verbatim the judgment issued against Mr. Navalny in the same case in 2013, which resulted in a   suspended sentence. That verdict was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, and Russia’s Supreme Court ordered a new trial in December. Although the retrial was organized unusually quickly for Russia, Mr. Navalny announced that he was running for president before his latest conviction. Russian political analysts suggested that the prospect of Mr. Navalny’s gaining a national platform to further criticize Mr. Putin had proved too much for the Kremlin hierarchy to tolerate. “The danger associated with Mr. Navalny is easy to explain,” Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email. “If allowed to run, he will disseminate his corruption findings more widely than ever  —   and this disturbs very much Mr. Putin and his gang. ” Officials figured a predictable campaign against impotent opposition was a safer bet, analysts said. Some Kremlin insiders were concerned that letting Mr. Navalny run now would improve his standing for the presidential race in 2024, when Mr. Putin cannot run under current laws, analysts said. Mr. Navalny, 40, is a handsome, telegenic figure with a model family, much more approachable than the usually dour apparatchiks churned out by the Kremlin bureaucratic mill. Despite his earlier conviction, Mr. Navalny was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. He garnered 27. 2 percent of the vote, just short of the threshold needed to force the   candidate into a runoff  —   and enough to feed the Kremlin’s fears. Mr. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, announced that he would appeal the verdict and file complaints with Russia’s Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The European Union issued a statement criticizing the latest verdict, noting that its human rights court had already found that Mr. Navalny did not get a fair trial in 2013. “This latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr. Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia,” the statement said. Mr. Navalny and his team pointed out that there was a conflict between the electoral law and the Constitution, which does not list a criminal conviction among the specific reasons to bar a candidate. Legal analysts said that, just as in the fraud case, any rulings in the other cases against Mr. Navalny would undoubtedly favor the Kremlin. “You can complain about this, but the result will be clear,” said Andrei Y. Buzin, an expert at Golos, an independent election monitor. “The Constitutional Court will say that lawmakers have the right to impose the restrictions it deems necessary to protect the freedoms of other citizens. ” In the Kirov case, the court convicted Mr. Navalny of embezzling 16 million rubles, worth about $500, 000 at the time, by purchasing timber from a   company at   rates and then reselling it at market value. The investigators said Mr. Navalny had used his position at the time as an aide to the Kirov regional governor to persuade the company to sign the contract. Mr. Navalny said the timber was bought at market rates. As the judge, Aleksei Vtyurin, droned through the familiar decision in a barely audible monotone, reading from nearly the same verdict as four years ago, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter to mock the proceedings. “This is page 40 now, and there are 77 of them. It’s comfortable to have the verdict in hand,” Mr. Navalny said from the courtroom. Even before the verdict was announced, the government moved to shut down the logistics for his presidential run. On Tuesday, Russia’s leading information technology company, Yandex, unplugged the online account that Mr. Navalny had used to collect money from supporters.",2020-12-12T21:27:51.120204Z,1

,2020-12-13T12:05:09.627717Z,386,123,5,"by Samuel Furfari © 2020Originally published in the European Scientist, republished as a Google Translated English version with permission of the author.The European Parliament (EP) is accelerating its strategy towards a completely carbon-free European Union. Not content with the ambitious proposal of the European Commission (EC), the parliamentary majority claims that more needs to be done. What they are proposing is unfortunately foolish. This is not an opinion, but a conclusion offered by the historical analysis of official data from Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU.Samuel FurfariINFLATION OF TARGETSAt the Earth Summit in June 1992, the United Nations adopted the Framework Convention on Climate Change. To get to this conference, where he was not allowed to speak, Jacques Delors had a proposal adopted for a directive aimed at the stability of CO 2 emissions in the EU. It was accompanied by a proposal for an energy-carbon tax. France did not want it, arguing that “to fight against alcoholism we should not tax lemonades”, because it was opposed to a tax on nuclear energy, which does not produce CO 2 . Times have since changed.In 2009, at the initiative of Mrs. Merkel, the EU adopted an energy-climate strategy with the objective of reducing CO 2 emissions by 20% compared to 1990. The year 1990 was, and remains, the point of benchmark in the whole climate issue, because it is quite simply the “rounded” year just before 1992. Nicolas Sarkozy, who presided over the EU that semester, had this directive adopted at full speed, because he saw it also a superb promotion of nuclear energy, of which France was a leader. Again, times have since changed.To prepare for the COP21 negotiations, the European Council reached, at its meeting on 23 and 24 October 2014, an agreement on the framework for action for the EU in the area of climate and energy by 2030. It adopted the principle of a binding target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. On 30 November 2016, the Commission, by publishing its “energy-climate” legislative package, this objective of reducing “by at least” 40% by 2030 was made concrete in legislative proposals. But there was no longer any question of nuclear power.During her campaign for the presidency of the Commission, Ms. Ursula von der Leyen promised to raise this target from 40 to 50%. It was a necessary step so that the candidate of the European People’s Party (EPP) could also receive the support of the European left against the socialist Timmermans. Visiting Paris, coming out of her meeting with President Emmanuel Macron, on the steps of the Élysée Palace, the candidate announced that her goal was now 55% for 2030 and 100% for 2050. We can imagine that the reference shareholder of the French nuclear company Areva had used its position of strength in the EP thanks to its elected representatives from the République en Marche. This objective, even more ambitious than the previous ones, was indeed apparently welcome to relaunch the sale of French nuclear reactors,that does not emit C02 and are explicitly mentioned by the IPCC as a source of carbon-free energy essential to achieve its climate objectives.This 55% target for 2030 was endorsed by the EC in its Green Pact in December 2019 and accepted a few days later by the European Council, with the notable exception of Poland. The decision is therefore not yet finalized, Poland having received the promise that billions of euros in aid from European taxpayers would be granted to it in compensation for its acceptance. The great bargaining has yet to take place, probably by the end of this year, bargaining, because the dossier on the rule of law in Poland, managed by Mr Timmermans under the previous Commission, is involved. This country will negotiate hard on its share in the reduction of CO 2 emissions .It will be observed that the objective for 2050 is not “zero carbon”, but “carbon neutrality”. The difference is that no one can imagine achieving zero fossil fuels in 2050, but the inevitable emissions will have to be captured and buried (CCS technology). In addition, the Vice-President of the EC has let it be known that he thinks like Germany on nuclear energy. It is therefore difficult to see how we will be able to reduce CO 2 emissions while abandoning nuclear power. The die-hards believe that the emissions trading mechanism will allow it. It is window dressing, because it is indeed additional emissions.On October 7, the EP raised the already ambitious target of 55% of the EC proposal to 60%. There was a majority of 392 votes, but also a very strong abstention (142), a sign that some, while understanding the exaggeration, were afraid of being castigated, or even ostracized like all those who do not follow without flinching the question. climate. In a lyricism of which only politicians have the secret, The moment has been called a “historic moment”.We did not have the opportunity to verify which Member States the MEPs who opposed (161) or abstained came from, but it is likely that some must have understood the huge trap of this vote. In fact, it provides, above all, that each of the Member States must reduce its emissions.Flashback to understand. The targets of the 20-20-20 strategy of 2009 were binding on each Member State, but those decided in 2016 were only binding on the EU as a whole and not on individual Member States. Environmentalists have tried to impose coercion on each member state, but the Council has held firm. The Bulgarian minister who was presiding over the EU at the time had this word which showed his determination: “  you are not going to bring in through the window what we have brought out through the door  “. The bill for the 20-20-20 objectives had indeed opened the eyes to many countries, which have finally understood that these energy policies are overpriced for mediocre results. Their position can be summed up by the popular expression “courage, flee! “.Because this is the most important point of the decision taken by the EP on October 7. Much more serious than the figure of 60%, it is the obligation for each Member State to achieve this objective. We can bet that the battle will be tough in the Council, because this disproportionate ambition of parliamentarians is unacceptable for many Member States, as we will see with a few simple arithmetical calculations.THE HARSH REALITY OF NUMBERSIn 1990, all the Member States of the current EU (EU-27) emitted 3,925.28 Mt of CO 2, of which 3,549.77 Mt came from the energy sector. If we refer to all greenhouse gases, these figures are respectively 4911.63 and 3734.38 Mt. The difference corresponds to industrial greenhouse gases which are not linked to the production of CO 2 . As these gases are more easily controlled, when politicians claim to limit emissions, it is mainly CO 2 emissions that they are referring. In particular, when environmentalists attack SUVs or airplane vacations, it is not, for example, SF 6 or N 2 0 that they are thinking, but of CO 2 emissions.. These were in 2018 (latest year of official Eurostat data) of 3,184.02 Mt, a decrease of 26.47 Mt per year, which corresponds to a reduction of 19% (still compared to 1990). Between 2018 and 2020, this figure will change and we can therefore recognize that the objective of the 20-20-20 strategy will be exceeded … but “thanks to” the Covid crisis.Globally exceeded! Because if Germany was able to reduce its emissions by 26%, Ireland increased them by 24%, Spain by 22%, Cyprus by 56%, the Netherlands by 3%, green Austria by 10%. and Portugal by 19%. In fact, a significant part of the reduction in EU CO 2 emissions since 1990 is due to the abandonment of the socialist planned economy in the former communist countries. In them, until the end of communism, the price of energy was not real, so there was no need to think about energy efficiency. Thus, once free and having adopted the market economy, Romania and Bulgaria were able to reduce their CO 2 emissions.65% and 43% respectively, demonstrating, if need be, the total ineffectiveness of planned socialist systems, including in energy and environmental matters. Globally, all the Member States that belonged to the Soviet sphere of influence were able to reduce their emissions by 69%, while those practicing market economy by only 17%, because energy efficiency which was part of their practice since the oil crises had already made it possible to achieve good efficiency.But at the same time, on the basis of 2018 data, it must be recognized that the efforts over 28 years have not led to the reduction announced in Western countries. The containment and the terrible recession underway will bring down CO 2 emissions and thus encourage enthusiasts of binding measures to claim that it is possible to achieve “ambitious, but realistic” objectives. This is a shortcut that the millions of citizens who are or will soon find themselves unemployed will appreciate …On average, since 1990, the EU 27 has reduced its emissions by 1.0% per year (1.7% for ex-socialist countries and 0.9% for others). Now, to reach -55% or -60% in 2030, CO 2 emissions should be 1766.38 or 1570.11 Mt, i.e. the annual effort by 2030 ( 12 years from 2018 to 2030) compared to that achieved so far should be 446% or 508%. Difficult to imagine except to consider a complete upheaval (and binding) of current lifestyles and the obligation to face all the excesses to which this upheaval will lead on the part of those who categorically refuse it.But as I wrote above, more dangerous than this 60% target is the will of the parliament to try again to “enter through the window” the obligation for each Member State to reduce its own emissions by 60%. . This means that France will have to multiply by more than 7 for 12 years what it has painfully achieved over 28 years (a reduction of 15%). Belgium should also be 7 times more ambitious. As for the Netherlands, they should be 50 times more ambitious, but in the opposite direction. Perhaps that explains the position of two parties which form the Batavian government to want to relaunch nuclear power?The following table gives, for each country, the ratio between the annual reduction which has been made so far and that which will have to be achieved to achieve the extravagant objectives of the European Parliament. It can be seen that the objectives of the European Commission are just as unattainable (in the table a negative figure indicates that this country has increased its emissions compared to 1990). The graph also illustrates that Parliament’s ambition to want to impose 60% does not in fact change the scale of the challenge compared to that of the European Commission. The bargaining that will take place in the Council to find a compromise between 55% or 60% is just window dressing for the naïve.CONCLUSIONSIs it serious to propose such objectives given the fact that they are unachievable, except to destroy the European economies or to change the economic system, and this, without the approval of the citizens? And this time, there are no more “low-hanging fruits” to take, everything that was easy to achieve has been done; we must now move on to the difficult things. Without forgetting the will of the anti-nuclear activists. Let us also observe that it is not wind or solar energies that can respond to this challenge that the institutions are proposing. Between 2008 and 2018, Germany increased its production of this popular form of energy by 240%, but only reduced its emissions by 12% (this comparison should not be made with 1990 when these energies were practically non-existent.In their next meetings, by the end of 2020, the heads of state and government are expected to debate the proposals of the Commission and that of the EP. The green lobbies will be unleashed in the media, while the industrialists, paralyzed as always on these issues, will begin their declarations with a “we are in favor of the drastic reduction of CO 2 emissions  ” or similar. Until when will European industry continue to be silent to appear green? Until when will the population remain in ignorance of the economic disaster that these parliamentarians cut off from industrial reality are preparing for them? Why is the press silent in the face of such incredible data?This demagoguery of the European Parliament, all parties combined, does not make it grow. Members of the European Parliament do not realize that their demagoguery is detrimental to them. Perhaps, moreover, the European Parliament could set an example, by deciding to abandon its massive transhumance towards Strasbourg four days a month, which also causes emissions?Almost 30 years after the adoption of the United Nations Convention, global CO 2 emissions have increased by 58%. Non-EU countries are heading at full speed towards a continuous increase in CO 2 emissions , because they are the consequence of socio-economic success, which is paramount for them. Despite its extreme positions, the EU is not and will not be the model for other countries in the world.Recall that with its meager 9% of global emissions, going to less than 5% will come at the cost of either a pan-European economic disaster and / or a change of politico-economic regime, about which citizens Europeans were not consulted, and to top it off, with extremely low global impact.The simplistic and grotesque parable of the hummingbird, very fashionable in some circles, and according to which everyone must do their part, however small, is here nonsense: unless the rest of the world follows Europe, which will never happen, this one condemns itself for almost no impact. Certainly, the EU will be carbon-free and will be able to look at the rest of the world from the height of its morale and its self-satisfaction, but it will also be considerably impoverished and will suffer in any case the effects of climate change to which the rest of the world will have contributed.“Should we do nothing then?” “, I am often asked? There are solutions. There have always been solutions; they have always been technological. European political parties and governments should first of all free themselves from their fear of professional green activists, for whom climate change is only the perfect pretext to advance their old goal of “another world”. Then, and consequently, to invest the money of European citizens in this well-controlled low-carbon energy production method, for which Europe has the skills in the legal, political and human sense, and in full technological development, which is the conventional nuclear. Why invest so much in inefficient or science fiction technologies (nuclear fusion, hydrogen as I show in my recent book ” The hydrogen illusion”), while we already have new generation reactors (SMR, molten salts), some of which consume their own“ waste ”?Table 1 Report of the annual changes to be achieved by 2030 compared to those made since 1990.About the AuthorDoctor of applied sciences and engineer, Samuele Furfari has been teaching energy geopolitics at the Free University of Brussels since 2003.

,2020-12-19T16:10:10.109742Z,387,120,167,"By Michelle Stirling © 2019In an April 18, 2019, op-ed in the Globe and Mail, David Anderson invites us to enter his time machine and return to the 1970 and 80s.  Is he still driving a Mercury Cougar? Pontiac Firebird? Chevy Suburban? No?  Curiously his column suggests that tanker traffic is stuck in this era. Regarding the West Coast tanker ban legislation (Bill C-48), the only thing people keep coming up with as a reason to ban tankers is the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989.Things change.  Thirty years ago, the Exxon Valdez was a single-hulled tanker with an inexperienced, exhausted hand at the wheel, the captain below deck, and a broken collision avoidance radar system. The rest is a tragic and messy history.But it is history.Now thirty years later, we have double-hulled tankers, so that if the outside hull is punctured, the inside hull remains intact. Tug boats guide tankers in and out of harbor.  We have GPS and much better mapping of ocean floors and far more accurate weather prediction.And we have excellent spill response materials, teams, and more in-depth scientific knowledge of how to address ocean oil spills than we had 30 years ago. Globally, oil spills have been reduced to a minimum, as reported by the non-profit International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF). Sadly, the facts don’t get the same play as the anti-oil hype in Canada.Robert Lyman, Ottawa energy policy consultant, former public servant of 27 years and diplomat for 10 years prior to that, has written several useful reports filled with facts.  And you know, Facts Matter!Here are some relevant excerpts from his work:Oil transported as cargo in Canadian waters annually totals 192 million tonnes (MT) to the Atlantic coast, 67 MT to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 24 MT to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and 6MT to the Pacific coast. So, only 2% of the oil shipped as cargo in Canadian waters goes to the Pacific coast. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/05/29/two-coasts-two-solitudes/The largest oil spill off Canada’s coast was in 1970. The M/V Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes off the coast of Nova Scotia, before the era when tankers were required to be double-hulled. The west coast’s largest spill was 240 tonnes caused by the sinking of the M/V The Queen of the North in 2006; that was a fuel oil spill. The largest west coast spill was thus 2.4% of the largest east coast spill. Over the last decade, marine oil spills in Canada have been so small that they are measured not in tonnes or in barrels, but in litres.The standard for response capability related to a potential marine oil spill is 10,000 tonnes across Canada. Why 10,000 tonnes? Because that is equivalent to the largest oil spill in Canadian history, which occurred about 50 years ago. No spill in the last 40 years comes anywhere close to that total, and the Canadian and international requirement of double-hulled tankers makes it extremely unlikely that it will ever happen again. Yet, the environmentalists on the west coast whine constantly that the response standard is not high enough.In its submission to the Tanker Safety Expert Panel (TSEP) in 2013, the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation provided information on several topics, including the present capacity of its equipment to deal with west coast spills. It stated that, even though the standard is 10,000 tonnes, it has a present capacity (i.e. in 2013) of about 26,000 tonnes and is continuing to grow! This is an extremely important counterpoint to the claims of the B.C government, only discovered if one trolls the depths of technical detail. So, the present private sector capacity for dealing with an oil spill off the west coast is two and a half times higher than anywhere else in Canada, and that does not even count the resources of the Canadian Coast Guard, which is the main federal government response organization. No one ever raises this in response to the B.C. government’s claims because it is never publicized. https://blog.friendsofscience.org/2018/04/18/spilling-best-kept-secrets-on-the-west-coast/With so much evidence publicly available as outlined in Lyman’s reports, why is Mr. Anderson still promoting a ban? It would seem technology and legislation has made tanker traffic very safe from spills, world-wide.Friends of Science Society’s report “Manufacturing a Climate Crisis” documents how environmental law charity, West Coast Environmental Law (WCEL), was funded by a foreign partner of the Tar Sands Campaign to push for the tanker ban legislation.Anderson’s commentary claims that the 2014 drop in investment was solely due to oil price decline. This is untrue. There was a concerted effort by major foreign-funded ENGOs, including Greenpeace, to drive investors out of the Canadian oil sands, as documented in our report.  In 2014, Greenpeace sent an intimidation letter to global  corporate executives of various oil, gas and coal companies, threatening CEOs and board directors with jail for alleged climate crimes. We wrote a rebuttal and sent it to those same corporations and individuals and issued this press release.  BankTrack, a group of some 40 ENGOs out of The Netherlands, has been harassing banks and investors for about a decade to drive them off investing or financing oil, natural gas or coal projects. They particularly hate the Alberta oil sands.Contrary to Anderson’s claim that only the oil price drop has driven the exodus of investors from Canadian oil, WCEL reportedly (from their own documents) went to Kinder Morgan’s AGM in Texas and scared the pants off them over Trans Mountain pipeline expansion with threats of law suits.  What exactly they said is not clear, but it certainly created reluctance.And as Houston energy investment banker noted in its April 2018 “Musings,” just weeks before Kinder Morgan shut down work on Trans Mountain, Canada became seen as a territory that is ‘hostile’ to investment. This is certainly reflected in recent Alberta government statistics.Source: https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/InvestmentContrary to Anderson’s assertions, both Bill C-48 tanker ban, and the hopelessly subjective Bill C-69, are the products of endlessly lobbying by a hoard of ENGO lobbyists in Ottawa.Robert Lyman explains the problematic issues of NEB reform, the result of which is Bill C-69.Clearly this tanker ban, the on-going foreign-funded pipeline “Blockadia” and foreign-funded international smear campaign against the Alberta oil sands are not based on facts or logic at all.Facts matter and so does living in the present. Because it’s 2019.Canada’s economy and our attractiveness to investment is being destroyed by foreign-funded activists.  Canada is a competitor in the OILympics. We just need market access to win.

,2020-12-12T21:15:57.555049Z,390,118,29,"One crisp winter morning in Sweden, a cute little girl named Greta woke up to a perfect world, one in which there were no petroleum products ruining the earth. She tossed aside her cotton sheet and wool blanket and stepped out onto a dirt floor covered with willow bark that had been pulverized with rocks.
“What’s this?” she asked.
“Pulverized willow bark,” replied her fairy godmother.
“What happened to the carpet?” she asked.
“The carpet was nylon, which is made from butadiene and hydrogen cyanide, both made from petroleum,” came the response.
Greta smiled, acknowledging that adjustments are necessary to save the planet, and moved to the sink to brush her teeth where instead of a toothbrush, she found a willow, mangled on one end to expose wood fiber bristles.
“Your old toothbrush?” noted her godmother, “Also nylon.”
“Where’s the water?” asked Greta.
“Down the road in the canal,” replied her godmother, ‘Just make sure you avoid water with cholera in it”
“Why’s there no running water?” Greta asked, becoming a little peevish.
“Well,” said her godmother, who happened to teach engineering at MIT, “Where do we begin?” There followed a long monologue about how sink valves need elastomer seats and how copper pipes contain copper, which has to be mined and how it’s impossible to make all-electric earth-moving equipment with no gear lubrication or tires and how ore has to be smelted to make metal, and that’s tough to do with only electricity as a source of heat, and even if you use only electricity, the wires need insulation, which is petroleum-based, and though most of Sweden’s energy is produced in an environmentally friendly way because of hydro and nuclear, if you do a mass and energy balance around the whole system, you still need lots of petroleum products like lubricants and nylon and rubber for tires and asphalt for filling potholes and wax and iPhone plastic and elastic to hold your underwear up while operating a copper smelting furnace and . . .
“What’s for breakfast?” interjected Greta, whose head was hurting.
“Fresh, range-fed chicken eggs,” replied her godmother. “Raw.”
“How so, raw?” inquired Greta.
“Well, . . .” And once again, Greta was told about the need for petroleum products like transformer oil and scores of petroleum products essential for producing metals for frying pans and in the end was educated about how you can’t have a petroleum-free world and then cook eggs. Unless you rip your front fence up and start a fire and carefully cook your egg in an orange peel like you do in Boy Scouts. Not that you can find oranges in Sweden anymore.
“But I want poached eggs like my Aunt Tilda makes,” lamented Greta.
I’d like to take credit for this, but I didn’t write it:
“Tilda died this morning,” the godmother explained. “Bacterial pneumonia.”
“What?!” interjected Greta. “No one dies of bacterial pneumonia! We have penicillin.”
“Not anymore,” explained godmother “The production of penicillin requires chemical extraction using isobutyl acetate, which, if you know your organic chemistry, is petroleum-based. Lots of people are dying, which is problematic because there’s not an easy way of disposing of the bodies since backhoes need hydraulic oil and crematoriums can’t really burn many bodies using as fuel Swedish fences and furniture, which are rapidly disappearing – being used on the black market for roasting eggs and staying warm.”
This represents only a fraction of Greta’s day, a day without microphones to exclaim into and a day without much food, and a day without carbon-fiber boats to sail in, but a day that will save the planet.
Tune in tomorrow when Greta needs a root canal and learns how Novocain is synthesized.

The geologic record reveals that  ice ages have occurred when CO2 was at 2000ppm to as high as 8000ppm. In addition, peer-reviewed studies have documented that there have been temperatures similar to the present day on Earth when  carbon dioxide was up to twenty times higher than today’s levels. And, a  peer-reviewed study this year found that the present day carbon dioxide level of 400ppm was exceeded – without any human influence – 12,750 years ago when CO2 may have reached up to 425 ppm.
It is thus good news that carbon dioxide levels have reached 400ppm and the greening of planter earth can continue. Read more:

,2020-12-13T12:05:26.567635Z,392,118,480,"Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a presentation (see below) Harvard astrophysicist Willie Soon came out blasting with both barrels at the corruption in climate science.
He started by saying that any respectable scientist would say that the American National Academy of Science (NAS) is “100 percent corrupt” and the climate scientists who put up the content at the NAS  are “really dangerous”, likening their solution for global warming to amputating a patient’s arms and legs in order to cure his headache.

Refuse to debate, like a religion
Soon says that there’s too much political activism in science and blasts global warming scientists’ refusal to debate the subject in public and compared global warming science to a religion, dubbing it “Scientism”. The public he says, is being confused by “political interference” in the science.
“In serious trouble”
The distinguished Harvard professor criticizes the hostile language used by global warming activists, which he feels played a role in the offices of 2 distinguished climate science skeptic professors being fired at with live munition. He presents a series of slides dibbed: “Science is in serious trouble.”
Reality disconnect
Soon believes that alarmist climate scientist Michael Mann is delusional as he seems to fancy himself to be someone who is rescuing the planet. Overall Soon paints a picture of scientists who have gone completely amok and are totally disconnected from reality, citing an IPCC request that the world pay 535 TRILLION DOLLARS for the carbon sin and NASA’s Gavin Schmidt claim that man is now driving the climate more than 100%.

The list of things that are alleged to be caused by global warming and CO2 is reaching absurd dimensions, Soon shows, e.g. more muddy pet paws, birds singing differently.
Collusion, bullying and censorship

One problem that Soon elaborates is that of scientific “censorship and bullying”, and that it is rampant. Inside climate alarmists constantly collude to shut out other opinions and to smear the reputations of scientists who do not agree. Soon openly says that they are “really dirty people, doing bad stuff”.
Paranoia, contemplations of suicide
At the 33-minute mark, Soon presents a chart showing how global warming scientists, having been frustrated by the skeptic scientists, discussed revamping the peer-review process in order to keep skeptic papers from being published. He mentions how Prof. Phil Jones became so desperate with the fear of being exposed that he “contemplated suicide”.
“Yellow star”
Soon shows how the American Geophysical Union Conference blocked out scientists who had different viewpoints. The censorship was so blatant that Soon dropped his membership. The Harvard astrophysicist is so feared and hated by the global warming alarmism community that he is forced to seek out private funding. One journal, he says, even employed the “yellow star” to designate Soon as a scientist to be wary of, a tactic Soon says is “really Nazi territory”.
On his nemesis Michael Mann, the author of the now debunked and disgraced hockey stick chart paper, Soon calls him a “sad guy”, who even equates himself to a Holocaust survivor, and a scientist who avoids the science and focusses more on personal attacks.
Soon summarizes: with 2 conclusions:

,2020-12-12T21:28:08.982290Z,396,120,986,"**Pubs and restaurants in some parts of England are being allowed to re-open, but with tougher rules.**
Different restrictions are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
There are also special rules over the Christmas period.
Despite the arrangements for meeting others over the festive period, you will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues.
You can meet other people outside your Christmas bubble, but only in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying.
The rules vary across the three tiers from Wednesday. The tiers are reviewed every 14 days.
In tier two areas - where about 60% of England's population lives - hospitality venues can only serve alcohol alongside a ""substantial meal"".
Venues will only offer table service, and diners could also be asked to leave once they have finished eating, No 10 has confirmed.
Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal, while legislation says it should be at least the main course of a breakfast, midday or evening meal, served at a table.
Up to six people from different households can sit together outside in a pub garden.
Businesses in all tiers are legally required to take customers' contact details, so they can be traced if there is an outbreak. Businesses can be fined up to Â£10,000 for failing to do this, for taking reservations of more than six, or not enforcing social distancing.
Staff in hospitality venues must wear masks, as must customers when not seated at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing one, or breaking the ''rule of six'' is Â£200 for a first offence.
Wedding receptions and wakes - where drinks and food are often served - will be permitted in tiers one and two.
People will be able to have 15 guests for weddings, civil partnerships, wedding receptions and wakes, as well as 30 guests for funerals in all tiers. But wedding receptions will not be permitted in tier three.
Northern Ireland is in a two-week circuit-break lockdown, which started on Friday 27 November.
Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops are shut, except for takeaways and deliveries, which must stop by 23:00.
Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes are open, but they will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday.
Under new restrictions, hospitality venues will also have to close their doors to customers by 18:00.
Businesses will, however, still be allowed to provide a takeaway service after 18:00 for food or non-alcoholic drinks.
If they have an off-licence, they can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The rule allowing a maximum of four people from four different households to meet in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. That does not include children under the age of 11.
Entry to premises is controlled and you will probably be required to pre-book with details of all group members.
Customers must wear face coverings, except when seated to eat or drink.
Businesses are legally required to take customers' contact details. They can be fined up to Â£10,000 if they do not do this, or if they take reservations of more than four, or do not enforce social distancing.
Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.
Restaurants, pubs and bars can open in regions that are placed in level zero, level one, level two or level three.
In **level zero** , up to eight people from three households can meet indoors, while in **level one** , a maximum of six people from two households can meet indoors.
In **level two** , pubs, bars and restaurants are permitted to sell alcoholic drinks only if they come with substantial meals.
This is allowed only until 20:00 indoors, and outdoors until 22:30.
In **level three** , alcohol sales are not permitted either indoors or outdoors. Cafes, pubs and restaurants are permitted to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks until 18:00.
And in **level four** , all hospitality venues must close.
Table service and the wearing of face coverings when not seated by all customers is mandatory in all hospitality venues.

The lesser charge was seen as a ray of hope. But that seems to be fading away.
Since then, the tones coming out of Russia have once again become notably harsher, with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commenting. The German edition of Ria Novosti writes:
The arrested Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise vessel knew what they were getting themselves into. Now we simply have to wait for the court’s decision, so says Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
‘This action was planned. All those involved very well knew who and what they would photograph,’ said Lavrov.”
Obviously Lavrov thinks they are guilty of serious offences. These remarks by Lavrov weren’t reported in the English version of Ria Novosti.

The Russian media also points out that the Greenpeace activists also have other charges to worry about, in addition to the serious charge of hooliganism. The English language Ria Novosti writes:
Russian investigators earlier said some of the detained activists could face additional charges, including ‘assault on an official on duty.’
Russia seized the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and its multinational crew after several activists tried to scale an offshore oil rig belonging to Russia’s state-run gas giant Gazprom on September 18.”
Unfortunately, sympathy for the Greenpeace environmental activists is also running low in Russia. Ria Novosti writes:
Only 20 percent of Russians believe that the Greenpeace protest was actually in defense of the environment, whereas 42 percent think it was part of a conspiracy to take away Russia’s valuable natural resources, according to a survey released Monday by respected state-run pollster VTsIOM.”
Greenpeace management obviously had completely miscalculated in sending the activists out to protest in the Russian Arctic. When you take on Russia, you take on the whole system: judicial, political, and even the state-run pollsters. It’s awfully clear who is going to lose this one. The activists won’t be coming back anytime soon.

Unfortunately, sympathy for the Greenpeace environmental activists is also running low in Russia. Ria Novosti writes:
Only 20 percent of Russians believe that the Greenpeace protest was actually in defense of the environment, whereas 42 percent think it was part of a conspiracy to take away Russia’s valuable natural resources, according to a survey released Monday by respected state-run pollster VTsIOM.”
Greenpeace management obviously had completely miscalculated in sending the activists out to protest in the Russian Arctic. When you take on Russia, you take on the whole system: judicial, political, and even the state-run pollsters. It’s awfully clear who is going to lose this one. The activists won’t be coming back anytime soon.

The pain in Spain cannot be sustained. That’s the conclusion of the Spanish government, which is slashing its subsidies for wind power and other renewable energy as part of a deficit-fighting move. Spain is the latest European country to cut subsidies for clean energy — following similar moves in the U.K., Germany and Italy — because they’re driving up costs for consumers. […]
It’s a sad end for a program once heralded as a model by the Obama administration for its own renewables initiative. Yet it’s also not a surprising one. […] Without government subsidies, it simply isn’t a viable business.

Germans thinking twice about sacrificing natural beauty
Meanwhile Germany’s online Spiegel is also taking a critical look at Germany’s wind industry in a piece (in English) called Eco-Blowback: Mutiny in the Land of Wind Turbines. It’s a good summation of how the wind energy is doing in Germany so far. Public resistance is reaching ever higher levels.
With the prime coastal locations already taken, operators are increasingly turning their attention to areas further inland. Even valuable tourist regions — such as the Moselle valley, the Allgäu and the foothills of the Alps — are to be sacrificed. […]

Michael Succow, a prominent German environmentalist and winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize, is also threatening to abandon ship. He fears soulless stretches of land and lost tranquility. […]
And his fears are not unfounded. Back in the 1980s, tree-huggers put up Aeroman wind turbines in their front yards — but those days are long gone. Just the masts of today’s wind turbines can reach up to 160 meters high. When active, they kill so many insects that the sticky mass slows the rotors down.

Moselle, Allgäu, foothills of the Alps? Nothing like sacrificing national and natural treasures for the sake of a neurotic climate obsession.
And I wonder how long it’s going to take other countries before they wake up and notice this isn’t working out. My home state of Vermont, for example, is planning to install an array of solar panels along an interstate. I wonder who is going to shovel the snow off 6 months a year? It’s amazing how duped and caught up with an idea seemingly intelligent people can get.

I wonder how many bloggers know what the symbol to the left means? Seems like there are some that don’t.
No, it doesn’t mean Christmas!
I really wish I didn’t have to write this. But I feel compelled to do so.
I’ve been blogging 9 months and I try to make sure I don’t violate copyright laws. Copyright laws do enter gray territory at times, and sometimes it isn’t really clear what is allowed and what is not. I hope that I’ve always stayed within the law. I use photos from Wikipedia, as it’s stated there what you can and cannot do. I hear a lot of people bring up “fair use”. Laws vary from country to country. It gets complicated and fuzzy.
When blogging, I often quote papers, online articles and provide excerpts, always making sure to cite and link to the sources. I think people who wrote the original material deserve credit and recognition for their work. I like linking to other sites, hoping that the little extra traffic I generate will make them happy. What goes around, comes around.
What do other bloggers think? I’d be interested to know. Maybe I’m naive about all this.

I must say I’m surprised by the number of sites that simply copy and paste ENTIRE stories and paste them at their site, without even asking. This has been done to me more than once, and with increasing frequency lately. With one of my recent posts I found 6 other sites that did this with my story – not one asked for permission to do so. Sure they provided a link, but who needs to click on it when it’s all there?
I don’t want to sound like I’m crying about it, but geez, c’mon, it sure would be nice if people asked. Like hello! I’m not there to carry your water.
Don’t get me wrong, I love it when other blogs pick up on the stuff I write. It really feels rewarding. All I ask is that bloggers post the first 30% of the content or so, or excerpts, followed by a direct link to the original story. Is that too much to ask? Am I being naive?
Tom Nelson does an outstanding job in respecting other people’s work. Tom always posts a few main excerpts, some content, then followed by a link to the original story. This way everyone is happy.
I noticed some sites that copy and paste entire stories without permission also have advertisements at their sites, meaning they are gaining financially by copying and pasting. In this case the originators of the content have the right to compensation.
I’m not going to go after past infractions, but in the future I’m not going to let these things slide as much anymore. Bloggers who benefit financially from advertising at their sites, or receive donations, and decide to copy and paste entire stories from NTZ will have to expect to hand over a cut of their profits, willingly or unwillingly.
All in all, I’m just hoping everyone will agree to play fair in the future.  
Merry Christmas everyone.

This annually-published document is generally regarded as the most accurate and authoritative statistical record of global energy supply, demand and related subjects. For several years now, BP has included statistics on carbon dioxide emissions. The following is the link to this report. Page 49 contains the data on carbon dioxide emissions. They describe emissions by geographic region and country for each of the years 2007 to 2017, an indication of the growth rates over the period 2007 to 2016, and the share that each region or country had of global emissions in 2017. https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html Not everyone likes statistics, especially when they are printed in a small font without explanation or commentary. Nonetheless, the value of statistics is that they constitute factual evidence of what has actually happened in global energy markets, free from the debates that inevitably surround discussions about what the future may hold based on economic models and mathematical equations. Statistics about the past are just the facts. In my comments that follow, I draw attention to the data that I think is especially telling with respect to carbon dioxide emissions in the context of the agreements of the Parties under the Climate Change Convention since 1990 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, including the most recent COP21 Agreement in Paris in December 2015. Broadly, what have the countries of the world actually done over the past eleven years with respect to carbon dioxide emissions? The following points are the highlights: Global emissions are not declining. In fact, carbon dioxide emissions in 2017 were 33.4 gigatonnes (Gt) compared to 30.0 Gt in 2007. So, emissions increased 11.3% over that period. Two parts of the world, as represented by the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the more highly developed economies, and the non-OECD are heading in opposite directions with respect to emissions. OECD emissions declined at the rate of 123 megatonnes (Mt) per year over the period 2007 to 2016, or 0.8% per year. Meanwhile, the non-OECD countries increased their emissions during the same period at the rate of 417 Mt per year, or 2.9% annually. In 2017, the non-OECD countries constituted 63% of global emissions, and the OECD countries constituted 37%. The non-OECD share is steadily increasing year by year, so what happens there is much more important to the global total than what happens in the OECD. The largest country emitter in the world by far is China with 9.3 Gt in 2017, or 28% of the world’s total. The next five largest country emitters in order are the United States (5.1 Gt), India (2.3 Gt), Russia (1.5 Gt), Japan (1.2 Gt) and Germany (0.8 Gt). Emissions declined fastest over the 2007-2016 period in Europe, at the average annual rate of -1.5%, followed by North America at -0.9%. Emissions grew fastest in the Middle East at 3.6% annually, followed by the Asia/Pacific area at 3.1% annually. The largest percentage reductions in emissions over the period by country were in Finland, Greece and Turkey, all at 3.9% per year. The largest percentage increases in emissions over the period by country were in Vietnam, at 10.4% per year, followed by Qatar at 9.4% per year and Bangladesh at 7.7% per year. The annual growth in Asia/Pacific emissions from 2007 to 2017 was 337 Mt, more than the total annual emissions of France in 2017 (320 Mt). Based on their 2017 emissions levels, a group of countries are on track to become carbon dioxide emissions “heavyweights” in the near future: South Korea (680 Mt); Iran (634 Mt); Saudi Arabia (595 Mt); Indonesia (512 Mt); Brazil (467 Mt) and Mexico (473 Mt). The United Nations goal is to reduce emissions to one half of 2005 levels by 2050, or roughly 15 Gt. Today, if one could eliminate all emissions from the western hemisphere, Europe, the former Soviet Union countries, the Middle East and Africa, remaining emissions from the Asia/Pacific region would still exceed that goal.~~~~Related: “The Two-Degree Delusion”  Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)",2020-12-12T21:29:32.282496Z,1

E. C. and literally obliterate  —   —  ” Alas, politics junkies, news editors and anyone else who was watching the broadcast online did not learn how that sentence ended. Ms. Waters was cut off. Instead, they heard the jangling music of a feed from RT, a   Russian television network that has been accused of helping its government interfere in the American election. Some on social media immediately assumed that the interruption, which lasted about 10 minutes, had nefarious implications.    in a statement, had a simpler explanation: It was probably a technical error.  ’s television broadcast continued uninterrupted. Noting that RT is among the news feeds it regularly monitors, it said: “We don’t believe we were hacked. Instead, our initial investigation suggests that this was caused by an internal routing error. We take our network security very seriously and will continue with a deeper investigation, which may take some time. ” RT America, which is broadcast by cable companies within the United States, did not respond to an email requesting comment on Thursday afternoon. A recent declassified intelligence report accused Russia of interfering in the election and said that RT “aimed at undermining viewers’ trust of U. S. democratic procedures. ”    —   a private company that, according to its website, is available in 100 million American homes  —   receives no government money but broadcasts all live congressional proceedings, providing a direct feed of the daily stuff of politics to Americans who find themselves interested in what their representatives are doing. Howard Mortman, a network spokesman, said he could not provide numbers for  ’s online viewership at the time of the interruption.  ’s newsroom monitors many other channels for breaking news, including domestic networks like CBS and CNN as well as various international networks. Its statement suggested that a routing error had caused the RT feed it regularly monitors to be broadcast accidentally. Mr. Mortman said the network’s early explanation for the interruption came from an internal analysis. He said that he was not aware of any previous such interruption. Timothy Burke, the video director at Deadspin, who regularly monitors 20 to 30 online news feeds from his home in Tampa, Fla. was among the first to comment on Twitter about the sudden interruption. He said he had assumed “somebody just flipped a wrong switch somewhere. ” Had Mr. Burke and others who were watching   online at the time not been interrupted, they would have heard Ms. Waters mention Russia and   Donald J. Trump several times before she ended her turn on the floor. In a phone interview Thursday, she was perplexed. She said no one had satisfactorily explained “how this happened or why it happened, or if it’s happened before. ” “I just think it’s strange,” Ms. Waters said. “At a time when our intelligence agencies are very confident and basically have confirmed that Russia hacked the D. N. C. and other political interests, and then we have, while I’m on the floor of the House, talking about Trump and Russia, I get interfered with and interrupted by Russia Today. ” “It’s strange.

According to the IPCC, the Arctic and Antarctic regions warm more than the rest of the globe — a phenomenon branded as polar amplification.
Further, it is conclusively stated (with “high confidence”) that this enhanced polar warming occurs largely in response to increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration.

A 2015 Scientific Paper Affirms CO2 Forcing Is ‘Weak’ To Negligible At The Poles
In late 2015, four climate scientists published a groundbreaking paper (Schmithüsen et al.,[2015]) in the highly-regarded Geophysical Research Letters scholarly journal.
Although obligatorily insisting their research did not undermine the main tenets of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory at one turn, the authors nonetheless landed a devastating blow to the conceptualization of a CO2-amplified polar climate – and thus to the narrative that says the ice sheets and sea ice are melting primarily due to increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
Schmithüsen and colleagues reached the conclusion that CO2-forcing is “rather small” and even “weak“ at the poles.  They found the planet’s tiniest warming signal from CO2 occurs for central Antarctica; they characterized the CO2-forcing for the Arctic region as “comparatively weak”.    For example, quadrupling CO2 concentrations over the Antarctic Plateau is poised to yield a net radiative forcing value of just 1 W m-2.
The authors even assert that increasing CO2 concentrations causes atmospheric cooling in some areas above the Antarctic continent.  They characterize this as a “negative greenhouse effect” due to the “increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system”.
Key points from the paper are highlighted below.

Schmithüsen et al., (2015)

‘Polar Amplification’ From Increased CO2 Not Detectable For Antarctica
Consistent with the conceptualization that “polar amplification” from increasing human CO2 emissions has gone unrealized, the temperature records for the Antarctic continent do not suggest warming has occurred in recent decades.

Graph Sources: Climate4you, Miles et al., 2013, Turner et al., 2016
Increasing CO2 Emissions Has Exerted No Detectable Effect On The Arctic Region
Consistent with the conceptualization that “polar amplification” from increasing CO2 has gone unrealized, the temperature records for the Arctic region also do not suggest a discernible net warming has occurred in response to the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the mid-1940s.  The Arctic region is no warmer in recent decades than it was ~80 years ago, or before CO2 emissions began rising significantly.  This would support the conclusion that CO2 emissions increases have exerted no detectable effect on the Arctic region’s temperatures.

‘Weak’ To Negligible CO2 Forcing At The Poles Lands A Devastating Blow To AGW Alarm
If the warming effect from increasing CO2 concentrations is only “weak” to negligible for both the Antarctic and Arctic regions, then the justification to endorse the most alarming tenets of the anthropogenic global warming conceptualization may be thoroughly undermined.
For example:
1. The decline in Arctic sea ice since the late 1970s may no longer be predominantly attributed to CO2-induced Arctic warming.
2. Mass ice losses for both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets in the modern era may no longer be predominantly attributed to CO2-induced polar warming.
3. The net ice melt contribution to sea level rise from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets in the modern era may no longer be predominantly attributed to CO2-induced polar warming.
4. The post-1980s temperature warming for the Arctic region (that has significantly affected the overall global warming trend) may no longer be predominantly attributed to CO2-induced Arctic warming.
In sum, affirming the Schmithüsen et al.,(2015) analysis leaves little room for continued insistence that rising CO2 emissions are a profound and existential planetary threat.

Update: A just-published paper, Flanner et al., 2018, cites the negative CO2 greenhouse effect conceptualization introduced by Schmithüsen et al.,(2015).  At no time do the authors challenge the relatively quite weak radiative forcing values (~1 W m-2) for the CO2 greenhouse effect in the polar regions as depicted in the colorized graph above.  Instead of challenging these very small CO2-forcing values for polar regions, the authors only challenge the less consequential concept of whether or not a cooling would occur at the poles in response to increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in general, and not CO2 in particular.   It would appear the weak CO2 forcing (W m-2) values for the polar regions as determined by Schmithüsen et al., (2015) are accepted by mainstream climate science.

Libby, 1970
FIFTY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TIMELY IMPORTANCE
WEATHER MODIFICATION BY CHANGING CO2 CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERE [p. 48]
American Scientist, January-February 1970, p. 18, “‘Though dire effects on climate of an increase in CO2 have been predicted, they are far from being established. The cycle is not really understood; carbon dioxide may well prove to be the least objectionable or the only beneficial addition to the atmosphere from industrial sources‘”
Then, 40-some years later, Scientific American writers have changed their minds, claiming that the worst human-generated pollution (of all the possible polluting emissions) is carbon dioxide.


Back in the 1970s, a warming planet was good, and a cooling climate was bad.    Now, it’s the opposite.   Warmth is bad, and cooling is good.   And carbon dioxide, instead of being thought of as beneficial, is now considered a pollutant.
Fortunately, though, many modern scientists do not agree that warming and elevated CO2 are the scourge of the biosphere.  In fact, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that humans, plants, and animals are much more likely to adapt to and thrive in a warming climate than a cooling one.   For casual observers, this may seem obvious.   But for those who are convinced that it is essential to alarm the public about lurking climate catastrophes, good news about warming and elevated CO2 levels are not welcome, let alone worth considering.  It may be characterized as “anti-science” to even mention that (a) Gasparrini et al., 2015 “Cold weather kills 20 times as many people as hot weather, according to an international study analyzing over 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries”, or (b) Donohue et al., 2013  “[T]he 14% increase in atmospheric CO2 (1982–2010) led to a 5 to 10% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments.”   Dramatically reduced mortality rates due to warming, or a greener planet with enhanced crop yields and longer growing seasons due to CO2 rise…do not advance the humans-are-causing-climate-catastrophe agenda.  So instead of reporting on them, tendentious journalists and activists for the cause largely ignore the “good news” about global warming and elevated CO2.
So let’s uncover some of these recently published “good news” papers.  The below list of 20 new (2016) peer-reviewed scientific papers conclude that:
(a) modern mortality rates are lower with warmth they are in cooler environments;
(b) elevated CO2 ‘dramatically’ increases crop yields;
(c) elevated CO2 ameliorates the effects of drought and heat waves;
(d) elevated CO2 greens the Earth;
(e) elevated CO2 and warming lead to weaker hurricanes and storms and stabilize the climate;
(f) there is no significant evidence linking extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, droughts fires, tornadoes)… to CO2 changes, but there is…
(g) evidence that cooling temperatures lead to a more unstable climate.

Mortality Rates Lower With Warmth, Higher With Cold

Shaposhnikov and Revich, 2016
“Highlights: Cold spells seem to be more hazardous to human health than heat waves.
Heat waves and cold spells were identified during 1999–2007. Statistical analysis of mortality from all non-traumatic, cardiovascular, respiratory and all external causes among age groups 30–64 and ⩾65 allowed to obtain site-specific and then pooled estimates of relative increases in mortality separately for heat and cold waves. The evidence of impacts of cold on mortality was more robust than the same for heat.”

Arbuthnott et al., 2016
“Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods. … There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown.”

Elevated CO2 ‘Dramatically’ Increases Crop Yields

Fitzgerald et al., 2016
Elevated atmospheric [CO2] can dramatically increase wheat yields in semi-arid environments and buffer against heat waves
“Wheat production will be impacted by increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 [CO2], which is expected to rise from about 400 μmol mol−1 in 2015 to 550 μmol mol−1 by 2050. … The Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility was established to compare wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth and yield under ambient (~370 μmol−1 in 2007) and e[CO2] (550 μmol−1) in semi-arid environments. Experiments were undertaken at two dryland sites (Horsham and Walpeup) across three years with two cultivars, two sowing times and two irrigation treatments. Mean yield stimulation due to e[CO2] was 24% at Horsham and 53% at Walpeup, with some treatment responses greater than 70%, depending on environment. Under supplemental irrigation, e[CO2] stimulated yields at Horsham by 37% compared to 13% under rainfed conditions, showing that water limited growth and yield response to e[CO2]. Heat wave effects were ameliorated under e[CO2] as shown by reductions of 31 and 54% in screenings and 10 and 12% larger kernels (Horsham and Walpeup).”

Abebe et al., 2016
Highlights

Effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on maize was studied using open top chamber.
Grain yield and yield attributes increased with elevated CO2 in north–west India. 
 Elevated temperature decreased yield but improved grain nutrient contents. 
 Elevated CO2 reduced the negative effects of elevated temperature on maize yield.

“Elevated CO2 increased grain yield of maize by 53.7% and harvest index (HI) by 2.9% compared to ambient CO2. Stover yield and yield attributes such as cob length, cob diameter, grain weight cob−1, number of grains cob−1 and 100 grain weight also increased with elevated CO2.”

Elevated CO2 Ameliorates Effects Of Droughts, Heat Waves

Roy et al., 2016
“Extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as droughts and heat waves are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency and impact the terrestrial carbon balance. However, we lack direct experimental evidence of how the net carbon uptake of ecosystems is affected by ECEs under future elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations (eCO2). … Our results indicate that eCO2 [elevated CO2] not only slows down the decline of ecosystem carbon uptake during the ECE [extreme climate events] but also enhances its recovery after the ECE , as mediated by increases of root growth and plant nitrogen uptake induced by the ECE. These findings indicate that, in the predicted near future climate, eCO2 could mitigate the effects of extreme droughts and heat waves on ecosystem net carbon uptake.”

van der Kooi et al., 2016
“Exposure of plants to elevated CO2 (eCO2) has a number of physiological effects, including increased photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreased stomatal conductance, resulting in greater growth and yield and also improved water use efficiency. Therefore, eCO2 [elevated CO2] is considered to ameliorate the adverse effects of drought. … Our results suggest that crops grown in areas with limited water availability will benefit from future eCO2 [elevated CO2], regardless of their metabolism. Drought leads to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in both C3 and C4 crops, which is alleviated when the plants are grown under eCO2.”

Elevated CO2 as a driver of global dryland greening
“While recent findings based on satellite records indicate a positive trend in vegetation greenness over global drylands, the reasons remain elusive. … Based on 1705 field measurements from 21 distinct sites, a consistent and statistically significant increase in the availability of soil water (11%) was observed under elevated CO2 treatments in both drylands and non-drylands, with a statistically stronger response over drylands (17% vs. 9%). Given the inherent water limitation in drylands, it is suggested that the additional soil water availability is a likely driver of observed increases in vegetation greenness.”

Zhu et al., 2016
“Global environmental change is rapidly altering the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, with consequences for the functioning of the Earth system and provision of ecosystem services.  Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982–2009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau.”

“Observations show an increasing amplitude in the seasonal cycle of CO2 (ASC) north of 45° N of 56 ± 9.8% over the last 50 years and an increase in vegetation greenness of 7.5-15% in high northern latitudes since the 1980’s.  Modelled increases in greenness are primarily driven by warming whereas ASC changes are primarily driven by increasing CO2.”

Mao et al., 2016
“Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.”

Vejpustková et al., 2016
“Trees growing in a pure aspen stand were selected according to the CO-gas regime within their  rooting zone. Five high [CO2] trees (10–25% CO2 in the soil) and five low [CO2] trees (up to 3% CO2 in the
soil) were sampled. Stem growth analysis of each trunk was carried out to study growth pattern in detail.  High and low [CO2] trees significantly differed in a growth rate. At the age of 25 years, the basal area of high [CO2] trees exceeded low [CO2] trees by 39 %. The positive effect of CO2 on annual increment was pronounced particularly in the years with optimal growing conditions. Results suggest that trees can be fertilized not only by elevated atmospheric CO2 but also when fed with CO2 via the roots.”

Elevated CO2, Warming Weakens Hurricanes, Stabilizes The Climate

Chang et al., 2016
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America. Climate models project a decrease in summer cyclone activity, but the observed decreasing rate is near the fastest projected.”

Gaucherel and Moron, 2016
“‘Tipping points’ (TPs) are thresholds of potentially disproportionate changes in the Earth’s climate system associated with future global warming and are considered today as a ‘hot’ topic in environmental sciences. In this study, TP interactions are analysed from an integrated and conceptual point of view using two qualitative Boolean models built on graph grammars. They allow an accurate study of the node TP interactions previously identified by expert elicitation and take into account a range of various large-scale climate processes potentially able to trigger, alone or jointly, instability in the global climate. Our findings show that, contrary to commonly held beliefs, far from causing runaway changes in the Earth’s climate, such as self-acceleration due to additive positive feedbacks, successive perturbations [associated with ‘global warming’] might actually lead to its stabilization.”

Kelly, 2016
“It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change.”

No Significant Evidence That Elevated CO2, Warming Lead To More Hurricanes, Floods, Droughts, Fires, Tornadoes

Boos and Sterelvmo, 2016
“Neither a physically correct theoretical model nor a comprehensive climate model support the idea that seasonal mean monsoons will undergo abrupt, nonlinear shifts in response to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol emissions, or land surface albedo.”

van der Wiel et al., 2016
“[T]he observed record and historical model experiments were used to investigate changes in the recent past. In part because of large intrinsic variability, no evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record.”

Hoerling et al, 2016
“Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales. … Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change.”

Doerr and Santín, 2016
“Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth’s surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.”

Guo et al., 2016
“The combined spatial-temporal variability of U.S. tornado occurrence has remained nearly constant since 1950.”

Evidence That Cooling Is Associated With Extreme Weather Events, Instability

Dezileau et al., 2016
“Storms and tsunamis, which may seriously endanger human society, are amongst the most devastating marine catastrophes that can occur in coastal areas. … [T]hese extreme events occurred around 5250, 4000, 3600, 3010, 2300, 1350, 650, and 80 years cal BP. No comparable events have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. The results indicate little likelihood of a tsunami origin for these coarse-grained layers, although historical tsunami events are recorded in this region. These periods of surge events seem to coincide with the coldest periods in Europe during the late Holocene, suggesting a control by a climatic mechanism for periods of increased storm activity.”

Pratte et al., 2016
“The highest dust fluxes in the Baie bog were recorded from 1750–1000 cal. BP to 600–100 cal. BP and occur at the same time as periods of high variability in the macrofossil record (i.e. successive layers dominated by Sphagnum or Ericaceae). The timing of these events in the dust and macrofossil records also corresponds to documented cold periods. These two [cold] periods have been identified as episodes of climatic instability, which could have been caused by changes in the wind regime.”

H/T Eric Worrall and Breitbart – Obama’s inability to make a decision on Keystone has finally yielded a result – Canada has made the decision for him.
Breitbart reports Canada has just approved the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project – a major pipeline to ship Canadian oil to Asia.
The Canadian oil will still be burnt – in Asia, instead of America. 
All the jobs and energy security which Canadian oil could have delivered to America, will instead be delivered to Asia.
Rather than purchasing crude from a friendly and allied neighbor, the United States will most likely need to continue its reliance upon hostile sources like Venezuela. Energy analysts had hoped that construction of Keystone could have replaced almost half of the current U.S. daily crude purchases from that volatile, anti-American dictatorship, depriving Venezuela of the resources it relies upon to stay in power and fund its Cuban allies.
You can’t say Canada didn’t give America a chance – they waited years for the American administration to come to their senses. But in the end, they couldn’t wait any longer, and have put the interests of Canadians first.

,2020-12-12T21:44:00.623259Z,408,120,484,"“One of the great weapons of a democracy. ” This was how Harry Belafonte, the performer and civil rights activist, referred to the street march in a recent interview. Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills. He is also a   of the women’s march set for Saturday. When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend, they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital. From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Marian B. Mollin, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements, said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater, attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals. But the test of a march’s   efficacy, she said, is whether it energizes participants long after they’ve gone home, sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change. This is what she’ll be watching for in the months after Saturday’s march. “Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Because there is a lot of unfun, unglamorous work to do,” she said. We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed  —   or didn’t change  —   history. On March 3, 1913, a    named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots, threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest women’s march in American history. Behind her came businesswomen in blue, writers in white, artists in pink and musicians in red, all calling for their right to vote. Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them. “If my wife were where you are,” a police officer told one woman, according to this newspaper, “I’d break her head. ”   Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. By the end, more than 100 women were hospitalized. Women had fought for suffrage since at least 1848. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. By 1920, American women had the right to vote. Read how The New York Times covered the march here. On July 28, 1932, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington, wheeled tanks into position, prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperse. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the   marches in American history. The law had said payments would be made in 1945, but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier. The event lasted weeks, until President Herbert Hoover ordered the protesters’ removal. Army troops shot “a heavy barrage of tear gas” at the veterans, according to The Times. Two people died during the protest. In “The Bonus Army: An American Epic,” the authors Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen wrote that the march changed the nation, pushing Congress to pass the G. I. Bill, landmark legislation that allowed many veterans to go to college. Read how The Times covered the march here. The National Mall swelled with people on Aug. 28, 1963, to urge Congress to pass a historic civil rights bill. It was here that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. “As he arose, a great roar welled up from the crowd,” the journalist E. W. Kenworthy wrote in The Times. “When he started to speak, a hush fell. ” The paper reported that more than 200, 000 people had attended. At the time, civil rights legislation was tied up in Congress, facing a filibuster by Southern lawmakers. But the march helped energize everyday people like Hazel Mangle Rivers, a black woman who took the $8 overnight bus to Washington from her home in Birmingham, Ala. “When I get back there tomorrow I’m going to do whatever needs to be done,” she told a Times reporter after the protest. “I don’t care if it’s picketing or marching or   or what, I’m ready to do it. ” The gathering was followed by sustained activism  —   including a   drive in Mississippi and a march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery  —   that helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The march, Mr. Belafonte said recently, showed that there was “a great swatch of American opinion that was supportive of our cause. ” Read how The Times covered the march here. On Nov. 15, 1969, antiwar activists streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue, calling for a rapid withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Three drummers led the procession, followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead. Then came rows and rows of marchers, 17 abreast, shouting, “Peace now! Peace now!” A police official estimated the crowd to be at least 250, 000 strong, though others have said it was much larger. At the time, many Americans had grown impatient with President Richard Nixon’s policy of gradual withdrawal. The White House said the president had spent the day watching college football inside. It was the largest antiwar protest to date. But its success was less clear than the 1963 civil rights gathering. “In the aftermath of that march, Nixon escalates the war,” Professor Mollin said. Read how The Times covered the march here. The Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion, spurred anger across the country, particularly among religious and conservative families. A year after Roe v. Wade, on Jan. 22, 1974, thousands gathered in Washington to urge Congress to support a constitutional amendment, known as the Buckley Amendment, which would have effectively overturned the decision. When it became clear it wouldn’t happen that year, the march’s founder, Nellie Gray, vowed to hold marches every year until it did. This year’s march, to be held on Jan. 27, will include a particularly prominent speaker: Kellyanne Conway, the   woman in the Trump administration. Read how The Times covered the march here. Andy Humm was a television reporter for the Gay Cable Network on Oct. 11, 1987, when an estimated 200, 000 people gathered in Washington to call for AIDS research and the end of discrimination against gay people. (The event followed a 1979 march, before the AIDS crisis.) By 1987, more than 20, 000 Americans had died of AIDS and an additional 36, 000 had learned they had the disease, which was deeply stigmatizing. Activists were desperate for research and care. They spread a quilt bearing names of the dead. And they wept as Mr. Humm interviewed them. “There was no hope,” he said in a recent conversation. “We were a fairly powerless movement back then. ” The march helped mobilize and personalize the movement. Three years later, Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, the largest federally funded program for people living with H. I. V. and AIDS. (AIDS deaths continued to climb each year until 1995.) Read how The Times covered the march. Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them black men, came together on Oct. 16, 1995, for a rally organized by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He called on them to “accept the responsibility” to “be good husbands and fathers and builders of our community. ” It was contentious  —   Mr. Farrakhan had been criticized previously for sexist and   remarks  —   and was attended by the poet Maya Angelou but opposed by the N. A. A. C. P. Organizers said the event spurred 1. 7 million black men to register to vote. But the march’s legacy is the subject of debate. “Some say its core message of   and atonement left black men grappling alone with issues such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, letting politicians and institutions off the hook,” a Washington Post reporter wrote. “Others argue that the earnest assembly was a potent symbol that changed perceptions of black men and inspired the marchers to make great changes in their lives. ” In 2015, Mr. Farrakhan held a second march. Much of the discussion centered on the use of force by the police and continued discrimination. Art Scott, 59, a salesman who attended, told The Times: “There comes a time, after being pushed for so long, to push back. I think that’s the feeling in the black community right now. ” Read how The New York Times covered the march.",2020-12-12T21:44:00.623291Z,1

Von Frank Bosse und Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated and condensed [due to time constraints] by P. Gosselin)
The star at the center of our solar system was also very inactive last month. The determined sunspot number SSN of 26.1 was only 50% of what is normal.
Fig. 1: Mean solar activity (blue) compared to the activity of the current cycle (red) and the very similar solar cycle 5 (black).
A comparison of all the cycles:

Fig. 2: The activity of all cycles 1 to 24. Depicted is the deviation from the mean. The current cycle began in December 2008 and is the 3rd quietest since systematic observations began in 1755.
The behavior of the solar polar fields also indicate that the upcoming solar cycle 25 could be as weak as SC 6. According to the current conditions, we could experience a solar minimum that is similar to that experienced during the Dalton Minimum (SC 5, 6 and 7) of 1790 – 1830. The strongly decoupled polar fields is a phenomenon that has yet to be observed since systematic observations began in the 1970s – a time when the solar activity was stronger than at any time ever observed.
Antarctica: So little ice as never observed before! 
Last month we saw plenty of headlines about this. The German ARD remained rather factual, but others were dramatic and even employed photo-shopped images suggesting climate alarm. First the facts: This year’s ice extent is at a record low, as is referenced by the NSIDC in its report. Here’s the chart:


Fig. 3:  Sea ice extent around Antarctica in February compared to 1979 (in %). Source.
The dashed line depicts the overall trend, and it remains strongly upward. The long-term trend is what counts when it comes to climate. Yearly fluctuations are related to weather. A look at the GISS temperatures across Antarctica shows no relevant trend.

Fig. 4: Antarctic surface temperature as to GISS.
What follows are the sea surface temperatures (SST). Here we see where the sea ice loss is coming from:

Fig. 5: Temperature anomaly of the ocean surrounding Antarctica. 
Here we recognize the downward trend since the 1990s, followed by a sharp upward spike at the end. Certainly much of this has to do with the weather at the end of 2016, more precisely since September.  There is no real information on what is behind the spike.
One suspicion is the very powerful El Nino of 2015/16, but such a spike did not follow the El Nino 1997/98. It must be kept in mind that there were some real global differences between the last powerful El Nino and the one from the late 1990s, see study here. One suspects that a chain of events may have unfolded which led to a warming of the water around Antarctica. Next year will likely tell us if this is only a temporary powerful warming spike, or if it is the start of a trend reversal.
Media reports that global warming is now catastrophically reducing sea ice around Antarctica are however, wild speculation. In a recent study here on the AMOC, it is determined that a powerful heat transport towards the North causes a special pattern: The sea surface temperature (SST) cools and the depths get warmer. The deeper water at the edge of the continent down to 700 meters shows a warming trend. Here’s a look at the lower depths there:

Fig. 6: Ocean temperature anomalies down to 700 meters deep around Antarctica.
The divergence between the lower layers and its surface can be clearly seen. In Fig. 5 we see the sudden positive spike in SST, but the ocean down to 700 meters cannot of course follow along due to its high thermal inertia.
In the North Atlantic we do see, however, a retreat in heat transport since about 2012:

Figure. 7: The surface temperature anomalies in the sub-polar North Atlantic since 1980.
It may very well be that the El Nino is in part causing the “see-saw” effect: A stronger northward directed heat transport (strong AMOC) cools the water at the sea surface of the ocean (the sea ice grows) around Antarctica while it gets warmer in the water depths. A weaker AMOC (Fig. 7 favors a diminishment compared to the years after 1998) reverses the condition in the south: it gets warmer on the sea surface (sea ice melts) and the depths get colder.
We await with suspense the measurements around Antarctica to see whether this is the case. These are all natural processes, and whether man-made warming plays a role — if yes, how much of a factor it really plays — is completely unclear.
It is far too early to start blaring out that man is melting the Antarctic. Propaganda and science do not go well together. The internal variability of the currently cooling North Atlantic is simply “nature at work”.

The latest gap is revealed by an experiment by an international team of scientists that shows evidence of a new mechanism where light causes atmospheric aerosols to increase in size.
 
Aerosol pollution over India and Bangladesh, 2001. (Photo source: NASA)
The results of the research by a team led by Maria Eugenia Monge et al have been published by the PNAS. Title: Alternative pathway for atmospheric particles growth.
“The new and up to now unknown processes may be the reason why the atmospheric chemistry and physics of aerosol concentrations are often underestimated in models. This photo-induced processes first will be characterized experimentally and then introduced to tropospheric models,“ recommends Hartmut Herrmann of the German Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (IfT) in Leipzig, a member of the team.
The paper’s abstract underscores that major gaps exist in the understanding of the physicochemical pathways that lead to aerosol growth in the atmosphere and that these pathways need to be considered by models.
So once again it’s back to the drawing board for our habitually lost climate modellers.

According to a Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research press release, light causes the aerosols to grow in size and have an impact on clouds and climate. Photocatalytic reactions can lead to a rapid formation of non-condensing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the surface of particles. They found that light can trigger chemical reactions between gaseous bonds and chemicals on the surface of organic particles, which ultimately allows them to increase in size says Dr. Maria-Eugenia Monge of IRCELYON and the University of Lyon.
Experiments showed that the particles under the influence of light can grow about 50 to 65 nanometers, which corresponds to about a doubling of their weight. The intensity of the light was of lesser importance. Already very weak UV radiation is enough to break the chemical bonds of dissolved organic material (DOM) and form free radicals.
The experiments were conducted at the IRCELYON in Lyon under the supervision of Dr. Christian George. Also participating were scientists of the French CNRS research association, the Israeli Weizmann Institute with Prof. Yinon Rudich, and Prof. Hartmut Herrmann of the German Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (IfT) in Leipzig.
The Leibniz press release adds that aerosol particles in the atmosphere influence global climate because they reflect sunlight. They are also a factor in the global water circulation, which effects cloud formation and precipitation. They also impact human health as well. Despite their impacts, the processes that are responsible for the creation and growth of these particles are among the least understood fields of atmospheric science. At the IfT in Leipzig, the development chain of atmospheric particles from fine particulates to the formation of clouds and precipitation in natural areas as well as areas burdened by humans, i.e. large cities, are being researched.
So much for the new study on light and aerosols, which we know have a cooling effect on the planet. But with the last sentence in italics by the IfT, why do I get the feeling they are gearing up (again!) for man-made global cooling? Human activity is throwing up lots of aerosols (industry, agriculture, transportation, etc.) into the atmosphere and so are contributing to blocked sunlight. Time to start curtailing human aerosols!
And one more question: if low intensity light can cause major aerosol growth, wouldn’t it be very plausible that high energy cosmic rays could do the same?

,2020-12-12T21:45:15.264593Z,414,118,1650,"Lon Glazner, a fellow blogger and local electronics engineer made some comments about my post on the NASA/CSU study on California temperatures. Well that got me started…so below are Lon’s comments and my reply along with a fun technical challenge. For those of you that read this blog, but disagree with my views, I invite you to read this carefully.
Anthony,
You make a number of good points.  Particularly in the fact that the writers may have applied changes in urban temperature measurements over large regions for graphical impact.
As someone who has designed and built electronic temperature sensors I have certain concerns about the data itself.
Unless temperature sensors are regularly calibrated I think it is unreasonable to expect accuracy of greater than a couple of degrees.
Even some that are calibrated may not have good accuracy.  The LM34 which is a commonly used semiconductor for measuring temperature is +/-2 degrees F.  This is pretty typical of analog or digital semconductor sensors.  The temperature error for this part is also non-linear, and so it’s not a simple offset that you have to account for during data collection.  Furthermore, there are lots of additional errors that can creep into a temperature measuring device beyond the sensor itself.
http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM34.html
One could argue that numerical analysis done on data points would tease out errors.  But if a scientist doesn’t know the exact accuracy of a temperature sensor then they couldn’t account for errors in their system.
Some of the temperature sensing stations may be  very accurate and regularly calibrated.  But maybe they’re not?
I have a hard time trusting that the data is accurate to the level of identifying 1 or 2 degree changes over decades.  This is especially true since the techniques of making these measurements have changes over that time frame.
Lon

Lon, thank you for the comments. FINALLY somebody who understands the kind of biases that creep into temperature measurements!
I’m innately familiar with National Semi’s LM34 and it’s accuracy problems. One of my early jobs at my university as a research assistant was to create remote electronic weather stations. I soon learned how inaccurate many electronic devices can be in temperature measurement.
The problem with the National Weather Service temperature data sets (and world data sets too) is that they are full of biases and errors that I’m not sure have been accurately accounted for. People such as Jim Price, from CSUC who is on the IPCC say they have been, yet nobody has shown me any hard evidence of such. I’d be a lot less skeptical if I could see how the IPCC accounted for temperature measurement biases. But they won’t share.

Some people that I try to explain this to accuse me of splitting hairs. But these bias problems in temperature measurement are quite real.
What works against my arguments about the difficulty in getting accurate temperature records is the everyday simplicity of temperature and its common measurement. We live by temperature, we have it reported constantly, we all have thermometers at home, we measure our childrens fevers with thermometers, we barbeque with thermometers.
Measuring temperature is easy right? You just stick the thermometer in whatever gas, liquid, or solid you want to measure the temperature of and voila’  there it is. People tend to think of thermometers as perfect devices. Some very expensive calibrated thermometers, are close to perfect, especially when taking measurements in a closed system, like a fermenatation vat at Sierra Nevada.
But in an open system in our atmosphere, there are many many more biases that can affect the measurement within a few inches or feet of the thermometer. Here’s just a few:
– Reflected sunlight from nearby building or objects
– Re-radiated infrared from nearby cement or asphalt surfaces or the ground itself (which is why airports make terrible places for temperature measurement)
– The structure that the thermometer is mounted to, can conduct heat to the thermometer
Now add to that:
– Accuracy of the thermometer itself
– Linearity of the thermometer over its measurement range
– Long term repeatability of the thermometer’s accuracy
– Long term repeatability of the thermometer’s linearity
And then we have urban effects such as:
– Localized vegetatation removal or addition over time
– Localized building changes over time
– Localized asphalt or concrete surfaces addition or removal
And finally within the global temperature records data set we find instances of:
– Changing the location of the weather station and/or its thermometer
– Changing the thermometer itself at some point – i.e. repair/replace
– Changing the thermometer type, from mercury, to electronic (thats been done at thousands of weather stations worldwide)
– Variations in temperature measurement devices from country to country, even though the World Meteorological Organization has specifications, they are not always followed.
– Changes in thermometer shelter, different types of paint over time, all which have different absorptive and reflective properties.
– Changes in the observer recording the temperature, some may round up, others round down numbers. BTW for about 75 years, all temperature records were manually recorded.
Ok with all these biases and possible errors that you have to account for to make long term temperature measurement reflect the true temperature of the location, can you be absolutely sure of the data integrity? Especially when you are looking for trends that may be 1 degree or less over 50-100 years? I can tell you that I’ve looked at these climatological data sets, and NONE of them come with a calibration record for the thermometer, or even a description of the make/model used at that location. There are notations in the records that say things like “station relocated to accomodate construction” or “thermometer replaced” which can give clues to the data integrity possibly changing but the climate researcher is left to make a judgement call on the viability of the data without anything to gauge the sensor or its local environment.
Or lets try a thought experiment Lon, you’ve been commissioned by the IPCC to make a new thermometer for use around the world at climate measurement stations. As an electrical engineer, could you design an air temperature thermometer that is:
– Linear to within 0.1% over a temperature range of -20F to 120F
– Accurate to within 0.1 degree F over that same range

Alpha Ventus has 12 5-MW wind generators. The electricity will have to cost 7 – 8  US-cents per kwh just to cover the construction costs. That’s about the price electricty is traded at on German commodity markets. But then you have to add the operating, maintenance and dismantling costs after the expected 20 years of operation. Also the added cost of expanding the electrical grid to accommodate the wind parks has to be added in.
In general windparks cannot compete against conventional power plants. That’s why the German government subsidizes windpark operators and guaratees them 19 US cents per kwh. The higher costs are of course borne by the consumers and industrial customers.
Contribution to “climate protection”. So what is the consumer getting for his money? Using IPCC data and forcings, Krüger calculated how much Alpha Ventus will help to reduce the global temperature:
Without the assumed positive feedbacks: 0.000001°C,  with the assumed positive feedbacks 0.000005°C.
That’s right – a whopping few millionths of a degree! Boy can you feel it already?
Protest: The offshore windparks also kill a considerable number of migratory birds, and so environmentalists are already protesting the planned construction of 11 additional offshore parks. Indeed a Folks’ Initiative protest against wind energy is taking place in Berlin this coming weekend: http://www.volksinitiativewindrad.de/.

,2020-12-19T16:53:49.306605Z,416,120,563,"**Nobody saw it coming. Hong Kong's year of protest and violence stunned everyone from observers to participants. What started the crisis was political - but emotion has fuelled it.**
**We picked seven to explain this year of tears, exhilaration, broken relationships and personal pride. Text by the BBC's Grace Tsoi, portrait photographs by Curtis Lo Kwan Long.**
Saturday 30 March 2019 was the last normal day. Clear and sunny, it began like any other weekend in Hong Kong with its singular cocktail of frenetic leisure - family lunches, shopping late into the neon-lit night and cute selfies at every opportunity.
The next day, something more political began. A few thousand people marched through a dispiriting drizzle to protest against a proposal that would have allowed extradition to China: ""With extradition to the mainland, Hong Kong becomes a dark prison,"" they chanted.
It didn't get much coverage then. But the city was listening.
Within six months, Hong Kong was a place of huge protest marches, street battles and an unapologetic police response of tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and live fire. Teenagers shot bows and arrows, the parliament chamber was vandalised, hundreds of young people now know how to make Molotov cocktails and start fires. But after the bill was withdrawn, the anger became more palpable if anything.
Politics may have been the trigger, but reckless passion is the fuel and on display everywhere. Arguments have broken out on the street between strangers: one man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters; a taxi driver full of rage ran his car through a group of protesters; a student fell to his death in unexplained circumstances; an elderly cleaner standing in the middle of the road gaping at a fight was hit by a stray brick careening through the air. He died.
It is a difficult thing to report dispassionately on the descent of your home, a city famous for stability, into a surreal dystopian vision. People are worried about China's domination but they are also worried about what violence has done to the fabric of society. It seems as if nobody is sleeping well any more.
The textbook factors of politics, economics, demographics, even democratic ideals, ideology and identity cannot fully explain this - but the emotional intensity generated by the interplay of it all completes the picture.
Even though the politics divides, the emotions are what the city shares - and these stories have helped me understand Hong Kong's fraught predicament.
When Fiona met her husband at school, she knew she would marry him one day. Now, in their late 30s, they have a picture-perfect family with two children. But this is the year everything changed.
She is a protester. He is a policeman.
""I tell him I feel less love for him,"" Fiona says.
They didn't discuss politics when they were dating - there was little politics to discuss then.
It was only during the 2014 Occupy movement, which sought changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, that political differences emerged. She left home for the protest zone one month after she gave birth to their son, but felt wounded by the scorn of her husband.
Despite that, she believed that love could bridge any differences. That's not the case any more and the turning point for her - as for many others in Hong Kong - came on 21 July.
That night had seen protests erupt across the city. But as people headed home late in the evening another element entered the fray. In the rural district of Yuen Long, a large group of white-clad pro-government men, rumoured to be linked to triad gangs and armed with rods and poles, were waiting at the train station. They began beating people they believed to be protesters.
""I rushed out from the toilet with my phone in my hand. I told him the white shirts were beating up ordinary citizens in Yuen Long. He said he knew and went into the bedroom. He slept soundly that night, while I stayed wide awake.""
Outrage swept across Hong Kong and by the following morning there were accusations that the police had not done enough. Their denials were insufficient to prevent Yuen Long being used as proof that the police were not there for the people but for the masters. The next weekend of protest was one of the most violent seen up to that point.
Fiona's anger only grew as police became more heavy-handed. She and her husband began quarrelling over alleged police brutality.
Support for protesters, even as they went further in their violent action, is attested to by opinion polls. Protesters took out their rage on companies seen as pro-government: the MTR train operator saw stations and ticket machines vandalised, Chinese-owned ATMs were destroyed - this in a city famous for its respect for the rule of law. Yet the results of district election last month saw an overwhelming victory for pro-democratic figures.
Fiona's husband, though, was not swayed.
""Why is he so foolish? He thinks there's nothing wrong with the Chinese Communist Party and the extradition bill,"" Fiona says.
And so contempt crept into their relationship.
Her husband, however, still loves her very much. ""He keeps sending me heart emojis. I used to reply to him with a heart but now I don't feel like doing it. And he keeps asking...
""I really want to love him again, but I can't.""
She does acknowledge, though, that ""this is his pride. This is his identity.""
It is an acknowledgement needed by those in Hong Kong who support the police and the government. For them, one of the most unsettling things about Hong Kong's year is not confrontations between police and protesters, but the political fights that erupt on the street.
Just over a month ago Crystal Chu, a 49-year-old businesswoman, arrived at the border station of Sheung Shui at the call of a pro-Beijing group, which planned to stage a protest. About 100 of them were soon outnumbered by pro-democracy protesters.
She was first pelted with eggs and projectiles and then she was hit in the head - she needed three stitches.
""That moment was horrifying. I feel like they came from hell,"" she says, at a loss to understand a dehumanising cycle of hatred against people simply expressing their views.
""They do this in the name of freedom. But it's just sheer violence.""
The intensity of this hatred is being taken as a direct challenge to a system that has guaranteed stability, prosperity and a quiet life. For them, the pro-democracy movement is staffed by thugs with little understanding of political realities.
""Why don't they recognise themselves as Chinese? You can't deny this because we have black hair and yellow skin,"" Ms Chu says.
""Do you think Hong Kong can ever be separated from China?""
Few - on either side - have a clear grasp of the legal complexities of Hong Kong's special status, which makes safeguarding its fate all the more precarious. So the arguments end up being about ideology, identity and history. Ms Chu came from the mainland in her 20s. Many others of her generation, but born and bred in Hong Kong, will recall grandparents' tales about life in China. In the 1960s those grandparents may have swum over. Although they left China behind, it remains part of their identity.
The younger generation out on the streets does not share such memories - it is easier for them to disregard the older ties that bind. Their touchstones are globalised cultural memes of defiance: ""If we burn, you burn with us"" - they chant referencing The Hunger Games; Can You Hear the People Sing? they belt out from Les Miserables; Pepe the Frog, a symbol of the alt right movement, was also adopted - certainly unwittingly.
Ms Chu, though, feels alarm when strangers walk past quickly.
Over the past six months, Celine, a protester in her 20s, has attended almost every single march or rally going - and fought hard.
""Every time I am terrified. But I still do the same next time.""
The fear she has on the frontline is, she says, dwarfed by her fear of what could come if she doesn't act. She is afraid of the way China has weighed in on Hong Kong's politics. After five booksellers who sold salacious books about Chinese leaders turned up in Chinese custody, after China interpreted Hong Kong's mini-constitution so a few pro-democracy lawmakers could be disqualified, she asked herself: if they can do this now, what might happen when that mini-constitution expires in 2047?
This is a fear shared by an entire generation. She will be in her 50s. Her generation will be parents. What will become of their children?
In the beginning, she only set up roadblocks using bricks. Soon her hands no longer shook when she threw petrol bombs.
With each passing month of exhausting and escalating protest, she watched both her resolve harden and her fear increase. The clashes bring thrills but everything changed for her during the siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University in November.
It was the site of a three-day showdown between police and protesters barricaded on the campus. Hours of intense fighting saw huge fires, petrol bombs, bricks and even bows and arrows being fired at police. Police struck back with rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas so dense people could not see through the choking clouds.
""I thought I might die inside.""
""I saw a pool of blood,"" she says. ""Many people were bleeding from their heads and they were crying.""
She eventually managed to escape without being arrested.
Now, whenever she passes the university during bus rides she cries uncontrollably and finds it difficult to breathe.
Many young protesters acknowledge that their actions, while raising awareness, may only increase the likelihood of a more fundamental crackdown at some point. They know the risks but it is about balancing the probabilities of fears.
For those that speak out against protests - there is another, more deep-seated fear. They say that their Hong Kong, the safe prosperous society they built, is disappearing. Although staying silent was not ideal, they worry that this path is inevitable self-destruction from within rather than the feared assault from outside.
Mr Tsang's mind went blank when he received a call one rainy October evening telling him that his daughter had been arrested in a protest. He was on a night shift as a security guard but hopped on a bus and arrived at the police station soaking wet.
It was after midnight when he finally saw his daughter Alice. The 16-year-old was followed by police officers and her hands were bound.
""We didn't need to speak,"" Mr Tsang says. ""We could understand each other.""
Alice has been charged with rioting, an offence which could lead to up to a decade in jail.
She's one of about 1,000 underage demonstrators who have been arrested since protests started in June. She says she isn't a frontline protester, but couldn't leave the protest site because every route was surrounded by police.
One of the most striking moments over the past few months was when school headteachers went to Polytechnic University to try to negotiate the release of their students. The first person to be shot by a live bullet was a secondary-school student. It is not just young people, but adolescents who have got involved. They may court dangerous thrills, but they believe they are safeguarding uncertain futures. Either way the trauma and the impact on this generation is yet to be properly understood.
In Mr Tsang's eyes, Alice is an ordinary teenager who loves make-up and shopping. She's also a daddy's girl who sometimes gets jealous of the family cat: ""She says I love the cat more than her.""
He has always known she was a protester: ""I can't lock her up at home. No parent should do that.""
Yet he also witnessed a positive change in her because of the protests. She became more confident and made more friends. For a girl with depression and anxiety, that meant a lot. She is a living example of a culture of youth solidarity that has embodied these protests. They feel the older generation hasn't safeguarded their future, so it is in their hands - they have no options.
He still lets her join protests, but only those with police approval - he does not want to crush her ideals.
In 2013, Lily Wong became a widow. Her husband died of a heart attack, leaving her with two young sons.
Three years ago she set up a snack shop as she didn't want to be on social welfare any more.
Business had been booming at Ms Wong's snack shop. Patrons travelled from other districts to taste her handmade steamed rice rolls, pudding cakes and herbal drinks. Recently, she thought that she might just be able save enough for a mortgage down payment.
But all that changed after she uploaded a photo to Facebook of her attending a pro-police rally. Ms Wong says she supports the police because it is the duty of police officers to maintain law and order.
""I don't regret uploading the photo because I just expressed my personal opinion.""
The backlash was immediate. Young people stopped coming to her shop and it has become the target of health and safety complaints.
In October, officials from different departments visited her shop almost every other day, she says: they came to investigate things like food hygiene and compliance with fire regulations. Apps in Hong Kong now identify outlets as either ""blue"" - sympathetic towards police - or ""yellow"", which means protest sympathisers.
During one such visit, she broke down in tears: ""I was very emotional. I support my family and I want stability for them. But it felt like I was being pushed to the edge of a cliff.""
Ms Wong mourns the loss of the old Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong is a wonderful place. No matter one's education level, as long as one's willing to work, one will not starve,"" she says.
""Now, even eating is decided by colours.""
She understands young people feel the need to fight for their future, but feels they are ignoring the cost of their actions and the fruits of the efforts of past generations.
""Society has been torn by politics, and I feel sad for it.""
It was Derek's childhood dream to become a policeman. Officers always look sharp in cop movies and he truly believed he could help people.
But now he wants to quit.
Obedience is the most prized quality for police officers, as Derek has known from his first day - with little room for dissent.
For months, as violence has raged in Hong Kong, police officers have been wearing masks and their warrant cards have not been on display. Police say the masks are protective, but protesters say police are trying to conceal their identity to escape accountability.
""When I am on duty, I don't hide my face and I show my police number,"" Derek says. ""This is a principle I adhere to."" But this had implications for him on the front line when a senior officer questioned his motives.
For the police, this has all been genuinely tough. Officers have to put in at least 15 hours a day. Riot gear is heavy and it's exhausting to run around in the scorching sun. Policemen and their families have been doxxed - meaning their personal information has been leaked online - many feel this is just for doing their job. They face hatred just as much as they are accused of fuelling it.
Nonetheless, Derek feels there are no excuses for the unruly behaviour of police officers caught on camera beating protesters or opening fire: ""Frontline officers have no restraint and use excessive force,"" he says.
He disapproves of unquestioning loyalty within the police force - but he thinks the same thing is happening among protesters. He can't accept any assault on people of different political persuasions.
""I asked my pro-protest friends if they would distance themselves from this - all of them said no,"" Derek says.
So he doesn't know where he stands in this new Hong Kong.
For mainland-born Benjamin, the protests have finally made him consider himself a Hongkonger - after more than a decade.
On 16 June he spent five hours marching from Victoria Park to Admiralty by himself - a march that protesters said was attended by two million people.
""I am proud of this city,"" Benjamin says. He was touched by the resolve of the peaceful marchers.
But he is at odds with the community known as gang piao - (a Mandarin term which means Hong Kong drifters). These are the well-educated Chinese elites who move to Hong Kong. Every year, the government accepts 20,000 such ""drifters"", often scorned by locals for taking jobs.
""I can say 99 out of 100 drifters see their Chinese identity as unassailable,"" Benjamin says, and that they see a distinct Hong Kong identity as unacceptable.
Many mainlanders feel they have dedicated themselves to the city, but are suspected of just being ""brainwashed"" automatons. They cannot help but wonder if a touch of xenophobia is involved, even from people who they believe to be of their ""own kind"" - another example of how complex identity and allegiances are.
After university, Benjamin was determined to leave mainland China. He valued personal freedoms and had a natural scepticism towards the authoritarian Chinese government.
But it has also been difficult for him to build friendships with locals because of differences in background and language. ""We can... have dinner together,"" he says. ""But we can't become good friends.""
An August encounter with a pro-protest Uber driver sticks in his mind.
After a minor argument over a pick-up, ""he said to me that he could tell I am not from here by my accent,"" Benjamin recounts.
When he and two friends were thrown out of the car, his friends seized the opportunity.
""They said, 'Don't you stand on their side? Oh, they don't see you as one of them?'""
He is now looking to move away from Hong Kong and China.
The city is living a double life. Protests at the weekend, business as usual on weekdays.
But Hong Kong has entered its first recession in a decade, with the number of tourists plummeting more than 40%.
Mr Chan, who has been working as a hawker for more than four decades, knows that tough times have come. Before the protests, he made more than HK$1,000 (about $130; Â£100) every day. ""Now we only make a few hundred dollars.""
His account is a corrective to the narrative that economic decline will infuriate Hongkongers - it hasn't yet. But shops are closing down and people are feeling financial pain.
Despite this, the 67-year-old remains unfazed, even though Kowloon has become a battleground.
A Guangzhou native, Mr Chan was witness to the Cultural Revolution - he once saw a peasant being beaten to death by children. He swam to Hong Kong in 1973.
Mr Chan doesn't blame the protesters for his losses.
""The future belongs to the youth, and they are fighting for things they want,"" he says. ""We have enjoyed the most prosperous time, and we can only accept when things go downhill. It's as simple as that.""
James was in school for the 2014 Occupy Movement which eventually fizzled out - the protesters had lost.
On the last night before the clearance of the protest site, someone hung a banner with the words: ""It's just the beginning.""
""People said we would be back. In the beginning I wasn't that optimistic. I thought it would take at least 10 years,"" James says. ""I didn't know it would happen so quickly.""
James was in awe when a million took to the streets on 9 June. But he was especially touched by a July march organised by senior citizens who call themselves ""the silver-haired"". He did not know there would be so many older people who support the protests.
It was not the same experience at home - where he sees protesters as critical to defending Hong Kong's civil liberties, his parents think they are trouble-makers.
""My mother said it was right to beat people, and it's better to punish them all.""
These differences have also upset his mother: ""I have raised him... provided an education for him. The way he treats his elders makes me uncomfortable,"" she says. ""He said I am not educated and know nothing.
""I don't care about which side he supports politically. But he can't treat his parents this way.""
Seeing the older protesters was a moment of exhilaration for him, a bridge between generations.
These protests have been pivotal in cementing identity for thousands more like James across Hong Kong. It is no longer just a free-wheeling capitalist dream, where as long as you make money political apathy will rule the day. In just over 20 years it has seen one of the most rapid developments of group identity.
But it doesn't just go one way.
""China has developed well,"" says Lily Wong, who runs the snack shop. ""Young people don't understand their identities and their origins.""
She is one of those who feels the breath of China over their shoulder and is not chilled by it - but reassured.
They too have enjoyed being open about their feelings despite threats and condemnation from the many who support the cause of the protesters.
What nobody can do is tell us where Hong Kong goes from here. What they all know is that no matter what their view, they will fight with all their heart for what they believe is the best for the city.

,2020-12-19T17:03:49.802582Z,417,118,110,"The overall scientific credibility of the Climate Feedback critique is extremely low.  The CLINTEL European Climate Declaration – “There is No Climate Emergency” is a plain language statement of views for the UN and the general public to consider.  Climate Feedback attempts to offer a scientific critique of general points rather than simply asking the signatories to provide their evidence to back up the summarized statements. The Poynter Institute for journalists has ‘certified’ Climate Feedback, but most journalists do not even know the name of the complex differential equations integral to climate change. How can they certify who is or is not a climate scientist, an expert or accurate, in a field they know nothing about?  This absurdity is laid out in Prof. Christopher Essex’ memorable essay: “Cavemen, Computers and Climate.”That said, let us critique the Climate Feedback response. Climate Feedback states:Similar letters have sought to establish credibility with large numbers of co-signers in the past, but evidence is what counts in science. (bold added)The signatories agree that evidence is what counts in science.  This is why they have signed this EU Climate Declaration.The Climate Feedback respondents are clearly not up to date with the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientific findings.  At that time, the IPCC, reported that there had been no statistically significant warming for the 15 years prior (dating back to before Kyoto was ratified) despite a very significant rise in carbon dioxide concentration. Excerpt of Sept. 2013 IPCC WGI AR5 ReportThe (above) graph showing the global temperature anomaly versus the atmospheric CO2 concentration, illustrates a clear divergence between the rising ratio of CO2 concentration and the near flatline trend of temperatures for almost 2 decades.  The temperature spikes indicate El Nino years (a naturally occurring phenomenon).A similar graph above, using 5 datasets, (produced in 2015), shows a similar phenomenon – wide divergence between CO2 concentration and temperature.  This is contrary to the radiative forcing theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming.  While this evidence does not suggest that humans or CO2 from human industry have no effect on earth’s climate, it does show no correlation as theorized, and therefore questionable causation in respect to CO2 driving warming – especially ‘catastrophic’ warming.  Correlation of warming and CO2 rise, as was the case during the 1970’s-mid 1990’s was assumed as evidence of causation; the divergence of temperature and CO2 means no correlation is evidence of lack of causation.  This is a fundamental scientific principle. Dr. Hans von Storch, Lead author of the IPCC WGI (Physical sciences) of AR3, and WGII (Impacts, Adaptation, Vulnerability) of AR5 made public statements about this anomaly, prior to the issuing of the 2013 IPCC report, noting that not a single model forecast this pause. An excerpt from his interview with Der Spiegel:SPIEGEL: Just since the turn of the millennium, humanity has emitted another 400 billion metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, yet temperatures haven’t risen in nearly 15 years. What can explain this?Storch: So far, no one has been able to provide a compelling answer to why climate change seems to be taking a break. We’re facing a puzzle. Recent CO2 emissions have actually risen even more steeply than we feared. As a result, according to most climate models, we should have seen temperatures rise by around 0.25 degrees Celsius (0.45 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 10 years. That hasn’t happened. In fact, the increase over the last 15 years was just 0.06 degrees Celsius (0.11 degrees Fahrenheit) — a value very close to zero. This is a serious scientific problem that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have to confront when it presents its next Assessment Report late next year. (bold and underline added)SPIEGEL: Do the computer models with which physicists simulate the future climate ever show the sort of long standstill in temperature change that we’re observing right now?Storch: Yes, but only extremely rarely. At my institute, we analyzed how often such a 15-year stagnation in global warming occurred in the simulations. The answer was: in under 2 percent of all the times we ran the simulation. In other words, over 98 percent of forecasts show CO2 emissions as high as we have had in recent years leading to more of a temperature increase.Contrary to statements in the Climate Feedback critique, Dr. von Storch states that the models were not suitably predictive, not even close.He goes on to acknowledge that science is a process, subject to new findings all the time.SPIEGEL: What could be wrong with the models?Storch: There are two conceivable explanations — and neither is very pleasant for us. The first possibility is that less global warming is occurring than expected because greenhouse gases, especially CO2, have less of an effect than we have assumed. This wouldn’t mean that there is no man-made greenhouse effect, but simply that our effect on climate events is not as great as we have believed. The other possibility is that, in our simulations, we have underestimated how much the climate fluctuates owing to natural causes. (bold added)SPIEGEL: That sounds quite embarrassing for your profession, if you have to go back and adjust your models to fit with reality…Storch: Why? That’s how the process of scientific discovery works. There is no last word in research, and that includes climate research. It’s never the truth that we offer, but only our best possible approximation of reality. But that often gets forgotten in the way the public perceives and describes our work. (bold added) Note that the interviewer refers to “which physicists simulate the future climate” – yet Climate Feedback critics suggest that anyone who is not a ‘climate scientist’ has nothing to say on the issue of climate.  Climate Feedback authors denigrate the signatories as not being ‘climate scientists’ because many signatories are geophysicists or geologists. Earth sciences is the original home of climate science, dating back three hundred years to James Hutton, father of modern geology. https://www.academicinvest.com/science-careers/environmental-science-careers/how-to-become-a-climatologistGoogle search records reveal that the term ‘climate science’ and ‘climate scientist’ only became unique terminology about 2005. Are we to believe Climate Feedback’s position on ‘who is a climate scientist’ that only scientists qualified in the past 15 years or self-identified as ‘climate scientist’ are the experts? All understanding of earth’s complex climate system rely on the works of hundreds of thousands of earth scientists, atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, volcanologists, astrophysicists, chemists, biologists, and physicists dating back hundreds of years; yes, we stand on the shoulders of giants and the Climate Feedback critics actually mock the work of many of these emeritus professors.Evidence Over IdeologyEU Climate Declaration signatory physicist and Professor Emeritus Francois Gervais has published a paper showing that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation 60-year cycle has more to do with climate change and temperature, than carbon dioxide. Gervais also did a presentation at the Porto Climate Conference in 2018 at the Porto University (Faculdade de Letras, Universidade do Porto)  showing that the ‘consensus’ view has now shifted dramatically – scientists see carbon dioxide as a nominal contributor to global warming and nothing catastrophic.  While the Climate Feedback critics may hold a different scientific view, the proper approach is to invite discussion and open debate.  Clearly there is a disparity between what Climate Feedback critics say, and what the evidence shows.https://youtu.be/wU1PKa0W8Gc English and French versions of this material, videos, transcripts and the peer-reviewed paper are posted for convenience on this blog Climate Feedback Critics Dismiss IPCC Stance on Human InfluenceOne Climate Feedback critic claims that the natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800’s and human influence prevailed thereafter, while the IPCC states that human influence only stems from 1950, and everything prior was natural.  Likewise, the IPCC only claims that more than 50% of the warming after 1950 was human caused (but not 100%). A review of the graph of the Holocene (above) shows cyclical warming and cooling is the historical norm and that current warming is within the range of previous warm cycles.Timothy Osborn, Professor,University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit:The current period of warming is not because the Little Ice Age ended by 1850. Climate scientists study the causes of warming and cooling period and calculate their effects on our climate. These studies show that natural warming after the Little Ice Age was complete by the late 1800s. The warming from the late 1800s to the present is all due to human-caused climate change, because natural factors have changed little since then and even would have caused a slight cooling over the last 70 years rather than the warming we have observed. (italics added)Osborn confidently states that ‘natural factors have changed little since then’ without any evidence to support his claim.  In fact, natural factors are highly variable, most are not even documented or quantified and some, as noted in the APS document referred to below, are on very long-time scales for which we have no data.https://www.aps.org/policy/statements/upload/climate-seminar-transcript.pdf The foregoing shows that we are ‘far from understanding the climate system.’  Climate Feedback critics claim to be experts on the topic of climate, they claim that the greenhouse effect has been understood for well over a century, citing this about Svante Arrhenius:1896 – SvanteArrhenius publishes first calculation of global warming from human emissions ofCO2: doubling the CO2 in the atmosphere would raiseglobal temp some 5-6°C (9-11°F) In fact, in 1906, Arrhenius published a paper in German in which he drastically amended his view (based on additional scientific insights) and affirmed that warming would top out around 1.5 °C and would be beneficial.  This is effectively what we see today.  Indeed, temperatures have been drastically dropping for the past 3 years, despite a continuing rise in CO2 concentration.  Whether this trend continues or not, we will have to see.  In any event, due to the cyclical nature of climate change, earth’s populations should be prepared for either warming or cooling and implement relevant adaptations where possible.https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/While Climate Feedback critics and Poynter Institute journalists confidently state claims about earth’s temperatures, the experts at NASA GISS are much more circumspect.GISS Surface Temperature AnalysisThe Elusive Absolute Surface AirTemperature (SAT)The GISTEMP analysis concerns only temperature anomalies, not absolute temperature. Temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 1951-1980. The reason to work with anomalies, rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances, while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger region. Indeed, we have shown (Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987) that temperature anomalies are strongly correlated out to distances of the order of 1000 km.Q. What exactly do we mean by SAT? A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question. Even at the same location, the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 ft above the ground and different again from 10 ft or 50 ft above the ground. Particularly in the presence of vegetation (say in a rain forest), the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation. A reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 ft of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation. To measure SAT we have to agree on what it is and, as far as I know, no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted. Even if the 50 ft standard were adopted, I cannot imagine that a weather station would build a 50 ft stack of thermometers to be able to find the true SAT at its location.Q. What do we mean by daily mean SAT? A. Again, there is no universally accepted correct answer. Should we note the temperature every 6 hours and report the mean, should we do it every 2 hours, hourly, have a machine record it every second, or simply take the average of the highest and lowest temperature of the day? On some days the various methods may lead to drastically different results.Q. What SAT do the local media report? A. The media report the reading of 1 particular thermometer of a nearby weather station. This temperature may be very different from the true SAT even at that location and has certainly nothing to do with the true regional SAT. To measure the true regional SAT, we would have to use many 50 ft stacks of thermometers distributed evenly over the whole region, an obvious practical impossibility. In light of these insights, clearly no one should be claiming absolute certainty about global warming or ‘hottest year ever.’  As well, many scientists and citizens were deeply disturbed by the revelations of the ClimateGate emails which showed that scientists holding dissenting views on the effect of CO2 or who ascribed other factors to climate change (i.e. solar or ocean cycles, subliminal geothermal activity in the ocean, etc.) were systematically blocked from publication by a clique of climate insiders.  Other serious issues of scientific integrity and breach of ethics were exposed, as was the fact that sea surface temperatures in a large part of the world had been ‘made up.’  Some emails revealed that ENGOs like WWF were apparently directing preferred ‘results’.  WWF has been extensively funded by the ClimateWorks green billionaires. One of the Climate Feedback critics is the director of the climate research unit at one of the facilities most implicated in the ClimateGate scandal (not to suggest this person bears any responsibility; simply pointing out that this facility’s overall scientific integrity was put in question).In addition, a grad student’s 2016 report found thousands of errors in the HadCRUT (Hadley Climate Research Unit) Temperature datasets.  Some of these included embarrassing, nonsensical items like temperatures of 80 °C for months for Caribbean Islands or apparent sea surface monitored temperatures actually taken from a site that is miles inland. As pointed out by science writer Joanne Nova, “…it begs the question of why a PhD student working from home can find mistakes that the £226 million institute with 2,100 employees could not.”Climate Feedback was critical of the fact that the EU Climate Declaration also includes business people, as if business people need a climate science degree to see such errors and breaches of integrity in climate science – yet still be required to pay millions in carbon taxes or to address GHG regulations that impose severe burdens on their business.  Obviously, business people understand math better than many climate scientists do, and they understand that such breaches of integrity and accuracy, in their world, would result in severe financial or even criminal penalties (if related to air/water quality monitoring/regulatory issues or related to securities fraud), loss of customers, and collapse of their business operations.  The climate science world gets a pass on all these real-world consequences. This must not be allowed to continue. Type Two Scientific Misconduct by Climate Feedback, Sanctioned by PoynterThe participants in Climate Feedback review engage in Type Two Scientific Misconduct “‘type two scientific misconduct’ is other-harming and leads to falsely negative conclusions about someone else’s work‘ by referring to scientists in a defamatory manner by stating that signatories who hold rational, dissenting views on the alleged ‘consensus’ are ‘well-known climate deniers‘ when not a single person on the EU Climate Declaration signatory list denies that climate changes, and they all agree that humans affect climate change, but that the effect is nominal and not catastrophic.  Name calling like this is contrary to responsible conduct in research, as set out in the NAS handbook “On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research.”“Science has progressed through a uniquely productive marriage of human creativity and hard-nosed skepticism, of openness to new scientific contributions and persistent questioning of those contributions and the existing scientific consensus.” (underline emphasis added)Those who question are engaging in responsible conduct in research. Those who close ranks are preventing scientific progress.On a personal note, it is particularly offensive to see scientists attempting to denigrate scientific colleagues through the use of the term ‘denier,’ especially when many of the scientists of the European Climate Declaration live in EU countries where the horrors of the Holocaust still reverberate.The term ‘denier’ seems to have emanated from a PR man and Al Gore acolyte, who set up DeSmogBlog, a site that is a fundee of members of the massive ClimateWorks Foundation green billionaire network which funds most academics, non-profit journals, and local environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) as proxies to push the ClimateWorks plan to establish global cap and trade, carbon pricing and to put trillions of their vested interest renewables on the grid worldwide. Curiously, neither DeSmogBlog founder James Hoggan nor Al Gore are ‘climate scientists’ either, but they feel free to hurl the epithet ‘denier’ about and it is even more curious that respectable scientists, like those engaged in Climate Feedback commentaries, bring dishonor to the realm of science with such Type Two Scientific Misconduct tactics.  Discounting Expertise of Working ProfessionalsClimate Feedback claim many of the signatories work or have worked in fossil fuel industries, as if this automatically discounts their expert professional insights.  Earth scientists who have worked in oil, gas or coal must provide accurate assessments of the risk, access to and value of these precious resources.  To this end, they have studied 4.5 billion years of earth’s climate change history in order to make reliable judgements, upon which billions of dollars of investment rest, and from which society benefits with modern conveniences, modern medicine, and our many freedoms – especially that of world travel.Expert geoscientists and Professional Engineers work with models all the time and their works require exacting outcomes – both for public safety, and to meet investor and securities regulations. They are rightly critical of the climate modelling community which pumps out projections that are far from reality. Millions of people are being frightened by faulty climate models and related media hype, billions of dollars in public funds are being wasted on unreliable infrastructure (like wind and solar/electric vehicles) yet the climate modelled outcomes and claims would never meet basic industry standards. A disturbing revelation from the American Physical Society (APS) workshop of 2014 revealed that climate modellers found a 30% scaling error which they corrected on ten year forecasts….but not on 100 year projections! DR. KOONIN: But if the model tells you that you got the response to the forcing wrong by 30 percent, you should use that same 30-percent factor when you project out a century. DR. COLLINS: Yes. And one of the reasons we are not doing that is that we are not using the models as statistical projection tool.DR. KOONIN: What are you using them as? DR. COLLINS: Well, we took exactly the same models that got the forcing wrong and which got sort of the projections wrong up to 2100. DR. KOONIN: So, why do we even show centennial-scale projections? DR. COLLINS: Well, I mean, it is part of the assessment process. And the uncertainty, I think there is a point not to get confused about what the driving uncertainties there are. By the year 2100, it’s not – DR. KOONIN: If you calibrated the model against historical data, discovered you needed .7 to be applied to the greenhouse gas, you should keep that same .7 when you run it forward, no? Climate and investment policies are being set based on these long-range model projections which apparently include a significant, known scaling error.  In the context of a geoscientist or Professional Engineer working in any industry, (but particularly fossil fuel industries where reserve assessments and project development work decades in advance) such improprieties and lack of scientific integrity would result in firing and professional misconduct penalties.  In the climate world, such improprieties are only discovered ‘by accident’ in an APS workshop and then passed off as ‘…it is part of the assessment process.’ What is being assessed if the model is rife with scaling errors?Philosophers in Climate ScienceClimate Feedback critics are fixed on the notion that only ‘climate scientists’ can know anything about climate change and as critics they appear to claim some superior knowledge themselves.  Climate Feedback critics are critical of the inclusion of philosophers, despite the fact that the IPCC itself has two ‘moral’ philosophers – and look what this one has to say: “To fight climate change, the IPCC finds it necessary to hold meetings in remote corners of the world.” The IPCC philosopher seems to think that buying offsets will mitigate impacts of fossil fuel use. We will let readers draw their own conclusions about this unscientific theory and whether public funds should finance travel junkets and make carbon traders rich on your tax dollars http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/Philosopher%20at%20the%20IPCC.pdf Institutionalizing Climate LysenkoismSadly, Climate Feedback and Poynter Institute (which has certified Climate Feedback as an ‘accurate’ fact checking organization) are institutionalizing Climate Lysenkoism through group think and denigration of this cadre of 500 excellent scholars and professionals, many of whom have been awarded their nations’ highest honors for science and public policy work. This type of bullying and harassment is contrary to Poynter’s own core values:FairnessWe strive to act justly, to respect people and their privacy, to present different points of view and to minimize harm. (emphasis added)Expected BehaviorFirst and foremost, treat everyone with respectUnacceptable BehaviorUnacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, intimidating, threatening, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, demeaning or disorderly conduct;  EU Climate Declaration French Ambassador, Benoit Rittaud, gave a presentation on the Lysenkoism theme at the Porto Conference. Earth is in the Meghalayan, Not the Anthropocene In July of 2018, the International Union of Geological Sciences issued a statement concerning the latest stratigraphic designation – stating that we are in the Meghalayan stage of the Holocene.  Many had been expecting that the Anthropocene would be announced as confirmation that humans have greater influence on climate change than nature.The people most qualified to comment on earth’s climate are geologists, yet curiously they are left out of the IPCC list of scientists.  While one Climate Feedback critic decries the lack of biologists and women in the EU Climate Declaration, Roger Higgs has reviewed the IPCC AR6 list of experts and finds:IPCC’s next report, AR6, supposedly “will update our knowledge on climate change, its impacts and risks, and possible response options, and play an important role in implementing the Paris Agreement” said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. The selected “author teams, drawn from the hundreds of excellent nominations the IPCC was fortunate to receive, provide us with the necessary expertise across a range of disciplines to conduct the assessment” … but in truth …the author statistics (below) show that the “necessary expertise” is lacking, as geologists are again excluded, rendering the collective authorship incompetent for their stated mission of reviewing the literature to assess climate change. By this omission, IPCC ignores Earth’s history and the copious geological evidence, latterly backed by archaeology, that sea level (barometer of global temperature, via ocean-water expansion & polar ice melt) undergoes a rapid (100-500 year) & large (1-3 metres) oscillation every 500-2000 years, caused by volcanism and solar fluctuations, certainly not by industrial CO2.AR6 author statistics:Working Group I (WGI), ‘The Physical Science Basis’, 232 authors, including meteorologists, oceanographers, climate scientists, glaciologists, physicists, geographers and computer modellers, but no geologists.WGII, ‘Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, 323 authors, no geologists.WGIII, Mitigation of Climate Change, 229 authors, no geologists. Grand total 784authors, no geologists.Exemplifying IPCC’s chronic lack of impartiality (see my Technical Note 2018-2), one WGI author’s new (2018) book, ‘Sunburnt Country’, aims to convince the public that man is making Australia hotter; another’s frequent mainstream-media articles likewise aim to scare people into accepting that manmade warming is fact, not mere belief, and he criticizes Trump.IPCC’s Lee again, in true UN egalitarian style: “Of the selected experts, 44% come from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, 53% are new to the IPCC process and 33% are women.” How lovely: no geologists, but at least we have politically correct quotas of women, third worlders and youngsters! Worse: the 53% “new” people are doubtless nearly all younger than 50, i.e. indoctrinated through school and university with the ‘CO2 = pollutant’ fallacy.Be appalled that this biased, underskilled, political organization, having judged the imperceptible & geologically trivial 1°C of warming since 1900 (not a provably unprecedented rate) to be manmade, despite copious evidence of CO2’s innocence (Technical Note 2019-11), has unleashed multi-trillion-dollar expenditure, relentlessly raising your family’s taxes and energy bills, and destined to cripple the global economy and downgrade human living standards.In ClosingClimate Feedback and Poynter Institute do a disservice to open, civil debate on climate and energy policies and both appear to be agenda driven, while claiming to be fair, objective and fact-based.It is unfortunate that these flawed organizations are highly influential on media and social media outlets, with the behemoth Facebook relying on the Climate Feedback faulty claims as a rationale for blocking the distribution of the European Climate Declaration.This is contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and contrary to scientific principles.Science is about inquiry, not compliance.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)",2020-12-19T17:03:49.802616Z,1

 _John Rofe is an experienced Fraud Investigator._



As Albert Einstein said, “ _There are only two things that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And I am not sure about the universe.”_ Those of us who can’t distinguish between ignorance, delusion and fraud are likely to be called “stupid”. We know that James Shaw and Jacinda Ardern are not stupid so is their behaviour with regard to climate change ignorant, delusional or fraudulent? 



Google the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere and the first answer one gets is…



“ ** _Nitrogen_** ___accounts for 78% of the atmosphere, **oxygen** 21% and **argon** 0.9%. Gases like **carbon dioxide** , nitrous oxides, methane, and ozone are trace gases that account for about a tenth of one percent of the atmosphere._”



This is of course wrong, but is the error due to ignorance, delusion or fraud? The source, one of many aligning their view of reality to that of the United Nations, had conveniently dropped the dominant involvement of water vapour from inclusion in the atmosphere, in the same way as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (“UN IPCC”) had in their 2013 report AR5. 



The truth is that water vapour is always present, but its atmospheric concentration varies so dramatically, so quickly, from time to time and place to place. Water vapour and clouds are the nemesis of the UN IPCC. As the pragmatic Anne, The Princess Royal, once said, _“Climate changes all the time. It has done so throughout the globe’s history, so there’s nothing new under the sun.”_



Google the question, “What are the greenhouse gases?”and you get:



“ _Greenhouse gases include **water vapour** , **carbon dioxide** , **methane** , **nitrous oxide** , **ozone** and some artificial chemicals such as **chlorofluorocarbons** (CFCs). The absorbed energy warms the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth_.”



This definition was from the Australian Department of Agriculture, Land, Water and the Environment. They confirm that these gases all have utility: 



_“_ _The absorbed_ (solar) _energy warms the atmosphere and the surface of the Earth. This process maintains the Earth’s temperature at around 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it would otherwise be, allowing life on Earth to exist.”_



The three key compounds that differentiate our Earth from all other known planets are water in abundance, oxygen and carbon dioxide (let’s call it CO2). __



The UN IPCC says human emissions of CO 2 threaten our species and Greta Thunberg says that it has “stolen” her childhood but they are just trouble-makers hyping up the fraud to frighten us all – for their own ends.



The beginning of life on this planet can only be reliably traced back to 540 million years ago to the Cambrian Period when complex carbon-based life forms developed. At that time they benefitted from the 22oC average global atmospheric temperature (7 degrees above today’s “unprecedented” high temperatures) and the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 0.7% (17 times today’s level). But since that time there has never been runaway warming, nor has there been any evidence that a change in atmospheric CO2 has ever influenced climate change. That remains true today.



We are all complex carbon-based life forms, so while plants inhale air to get their CO2 to perform photosynthesis and exhale oxygen, and animals either eat plants or other animals, we humans eat both plants and animals (some that also eat plants). All animal life on earth ingests so much carbon that it builds up in the bloodstream. It is removed when we inhale oxygen and we exhale the carbon as CO2. The exhaled air contains 4% CO2 (or about 40,000 parts per million) and about 5% water vapour. So each adult human adds about 360 kgs of CO2 to earth’s atmosphere every year.



The present atmospheric level of CO2 is 0.041%. It has risen from 0.028% in 1850AD. So let’s review the history and significance of this atmospheric gas concentration in parts per million.



It used to be 7,000parts per million at the “beginning”, but it dropped to 180parts per million 12,000 years ago (at the end of the last full ice age). It grew to 280parts per million by 1850AD, and now thanks partly to us, it has grown to 415 parts per million. Yet James Shaw claims this is “unprecedented”. 



Why don’t we reduce CO2 emissions to zero as James Shaw and Jacinda Ardern demand (and as per the new Zero Carbon law)? **At or below 150 parts per million (or 0.015% if you like) all plants will die off and thus starve the ruminants, and then the birds and bees, right up to the time we too become extinct. So not clever.**



There is an obvious environmental benefit from increasing levels of atmospheric CO2. At up to five times the level of today, plant life will prosper, become more drought-tolerant and the world is – and will continue to get – greener with more abundant vegetation. That is both observed and proven.



What about the climate? Anthropogenic Global Warming theory, which was promulgated before we got satellite data doesn’t stack up well against proven laws of physics like the Beer-Lambert Law, which demonstrates that the radiative effect of CO2 was substantially saturated at the pre-industrial level of 0.028%. Also, water vapour and clouds actually dominate the radiative influence of all greenhouse gases by both potency and volume. Water vapour is about 96% of all greenhouse gases.



Water in the form of vapour or cloud droplets floats above our heads within Earth’s atmosphere, weighing roughly 15-20 trillion tonnes and this is enhanced by about 420 trillion tonnes per year due to evaporation and sublimation and yet reduced by precipitation as water, snow or ice. There are also 28 non-radiative effects that water vapour exerts that make it the sine qua non of all forces ameliorating the various natural and man-made impacts on Earth’s atmosphere to provide **dynamic climate equilibrium.** I quote Auckland’s Emeritus Professor Geoffrey Duffy FRSNZ as follows:



 ** _“_** ** _The unique and powerful phase-change capability of water together with the radiation superiority of water vapour, make water vapour self-buffering, self-regulating, self-correcting, and self-compensating even when the atmospheric changes are minute.”_**



The word best describing the true impact of human “carbon Emissions” on Earth’s climate is “piffling”. 



In New Zealand, the level of atmospheric water vapour is about 1%. This means it is 25 times as abundant here as CO2 but the volume and potency of methane and nitrous oxide is much less still and the potency of those last two trace gases is negligible. They are irrelevant in any sensible climate discussions.



In February 2020 I made a set of random observations to see how it could be that water vapour had such a massive effect on climate change over short periods when the UN IPCC saw fit to exclude it from their 2013 Report AR5 about the efficacy of greenhouse gases. 



I found that a major reason why the climate of Napier has higher maximum daytime temperatures and higher overnight heat losses than New Plymouth is due to a marked difference in the usual humidity levels. To show how large the diurnal range of humidity can be, Twizel’s fell on 21st February from 1.018% in the early afternoon to 0.667% 14 hrs later. The averages for cloud cover aren’t available for comparison, so the annual rainfall for seven towns was instead compared with the average diurnal temperature range for each, over a four-month period. This confirmed that the maximum, minimum and the average diurnal range of temperature for each town over the short, medium and long term, is substantially determined by water vapour, clouds and rain.



As an experienced fraud investigator and having completed this investigation,I was able to match the physical observations of causation for climate differences between New Zealand cities with the expert and empirical scientific evidence that I now hold. This shows the fraud is here and that it is officially sanctioned.



Having concluded that omission and deception are being employed, I laid a fraud complaint with the “proper authorities”, the NZ Serious Fraud Office, The Secretary for Justice and the NZ Police…for…



 **”** **wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain”** ****



Everyone is aware of the frighteners put on us to advance the conspiracy, yet most people are ignorant and many seem deluded. However, after 30 years of fraud most NZ institutions are corrupted in some way. So the next Government must repeal the “Zero Carbon Act”, bring all carbon trading projects to an end, and our National Airline refund all monies taken under false pretences, so travellers could buy carbon credits.



This fraud leaves a lot of complicit people from our PM and Minister down, to be held to account. So check your own status and exposure. Did you promote any of these three basic lies below?



None of those three is true. So if you have promoted these, you have some personal changes to make.



This deception of the public has been and still is only possible for the following reasons:

Sea level oscillations in Japan and China since the start of
the 20th century and consequences for coastal management
“Regionally, the sea levels in the PRD [Pearl River Delta, China] region and Japan show no significant acceleration from 1900 to present, but only oscillations. This result is consistent with the other coastal area of the world where long-term tide gauges are located. Policy making, and management, should therefore focus on adaptive measures linked to the monitoring by tide gauges and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) of relative sea level rise and land subsidence. Extreme sea level rise warnings based on predictions by never validated models, or speculations, that are defocusing coastal management from every other relevant situation, should be discharged.”
“[T]he long-term tide gauges of the world show no significant sign of sea level acceleration since the start of the 20th century.”
“Ocean and coastal management in the area should be based on the accurate monitoring of the relative sea level rise and the subsidence of the land by coupled tide gauge and Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, rather than models’ predictions and speculations defocusing coastal management from more relevant situations than the non-existent threat of extreme sea level rise.”

1. Permafrost is still present today in a region that was permafrost-free throughout the Holocene (until the onset of the Little Ice Age)
According to data from a new study (Sannel et al., 2018), subarctic Northern Sweden has yet to rise out of the range of frigid, permafrost-friendly temperatures coeval with of the Little Ice Age (roughly 1400 to 1900 AD).
Permafrost still exists today in regions where there was no recorded permafrost during nearly all of the Holocene, when temperatures were too warm (3°C higher than today) for permafrost to form.
“Throughout most of the Holocene, these northern peatlands have not experienced climatic conditions cold enough for permafrost to form.”
These findings strongly suggest that modern warmth is nothing unusual, unprecedented, or even remarkable.  In fact, it may be said that today’s subarctic warmth may only be slightly warmer than the coldest centennial-scale period — the Little Ice Age — of the last 10,000 years.

Sannel et al., 2018
“At all these sites the datings together with the results of the plant macrofossil analyses suggest that permafrost aggradation took place around 600–100 cal. a BP [the Little Ice Age]. … [A]t these sites there are no indications of permafrost inception prior to the Little Ice Age. … Warmer conditions during recent decades have resulted in extensive permafrost degradation in Fennoscandian palsas and peat plateaus (Sollid& Sørbel 1998; Zuidhoff& Kolstrup 2000; Luoto & Seppala 2003; Sannel & Kuhry 2011; Borge et al. 2017).”
“At present the permafrost is close to thawing with mean annual ground temperatures just below 0°C (Christiansen et al. 2010; Johansson et al. 2011; Sannel et al. 2016).”
“Throughout most of the Holocene, these northern peatlands have not experienced climatic conditions cold enough for permafrost to form.”
“During peatland initiation (c. 10 000–9600 cal. a BP) the climatic conditions in the region were favourable for plant productivity with around 3 °C warmer summer temperatures compared to today (Kullman & Oberg 2015), resulting in relatively rapid peat and net carbon accumulation rates during the early Holocene.”

2.  Italian Alps tree lines ~460 meters higher than present indicate surface temperatures were 3.1°C warmer during the Mid-Holocene
The modern forest line position in an Italian Alps study area (Badino et al., 2018) is 2,360 meters above sea level (m asl).
Per the data indicated in the graph below, the forest line position averaged between 2,750 to 2,900 m asl during 7400 to 3600 cal yrs BP — about 460 m higher than today’s forest line.
With a temperature lapse rate of 0.67°C/100 m for the region documented in the paper, this indicates temperatures were about 3.1°C warmer than today [4.6 X 0.67°C] during the Mid-Holocene.

Badino et al., 2018
“Between 7400 and 3600 yrs cal BP, an higher-than-today [~2820 m asl vs. 2360 m asl today] forest line position persisted under favorable growing conditions (i.e. TJuly at ca. 12 °C).”
“Between ca. 8.4-4 ka cal BP, our site [Italian Alps] experienced a mean TJuly of ca. 12.4 °C, i.e. 3.1 °C warmer than today.”
“[O]ur lapse rate (0.67°C/100 m), [is] slightly steeper than the average of 0.6°C for temperate regions (Barry and Chorley, 1992) was provided at higher spatial resolution.”

3. The Pyrenees (Spain) timber line exceeded today’s uppermost limit by 300-400 meters ~4,500 years ago, indicating Mid-Holocene surface temperatures were about 2°C higher
The temperature lapse rate for the Pyrenees region is 0.517°C/100 m according to a newly published paper.
“Estimation of near‐surface air temperature lapse rates over continental Spain and its mountain areas … The median NSLR [near‐surface (i.e., non‐free atmosphere) air temperature lapse rates] … Pyrenees −5.17 °C/km“  (Navarro-Serrano et al., 2018)
Leunda et al. (2018) have published a study that shows the Mid-Holocene (about 4,500 years ago) Pyrenees timber line was 300-400 meters higher than today’s uppermost limit.
This would suggest that Pyrenees temperatures were about 1.6 to 2.1°C warmer [3.5 X 0.517°C] than today during 4,650-4,200 calendar years before present.

Leunda et al., 2018
“The tree line ecotone was located at the cave altitude from 5,700 to 4,650 cal year bp, when vegetation consisted of open Pinus uncinata Ramond ex DC and Betula spp. Woodlands and timberline were very close to the site. Subsequently, tree line slightly raised and timberline reached the ice cave altitude, exceeding its today’s uppermost limit by c. 300–400 m during more than four centuries (4,650 and 4,200 cal year bp) at the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum.”

4. Tree remnants found northern Sweden mountain sites 600 to 700 meters atop where the 21st century tree line ends imply the Early Holocene (9500 years ago) was 3-4°C warmer than today
The temperature lapse rate for the Swedish Lapland region is 0.6°C/100 m.
Kullman (2018) found tree debris (trunks, cones, roots, etc.) 600 to 700 meters atop modern tree line positions that were dated to about 9,500 years ago.  Accounting for glacio-isostatic uplift, this tree line elevation implies surface air temperatures were 3.6°C higher than today during the Early Holocene.

Kullman, 2018
“The present paper reports results from an extensive project aiming at improved understanding of postglacial subalpine/alpine vegetation, treeline, glacier and climate history in the Scandes of northern Sweden. The main methodology is analyses of mega fossil tree remnants, i.e. trunks, roots and cones, recently exposed at the fringe of receding glaciers and snow/ice patches. This approach has a spatial resolution and accuracy, which exceeds any other option for tree cover reconstruction in high-altitude mountain landscapes.”
“All recovered tree specimens originate from exceptionally high elevations, about 600-700 m atop of modern treeline positions.”
“Conservatively drawing on the latter figure and a summer temperature lapse rate of 0.6 °C per 100 m elevation (Laaksonen 1976), could a priori mean that, summer temperatures were at least 4.2 °C warmer than present around 9500 year before present. However, glacio-isostatic land uplift by at least 100 m since that time (Möller 1987; Påsse & Anderson 2005)implies that this figure has to be reduced to 3.6 °C higher than present-day levels, i.e. first decades of the 21st century. Evidently, this was the warmth peak of the Holocene, hitherto. This inference concurs with paleoclimatic reconstructions from Europe and Greenland (Korhola et al. 2002; Bigler et al. 2003; Paus 2013; Luoto et al. 2014; Väliranta et al. 2015).”

1. Permafrost is still present today in a region that was permafrost-free throughout the Holocene (until the onset of the Little Ice Age)
According to data from a new study (Sannel et al., 2018), subarctic Northern Sweden has yet to rise out of the range of frigid, permafrost-friendly temperatures coeval with of the Little Ice Age (roughly 1400 to 1900 AD).
Permafrost still exists today in regions where there was no recorded permafrost during nearly all of the Holocene, when temperatures were too warm (3°C higher than today) for permafrost to form.
“Throughout most of the Holocene, these northern peatlands have not experienced climatic conditions cold enough for permafrost to form.”
These findings strongly suggest that modern warmth is nothing unusual, unprecedented, or even remarkable.  In fact, it may be said that today’s subarctic warmth may only be slightly warmer than the coldest centennial-scale period — the Little Ice Age — of the last 10,000 years.

Sannel et al., 2018
“At all these sites the datings together with the results of the plant macrofossil analyses suggest that permafrost aggradation took place around 600–100 cal. a BP [the Little Ice Age]. … [A]t these sites there are no indications of permafrost inception prior to the Little Ice Age. … Warmer conditions during recent decades have resulted in extensive permafrost degradation in Fennoscandian palsas and peat plateaus (Sollid& Sørbel 1998; Zuidhoff& Kolstrup 2000; Luoto & Seppala 2003; Sannel & Kuhry 2011; Borge et al. 2017).”
“At present the permafrost is close to thawing with mean annual ground temperatures just below 0°C (Christiansen et al. 2010; Johansson et al. 2011; Sannel et al. 2016).”
“Throughout most of the Holocene, these northern peatlands have not experienced climatic conditions cold enough for permafrost to form.”
“During peatland initiation (c. 10 000–9600 cal. a BP) the climatic conditions in the region were favourable for plant productivity with around 3 °C warmer summer temperatures compared to today (Kullman & Oberg 2015), resulting in relatively rapid peat and net carbon accumulation rates during the early Holocene.”

2.  Italian Alps tree lines ~460 meters higher than present indicate surface temperatures were 3.1°C warmer during the Mid-Holocene
The modern forest line position in an Italian Alps study area (Badino et al., 2018) is 2,360 meters above sea level (m asl).
Per the data indicated in the graph below, the forest line position averaged between 2,750 to 2,900 m asl during 7400 to 3600 cal yrs BP — about 460 m higher than today’s forest line.
With a temperature lapse rate of 0.67°C/100 m for the region documented in the paper, this indicates temperatures were about 3.1°C warmer than today [4.6 X 0.67°C] during the Mid-Holocene.

Badino et al., 2018
“Between 7400 and 3600 yrs cal BP, an higher-than-today [~2820 m asl vs. 2360 m asl today] forest line position persisted under favorable growing conditions (i.e. TJuly at ca. 12 °C).”
“Between ca. 8.4-4 ka cal BP, our site [Italian Alps] experienced a mean TJuly of ca. 12.4 °C, i.e. 3.1 °C warmer than today.”
“[O]ur lapse rate (0.67°C/100 m), [is] slightly steeper than the average of 0.6°C for temperate regions (Barry and Chorley, 1992) was provided at higher spatial resolution.”

3. The Pyrenees (Spain) timber line exceeded today’s uppermost limit by 300-400 meters ~4,500 years ago, indicating Mid-Holocene surface temperatures were about 2°C higher
The temperature lapse rate for the Pyrenees region is 0.517°C/100 m according to a newly published paper.
“Estimation of near‐surface air temperature lapse rates over continental Spain and its mountain areas … The median NSLR [near‐surface (i.e., non‐free atmosphere) air temperature lapse rates] … Pyrenees −5.17 °C/km“  (Navarro-Serrano et al., 2018)
Leunda et al. (2018) have published a study that shows the Mid-Holocene (about 4,500 years ago) Pyrenees timber line was 300-400 meters higher than today’s uppermost limit.
This would suggest that Pyrenees temperatures were about 1.6 to 2.1°C warmer [3.5 X 0.517°C] than today during 4,650-4,200 calendar years before present.

Leunda et al., 2018
“The tree line ecotone was located at the cave altitude from 5,700 to 4,650 cal year bp, when vegetation consisted of open Pinus uncinata Ramond ex DC and Betula spp. Woodlands and timberline were very close to the site. Subsequently, tree line slightly raised and timberline reached the ice cave altitude, exceeding its today’s uppermost limit by c. 300–400 m during more than four centuries (4,650 and 4,200 cal year bp) at the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum.”

On Wednesday, Beyond Meat started selling its plant-based food in China through thousands of Starbucks cafes.
Fast-food chain KFC said it will also start trialling fake chicken nuggets from next week.
As China recovers from the coronavirus outbreak, more people are looking to lead healthier lifestyles.
US-based Beyond Meat said it had ""seen the growing demand for plant-based meat in China"" and is offering three meals across 3,300 Starbucks in China. The majority of Starbucks outlets in the country have now re-opened, having been forced to close in late January.
This week, KFC said it will start selling plant-based fried chicken for the first time in China for a trial period in Shanghai and the southern cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
Western brands are hoping to tap into a growing demand for meat substitutes in China following a global trend to eat less meat and more plant-based foods.
China is also dealing with a meat shortage, particularly pork supplies, after African swine fever wiped out half of its hog herd in 2018. It has been struggling to import pork due to virus restrictions on factories across the world.
""We see Asia as a key region for strategic long-term growth and Beyond Meat's goal is to have localized production within Asia by the end of 2020,"" said a Beyond Meat spokesman. Its products are currently distributed in several countries across Asia including Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.
But the likes of Starbucks, KFC and Beyond Meat face challenges convincing Chinese consumers to eat their plant-based fake meats.
""The demand for healthier, non-meat proteins is not as high in China as in the US because Chinese already eat more vegetables as part of their daily diet than Americans and Europeans. It's relatively rare for Chinese to say they are vegetarians,"" said Shaun Rein at the China Market Research Group.

Professor Malberg starts his article by showing and discussing various solar activity charts. Today I’m a little short on time, and so I’ve translated his outlook and conclusion part of the article, which sums it up nicely.

Outlook
The sun is currently at the start of a quiet phase of activity and will likely reach the critical mean value of 50 sunspots during the current cycle, or even fall below it, i.e. the boundary value between a warm and a cold period. Analogous to the climate conditions during the time of the Dalton Minimum of 200 years ago, we have to expect a climate cooling for the decades ahead.
Only the “fickle“ sun will decide the general extent of the expected cooling and when the temperature again will gradually start to increase. The latter is expected to occur in the second half of the 21st century, when the sun returns to a more active phase.
Both the 200-year De Vries cycle and the 80 to 90-year Gleissberg solar activity cycle point to an imminent drop in solar activity that will have consequences for global climate and food supply.

Russian scientist I. Abdussamatov of the Russian Pulkovo Observatory near St. Petersburg (www.eike.eu) has reached the same conclusion. Also according to his results, the solar minimum – which corresponds to the peak in cooling – is expected to be reached during the solar sunspot cycle around the year 2055.
CO2 will neither be able to keep Europe nor the globe from cooling. At most it will help temper the temperature decrease a bit.
Global temperature has not risen in 15 years. It has stagnated, and in recent years has even shown a downward trend – despite the massive annual increases in CO2 emissions. (Why hasn’t the public been informed of this by the media?) For the politically motivated IPCC and its followers, it is now time to give up the dogma of CO2’s climate dominance and the marginalization and branding of those who differ with climate science. Just because one belongs to the mainstream does not mean he automatically has a better knowledge of the science.
Predicting a global warming of 4°C and associated apocalyptic consequences by 2100 by the CO2-dominated climate models (World Bank, PIK) is pure hypothesizing. As long as the solar effects and associated interactions are underestimated and the effects of CO2 exaggerated, no realistic climate conclusions can be expected.
The earlier analyses of climate allow only one conclusion to be made:
Compared to the integral solar climate effect, with all its complex, non-linear interactive mechanisms (ocean, clouds, albedo, biosphere, cosmic rays,…), the anthropogenic greenhouse/CO2 effect is only of subordinate significance. Also the media attempts to trace back singular weather events to an anthropogenic influence has no merit. History shows that hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, droughts and floods have occurred on and off over the centuries as a result of synoptic constellations. However, because of the population growth to 7 billion, more and more people and their goods are being impacted by natural catastrophes.
Instead of attempting over-rated and ineffective climate protection, all efforts should concentrate on global environmental protection: clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil and an intact ecosystem are among the fundamental rights of people. Measures for reducing CO2 can be justified by the limited fossil fuel resources and pollution that comes from combustion processes. So-called climate protection is, on the other hand, the least effective of all measures. There never has been a stable climate over the course of history, and there isn’t going to be one in the future.”

,2020-12-22T13:09:27.946451Z,424,120,352,"KANSAS CITY, Mo.  —   The most important play in football as far as the Kansas City Chiefs are concerned is not a long gain on first down or a defensive stop on   . It is the punt, the humble   and anyone who rebuts this point with Dave Toub does so at his own peril. Toub is the team’s   coordinator, the mastermind behind an elite unit, one that has fueled the Chiefs’ rise to A. F. C. contender and also his own candidacy for head coaching openings. But before Toub directed a group that has dominated field position and returned nine kickoffs or punts for touchdowns during his four seasons in Kansas City, he was a   novice. His first job in that area came during his first season as an N. F. L. coach  —   in 2001, when his current boss, Andy Reid, hired him as a   assistant to the   coordinator John Harbaugh in Philadelphia. Early conversations with Harbaugh, now a Super   coach in Baltimore, inculcated the magnitude of the punt. Toub, who was the Chicago Bears’   coordinator for nine seasons after leaving Philadelphia, considers the punt an offensive play, and no other offensive play registers the same consistent impact. It averages more than 40 yards. It flips field position. It determines outcomes. “My philosophy is if you punt well, cover well and play good defense, you’ll be in every game,” Toub said in an interview last week. The Chiefs, who play the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night in the playoffs, applied that philosophy en route to going   their best record since 2003, and winning the A. F. C. West for the first time in six seasons. Toub stresses it to newcomers and stalwarts alike, in meeting rooms and on the practice field, until they, too, understand. Twice in Toub’s four seasons, according to data compiled by Football Outsiders, Kansas City has had the best average field position in the N. F. L. “It’s why the best   players are on punt,” said one of them, the rookie defensive back Eric Murray. It is also why every   period at practice begins with punting. Murray and his cohorts allowed the   yards per return. The punter, Dustin Colquitt, pooched the   kicks inside the   line. The Chiefs’ opponents have the   average field position. For good measure, the Chiefs’ punt return unit, led by the rookie speedster Tyreek Hill, produced two touchdowns and the most yards per return. What powers Kansas City’s special teams, rated by Football Outsiders as the   unit in the N. F. L. after the Eagles’ is equal parts talent, scheme and trust. It begins with the confidence Reid has in Toub, 54, his friend for more than 30 years. It enables Toub, with almost the entire roster at his disposal, to make decisions with conviction. “I wouldn’t say that other ones in the past have looked over their shoulder like, ‘Is this O. K.?’” said Colquitt, in his 12th season punting for the Chiefs. “But Andy trusts him with the whole deal  —   this is your thing, put your spin on it. He wants to see the Dave Toub side of this play. ” The Toub side manifests itself in subtleties, such as an obsessive emphasis on    blocking, but also in more audacious moments, such as the fake punt he designed (and called) to perfection in a Week 13 victory in Atlanta or what his former boss in Chicago, Lovie Smith, said would have been “one of the greatest plays of all time” had a penalty not foiled a misdirection masterpiece for a touchdown that bewildered the Green Bay Packers in 2011. “Sometimes you can hit it just right with the personnel in one place,” said Smith, who hired Toub in 2004. “But what Dave’s done is unique. He’s done it twice. Look at what his special teams do. ” It was Smith who instilled the attitude that the Bears would win because of their special teams, and with 22 touchdowns on kickoff or punt returns (and only three allowed) during Toub’s tenure, they often did. Special teams are thriving again with Kansas City because the Chiefs prioritize them during the   when they evaluate players, and during the season, when critical practice time is devoted. On Tuesdays after games,   players eagerly await a packet containing grades in multiple categories. They receive points for things like drawing penalties, tackling ball carriers and being the first player downfield on a kickoff. They are docked points for things like missing tackles, committing penalties and not hustling. Toub and his assistant, Brock Olivo, the first recipient of the college   player of the year award in 1997, also assign grades to 350 potential draft picks. They value two qualities above all: instincts and speed. “If you have that combination, you know you’ve got a guy,” Toub said. “The floor is going to be at least a good   player. ” If a prospect does not play special teams, Toub and Olivo review his offensive or defensive film and project possible roles. If two receivers or defensive backs are perceived as similar, Toub said, the   mark breaks the tie. Sometimes the next contributor is obvious from the outset, as it was with Murray, who excelled on special teams at Minnesota. Toub loved Murray’s toughness and intelligence, traits that have served him well with the Chiefs, who depend on him both to make blocks and shed them. His aptitude landed him on Pro Football Focus’s   first team. “A lot of times, we match up against people who weigh 250, 260,” said Murray, listed at 5 feet 11 and 199 pounds, “but even though we’re smaller, Dave always says to punch them in the mouth. We’re relentless. ” The constant churn at the bottom of the roster can destroy   continuity, but the Chiefs’ unit has maintained a strong core  —   Frank Zombo, Anthony Sherman and Daniel Sorenson have played the last three seasons, for instance  —   supplemented by eager young players who volunteer for assignments. Recent drafts have netted D. J. Alexander, De’Anthony Thomas, Demarcus Robinson and Hill, who has returned three kicks (two punts, one kickoff) for touchdowns. Toub called Hill the fastest player he has ever coached  —   faster even than Devin Hester, regarded as one of the best returners ever. Toub has been fortunate to be able to deploy Hill (and Hester) but he specifically tells his charges not to expect Hill to depend solely on his physical gifts. “He knows it’s not like a video game, that Tyreek’s not going to make everybody miss,” Colquitt said. “When you go back and look and see how he got to the end zone, it’s because 10 guys are dedicated to blocking for him, doing exactly what was drawn up during the week. ” Thirty years ago, those organizational skills appealed to   Paso Coach Bob Stull, who gave Toub, a     offensive lineman at the university, his first   coaching job in strength and conditioning. Unlike many of his peers in that era, Stull said, Toub maintained records of his players’ progress in major lifts, first at UTEP and then at Missouri. It was there, in 1998, where he shifted to coaching football, after the sudden death of Missouri’s defensive line coach. And it was also there, Stull said, where Toub, a gifted carpenter, built a home and started renovating others. Decades later, Toub remains a meticulous craftsman. He just found another outlet.",2020-12-22T13:09:27.946483Z,1

From Tuesday most foreign nationals, including from the European Union, who want to work in the UK from 1 January will have to apply online for a visa.
Those seeking a skilled worker visa will need a job offer, to be proficient in English and earn at least Â£25,600.
Free movement from and to the EU will come to an end on 31 December.
The UK left the EU on 31 January but has been largely following its rules during the subsequent 11-month transition period, as the two sides try to reach agreement over a trade deal.
As talks continue in London, the UK is stepping up its preparations for leaving the EU's single market and customs union at the end of the year.
The government has announced it is setting up a new Border Operations Centre, which it says will ensure round-the-clock surveillance of goods and passengers coming in and out of British ports for the first time.
What happens next with Brexit?
It will use Â£20m software produced by the US tech firm Palantir, which gathers information from different government computers, in the hope of minimising the amount of ""short-term"" disruption at the border in the days and weeks after 1 January.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the new system would enable the authorities to identify and get on top of bottlenecks ""quickly and decisively"".
Business groups have said delays at the border are inevitable given the looming changes to customs procedures while Labour said ""glaring questions"" remained unanswered about what businesses needed to do.
""The government is putting the burden on businesses to prepare for the end of the transition period when it has not explained what it is those businesses are getting ready for,"" said shadow minister Rachel Reeves.
""The government is re-badging a basic element of preparation but still can't tell us how many customs agents are recruited or trained or whether crucial IT is ready.""
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove said: ""A lot of what businesses need to do is the same whether or not we get a free trade agreement or not.
""There's no harm in doing these things because they'll be necessary come what may.""
To tackle what the Cabinet Office calls the ""challenges"" of potential disruption at the UK border next year, a Border Operations Centre will use big data technology to try to ""identify the root causes"" of hold-ups to passengers and freight.
The software system is produced by the controversial US tech firm Palantir and will pull together information from different government computers to monitor the flow of people and vehicles across the UK border.
Palantir has courted controversy in the United States, where its systems are used by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
This has led the human rights organisation Amnesty International to warn of ""a high risk that Palantir is contributing to serious human rights violations of migrants and asylum-seekers"".
The company denies the suggestion and says it remains extremely concerned about protecting human rights, privacy rights, and civil liberties in general.
The UK government has stressed that Palantir will only process data in Britain and that strict measures are in place to protect personal information.
The UK's new immigration system will determine who can work in the country from 1 January.
Online applications for visas via a range of new ""routes"" will open on Tuesday.
Applications for skilled worker visas will be judged on the basis of a points system, which is modelled on the system in place in Australia for many years.
Points will be awarded for a job offer at the appropriate skill level in an eligible occupation, knowledge of English and whether applicants meet a salary threshold - which will typically be at least Â£25,600.
The cost of applying will be between Â£610 to Â£1,408 and people will have to show they have enough money to support themselves as well as having proof of identity.
Applicants will have to wait about three weeks to find out whether they have been successful.
EU citizens already living in the UK by 31 December and their families do not have to go through the new system but instead can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, and have until 30 June 2021 to do so.
If they are successful, they will be able to remain in the UK and claim the same benefits as UK citizens if they become unemployed.
Irish citizens do not need to apply to the scheme and will not require permission to come to the UK, as the UK and Ireland are both part of a Common Travel Area.
Different rules apply to workers from outside the EU, and EU migrants arriving after the end of the transition period. Those who lose their job will have to return to their home country, unless they have indefinite leave to remain.
The Home Office rules about which workers can remain in the UK after losing a job are complex but can be read here.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said the system would be ""simple, effective and flexible"" and enable employers to fill skills gaps while also placing a greater onus on firms to train and invest in British workers.
Ms Patel and other critics of free movement have long argued it has left British firms overly reliant on low-skilled workers from the continent and put applicants from the rest of the rest of the world at a disadvantage.
But unions have warned of a looming crisis over the recruitment of social care staff under the new rules and says action is also needed to support those foreign-born NHS workers whose visas are expiring.
Applications also opened on Tuesday for Global Talent, Innovator and Start-Up visas designed to attract ""those who have an exceptional talent or show exceptional promise in the fields of engineering, science, tech or culture"".
New rules for international students came into force in October.
The rights of the more than three million EU citizens already working in the UK are protected under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU earlier this year.
As of 30 September, 2.1 million people had been granted settled status and 1.6 million pre-settled status - ensuring they can remain in the UK.",2020-12-19T16:23:08.077798Z,1

One minute you’re bumping along on a fairly ordinary stretch of bitumen, the next you’re gliding on air. Canberra must surely have the smoothest, best-maintained roads in all of Australia.



The public sector is no slouch at looking after itself. It should surprise not a single taxpayer that the ACT has the highest median income in Australia, by a country mile. Like so many rich people today, these public service fat cats are as addicted to virtue-signalling as they are to our money.



The last stage of South Australia’s Hornsdale wind farm comes online today. With that, the ACT, more than 1,000 kilometres away, will “officially” be powered by 100 per cent renewable electricity.



Except that that’s just another in the litany of green lies.



Only about five per cent of the territory’s electricity is generated within its borders, by a few solar farms and rooftop panels on Canberra homes.



The rest comes from the national electricity market — the grid that powers the eastern seaboard — and four-fifths of the grid’s power comes from non-renewable sources.



In other words, nearly 80% of Canberra’s electricity comes from dirty old coal and gas… and that’s on the days when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.



The “100 per cent renewable” claim is a typically deceitful green pea-and-shells game. Only watermelons can somehow spin a maximum 20% into “100%”.



The ACT funds five different wind farms around Australia to feed energy into the national grid to make up for what Canberra consumes.



Those investments, together with Canberra’s own solar, put a stop to about 40 per cent of the ACT’s carbon emissions […]the shortfall is made up by the ACT Government’s mandatory contribution to the national renewable energy target, where it buys the equivalent amount of renewable power for 21 per cent of its total consumption.



  
No matter how you spin that, it still doesn’t add up to 100%. And Canberra is **still** consuming fossil-fuel generated electricity.



As always, the climate change scam is 100% fuelled by bullshit and taxpayers’ money.

,2020-12-13T11:34:21.598875Z,427,120,1457,"Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the subcommittee:



My name is Roger Pilon. I am a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and the director of Cato’s Center for Constitutional Studies.



I want to thank Chairman Hyde of the committee and Chairman Coble of the subcommittee for their invitations to me to testify on the important issue of “Judicial Misconduct and Discipline.” These hearings have been called, I understand, because of a concern that a number of people have expressed about “judicial activism”–the practice by judges of applying to cases before them not the law but principles or values that are no part of the law. Because such a practice is thought by many to constitute judicial misconduct, some in Congress are searching for ways to discipline it.



 **I. Summary**



At the outset, let me summarize my thoughts on this subject, then discuss it in somewhat more detail. There can be no question that judicial activism, as just described, has been a problem in our legal system for some time. The power of the judiciary under our Constitution to declare the law and decide cases under that law is awesome; when abused, that power is too often beyond reach. At the same time, I believe that many of those who have complained most often about judicial activism have overstated and misstated the problem, thus distracting us from the real issue–legislative activism on the part of Congress, which leads to judicial activism.



Overstating the problem. Many of the examples of “judicial activism” that are cited turn out, when examined more closely, not to be cases in which the judge failed to apply the law but applied the law differently, or applied different law, to reach a result different than the result thought correct by the person charging activism. To be sure, there is no bright line between failing to apply the law and wrongly applying the law or applying the wrong law, but when that distinction is drawn, it turns out that there are fewer cases of true judicial activism than at first may appear.



Misstating the problem. More importantly, the problem of “judicial activism” is seriously misstated when it is cast, as it often is, as involving judges overruling the will of the people. In our legal system, judicial review often requires a judge to do just that. In such a case, were the judge to defer to the political will, exercising “judicial restraint” when the law requires active judicial intercession, that restraint would itself be a kind of activism, for it would amount to an “active” failure to apply the law in deference to democratic or majoritarian values. The judge in such circumstances would be shirking his judicial responsibilities every bit as much as if he overrode a legitimate exercise of political will in the name of other values.



Thus, as terms of art, judicial “activism” and “restraint” can be quite confusing and even misleading. What is more, they are often used in ways that camouflage the real issues. What we all want, I assume, is judges who are neither “active” nor “restrained” but “responsible”–responsible to the law. But when the law is unclear or inconsistent, judicial responsibility may be difficult to achieve–and “activism” inevitable. In the end, therefore, our substantive law may be the ultimate source of the problem before us today. That, in fact, is what I will argue shortly. Let me begin, however, with a brief overview of the complaints. [1]



 **II. The Critics of Judicial Activism**



Complaints about “judicial activism,” however formulated, can be found from our inception as a nation. In their modern form, however, they have come largely since the advent of the Warren Court and most often from political conservatives. My fellow panelist today, Professor Lino Graglia, with whom I have debated the issue more than once, has put the complaint starkly:



… the thing to know to fully understand contemporary constitutional law is that, almost without exception, the effect of rulings of unconstitutionality over the past four decades has been to enact the policy preferences of the cultural elite on the far left of the American political spectrum. [2]



“That is exactly right,” comments Judge Robert Bork in his recent best‐​seller, _Slouching Towards Gomorrah_ , “and the question is what, if anything, can be done about it.” [3] I gather that these hearings are a partial answer to that question.



The bitter confirmation battle that followed Judge Bork’s Supreme Court nomination a decade ago had a way of concentrating the issue for many, of course. Still, the issue has been in the air since the 1950s, covering subjects as various as civil rights, apportionment, federalism, speech, religion, abortion, education, criminal law and procedure, and much else. And in each case, the complaints from conservatives have been essentially the same.



Speaking before the Federalist Society’s 10th anniversary lawyers convention last November, for example, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, summarized the issue from his perspective:



What is at stake … is nothing less than our right to democratic self‐​government as opposed to … “Government by Judiciary.” For when we commission judicial activists who distort the Constitution to impose their own values, policy preferences, or visions of what is just or right, we are in effect sacrificing our ability to govern ourselves through the democratic political processes to the whims and preferences of unelected, life‐​tenured platonic guardians. [4]



Judges “must _interpret_ the law, not legislate from the bench,” Senator Hatch continued. “A judicial activist, on the left _or_ the right, is not, in my view, qualified to sit on the federal bench.” [5]



In a similar vein, little more than two months ago Senator John Ashcroft, chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the Conservative Political Action Conference at its annual meeting that it was time “to take a broader, comprehensive look at the alarming increase in activism on the court.” [6] Asking what we can do to put an end to “judicial tyranny,” Senator Ashcroft called for rejecting “judges who are willing to place private preferences above the people’s will.” [7]



Not to be outdone by the Senate, on March 11 House Majority Whip Tom DeLay told editors and reporters at the _Washington Times_ that “as part of our conservative efforts against judicial activism, we are going after judges” and are “right now” writing articles of impeachment. [8] Those sentiments were echoed two days later by Congressman Bob Barr of this subcommittee when he appeared on CNN’s “Crossfire.” Clearly, perhaps as never before, the issue of judicial activism is on the nation’s agenda. [9]



 **III. Overstating the Problem**



It is not entirely clear just what has brought the judiciary and its methods to the nation’s attention at this point in time. Cynics point to the need for something–some issue–in a drifting Republican Party: “The revolution is in the doldrums. Nobody’s got a plan; nobody’s got a direction.” [10] Others, however, have noted a rising frustration among conservatives over their relative ineffectiveness on the judicial front despite having dominated the judicial selection process since the Nixon years. [11] And still others cite a series of recent cases that have seemed to crystalize complaints about judicial activism: the district judge who stayed the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI); [12] the New York judge who suppressed evidence in a drug case, saying the police had no reason to stop the suspects; [13] the decision by the Supreme Court that the Virginia Military Institute had to become coeducational. [14]



Looked at in broad perspective, there can be no question that the drift in American law over the past 40 years and more has been in large part to the left, as that term is ordinarily understood. And a good part of that drift has resulted from court decisions. Yet by no means can all or even most of the drift be attributed to the courts. Moreover, even that part that has resulted from court decisions does not arise entirely or even primarily from “judicial activism”–not unless that idea is stretched to include every decision that conforms to some leftist political agenda.



In fact, when we look at most such decisions closely, we rarely find that the judge or justices “legislated.” To be sure, they often reach results consistent, if not with their “whims,” at least with their “values, policy preferences, or visions of what is just or right.” But those results can usually be tied to some legal anchor, even if it takes some stretch to do so.



Take the recent CCRI decision by U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson, which enjoined enforcement of the initiative shortly after it was passed by some 54 percent of California’s voters. Many critics of the judiciary immediately pointed to the decision as a blatant example of judicial activism. Judge Henderson’s opinion was a stretch, to be sure. But it was not without legal foundation, citing _Hunter v. Erickson_ , 393 U.S. 385 (1969) and _Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1,_ 458 U.S. 457 (1982). Moreover, as we know, the case has taken the normal appellate course; the decision has since been reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; [15] and plaintiffs have just filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. We are likely to learn from the Court whether the cases Judge Henderson relied upon in fact apply or are still good law. In the meantime, however, we are hard pressed to say that his decision was “lawless,” however strained it may have been.



One could review putative cases of judicial activism almost _ad infinitum_ , of course, but the fact remains that the better part of such cases do not exhibit judicial lawmaking, just better or worse judicial reasoning. It is no small irony, however, that when we do come across a genuine case of blatant judicial activism that cuts the other way, politically, many conservative critics of the judiciary are strangely silent. That was pointed out just last week, for example, by conservative constitutional scholar Bruce Fein in an op‐​ed in the _New York Times_ , citing the current controversy over the decision of an Alabama state judge to defy a long line of Supreme Court rulings on the separation of church and state “by posting a copy of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and inviting clergy to lead juries in prayer,” [16] even after a state appellate court found the practices unconstitutional.



 **IV. Misstating the Problem**



In the end, therefore, those who are concerned about judges who seem always to be leaning to the left may be better advised to look less to the judicial role in our system–to the practice of judicial review–and more to the reasoning judges employ in performing their roles and, more importantly, to the sources they employ when doing their reasoning. Bad reasoning is just that and should be called that, not called judicial “activism.” But bad law, from which so much bad reasoning proceeds, is another matter. We should hardly be surprised that judges today are thought so often to be engaged in “judicial activism” when they are called upon so often to apply law that is inconsistent, incoherent, and fairly invites them to make all manner of value judgments. In such circumstances, they can hardly be seen to be doing anything but legislate.



We come, then, to what in fact is the crux of the matter. Under our system of law, the role of the judge should be much simpler than it has come to be. The problem, however, does not go back just 40 years, as too many conservatives believe. Rather, its institutional roots are in the New Deal. And its ideological roots are in the Progressive Era, when we stopped thinking of government as a “necessary evil,” as the Founders had conceived of it, and started thinking of government as an engine of good, an instrument for solving all manner of social and economic problems. Standing in the way of carrying out that agenda, of course, was a constitution that established a government of limited, enumerated powers–a constitution that held, more or less, until the New Deal. As we all know, however, when President Roosevelt was unable to get his programs past the Court–there being no authority for them under the Constitution–he threatened to pack the Court with six additional members. Not even Congress would go along with that. Nevertheless, the Court got the message; there was the famous switch in time that saved nine; and by 1938 the Court had essentially turned the Constitution on its head, as New Deal architect Rexford Tugwell would later tell us the administration meant for it to do. [17]



In a nutshell, a document of delegated, enumerated, and thus limited powers became in short order a document of effectively unenumerated powers, limited only by rights that would thereafter be interpreted narrowly by conservatives on the Court and episodically by liberals on the Court. Both sides, in short, would come to ignore our roots in limited government, buying instead into the idea of vast majoritarian power–the only disagreement being over what rights might limit that power and in which circumstances. Indeed, we need look no further than to Judge Bork–no liberal he–to see the new vision stated–and wrongly ascribed to James Madison. The “Madisonian dilemma” that constitutional courts face, Bork tells us, is this:



[America’s] first principle is self‐​government, which means that in wide areas of life majorities are entitled to rule, if they wish, simply because they are majorities. [It’s second principle is] that there are nonetheless _some_ things majorities must not do to minorities, _some_ areas of life in which the individual must be free of majority rule. [18]



That gets the Madisonian vision exactly backward, of course. America’s first _political_ principle may indeed have been self‐​government, but its first _moral_ principle–and the reason the people instituted government at all–was individual liberty, as the Declaration of Independence makes plain for “a candid world” to see.



Indeed, we did not throw off a king only to enable a majority to do what no king would ever dare. Rather, the Founders instituted a plan whereby in “wide areas” individuals would be entitled to be free simply because they were born so entitled, while in “some” areas majorities would be entitled to rule not because they were inherently so entitled but as a practical compromise.



That gets the order right: individual liberty first; self‐​government second, as a means toward securing that liberty–with wide berths to state governments, which were later reined in by the Civil War Amendments. That is why the Constitution enumerated the powers of Congress and the executive, to limit them. And that is why the Bill of Rights concludes with the Ninth and Tenth Amendments: to make clear that Americans begin and end with their rights, enumerated and unenumerated alike, while government proceeds only with the power it is given.



The New Deal changed all that, of course, not by amending the Constitution, the proper method, but by radically reinterpreting it: in particular, by reading the General Welfare and Commerce Clauses not as shields against power, as they were meant to be, but as swords of power; then by turning the Bill of Rights into a document of “fundamental” and “nonfundamental” rights. [19] None of that was found plainly in the Constitution–to the contrary, the entire document tends plainly the other way. Rather, it was invented virtually out of whole cloth, by the New Deal Court, to make way for the New Deal’s political agenda.



Our modern problem of overweening, inconsistent, incoherent statutory law began, then, not with an activist Court–to the contrary–but with an activist Congress and executive branch, bent on expanding government power. In time, however, the problem was abetted by an activist Court–succumbing to pressure from the political branches. But as noted earlier, the Court’s “activism” was not as we think of it today–a search for rights not apparent in the Constitution. Rather, it was activism in finding rationales for power–what conservatives today call deference to the political branches.



It needs to be said again, however, that the New Deal Court’s activism was not entirely without legal foundation. The sources for the Court’s rulings were there, in the Constitution, even if it did take a high degree of creativity, to be charitable, to draw them out, and even if doing so did fly in the face, for the most part, of a century and a half of constitutional jurisprudence that went the other way.



We come, then, to the bottom line in all of this. Law, including constitutional law, is not written in immutable stone. It is to some extent malleable, of necessity, and is given life by those charged with giving it life–the judiciary. In doing their work, however, judges do not work in a vacuum. They work instead in a larger political climate. If we who shape that climate persist in believing that it is proper for government to be addressing our every problem, no matter how trivial or personal, and persist in believing that our Constitution can legitimately be read to authorize that result, then we should not be surprised that the judiciary is dragged along to play its part in the process–today, often, to try to undue the mess that legislatures make of the effort. [20]



Yes, judges today often thwart the majoritarian will–as a vestige, perhaps, of their former principal role. Just as often, however, a judge may see himself as simply a facilitator in the grand enterprise of government. We are coming to the close of what has rightly been called the century of government–more accurately, the century of failed government planning. If we are unhappy with the role the judiciary sometimes plays in this setting, it may be that we need to look first to the material we give judges to work with–the reams of statutory material we have enacted over the course of the century.



The Founders had a simpler vision in mind when they set out to craft our legal order. They left most human affairs to private ordering, not to government planning. That gives the judiciary–and Congress–relatively little to do. Is that not what critics of judicial activism want?

Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, which gave rise to the “effects test” in antidiscrimination law and to a host of affirmative action programs. But in interpreting the language of section 703 (h) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which authorizes “any professionally developed ability test” that is not “designed, intended, _or used_ to discriminate because of race” (at 433, emphasis by the Court), the Court simply drew upon the ambiguity of “used.” Congress could later have addressed that ambiguity, of course, but it did not.

But they were never going to be easy.
The UK left the EU on 31 January and entered a transition period until 31 December, with all the rules, regulations and budget payments staying the same. From the beginning of next year, though, things are going to change come what may.
The talks have been overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis, especially at the beginning when they had to take place via video link. But that's not the only reason why big disagreements remain after months of negotiations.
It's mainly a matter of substance.
If a free trade deal is agreed now, it won't be a particularly ambitious one. There hasn't been time to go for much more than a basic model.
But even with these limited aims, negotiators have hit a brick wall on some fundamental issues.
First of all, there is what is known as the level playing field. That means measures to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other.
All trade agreements have such measures, but the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, environmental regulations and, especially, state aid (financial assistance given by government to businesses).
The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following common rules.
Then there is fisheries: the EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue fishing in UK waters.
British negotiators say the UK is now an independent coastal state and it will prioritise its own boats. But if there is no agreement on access to fishing waters, the UK won't get full access to the EU market to sell its fish there.
Even though fishing makes up only a tiny part of the economy on both sides, it was a big part of the Leave campaign that won the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016.
A third area of disagreement is what is described as the governance of any future agreement. That is partly about the overall structure of any deal, but it is also about how any new agreements would be enforced and about the role of the European Court of Justice.
Another issue that remains sensitive is the way the UK proposes to implement the agreement it made with the EU before Brexit, on keeping the land border in Ireland (which is now the border between the UK and the EU) as open as it is at the moment.
The UK's Internal Market Bill, which could override parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, has added to EU concerns that the UK may not live up to all of the commitments it has already made.
So there are plenty of issues to resolve and it normally takes years to do a trade deal. But this process only has a matter of weeks left.
If there is no trade agreement finalised by the end of the year, the UK won't have any formal deal with the EU, which accounted for 43% of UK exports in 2019 and 51% of UK imports.
It's also worth remembering that the negotiations are not just about trade.
There are important talks, for example, about police and security co-operation as well. The UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now, but the EU says that isn't on offer to non-members.
And if the trade talks fall apart, don't expect much meaningful agreement on anything else.
Will a basic deal be done in the short time that remains?
It's certainly still possible, but politicians on both sides are going to have to make concessions quickly on some pretty fundamental issues.
And there are influential voices on the UK side who would prefer a clean break without any compromises.
Deadlines for completing a deal have come and gone. Don't forget, any agreement would still need to be turned into a legal text, translated into all EU languages, and ratified by parliaments on both sides.
So, time really is running out.
Even with a deal, the UK's relationship with the EU will be very different after it leaves the EU single market and the customs union at the end of the year.
There will be far more bureaucracy for businesses that trade across the border, and free movement of people in both directions will come to an end. An agreement would do very little for the substantial trade in services either.
If the talks fail completely, though, businesses on both sides of the Channel will have only a few weeks to try to prepare for very abrupt changes in the way they trade, at a time when many are already struggling to stay afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Joe Biden's victory in the US presidential election may have increased the chances of a last minute deal being done. Unlike Donald Trump, the President-elect is no fan of Brexit, and would disapprove of a deeper economic rupture between his European allies.
Will that be enough to tip the balance? Even at this very late stage, there are no guarantees.

The CRU apparently is very concerned about personal data ending up in public, which is a legitimate, of course. Yet, we can’t help but think they are really much more concerned about something else, e.g. the exposure of science shenanigans and possible large-scale fraud taking place at the UEA.
Luckily Lord Christopher Monckton is watching out for the bloggers, and has kindly provided some legal advice, which I am taking the privilege of disseminating further. Naturally privacy laws vary from country to country, and so you should check them out.
Here’s Christopher Monckton’s suggested response, in the event it can be of help to anyone else:
Roger: You do not need a lawyer for this one. Reply as follows:
Gentlemen, – I have received an email from you in which you purport to act for the University of East Anglia. I do not require any lectures from this corrupt institution or from its purported lawyers about how to behave. I neither confirm nor deny having received the password to which you refer. If I choose to reproduce any emails that may become available to me, I shall exercise my own discretion and common sense without benefit of your unsolicited instruction.
Inferentially, the Climategate emails were released by a whistleblower at the University who was as horrified as are all true lovers of science at the systematic scientific corruption and fraud that is made evident in the emails. The whistleblower says he wished to warn the world that the scientific basis for the diversion of trillions from the taxpayers’ pockets to various global-warming profiteers was in doubt. I am unable to contact the whistleblower, but he has done a great service to science by releasing the emails.
In the light of your email, I shall now convey all information in my possession to an international investigation team that is scrutinizing the fraudulent aspects of climate science, including without limitation the Climategate emails. I shall be inviting the team – which includes eminent police officers specializing in the investigation of complex international frauds and organized crime – to consider the role that the University, its vice-chancellor, its head of research, its climate research unit and (in the light of your bullying email and of the University’s previous misconduct in sicking anti-terrorist police on to me) its lawyers may have played in conspiring to perpetrate and to perpetuate the fraud, whether as instigators or as accessories during or after the fact of the fraud.
You will no doubt recall the adage about the pot that called the kettle black. – Tallbloke”

It’s a fact: Children are very easy to manipulate and deceive.
Children – and adults with stunted intellectual development – are much easier to convince than adults who have been around the block of life a few times. Children are naive, inexperienced, lack insight and highly impressionable. This makes them vulnerable and thus really easy targets for climate radicals.

Nothing illustrates this better than a recent story appearing in the Daily Mail here, where it is reported how a German sadist, via Skype, was able to successfully convince 88 young women to give themselves potentially lethal 230-volt shocks!
If one sicko is able to convince people to practically electrocute themselves, then imagine how easy it is for the media/organized activists to convince kids a climate doomsday is coming. It’s all based on the same bloody. The approach is the same in both cases:
1) First there’s an offender who derives pleasure through power over the victims
2) The offender claims to have great authority
3) The offender requests that their victims submit and obey
4) The offender claims it’s for a good cause
5) The offender promises the victims great reward for submitting
6) disaster results

Just as the German ‘socket sadist’ derived his pleasure from the sense of power over his victims and sexual gratification, the climate radicals derive their pleasure from the control they have over today’s children.
2. Claim of authority
While the German socket sadist claimed to be a researcher conducting an experiment that would advance science and thus the common public good, climate radicals falsely claim to possess the scientific truth, and that they have everything under control and can be trusted.

“The victims believed he was a scientist and there was no danger to them to carry out the experiment, that’s why they agreed,” the Daily Mail quoted prosecutors. “But he appeared so serious,” one victim later said.
The socket sadist refused to be challenged. If his victims resisted cooperating, then they were made to feel guilty and inadequate. With climate radicals, they label dissenters as deniers and villains. The climate radicals also do not tolerate any questioning or dissent.
3, Request to sacrifice
The German socket sadist asked his young female victims to hurt themselves – all in the name of science. The climate radicals demand that their followers collectively subject themselves to hardship and accept going without the amenities we enjoy, while exempting themselves.
4. Do it for a good cause
The socket sadist promised his victims it was in service of science, a good cause they could feel good about. Likewise, the climate radicals falsely promise kids they will see a much brighter future-  but only if they submit and do as they’re told. It’ll save the planet if they do, they are told.
5. False promises of reward
While the “socket sadist” allegedly made false promises of money (up to €3,000) to his victims and assured them they were participating in the noble cause of advancing science, the highly organized and authoritarian climate radicals promise the kids that if they do as they are told, the planet will be rescued, will become a green paradise, and peace will reign.
And they won’t have to school on Fridays.
6. Will turn into a mess
Just as the socket sadist case turned into a disaster, so will the extreme climate movement of zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Ironically, defense lawyers for the socket sadist, Klaus W Spiegel and Matthias Bohn, are now claiming their client had diminished responsibility for his actions as he suffers from Asperger Syndrome and autism. Sound familiar?

Story submitted by John Kehr, The Inconvenient Skeptic
Any serious discussion about the Theory of Global Warming will eventually include the absorption band argument that started more than 100 years ago between Arrhenius and Ångström.  One of the arguments presented by Ångström was that the main CO2 absorption band is between 14-16 micron and that band is also absorbed by water vapor (which is correct).  The counter to this by Arrhenius was that it didn’t matter in the upper atmosphere where there was no water vapor.  Of course none of this matters because radiative heat transfer is only 20% of the energy transferred to the atmosphere, but that is generally ignored by both sides of the argument.
At the time there was no way to measure the temperature in the upper atmosphere so there was no way to determine what was going on there, but of course now there are many ways to measure the temperature there.  When I started looking at the annual temperature behavior of the stratosphere and the top of the troposphere I found something very interesting that is as usual, bad for the warmists.
Here is the average daily temperature of the troposphere (at ~4.2 km) and the stratosphere (41 km).


What makes this so interesting is that they are completely out of phase with each other.

The tropospheric temperature is matched to the natural global temperature cycle.  This is highly dependent on the geography of the Earth’s surface.  The stratospheric temperature is not in phase at all with the surface temperature.  It is however in phase with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  The distance the Earth is from the Sun determines how much energy the Earth gets from the Sun.  Here is the stratospheric temperature and the solar constant over the course of the year.

While I would not say that the upper atmospheric temperature is completely independent, it is mostly independent of the of the lower atmosphere.  The cooling in the stratosphere each spring is exactly what would be expected based on the changing solar constant.  The warming that takes place in July is likely caused by the peak atmospheric temperatures in the NH that take place during the summer months.  That warming stops in October, but by that point the increasing solar iconstant warms the stratosphere.
What determines the stratospheric temperature is absolutely critical to understanding why it has been cooling over the past 60 years (which is about how long it’s temperature has been measured).  If the stratosphere’s temperature is primarily dictated by the incoming solar energy then the argument made by Arrhenius is meaningless.  That is because the increase in CO2 would never have an impact on the temperature there, simply because so little of the energy needed to warm the stratosphere comes from the Earth’s surface.
Based on the scientific data, the stratosphere is mostly influenced by the solar constant (basically the distance from the Sun for this discussion).  There appears to be some influence from the lower atmosphere, but it is clearly marginal.  This is not really a surprise since the energy transfer mechanisms are very limited above 12km.  The low atmospheric density results in low vertical mixing rates which only leaves radiative transfer which is a poor method for heat transfer when low absolute temperatures are involved.
When the temperature of the stratosphere and the troposphere are compared for the period from 2003-2011 it is also interesting to note that the peak stratospheric temperature was lowest of the whole period in early 2009.  This also matches the period of minimal solar activity over the entire period of time.  All of these pieces together clearly demonstrate the importance of the solar constant on the stratospheric temperature.  This also means that any impact by atmospheric CO2 levels on the stratospheric temperatures is very limited.

Sea Surface Temperature Measurement Instruments:
Standard Thermometer

Measures: Temperature in degrees, typically used in the bucket thermometer
Operates: At any depth by cable or line or by hand
Notes: Mercury in original thermometer has been replaced in many standard
thermometers by less toxic materials

Bucket Thermometer

Measures: Water temperature near the surface
Operates: At the surface by hand or line
Notes: Typically lowered about 1 meter into the water, left there for one
minute, and then retrieved deck side for reading.

Reversing Thermometer (for Nansen Bottle)

Measures: Water temperature at a specific predetermined depth
Operates: Only when turned 180 degrees (the mercury breaks in the special loop
and will not get back together until reset) Temperature at depth can be recorded
with a 180 degree flip (as is done with the Nansen Bottle) and there will be no
change on the way up.
Notes: A Nansen bottle
is a device for obtaining samples of seawater at a specific depth. It was
designed in 1910 by the early explorer and oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen.
The bottle, a metal or plastic cylinder, is lowered on a cable into the sea, and
when it has reached the required depth, a brass weight called a “messenger” is
dropped down the cable. When the weight reaches the bottle, the impact tips the
bottle upside down and trips a spring-loaded valve at the end, trapping the
water sample inside. The bottle and sample are then retrieved by hauling in the
cable.

Bathythermograph (BT)

Measures: Water temperature over a range of depth
Operates: Over any depth with a cable or line by hand or with a hydraulic winch
Notes: This model records the information inside and is retrieved however there
are expendable models (XBTs) that free fall on a copper line and transmit the
temperature and depth information through the copper wire before dropping to the
bottom

Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index.
Overall, it found prices of goods excluding food fell 3.7% in November.
Market researchers Mintel and Springboard say they see similar trends and expect further falls in December.
The BRC said the discounting reflected ""an extremely challenging year"" for retailers after trade was put on hold because of lockdowns.
""As we approach Christmas, consumers will be glad to see another month of falling prices,"" said boss Helen Dickinson.
""Where demand was weak for some products, discounting has followed, with many retailers trying to encourage more consumer spending, particularly those selling fashion and DIY goods.""
The BRC's Shop Price Index tracked the price of 500 of the most commonly bought High Street products from 2 to 6 November - a period that crossed into the start of England's second national lockdown.
Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said pre-Christmas discounts were not new, but that there would be more deals than usual this year as non-essential shops tried to make up for lost sales.
""Many retailers will have committed to orders, not had enough time to cancel and then ended up lumbered with stock,"" she told the BBC.
""They won't be able to sell things like seasonal gift sets and certain fashion lines in the new year, so we expect lots of discounts on those.""
Retailers are also trying to get people to do their Christmas shopping earlier, fearing a spike in online orders that will be hard to fulfil, said Nick Carroll, associate director of retail at Mintel.
This partly explains why this year's Black Friday sale had lasted longer than usual, with deals available as early as 1 November, he said.
""We've seen huge pressure on logistics operations and people not able to get their goods on time, so the more demand is spread out out, the easier it will be.""
The pandemic continues to batter retailers, putting thousands of jobs at risks.
This week Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, while Debenhams announced it would shut its 124 UK stores after last-ditch rescue talks failed.
The BRC's Ms Dickinson said businesses shuttered during lockdown had ""lost billions in sales and many are now in a precarious financial position"".
She called for more government support saying that ""without such interventions, we will see countless more store closures and job losses"".",2020-12-12T21:48:24.071402Z,1
,2020-12-13T11:52:39.498732Z,439,118,1308,"Here’s something rather astonishing.
The Institute of Physics, has made a statement about climate science.
 
The Institute of Physics is a scientific charity devoted to increasing  the practice, understanding and application of physics. It has a  worldwide membership of over 36,000 and is a leading communicator of  physics-related science to all audiences, from specialists through to  government and the general public. Its publishing company, IOP  Publishing, is a world leader in scientific publishing and the  electronic dissemination of physics.
IOP issued a no holds barred statement on Climategate to the UK  Parliamentary Committee. Here’s the key passages:

What are the implications of the disclosures for the  integrity of scientific research?
1. The Institute is concerned that, unless the disclosed e-mails are  proved to be forgeries or adaptations, worrying implications arise for  the integrity of scientific research in this field and for the  credibility of the scientific method as practised in this context.
2. The CRU e-mails as published on the internet provide prima facie  evidence of determined and co-ordinated refusals to comply with  honourable scientific traditions and freedom of information law. The  principle that scientists should be willing to expose their ideas and  results to independent testing and replication by others, which requires  the open exchange of data, procedures and materials, is vital. The lack  of compliance has been confirmed by the findings of the Information  Commissioner. This extends well beyond the CRU itself – most of the  e-mails were exchanged with researchers in a number of other  international institutions who are also involved in the formulation of  the IPCC’s conclusions on climate change.
3. It is important to recognise that there are two completely  different categories of data set that are involved in the CRU e-mail  exchanges:
· those compiled from direct instrumental measurements of land and  ocean surface temperatures such as the CRU, GISS and NOAA data sets; and
· historic temperature reconstructions from measurements of  ‘proxies’, for example, tree-rings.
4. The second category relating to proxy reconstructions are the  basis for the conclusion that 20th century warming is unprecedented.  Published reconstructions may represent only a part of the raw data  available and may be sensitive to the choices made and the statistical  techniques used. Different choices, omissions or statistical processes  may lead to different conclusions. This possibility was evidently the  reason behind some of the (rejected) requests for further information.
5. The e-mails reveal doubts as to the reliability of some of the  reconstructions and raise questions as to the way in which they have  been represented; for example, the apparent suppression, in graphics  widely used by the IPCC, of proxy results for recent decades that do not  agree with contemporary instrumental temperature measurements.
6. There is also reason for concern at the intolerance to challenge  displayed in the e-mails. This impedes the process of scientific ’self  correction’, which is vital to the integrity of the scientific process  as a whole, and not just to the research itself. In that context, those  CRU e-mails relating to the peer-review process suggest a need for a  review of its adequacy and objectivity as practised in this field and  its potential vulnerability to bias or manipulation.
7. Fundamentally, we consider it should be inappropriate for the  verification of the integrity of the scientific process to depend on  appeals to Freedom of Information legislation. Nevertheless, the right  to such appeals has been shown to be necessary. The e-mails illustrate  the possibility of networks of like-minded researchers effectively  excluding newcomers. Requiring data to be electronically accessible to  all, at the time of publication, would remove this possibility.
8. As a step towards restoring confidence in the scientific process  and to provide greater transparency in future, the editorial boards of  scientific journals should work towards setting down requirements for  open electronic data archiving by authors, to coincide with publication.  Expert input (from journal boards) would be needed to determine the  category of data that would be archived. Much ‘raw’ data requires  calibration and processing through interpretive codes at various levels.
9. Where the nature of the study precludes direct replication by  experiment, as in the case of time-dependent field measurements, it is  important that the requirements include access to all the original raw  data and its provenance, together with the criteria used for, and  effects of, any subsequent selections, omissions or adjustments. The  details of any statistical procedures, necessary for the independent  testing and replication, should also be included. In parallel,  consideration should be given to the requirements for minimum disclosure  in relation to computer modelling.
Are the terms of reference and scope of the Independent  Review announced on 3 December 2009 by UEA adequate?
10. The scope of the UEA review is, not inappropriately, restricted  to the allegations of scientific malpractice and evasion of the Freedom  of Information Act at the CRU. However, most of the e-mails were  exchanged with researchers in a number of other leading institutions  involved in the formulation of the IPCC’s conclusions on climate change.  In so far as those scientists were complicit in the alleged scientific  malpractices, there is need for a wider inquiry into the integrity of  the scientific process in this field.
11. The first of the review’s terms of reference is limited to:  “…manipulation or suppression of data which is at odds with acceptable  scientific practice…” The term ‘acceptable’ is not defined and might  better be replaced with ‘objective’.
12. The second of the review’s terms of reference should extend  beyond reviewing the CRU’s policies and practices to whether these have  been breached by individuals, particularly in respect of other kinds of  departure from objective scientific practice, for example, manipulation  of the publication and peer review system or allowing pre-formed  conclusions to override scientific objectivity.
How independent are the other two international data sets?
13. Published data sets are compiled from a range of sources and are  subject to processing and adjustments of various kinds. Differences in  judgements and methodologies used in such processing may result in  different final data sets even if they are based on the same raw data.  Apart from any communality of sources, account must be taken of  differences in processing between the published data sets and any data  sets on which they draw.

Clearly a sleeping giant has awakened.
Andrew Bolt muses:
This submission in effect warns that this recent warming may not be  unprecedented, after all, and those that claim it is may have been  blinded by bias or simply fiddled their results and suppressed dissent.
I’ll repeat: Climategate reveals the greatest scientific scandal of our  lifetime.

Everything was falling into place as it looked as if nothing would prevent them from imposing their green regime. The Pope was on their side, global temperatures had been near record highs (thanks to an El Nino event) , and Hillary Clinton would surely go on to become President of the USA.
Warmist agenda now getting torpedoed
With Clinton at the helm, the US would wholeheartedly commit to Paris and to strict decarbonization. Never did the green dream look so promising. But then came the mother of torpedoes, President Donald Trump.
And now there’s yet another torpedo about to slam into the already badly damaged warmunista ship: a rapidly approaching La Nina. In the wake of last year’s El Nino event, global temperatures had already been falling. A La Nina will only cause the globe to cool further. This is surprising because just months ago experts had predicted El Nino conditions to return.
La Nina powers in
The global warming alarmists are in sheer desperation and panic, as made evident by their hysterically shrill reactions to the recent hurricanes. The latest forecast shows a return to La Nina conditions (and a global cool-down).
Source: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/shtml
The above chart shows La Nina conditions expected to persist into spring, 2018. This cooling will make itsself evident in satellite data with a lag of about 6 months. This means global temperature will fall even further next year, which means the warming pause will go beyond 20 years.
Note the intensifying La Nina conditions forecast for the end of the here in the following NCEP chart for the rest of the year:

 
This oncoming La Nina development led meteorologist Dr. Ryan Maue to comment on Twitter:

La Niña means extreme winter weather — colder global temperatures — and all sorts of interesting things.  Are you prepared for it?

Not only La Nina is serving to cool global surface temperatures, but so are the powerful hurricanes as well. Yesterday at the Weatherbell Daily Update, Joe Bastardi showed the effects of hurricanes Irma and Jose on sea surface temperature (SST).

Note the band of cool water through the Caribbean and a substantially cooled down Gulf of Mexico. Just a week ago reports abounded on how the waters there surface had been “bathwater warm”. So quickly can weather change. True, there remains considerable amounts of heat at the ocean surfaces.
Frigid winter projected for Europe
The recent winter projection for Europe issued by Meteociel below shows Europe possiby being gripped by a frigid winter. If the prognosis holds, it could be one of the coldest in years:

Arctic sea ice rebound
Also the Arctic has shown recovery over the past years. This year’s Arctic sea ice for mid September is about a full 1 million sq. km. over the record low set 5 years ago.

Products will be picked from Morrisons stores as part of the trial in Leeds.
Morrisons said customers would be able to get their full weekly food shop from the online retail giant for the first time.
However, only people who pay for an Amazon Prime subscription will be able to benefit from the service.
Doug Gurr, Amazon UK country manager, said the Morrison on Amazon scheme would offer ""increased visibility"" for the supermarket and ""an even greater choice for our customers"".
Some Morrisons products had already been made available for same-day delivery to Amazon Prime customers in major cities across the UK.
However, the supermarket, which has its HQ in Bradford, is now growing its partnership with Jeff Bezos' company with the launch of a dedicated page especially for its products.
Shoppers will have the option to book two-hour slots for same-day delivery.
Morrisons chief executive David Potts said the scheme ""will give more and more customers the option of receiving Morrisons groceries straight to their doorstep, including freshly prepared products"".
Morrisons also operates a grocery delivery business directly through its own website, which is fulfilled through a distribution deal with Ocado, as well as an on-demand delivery service launched with Deliveroo in April.
In recent months, Amazon has been ramping up its online grocery service with the aim of serving millions of shoppers across the UK by the end of 2020.
Online food sales have almost doubled during the pandemic with grocers struggling to keep up with demand.

Canada to N. Iceland to S. Europe. The cooling persists year-round and extends from the surface down to depths of 800 m.

A cooling of “more than 2°C” in just 8 years (2008-2016) has been reported for nearly the entire ocean region south of Iceland.
The cooling persists year-round and extends from the “surface down to 800 m depth”.
From 40°N to 70°N, and from 40°W to 0°W, average temperatures have plunged 0.6°C from 2008 to 2016 – also to depths of 800 m.
To put these thermal changes into perspective, consider it took the global oceans 55 years (1955-2010) to warm 0.18°C (0.27 W/m²) in the 700 m layer (Levitus et al., 2012).
It is unknown to what extent the cooling will permeate other regions of the ocean. Nor is it known how long the cooling will persist. Or worsen.

Despite the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions, trading continues to be slow as many office workers are still at home.
Staff in stores have been asked to work about 20% fewer hours than before.
A Pret spokeswoman said: ""Our biggest priority is to do everything we can to save jobs.
""With footfall in our shops still significantly below normal levels, we have had to review the hours team members are contracted to work each week - although of course we hope to increase these hours as trade improves.
""By making these changes we are able to save a large number of roles.""
Pret is reliant on sales from commuters and office workers at lunchtime, which have been significantly impacted by the lockdown.
The firm runs 550 outlets globally, employing 13,000 staff, including 8,000 people in the UK.
A majority of Pret stores are now open for significantly fewer hours than they were prior to the pandemic.
Trade across the country is understood to be down by 65% since the lockdown came into force in late March. In the City of London, business has fallen by 80%.
In July, Pret announced that it would be closing 30 outlets and cutting about 1,000 jobs across its business as part of a post-pandemic restructuring.
Pret said 339 of its 410 UK shops have so far reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions.
Consultations are currently ongoing between the firm and the affected employees working at the 30 shops that will not reopen.
Pret is also in talks with landlords about reducing its rent bill. In May, it appointed advisory firms to help restructure the business, and in April it raised â¬100m (Â£90m) in emergency funding from its banks.",2020-12-12T21:48:46.484299Z,1
,2020-12-13T11:52:52.322255Z,445,118,202,"As the Copenhagen Climate Conference is taking place, it is appropriate to clarify once again what is more or less accurately known about the climate of our planet and about climate change.   
  
Obviously, a brief post can not substitute for detailed studies of professionals in a variety of scientific disciplines – climatology, atmospheric physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, and economics. However, a short post can summarize basic theses on the main trends in climate evolution, on its forecasts, and on its actual and projected effects.   
  
1\. _The Earth’s climate is constantly changing._ The climate was changing in the past, is changing now and, obviously, will be changing in the future – as long as our planet exists.   
  
2\. _Climatic changes are largely cyclical in nature._ There are various time horizons of climatic cycles – from the annual cycle known to everyone to cycles of 65-70 years, of 1,300 years, or of 100,000 years (the so called Milankovitch cycles).   
  
3\. _There is no_ f _undamental disagreement among scientists, public figures and governments about the fact that the climate is changing. There is a broad consensus that climate changes occur constantly._ The myth, created by climate alarmists, that their opponents deny climate change is sheer propaganda.   
  
4\. _Current debate_ _among climatologists, economists and public figures is not about the fact of climate change, but about other issues._ In particular, disagreements exist on:   
\- Comparative levels of modern day temperatures (relative to the historically observed),   
\- The direction of climate change depending on the length of record,   
\- The extent of climate change,   
\- The rate of climate change,   
\- Causes of climate change,   
\- Forecasts of climate change,   
\- Consequences of climate change,   
\- The optimal strategy for human beings to respond to climate change.   
  
5\. _Unbiased answers to many of these issues are critically dependent on a chosen time horizon – whether it is 10 years, or 30 years, or 70 years, or 1000 years, or 10,000 years, or hundreds of thousands or millions of years._ Depending on the time horizon, the answers to many of these questions may be different, even opposite.   




6\. _The current level of global temperature in historical perspective is not unique._ The average temperature of the Earth is now estimated at about 14.5 degrees Celsius. In our planet’s history there have been few periods when the Earth's temperature was lower than the current – in the early Permian period, in the Oligocene, and during periodic glaciations in the Pleistocene. For most of the time during the last half billion years, the air temperature at the Earth's surface greatly exceeded the current one, and for about half of this period it was approximately 25°C, or 10°C higher than the current temperature. Regular glaciations of cold periods during the Pleistocene era lasted for approximately 90,000 years, with a low temperature of approximately 5°C below that of the present, alternated by warm interglacial periods (for 4,000-6,000 years) with temperatures of 1-3°C higher than at present. Approximately 11,000 years ago the last significant increase in temperature began (of approximately 5°C), during which time a huge glacier, that covered a considerable part of Eurasia and America, had melted. Climate warming has played a key role in humanity’s acquisition of the secrets of agriculture and in its transition to civilization. Over the past 11,000 years there were at least five distinct warm periods, the so-called ""climatic optima"" when the temperature of the planet was at 1-3°C higher than at present.   
  
7\. _The focus of climate change depends critically on the choice of time horizon._ In the past 11 years (1998-2009 years) global temperature was flat. Before that, in the preceding 20 years (1979-1998 years) it increased by about 0.3°C. Before that, during the preceding 36 years (1940-1976 years) the temperature fell by about 0.1°C. Before that, for the preceding two centuries (1740 – 1940 years), the overall trend in global temperature was mainly neutral – with periodic warming, followed by cooling, and then again warming. Over the past three centuries (from the turn of 18th century), the temperature in the northern hemisphere has increased by approximately 1.3°C, from the trough of the so-called ""Little Ice Age"" (LIA) during the years 1500-1740 years, followed by the contemporary climatic optimum (CCO), which started around 1980. During the three centuries preceding the LIA, the temperature in the northern hemisphere was falling compared to the level it was during the medieval climatic optimum (MCO) in the 8th – 13th centuries. Depending on the chosen time frame the long-term temperature trend has a different trajectory. For periods of the last 2,000 years, the last 4,000 years, and the last 8,000 years, the trend was negative. For periods of the past 1,300 years, the last 5,000 years, and the last 9,000 years it was positive.   
  
8\. _The rate of contemporary climate change is much more modest in comparison with the rate of climatic changes observed earlier in the history of the planet._ The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes the increase in the global temperature by 0.76°C over the last century (1906-2005 years) as extraordinary. There is reason to suspect this temperature value is somewhat overstated. However, the main point is that previous rises in temperature were greater than those in the modern era. Comparable data demonstrate that the increase in temperature, for example, in Central England in the 18th century (by 0.97°C) was more significant than in the 20th (by 0.90°C). The climatic changes in Central Greenland over the past 50,000 years show that there were at least a dozen periods during which the regional temperature increased by 10-13°C. Given the correlation between changes in temperature at high latitudes and globally, those shifts in temperature regime in Greenland meant a rise in global temperature by 4-6°C. Such a rate was approximately 5-7 times faster than the actual (and, perhaps, slightly exaggerated) temperature increase in the 20th century.   
  
9\. _The rate of current climate change (the speed of modern warming) by historical standards is not unique._ According to IPCC data, the rate of temperature increase over the past 50 years was 0.13°C per decade. According to comparable data, obtained through instrumental measurements, a higher rate of temperature increase was observed at least three times: in the late 17th century – early 18th century; in the second half of the 18th century; and in the late 19th century – early 20th century. The centennial rate of warming in the 20th century is slower than the warming in the 18th century that was instrumentally recorded and slower than the warming in at least 13 cases over the past 50,000 years that were measured by palaeoclimatic methods.   
  
10\. _Among the causes of climate change in the pre-industrial era there were hardly any anthropogenic_ _factors_ – due to modest population size and mankind’s limited economic activities. But the range of climatic fluctuations and their rate and peak values in the pre-industrial era exceeded the parameters of climate change recorded in the industrial period.   
  
11\. _During the industrial age (since the beginning of the 19th century) climate change is believed to be under the impact of both groups of factors – of natural and of anthropogenic character._ Since the rate of climate change in the industrial age is so far noticeably smaller than at some time in the pre-industrial age, there is no basis for the assertion that anthropogenic factors had already become as significant as natural factors, even less for the assertion that they overwhelm natural factors.   
  
12\. _Factors of anthropogenic climate change are rather diverse and can not be confined to carbon dioxide only._ Mankind impacts local, regional and global climate by constructing buildings and structures, heating houses, industrial and public premises, by logging and planting forests, plowing arable land, damming rivers, draining and irrigating lands, leveling and paving territories, conducting industry, issuing aerosols, etc.   
  
13\. _There is no consensus in the scientific community on the role of carbon dioxide in climate change._ Some scientists believe that it is crucial, others believe that it is secondary to other factors. There are also serious disagreements on the nature and direction of possible causality between concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and temperature: some researchers believe the former causes temperature to rise, others argue the opposite – that fluctuations in temperature cause changes in carbon dioxide concentration.   
  
14\. _Unlike carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) is harmless to humans; in contrast to aerosol, a harmful and dangerous substance, carbon dioxide does not pollute the environment._ It has neither a color, nor a taste, nor a smell. Therefore, popularly used photos and videos showing factory chimney stacks emitting smoke and cars emitting exhaust to illustrate carbon dioxide are just misleading – CO2 is invisible; what is visible in those images are pollutants. It should also be noted that the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has a positive impact on the productivity of plants, including agricultural crops.   
  
15\. _The relationship of the concentration of carbon dioxide to climate change remains a subject of intense scientific debate._ True, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the past two centuries increased from 280 parts per million of air particles in the early 19th century to 388 particles in 2009. It is also true that the global temperature in that period rose by about 0.8°C. But whether these two factors are connected is unclear. The dynamics of CO2 concentration did not correlate well with the expected changes in temperature. The significant and rapid increases in global temperature during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene, during the Medieval Climatic Optima, in the 18th century, were not preceded by an increase in carbon dioxide concentration. In the industrial age, an increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was not always accompanied by a rise in global temperature. In 1944-1976 CO2 concentration increased by 24 units – from 308 to 332 particles, but the global temperature fell 0.1°C. In 1998-2009 CO2 concentration increased by 21 units – from 367 to 388 particles, but the global temperature trend remained flat. In the first half of the 1940's the decline in the concentration of carbon dioxide by 3 units (as a result of the massive destruction caused by World War II) did not prevent the global temperature to rise by 0.1°C.   
  
16\. _So far global climate models demonstrate their limited effectiveness._ The complex nature of the climate system is not reflected adequately enough in the global climate models whose use has recently spread around the world. The projections developed on their basis in the late 1990s through the early 2000s predicted the global temperature to rise by 1.4-5.8°C till the end of the 21st century with a 0.2-0.4°C increase already in the first decade. In reality during 1998-2009 the temperature was flat at best.   
  
17\. _Forecasts of global climate change made at the beginning of this decade by Russian scientists (from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, the Voejkov Main Geophysical Observatory) predicted a fall in the global temperature by 0.6°C by 2025-2030 in comparison with a temperature peak reached at the end of the 20 th century._ So far the actual temperature for the last decade has not risen.   
  
18\. _Implications of climate change for human beings differ greatly depending on their direction, size and rate._ An increase in temperature leads as a rule to a softer and moister climate, while a decline in temperature leads to a harder and drier climate. It was a climatic optimum in the Holocene period with temperatures 1-3°C higher than today that greatly contributed to the birth of civilization. Conditions for people’s life and economic activities in warmer climates are usually more favorable than in colder environments. In warmer climates there is usually more precipitation than in drier areas, the cost of heating and volume of food required to sustain human life is lower, while vegetation and navigation periods are longer, and crops’ yields are higher.   
  
19\. _Methods ""to combat global warming” by reducing carbon dioxide emissions suggested by climate alarmists are scientifically unfounded in the absence of extraordinary or unusual changes in climate during the modern era._ Such measures, if adopted, are especially dangerous for mid- and lower income countries. Those measures would effectively cut those countries off the path to prosperity and hinder their ability to close the gap with more developed nations.   
  
20\. The impact of all anthropogenic factors (not only CO2) on climate is unclear when compared with factors of nature. _Therefore, the most effective strategy for humanity in responding to different types of climate change is adaptation._ That approach is exactly the way that humans have reacted to the larger-scale climatic changes in the past, even though they were less prepared then for such changes. Now mankind has greater resources to adapt to lesser climate fluctuations and it is better equipped for them scientifically, technically and psychologically. The adaptation of humanity to climate changes is incomparably less costly than other options being proposed and imposed by climate alarmists. Human society has already adopted to climate change and will continue to do so as long as economy and society are vibrant and free.",2020-12-13T11:52:52.322287Z,1
,2020-12-19T20:00:14.874356Z,446,118,3715,"Share this...FacebookTwitterAs the sporadic, unpredictable supply of solar and wind energies increasingly become a part of Germany’s power mix, the country’s electrical grid is becoming more and more unstable and thus vulnerable to a massive power outage.
Dr. Klaus Peter Krause has an article at www.freiewelt.net called “Renewable, but not controllable“, which looks at Germany’s ever more precarious power grid, all thanks to its madly rushed foray into renewable energies, particularly wind and sun. Krause describes the situation in Germany as: “Getting closer to a power outage – The energy policy of madness“.
In the article he brings up a presentation by 2 German power grid experts, Dr. Bernd Benser and Prof. Helmut Alt, which was made at an event organized by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).
Most people have experienced a power outage at one time or another, and so may view it as only a nuisance. However, such power outages are almost always very local, isolated, and usually last only a few minutes or a couple of hours at most. But a prolonged, large-scale power outage would be much more than just a nuisance. It would be a catastrophe for a developed country like Germany. Fortunately, few of us have ever experienced that. That may change soon.
Peter Krause reports on how Benser and Alt described what would happen if a large-scale power outage did hit Germany:
What happens when the power goes out
Benser and Alt warned of the consequences of such a power outage and described what it would mean. Here’s just an excerpt: The communication system would immediately go silent or would collapse, if it could function, because of overloading, Fire departments, aid organizations and law enforcement could no longer be reached, payment systems would come to s standstill, ATM machines would no longer dispense cash, water supply and wastewater removal would no longer operate, traffic would jam up completely due to non-functioning traffic lights and signals, entire logistics systems would collapse, production systems would stop functioning, refrigeration systems would stop and perishables would rapidly spoil, air conditioning would cease at in large poultry farms, cows would not be milked, in buildings the electrical blinds for windows would not operate in the morning, also (after 4 hours, at times after just 2 hours) plundering would have to be expected, the medical care system would be crippled as about 90 percent of German hospitals are unable to supply themselves with emergency power for more than 48 hours. According to Benser, six days are needed to bring power back online after a total power outage. “‘n the worst case, we estimate 200,000 dead.“ In high-tech Germany, the most important things practically stop functioning. A large scale power blackout is a national catastrophe scenario.”

,2020-12-19T17:04:25.838216Z,447,120,1530,"This spring the Pew Research Center released its eighth annual report on the state of American journalism. “In some ways, new media and old, slowly and sometimes grudgingly, are coming to resemble each other,” the study says. The traditional platforms of the Fourth Estate are changing, and last year, online news consumption outstripped print media for the first time in terms of both advertising revenue and readership. The tipping point has arrived. The trend line is clear. And the Cato Institute, it seems, has been ahead of the curve.



Since 2005 _Cato Unbound_ has given readers access to a state‐​of‐​the‐​art virtual trading floor in the intellectual marketplace. A unique online magazine, it reflects an appreciation of the way ideas are exchanged in the digital age. Every month one of the world’s leading thinkers presents an essay on a topical issue. A panel of distinguished experts responds, each offering his case before challenging and refining the arguments in an ongoing conversation. Readers are then encouraged to join the dialogue by offering their own thoughts through websites, blogs, and letters to the editor. These contributions are pulled together into an easily accessible forum, creating a media product that is virtually distinct within the digital realm.



Yet _Cato Unbound_ is also designed to avoid the pitfalls of its platform. For starters, the site revolves around the value of debate. All too often, the sheer availability of personalized news today allows readers to give in to confirmation bias — to seek out only the information that reinforces their existing beliefs. The internet, by any measure, caters to the obstinate. At _Cato Unbound_ , however, contributors are forced to confront their critics, and the tendency to selectively ignore the opposition is mitigated.



The site also hinges on the importance of perspective. The current news climate is subject to certain kinds of pressure: readers increasingly look for minute‐​by‐​minute updates. Many sites therefore suffer from a lack of depth by becoming preoccupied with instantaneous delivery. _Cato Unbound_ is different. “We try to step back, take a deep breath, and focus on the larger picture,” Jason Kuznicki, the site’s editor, explains.



In the latest issue, “Targeted Killing and the Rule of Law,” the editors ask whether the executive branch can lawfully kill. Lead essayist Ryan Alford, assistant professor at the Ave Maria School of Law, argues that it cannot. In fact, the “presidential death warrant” is so repugnant to our constitutional tradition, he says, that the Founders didn’t even think it necessary to make an explicit statement about the practice. At the time of the Revolution, British kings hadn’t enjoyed such a power for centuries, and it was thought to be the very antithesis of the rule of law. The distinguished panel of legal and historical experts responding to Alford includes John C. Dehn of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Gregory McNeal of Pepperdine University, and Carlton Larson of the University of California at Davis.



Other past issues have included



These monthly conversations have received attention from publications like the _New York Times_ , the _Washington Post_ , and _The Economist_. The site has featured a lineup of prominent contributors, including James M. Buchanan, the Nobel laureate and founder of the public choice school of political economy; Richard H. Thaler, professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Chicago; James R. Flynn, a pioneer in the study of IQ; Clay Shirky, the renowned social media theorist; and Jorge Castañeda, former foreign minister of Mexico. Over the years, this forum has shown a depth of exchange and an accessible format that few other outlets offer.



An idea can be bound between covers, bound by convention, or bound for the dustbin of history. The ideas of _Cato Unbound_ , we hope, are none of the above.",2020-12-19T17:04:25.838246Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:10:46.264322Z,448,120,1190,"My blog yesterday on potential 2012 GOP candidates and the stimulus provoked a deluge of e‐​mails from fans of Sarah Palin objecting to my characterization of her support for the bill. And Palin’s office, responding to news reports (like this one from Fox News and the Associated Press that I relied on), put out a statement attempting to clarify her position. It wasn’t particularly successful.   
  
  
Palin does urge Congress to “consider” whether the stimulus bill is too big and burdens future generations with debt, but unlike some other governors (Sanford, Barbour, Jindal, for example), she does not call for the bill’s defeat or urge her congressional delegation to vote against it. Instead, she goes on to raise her big concern with the bill – it doesn’t give enough money to Alaska: 



“Governor Palin discussed troubling elements in the stimulus package including provisions that punish Alaska for forward‐​funding education, the mass transit funding formula that will limit Alaska opportunities but will pour money into other states, and the “shovel‐​ready” criteria for projects that northern climates might not be able to accommodate consistently due to the shortened construction season.”



Earlier Governor Palin sent a letter to her congressional delegation in which she similarly complained, not about the spending in the stimulus bill per se, but about the formulas for distributing the funds, which she believes short changes her state (as if Alaska were not already a wholly‐​owned subsidiary of the federal government.) She also wants the bill to include five specific projects (we used to call those “earmarks.”)   
  
  
So, I’ll stand (somewhat) corrected. Governor Palin didn’t lobby for the bill. She just lobbied for her share of the pork.",2020-12-22T13:10:46.264355Z,1
,2020-12-12T21:49:41.866378Z,450,121,466,"István E. Markó*Si vous pensez que la conférence sur le climat qui se tiendra à Paris en décembre 2015 (COP21) a quelque chose à voir avec le climat ou la protection de la nature, révisez votre copie. Vous avez tout faux. Les premiers qui s’en rendront compte, après avoir vainement fouillé dans les derniers recoins de ces futurs accords, minimalistes et non-contraignants mais présentés par les politiques comme une grandiose réussite pour l’environnement et le climat, seront les écolos et certaines ONG environnementales. L’Union européenne, elle, le sait déjà. Car ne nous leurrons pas. Malgré l’échec certain et déjà annoncé de cette 21ème grande messe climatique, elle sera « vendue » au grand public comme une victoire des politiques qui semblent ne pas avoir d’autres urgences que de se préoccuper du climat qu’il fera éventuellement en l’an 2100. En ce moment, les représentants des différents pays de l’UE ont perdu l’espoir d’adopter des accords contraignants sur les émissions de CO2 et doivent trouver un moyen honorable de sortir du pétrin dans lequel ils se sont fourrés. Car tout ce barnum n’est qu’une question de gros sous, de transferts de capitaux et de subsides, de pouvoir politique national et global. Plus précisément, il s’agit de transferts de sommes colossales vers des pays émergeants avec, au passage, un petit écrémage et un retour certain – sous la forme de dividendes – vers les pays financeurs. Rien de généreux, ni de désintéressé là-dedans, mais bien du business pur et dur. Illustrons ce propos avec l’exemple de Mme Merkel.L’Allemagne a promis d’offrir à l’Inde plus de 2 milliards d’euros afin de soutenir des projets dirigés vers l’utilisation de l’énergie solaire et la mise en place de réseaux électriques intelligents pour accélérer la transition de ce pays vers un développement durable. Cette annonce, faite durant la récente visite d’Angela Merkel à Delhi, a conduit le premier ministre Modi à promettre que l’Inde, l’une des puissances dissidentes dans la lutte contre le CO2, s’engagerait à renouveler ses efforts en la matière. Un semblant de victoire politique pour la chancelière allemande qui tente ainsi d’amadouer Modi et de l’amener à être du côté de Hollande lors de la COP21. Sauf que le premier ministre indien n’a nullement l’intention de ralentir la progression économique de son pays et que les chiffres qu’il a soumis à la COP21 invalident sa promesse faite à Mme Merkel. L’Inde fera ce qui est rationnel et va donc améliorer le rendement énergétique de ses centrales au charbon en utilisant de nouvelles technologies. Elle va donc diminuer la vitesse de croissance de ses émissions, mais celles-ci continueront cependant à croître. Les vrais vainqueurs de ce pathétique accord : les cabinets indiens qui feront les études de marché (en empochant les inévitables commissions) et les industriels allemands qui fourniront produits et matériaux pour le tout renouvelable photovoltaïque. Qui payera ces 2 milliards s’euros qui enrichiront en partie l’industrie allemande aussi complice que l’indienne? Les contribuables allemands. Sous forme de taxes, bien entendu.La duplicité des électriciens allemands est un modèle du genre. En effet, non-seulement bénéficient-ils de subsides étatiques promis par les politiques pour poursuivre la catastrophique transition énergétique allemande (EnergieWende), mais en plus, ils se permettent d’augmenter la facture d’énergie du citoyen qui se retrouve ainsi deux fois payeur. Les CEO allemands n’hésitent pas à mettre en péril leurs propres entreprises (elles perdent déjà beaucoup en bourse) parce qu’ils savent bien qu’ils bénéficieront de juteuses aides financières étatiques. C’est ce qui explique que l’entreprise EON ait été divisée en deux entités légalement indépendantes. Cette attitude irrite les entreprises énergétiques de petits Etats qui ne peuvent suivre cette politique de la course aux subventions sans risquer la faillite pure et simple. Ce qui explique les dissensions au sein du Conseil énergie de l’UE entre l’Allemagne et les « pays de l’Est » qui ne veulent pas de nouvelles contraintes sur les énergies renouvelables.Derrière tout ce cirque climatique se cachent de grandes banques, qui ont investi dans le renouvelable des sommes faramineuses et qui voudraient récolter les plantureux dividendes qui leur avaient été annoncés. Les crédits « carbone » ne sont qu’une de leurs nouvelles additions boursières. Ajoutons à cela de nombreuses industries multinationales qui officient dans des domaines aussi variés que la chimie, l’électricité et le pétrole (vous avez bien lu). Ces industriels ont aussi tablé sur le « tout renouvelable », la « chimie verte », les « énergies non polluantes », les biocarburants, la « décarbonisation », tout ce qui leur permettrait de bénéficier des largesses des Etats pour profiter des généreux subsides offerts de manière irréfléchie par nos dirigeants politiques. Les dindons de la farce ? Nous, les citoyens !Nombreux sont les industriels européens (surtout) qui plaident en faveur du renouvelable et ne cessent de demander des accords de plus en plus contraignants en la matière. Pour le bien de la planète ? Certainement pas. Ces décisions devraient leur garantir des retombées financières colossales, éviter que les investissements qu’ils ont faits en matière de renouvelable ne les entraînent dans une spirale financière négative et empêcher la concurrence des pays émergeants. Ils veulent éviter un « subprime » de l’énergie pourtant inéluctable. Prenons l’exemple de Total, qui a abandonné toutes ses activités solaires et fermé son usine belge http://www.journaldelenvironnement.net/article/total-et-gdf-suez-vont-fermer-leur-usine-solaire,29543) mais qui maintient son volet photovoltaïque en France (http://www.total.fr/ma-maison/solaire/panneaux-photovoltaiques.html). Pourquoi avoir gardé cette activité en France. Mr Hollande et ses promesses de déductions fiscales à l’entreprise belgo-française y seraient-ils pour quelque chose ?En son temps, BP (British Petroleum) s’est engouffré, comme certains agriculteurs, dans la course aux biocarburants aux subsides pour produire des biocarburants et avait même changé son nom pour Beyond Petroleum (comme c’est beau !). BP, qui avait massivement investi dans le « vert » a tout abandonné. Hélas, pas la Belgique, ni la France, ni l’Allemagne qui continuent à subventionner cette production utopique dont le rentabilité est facilement mesurée par le coût de la tonne de CO2 évitée: alors que sur le marché du carbone (ETS) la tonne se vend entre 6 et 8 €, celle des biocarburants revient à 300€. Et ces biocarburants ne sont en rien “écolo”. Le bioéthanol est produit comme la bière, par fermentation de céréales, et tout le monde sait que la fermentation produit beaucoup de CO2. Tout le monde ? Non, pas les politiques. Quant au biodiesel, il n’est qu’en partie “bio” car pour le produire il faut faire réagir de l’huile végétale avec du méthanol qui provient du méthane. Le biodiesel est donc généré à partir d’énergies fossiles. Tous les chimistes le savent. Pas les politiques.Quand aux ONG environnementales, qui fleurissent comme perce-neiges au printemps et qui ont un besoin vital de ressources financières, elles relayent les paroles sacrées de la messe climatique, effrayent le citoyen innocent et se remplissent les poches au passage. N’hésitant nullement à mentir ou à amender les faits, elles nous prédisent, avec l’aide de climatologues dédiés à LA cause, une future apocalypse des plus excitantes. Tout cela grâce à des subventions publiques aussi peu transparentes qu’abondantes.

Having been on the subject of meat-diets and nutrition over the last few days, here too we have another long held belief supported by a overwhelming consensus of doctors and experts that is turning out to be completely wrong. It is the claim that cholesterol is bad for you. Data is showing the opposite is likely true.
It turns out that there’s no data supporting the hypothesis that that it leads to heart disease. In fact it is being revealed that patients have been misinformed by doctors, medical associations and their governments for decades now. The consequence of this false information has been a mass pandemic of obesity along with all the killer diseases associated with it.

Note “Michael Mann” hockey stick at 25:00-minute mark…stunning parallels with climate science. 
Let’s all recall how the science was settled and that 99.9% agreed that cholesterol was dangerous and would kill us if we allowed it to reach levels over 200. It is emerging that this long-supported claim may very well all be completely wrong. In fact there is a massive growing volume of new literature that shows cholesterol is beneficial, and thus it’s only a question of time before medical science will soon be forced to admit to the greatest medical debacle of all time.
Today there is even an international association of cholesterol skeptics. Like climate skeptics, they too were and are being labeled crackpots and so cannot be taken seriously. And as is the case with climate skeptics, it’s emerging that the skeptics are right.

Often it starts with one person finding an inconsistency, digging a little deeper, and then announcing that something is rotten. That person in turn gets attacked and smeared as an outcast. But a few other, open-minded persons take a closer look and they too realize that something is indeed wrong. Before you know it, other scientists and experts in the field are joining in and chipping away, and soon the whole thing collapses.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung (right) wonders why climate “hysteric scientists” have come out of their cave.
This is what is happening now in climate science in Germany – lots of skeptic people are now chipping away and that process has become a run-away train.
Just a few years ago, the science was as good as settled in Germany. Yet, a few skeptical, mainly retired scientists looked into the dissent coming from America and found that the AGW hypothesis was indeed full of holes. They formed into the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and before too long more than 60 German scientists signed an open letter rejecting man-made global warming. Eventually some small-scale media outlets, journalists and blogs joined in. They in turn were followed by skeptical major articles appearing in flagship news magazines such as Spiegel and Bild, see here, here, here, and here, for example.
In 2012 one of the fathers of the modern German environmental movement, Professor Fritz Vahrenholt, teamed up with geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and released a best selling skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. That book shook up the German climate establishment. The alarmists scrambled and put on a full-court press, but failed to contain the book’s spread. Now that book is appearing worldwide in English next month.
Recently, Germany’s leading meteorologists have begun taking note and have used their immense skills to analyze the climate data. They too have concluded that the science is far from convincing, see here, here, here, and here. Earlier, many simply had accepted the IPCC findings as truth, but for whatever reason they began taking a closer look just to be sure. And when they did, they too quickly realized that much was rotten with AGW science. Today that fact is so obvious that German meteorologists are now openly ridiculing the once highly respected institutes as opportunist prophets of doom scamming for public funding. The German skeptic train is now running away.
The latest prominent meteorologist to express harsh criticism is Dominik Jung, who I follow at Twitter. Here he linked to a short commentary at his wetternet site where he takes a slap at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) for their recent fit of alarmism in projecting an 8-fold increase in heat waves in Germany by the year 2040 – based on failed models.

Weather: The Climate Hysterics Are Back!
Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 16 August 2013 – Hard to believe: heat and drought in the middle of the summer – now who’d have ever expected that? Hardly a summer was dryer or nicer in the last 10 years, and already the climate experts are coming out on stage.
Drought?
After a really warm July and a very hot start in August, it had to be expected: the climate experts are again coming out of their caves and warning us of extreme heat summers that are supposedly now imminent.
At least that’s what we read last Thursday and Friday in the media. There are going to be more and more heat-waves until 2040, so claim the prognoses. Yet, we are still waiting for the German winters with no snow and ice which were prophesized in the year 2000 . Perhaps the lady and gentleman climate scientists should simply once ask the workers of the road maintenance and winter snow clearing crews?
Weird: Over the last two rather cool and unsettled summers, we heard or saw almost nothing from the climate prophets. Also during the last colder than normal winters there was silence. Perhaps it is once again time for applying for new research funding …who knows, who knows…

“so much to say…so little time.” – Roy Spencer
I have at last found the time for the next step in my Sun-Cloud-Ocean calculations. But first, I would like to thank everyone who commented on my previous article. Some are addressed directly below, and all comments (well, most) were useful. You found, or helped me to find, a number of important errors and new lines of thought. As I said last time “If I’ve stuffed up, I want to know that right away, so please get a critical comment in asap.“. The same applies this time!
[For those not familiar with some of the abbreviations used, there is a list of abbreviations at the end of this article, along with data and code files].

1. Preamble
In an earlier article, I expressed the opinion that Infra-Red radiation (IR), eg. as from Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), did not warm the ocean as effectively as the wavelengths of direct solar radiation which penetrated into the ocean (ITO): “The GHG process involves only IR, which cannot penetrate the ocean more than a fraction of a millimetre, where its energy goes mainly into evaporation. ie, the energy goes straight back into the atmosphere.” and “The ITO warms the ocean well below the surface with little direct effect on the atmosphere.”.
Some time after my last article was published, I realised that Nick Stokes’ (NS) diagram (Figure 2) provided an opportunity to test my statement. If I could reproduce the diagram from first principles – ie. reverse engineer it – then I would have the means to calculate whether IR and direct solar radiation did indeed differ in their effect, and if so by how much.
It took me a long time, but I have completed (to my satisfaction) the reverse engineering, using a notional “average” patch of ocean over one 24-hour day without upwelling. The comparisons for IR and direct solar radiation were then very simple. The results are summarised below, and then the whole process is described in more detail.
There is one important caveat. The results can only be as good as the assumptions that went into them. The ocean surface is a pretty volatile place, and everything is necessarily some kind of approximation. It is possible that changed assumptions could give significantly different results.
 
2. Quick Summary
· With no upwelling, nearly a third of all input radiation remains in the ocean at the end of the day. It is not all lost on the same day.
· Results do support the idea that a proportion of inward IR is immediately lost in evaporation, but the proportion comes out at about 17% rather than “mainly”.
· IR and solar radiation do differ in their ability to warm the ocean. A Watt of direct solar radiation is nearly 50% more effective at warming the ocean than a Watt of IR.
· Retained energy can build up for later upwelling, eg. with El Niño, AMO or PDO, or for transport towards the poles.
· Results suggest that from 1983-2009, cloud changes were responsible for a bit over 90% (90.6%) of global warming, man-made CO2 for less than 10% (9.4%).
My take: Changes to direct solar radiation as caused by changes in cloud cover are much more important than changes to back radiation as caused by man-made GHGs. Solar energy is always being stored in the ocean, and it is reasonable to suppose that this energy is the key to Earth’s climate, as also evidenced by the global climate (= atmospheric temperature) changes that result from warming/cooling phases of ENSO, AMO, PDO, etc. Upwelling would seem to be a (or the?) major mechanism by which the stored energy is delivered from the ocean to the atmosphere. We have to understand the ocean if we want to understand climate.
3. Summary
3.1 Energy balance
The Kiehl and Trenberth (K&T) energy balance (Figure 1) that I use for some of the input information is useful and informative, but it conceals as much information as it reveals. It shows a perfect energy balance, but it shows nothing of the different timescales involved. Looking at K&T it would be easy to suppose that the energy coming in during a day also goes out – as is shown, for example, in the diagrams that Nick Stokes presented (Figure 2).
In fact, much of the energy from solar radiation remains in the ocean at the end of the day. This is the heat which builds up and is transported poleward or is later released by an El Niño or by the AMO or PDO, etc. In the “average” patch of ocean, 168 Wm-2 of direct solar radiation and 324 Wm-2 of back radiation enter the ocean, and if there is no upwelling then 160 Wm-2 stays there – only 332 Wm-2 escapes to the atmosphere. The actual numbers may be surprising, but the concept should not be. We all know that the ocean transports heat from the tropics towards the poles, and that the ocean oscillations release heat that has built up in the ocean over a period of time. Heat cannot build up if it is not being retained in the first place. An implication is that much of the energy shown by K&T escaping from the ocean has been there for quite a long time – it does not all escape on the day it came in, it does not escape at a steady rate, and it is not released uniformly across the oceans. By implication, over short periods or even up to a few decades, atmospheric temperature may bear little or no relationship to the global temperature.
3.2 Evaporation
In the calculations, I test the possibility that some of the inward IR gets lost in evaporation by, for example, exciting water molecules at the surface so that they escape into the atmosphere. There is an obvious limit to how much can get lost in this way, because less than half of the excited molecules would go in the right direction. I don’t put any restriction on the parameterisation for this, so the reverse engineering is free to settle on any percentage.
For the balance of thermals and evaporation, I assume that the rate varies linearly with temperature. In the real world, other factors such as wind speed are important, so there is an implicit assumption that these other factors remain unchanged. Given that we are working with a notional “average” patch of ocean over a single day, that should not be an issue.
Results suggest that about 17% of the energy from inward radiation that does not get past the top 10µm goes straight into evaporation (see parameter ‘v’ in worksheet parms). This evaporation is not temperature dependent. Results also indicate that my earlier assertion that IR’s energy “goes mainly into evaporation” is incorrect : partly, yes, but “mainly”, no (Roy Spencer will be pleased, I think).
3.3 IR vs solar radiation
IR and solar radiation do indeed differ in their ability to warm the ocean. Looked at in isolation, a Watt of direct solar radiation is nearly 50% more effective at warming the ocean than a Watt of IR.
I had expected a difference, but I had thought that the ratio would be higher. The result also shows the reason for the lower ratio: the mechanism is not what I had expected. The major factor is the temperature gradient near the ocean surface – IR isn’t fully effective at slowing the flow of energy from the ocean to the atmosphere.
In the previous article, I estimated that man-made CO2 contributed only 9% or less of the global warming over the 1983-2009 period. There were some errors in that article, addressed below. The corrected figures for the 19983-2009 period are +0.65 Wm-2 for man-made CO2, and +4.5 Wm-2 for direct solar radiation (all direct solar radiation, not just ITO). The CO2 figure is much higher than before, as explained below, and the direct solar figure is a bit lower. With the results from the NS reverse engineering, the man-made CO2 contribution to 1983-2009 global warming came out at about 9.4%, but the calculation has changed as described below.
If Dr. Antero Ollila is correct, then the figure for CO2 1983-2009 would be +0.38 Wm-2, not +0.65 Wm-2, giving a lower contribution (only 5.7%) from CO2.
3.4. Energy Accumulation
The results for different SSTs (see worksheet parms in spreadsheet OceanDiurnal.xlsx) are so similar, that the notion that absorbed solar energy at depth can build up over a long period is supported. [NB. Just ‘supported’, not proven. In interpretation of the figures, be aware of how they were calculated.]. The fact that ocean temperature just below the surface is higher than at depth means that the only way that energy at depth can escape to the atmosphere is by convection, ie. by mixing or by upwelling.
The ~118 Wm-2 retained from 10m to 100m depth is enough to warm that ocean band by nearly 10 deg C in a year (see the Heat content calculator in worksheet FluxDescr in spreadsheet OceanDiurnal.xlsx). Obviously the heat wouldn’t necessarily be retained for a whole year, but this shows that significant heat build-up is possible.
Note: After writing everything up, I have noticed that the ‘Thermals and evapotranspiration’, at 104 Wm-2, is higher than K&T’s 102 Wm-2. It should if anything be a bit lower, which suggests that I should have used a slightly higher SST. Maybe 19 deg C instead of the 18 deg C that I used. The results would change slightly, but the overall pattern and conclusions would remain unchanged. Percentage of inward IR lost to immediate evaporation would come down from 18% to 17%. I have changed the text above to use the lower number.
4. Method
The aim was to reproduce the Day & Night temperature profiles in the NS diagrams using the K&T energy budget figures, and using solar and absorption data as presented in the previous article.
The spreadsheet, OceanDiurnal.xlsx, models the upper ocean bands of a notional “average” patch of ocean in 20-second steps over one 24-hour day. Data for all inputs of energy is used unchanged, but data for outputs is used as a guide only with variable parameters. The parameters were then optimised to find the combination of inputs and outputs, together with the energy flows within the ocean, which matched both the Day and the Night NS temperature profiles in a single daily cycle.
It is all explained in spreadsheet OceanDiurnal.xlsx, worksheet FluxDescr, so I won’t repeat the details here. You can play with the figures in the spreadsheet, of course, but to run new optimisations you will need an external optimiser. You can verify that the result is correctly optimised by changing the ‘optimised’ parameters in worksheet parms.
4.1 Input Data
K&T data is taken from:

Figure 1. Global annual average energy budget, from here).
The data that the reverse engineering is trying to match is taken from the NS diagram:

Figure 2. The diurnal (day-night) cycle in the top few metres of the ocean. From Nick Stokes’ blog Moyhu. NB. The two panels have different scales on the x-axes (that’s not an issue at all, just be careful to see the panels correctly).
 
The part of the NS diagrams that I am trying to match is the top part, ie. below 1m. If you look closely at the diagrams you will see that the vertical axis is vague (“5-10m”), and that it is not accurately to scale. On a true log scale, using 10m for the last point, it looks like this:

Figure 3. Data from the NS ‘Day’ diagram. Y axis is ocean band number. “-1” is surface, 0 is to 1µm, 1 is to 10µm, then increase by a factor of 10 per band to: band 7 is to 10m. Bands 8 to 100m and 9 >100m are not covered in the NS diagrams. In the spreadsheet, band 1 is surface to 10µm.
I also use absorption data as reported on last time, but with corrections (see 5. below) and with the IR wavelengths that are missing from SORCE data estimated to match the K&T data. See spreadsheet OceanDiurnal.xlsx worksheet Absorption.
4.2 The MatchingProcess
Bands 1, 2 (10µm, 0.1mm) are very thin, and a large amount of energy goes into and out of them with very small residuals, so calculating their temperature accurately is not practical. I therefore tie bands 1 and 2 to band 3 (1mm) for optimising purposes, using temperature differences from band 3 to match the NS diagram. The adjustments needed are small, averaging a lot less than 0.01 Wm-2. I then optimise for just band 3.
The resulting match looked like this:

Figure 4. The match to NS Data obtained by the reverse engineering process.
The match at band 3 is accurate, but any attempt to match the deeper bands exactly failed because the entire profile is effectively dictated by band 3. Put simply, if energy flows more between bands – conduction radiation or mixing – then band 3 cannot get up to its daytime temperature in the NS diagram. If they flow less then the heat can’t get out fast enough at night.
5. Absorption changes from last time
 
This para refers to assumptions and calculations in the previous post. The changes listed here were made in the absorption spreadsheet from last time. The results as used are shown in worksheet Absorption of spreadsheet OceanDiurnal.xlsx.
Changes were:
· Previously, I effectively ignored energy entering the ocean at depths beyond 10m. This energy is undoubtedly added to the system, so this time I account for it. Note that this energy cannot be released into the atmosphere by conduction or radiation because the higher ocean layers are warmer, so it is actually likely to accumulate in the system for longer than energy from other wavelengths. The ocean thermocline is typically well below 100m, so is not an issue.
· A bad arithmetic error in a RF calculation, pointed out by commenter Donald L. Klipstein was corrected. Thanks, Donald, much appreciated.
· Error corrected: Different units were used for CO2 (Wm-2 actual) and ITO (ocean Wm-2 global equivalent).
· A more subtle logical error was corrected: Last time, I left out non-ITO wavelengths when estimating the proportions of warming from CO2 and ITO, because I argued that it’s the ITO wavelengths that drive multi-decadal global temperature. But CO2 operates via non-ITO wavelengths, so I should have included those wavelengths from the sun too, for correct comparison.
· For 1983-2009, I previously used solar and cloud data averaged over all the ocean. This time, I calculated them in 5-degree latitude bands in order to get a more accurate weighted trend 1983-2009. The end result was a slightly smaller trend in cloud effect over the period.
The latest results show that IR is not as effective, Watt for Watt, as direct solar radiation at warming the ocean. This is now taken into account, too.
One of my statements (“I use SORCE data for 2003. All years are almost identical.”) was challenged by Bob Weber (“All years are not ‘almost identical’ in solar activity …”). I do agree that over extended periods all years are not ‘almost identical’, but the years covered in the SORCE data, 2003-2016, were almost identical:

Figure 5. Composition of solar radiation by wavelength, from SORCE. 14 separate curves are plotted, for the 14 years 2003-2016. They are all almost exactly the same, apart from gaps where data is missing..
Bob also asked ‘A practical question’: “how long does it take for varying solar energy deposited at depth to resurface?”. The question goes to climate’s absolute core. The results reported here show that a lot of energy is deposited. I argue that the upwelling timescale is variable. In an earlier post, I said the time taken “could be days or months (eg, it might up-well quite quickly), it could be years (eg, waiting to be scooped up in an El Nino), it could be decades (eg, accumulating until an ocean oscillation such as the AMO or PDO brings it to the surface), or it could even be many centuries (eg, taken down into the deep ocean by the THC).”.
I will try to reply to Leif Svalgaard’s comments (eg. here, here) in a later post.

We are seeking the involvement of a spectrum of organizations and individuals from business, energy, civil society, Indigenous communities, education, faith, youth, government, agriculture and people whose lives are invested in fossil fuels. …Communications specialist George Marshall and the organization he co-founded, Climate Outreach, will lead this work.

The owners of Mavisbank care home in Bishopbriggs confirmed the deaths and said that a further seven residents had also tested positive for the virus.
Another 11 staff members were self-isolating following positive tests.
The Care Inspectorate rated the home in Lennox Crescent as ""weak"" in its Covid-19 response in an inspection last month.
At the unannounced check on 26 October, inspectors found the cleanliness of the home a ""significant concern"".
It went on to describe the cleanliness of the environment and the overall fabric of the building as ""poor"".
Inspectors said in their report that they were ""very concerned about the potential risk of infection for residents"".
Senior managers responded immediately and maintenance staff were deployed to clean the home.
However, the operators were ordered to carry out a deep clean of the facility by 11 November.
Mavisbank owners HC-One said they were monitoring the situation closely.
A spokeswoman said: ""Our thoughts and sympathies are with all families who have lost a loved one from coronavirus.
""As we navigate this outbreak, we continue to work closely with all the relevant authorities to contain the virus and safeguard our residents.
""We are pleased that a number of residents have now recovered, and we continue to closely monitor the health and wellbeing of all those affected.
""This includes following all government guidance in relation to infection prevention and control.""
Responding to the Care Inspectorate report, the company said the health, safety and wellbeing of its residents and staff was a priority.
The spokeswoman said: ""We were disappointed that inspectors found some elements of our robust infection control plan were not being fully implemented and we acted urgently to respond to this feedback. These issues were immediately rectified so that when inspectors returned, they were able to see and approve of the work that had been completed.
""Senior staff are also supporting the home and our learning and development team are ensuring that all colleagues complete refresher training which includes our specific coronavirus training modules on the virus, enhanced infection control procedures, and the correct use of PPE.
""These training modules have been regularly updated to reflect all changes in the guidance over recent months.""
Caroline Sinclair, of East Dunbartonshire Health and Social Care Partnership, said, ""We are aware of this very sad situation and have been working with Mavisbank care home to provide a high level of clinical support to residents at this difficult time. Our thoughts are with the families of those who have passed and others affected by their loss.""",2020-12-19T17:04:33.578390Z,1

Kent County Council (KCC), which takes responsibility for lone children arriving on its shores, said it took 23 under-18s into care on Friday alone.
A record 235 people made the crossing in 17 vessels on Thursday.
The government has said planes are due to return migrants to Europe, with a flight taking up to 20 on Wednesday.
The crossings continued on Friday, with at least 130 people believed to have arrived on UK shores after being intercepted by authorities.
Pictures showed young children being lifted from boats by Border Force officers at the Port of Dover.
Roger Gough, leader of KCC, said the authority was ""under some considerable pressure"" due to the arrival of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.
He said 65 children were taken into its care in May, 85 in June, and 70 in July.
The Home Office has refused to confirm the number of children arriving and figures provided by KCC do not include those travelling with their families.
At least 3,950 migrants have reached the UK in small boats this year.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a tweet that the number of crossings was ""shameful"" and ""unacceptably high"", adding that she was ""working to make this route unviable"" by preventing boats from leaving France as well as intercepting and returning those attempting to make a crossing.
""This is complex to do and we face serious legislative, legal and operational barriers,"" she added.
About a dozen Conservative MPs have signed a letter to Ms Patel calling for the government to stop crossings and return people who illegally cross the English Channel.
Crawley MP Henry Smith said the government needed to ""take a much more robust response with France"".
Since January 2019, more than 155 people who entered the UK on small boats have been returned to Europe. At least 5,800 people have arrived in that time.
The number due to be returned on Wednesday's flight is contained in a letter from the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement team to officials at the High Court, setting out their plan for the removal of migrants and arguing why judges should not consider late attempts to stop the flight.
The migrants will be returned to France and Germany after those countries agreed to consider their asylum claims.
The Home Office has blamed current regulations - which determine where an asylum-seeker's claim is heard - for the comparatively low number of people to have been returned to Europe.
It said the Dublin Regulations, which will not apply to the UK after Brexit, were being ""abused by both migrants and activist lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here"".

Here in Europe, that dreaded day has unfortunately arrived. This one is as welcome as a root canal treatment. Now that it’s here, for the European Establishment, it’s: let’s get it over with and hope the pain will be bearable.
In Germany the newsrooms and media are having a difficult time coming to terms with the inevitable results. The insults and nervous breakdowns are everywhere. The dreams of socialism, world goverment and climate theocracy are crumbling before their eyes.
Now, instead of being inspiring slogans, “Yes we can” and “Hope and Change” have become a big joke.
It’s that damn Tea Party, which is made up of unsophisticated, rather ignorant, white, racist, narrow minded, religious, ultra-conservative, angry gun-wielding Americans who are too stupid to know what’s good for them, all led by extremists like Sarah Palin – so laments much of the established media here. The Tea Partiers are so disinformed, e.g. many don’t even believe in the hard science of manmade global warming and believe the planet was created 6000 years ago.  If only Americans weren’t so stupid and ignorant.
Two years ago the German and European media made Obama their darling, portraying him as the savior that had delivered America and the world from the clutches of the evil Bush regime. A year later he was even awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for doing so. But that has since turned out to be a certificate of failure (think Gore, Arafat and a host of others).
Now, as Europe views it, the Tea Party express places the whole grand global plan of a world nanny state rescuing the planet from climate catastrophe and capitalism in jeopardy. Nothing gets more villified in the European press than the Tea Party (except climate deniers, that is).
Many media outlets have complained that climate initiatives will soon be blocked by these new denier Republicans. Here are some excerpts of how the German print media feels about the upcoming Congressional overhaul and the reasons behind it.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung
The USA increasingly appears to be a giant that is paralyzed by polarity. On one side you have the political middle who are attempting to implement solutions for the big challenges that the nation faces. On the other side, there’s the Tea Party, TV network Fox News and the “no”-faction who say no to government, no to taxes, no to change, no to environmental protection. In this camp there are many who believe that climate change is a big conspiracy by intellectuals or by the Chinese.

In the meantime, reality has caught up to the Obama government. The promised hope and change has stalled time and again in committees and meetings, failing because of resistantance from the political opposition.
Die Welt
Many Americans are disappointed by the economic policy of the government, even though the financial and economic crisis began on Obama’s predecesssor George W. Bush’s watch. The right-wing populist Tea Party movement, which supported many candidiates, profited the most from the frustration.
Die Zeit
In the House, Obama has had a majority of 39 seats. They will lose 70 or even 80 seats to the Republicans. Soon the conservatives will have a majority and will appoint the Speaker of the House. In the Senate the Democrats have had a majority of 59 of the 100 seats. There are surely going to be losses there too. But most likely they will hang on to a slim majority with 51 or 52 seats.
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
It is mainly the conservative grassroots Tea Party that has provided the Republicans, who took it on the chin 2 years earlier, with a Renaissance. It’s likely that the Tea Party movement will also be a major factor in 2012 with its economically motivated demands for debt reduction, spending discipline, tax cuts and smaller governments.

Let us hope that the American left’s recent publication of its “Green New Deal” (GND) won’t be contagious enough to infect Labour here.



Just over a week ago, Jeremy Corbyn had an in‐​depth phone conversation with Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez, the rising socialist congresswoman. The aim, it was said, was to “build a movement to take on the billionaires, polluters, and migrant baiters”.



US politics is generally considered to sit to the right of the UK landscape. But Ocasio-Cortez’s GND makes the 2017 Labour manifesto look like Thatcherism on steroids.





Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting.



Consider how radical Labour’s proposed policies seemed just two years’ ago. The party pledged rail, energy and water sector nationalisation, and to reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail.



It would have reintroduced or strengthened price controls, with an energy price cap, a £10 minimum wage by 2020, and private sector rent regulation. In energy, it would have banned fracking, but invested in nuclear and supported renewables to hit existing carbon emissions targets.



Now consider the GND, endorsed — unbelievably — by declared Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand. It would put the US on a national war footing to collectively achieve a net zero emissions society within one decade.



That requires gargantuan public investment to ensure that power demand is met 100 per cent by renewables within 10 years. The domestic transport system would be completely electrified, new high‐​speed rail built, flight availability curbed, and research programmes into sustainability and renewable technology funded.



Not content with this energy transformation to a near carbon‐​free utopia, the GND pledges a social transformation too. Vital in the fight against climate change, apparently, is free healthcare and higher education, a jobs guarantee for all who want to work, economic security for those who don’t, family leave, extra resources for pensioners, and a family living wage.



One could well think of the GND’s emissions‐​reducing veneer as a Trojan Horse for a progressive social policy wet dream.



The document is, for want of a better term, bonkers. But it is being treated as a serious proposal that must be assessed on its merits. The branding helps to insulate it from well‐​deserved criticism: if you’re opposed to the “Green New Deal”, then you want to kill the planet.



The truth though is that the GND goes far beyond reasonable carbon mitigation, completely denying the existence of trade‐​offs or the costs of programmes that it recommends.



While Labour’s 2017 election manifesto would be supremely damaging to the UK economy, at least there was some economic reasoning in justifying Corbyn’s ideas. With this radical new breed of Democrat, there is no acknowledgement that nationalising vast swathes of the economy could adversely affect growth by crowding out private activity. In fact, we are told the opposite, that it would make the economy stronger as well as greener.



Could such a programme ever gain traction here? One would hope not, but the lock on this radical worldview is currently being picked at by the British left.



Ocasio‐​Cortez and her cohorts are disciples of a new macroeconomic worldview called “Modern Monetary Theory” (MMT).



This postulates that governments with sovereign currencies face no financing constraints, and can spend as much as they like through new printed money. The only real constraint on spending levels is the capacity of the economy.



Even academic MMT‐​ers admit that if you pump in too much money when the economy is at full employment, inflation will rise, and will need to be choked off by higher taxes or spending cuts.



But political proponents of this kooky theory downplay this implication. In fact, they circumvent it, by claiming that, despite low unemployment, our economies are running significantly below their potential. This allows them to say that huge new spending could be financed by money printing without requiring higher taxes or resulting in rising inflation.



Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting. Last week, John McDonnell’s more mainstream fiscal rule — which would require a future Labour government to balance day‐​to‐​day spending over time — was sharply criticised by British leftists.



If Labour becomes starry‐​eyed about a GND‐​type agenda, there may well be a scramble to subscribe to a theory that promises to allow much more government spending without unpopular tax hikes.



For now, though, count your blessings. Unlike Ocasio‐​Cortez, Labour is not invoking climate change as the new Hitler to be defeated, nor promising to print money for social policy on a hunch that the economy is below capacity.



While reading the Democrats’ Green New Deal, an alien emotion swept over me. For once, I was grateful for Corbyn and McDonnell’s relative moderation.",2020-12-12T22:30:11.457438Z,1
,2020-12-13T11:55:55.130949Z,463,122,327,"Study suggests Facebook, Twitter sentiments correlate with weather patterns – no mention of climate linked sentiments
Sentiments expressed on Facebook and Twitter may be associated with certain weather patterns, according to a study published April 25, 2018 in the open-access journal PLOS ONEby Patrick Baylis from the Vancouver School of Economics, Canada, Nick Obradovich from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, and colleagues.
Previous research has identified a potential link between weather and people’s emotional states, but which specific weather conditions trigger positive or negative emotions and how to measure these sentiments in an accurate and consistent way require further investigation.
To examine the association between weather conditions and expressed sentiments, the authors of the present study gathered 2.4 billion posts from Facebook and 1.1 billion from Twitter between the years 2009 and 2016. They analyzed the sentiment for each post using a special tool that categorizes posts based on keywords as positive or negative.
The researchers found that temperature, precipitation, humidity, and cloud cover each were strongly associated with an expression of sentiment, whether positive or negative. Positive expressions increase up to 20 degrees Celsius and decline as the temperature goes over 30 degrees Celsius. They also found that precipitation was associated with more negative expressed sentiment. Days with a humidity level of 80% or higher were associated with negative expressions, as were days with a high amount of cloud cover.
While the sentiment analysis tool used is imperfect, this study can help provide insight into how weather conditions might impact sentiments expressed via social media, which can act as a proxy for underlying human emotional states. Understanding the potential impact of weather on our emotions is important considering our constant exposure to weather conditions.
“We find that how we express ourselves is shaped by the weather outside,” says Nick Obradovich. “Adverse weather conditions — hot and cold temperatures, precipitation, added humidity, and increased cloud cover — reduce the sentiment of human expressions across billions of social media posts drawn from millions of US residents.”

,2020-12-19T16:53:58.520366Z,464,118,82,"Contributed by Robert Lyman 2020. Lyman’s bio can be read here. There are four ways in which actual global trends are diverging more and more from the predictions upon which climate activists base their claims of impending catastrophe and allegedly “inevitable decarbonization” of the world economy.After almost thirty years of measurement, the gentle rise in average global temperatures is near the bottom of the range projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If, as many now expect, the world enters a cooling trend over the next few decades, average temperatures will fall entirely outside that range, and demonstrate conclusively that the IPCC models do not provide a reliable foundation for climate policy.https://blog.friendsofscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/When-Climate-Prophecy-Fails-FINAL.pdfWhen-Climate-Prophecy-Fails-FINALDownloadFossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) now supply 84% of global energy needs, and consumption of oil and natural gas is rising at its fastest rate in history, with no current prospect of subsiding. If, as projected by all major authorities on global energy supply and demand, these trends continue through to 2030 and beyond, driven by economic growth in Asia, why would people in the OECD countries accept the claims of climate activists that they must reduce their use of fossil fuels?Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased, not decreased, by 12 per cent over the past decade, despite claims that the world must sharply reduce emissions. Even if global emissions were to stabilize, as some forecasters suggest, that will represent a major departure from the “pathways” to reduced emissions that climate alarmists say is essential. At which point will the claims of rapid decarbonization become untenable?Following the COP21 conference in Paris in 2015, many OECD countries submitted plans about how they would reduce GHG emissions by 2030. Many developing countries submitted similar plans conditional upon receiving financial assistance in the form of the Green Climate Fund (i.e. U.S. $100 billion per year). When countries report on their progress before the November 2020 COP, it will become clear that nine out the ten largest GHG emitters are not on track to meet the 2030 targets. The total contributions to the Green Climate Fund, as of mid-2018, were $10.2 billion. Despite the certain calls for more aggressive emission reductions, it will be clear by the end of this year that the entire U.N. artifice of supposed commitments to decarbonization is flawed.When reality fails to match prophesy, those who follow climate and energy policy developments closely will see the rationale for drastic transition crumble. The Canadian public, unfortunately, may not react until climate taxes and other measures impose intolerable costs on the average person.

,2020-12-19T16:58:46.840314Z,466,118,803,"Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s another compelling reason why we should all be hoping that the earth will warm and not cool over the coming decades. (After all, there is no way the temperature is going to stay stagnant).
The print edition of yesterday’s UK Daily Mail has a short report on an international study on the effects of temperature on death rates. The comprehensive study was conducted by the Dr. Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It examined 74 million deaths in 13 countries.
Also read it at Science Daily (Can’t link because I’m writing from a mobile device – just Google it).
The result, The Daily Mail writes:
7.71 per cent of the deaths were caused by non-optimal temperatures. Cold was responsible for 7.29 per cent of deaths, while 0.42% were attributable to heat, according to the study, published by the Lancet medical journal.”
In other words, deaths from cold were some 20 times than those from heat.
What is interesting is that the study found that most of the deaths occurred when the temperatures were “moderately hot and cold”. This may be due to people underestimating the “moderate” anomalies, and thus failing to take the corresponding precautions. On extremely hot or cold days, on the other hand, the level of awareness is heightened due to media hype, and so people tend to behave accordingly, i.e. drink more fluids, or really bundle up.
Cold is the last thing we need
The study tells us one thing: Cold is the last thing we want to see, and any warming needs to be welcome. Unfortunately recent temperature data and climate trends bode ill, as a number of distinguished scientists are forecasting cooling over the coming decades due to ocean and solar cycles swinging into their cool modes.
Given the results of the study, which are obvious to most normal thinking people, one would need to be a total moron, or just plain mean-spirited,  to be rooting for cooling.

,2020-12-12T22:32:21.835661Z,468,118,164,"The Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   
  
Have climate models, which are claimed by our friends like Ben Santer, to accurately represent the climate of the 20th century gotten things right for the wrong reasons? New research on the role of carbon aerosols suggests that this may be the case. If it is, it does not bode well for the accuracy of forward projections made by the same climate models.   
  
This would represent a classic case of “overfitting”— building a model with bells and whistles added and tuned so as to match the data at hand, but which then breaks down when trying to predict out-of-sample observations. This occurs because the overfitted model has been polished up to give the appearance of capturing the underlying behaviors driving the system—an appearance that is often good enough to fool even the model builders—but, in fact, the appearance is only skin deep, and the mechanisms driving things in the real world differ from those from which the model was built.   
  
A recent paper by Dr. Tami Bond and colleagues finds that carbon aerosols—particulates released into that atmosphere from a variety of human activities including diesel engines, open cook stoves, poorly filtered coal burning, and open burning, etc.—have played a _much_ larger role in impacting the climate than has been previously recognized (and included in climate models).   
  
For instance, Bond et al. report  that black carbon aerosol, or soot, is second only to carbon dioxide as the substance emitted by human activity that has the greatest warming influence on the climate—contributing a quarter (or perhaps even a bit more) to the current overall anthropogenic warming effect. Bond et al. find that the total warming impact from black carbon emissions is about 70% as large as that from carbon dioxide emissions.   
  
These finding are similar to those reported a few years ago by Ramanathan and Carmichael but grossly dissimilar to those from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says that black carbon is responsible for only about 10% of the total anthropogenic warming influence.   
  
Apparently, climate models incorporate even less of an influence from black carbon. According to Bond et al. “global atmospheric absorption attributable to black carbon is too low in many models, and should be increased by a factor of almost three.”   
  
There are several interesting implications.   




When divvying up the causes of the observed global warming over the past 50 years, a much larger percentage is now recognized to result from something other than carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.   
  
Figure 1 shows our tally, based on the IPCC’s latest climate compendium, and the results from Bond et al.   






Figure 1. Relative warming influence of the major anthropogenic emissions (whiskers are the 90% uncertainly bounds).   
  
If you combine the results in Figure 1 with those recently reported concerning other (non -greenhouse gas) influences on the observed temperature history, you must conclude that carbon dioxide was responsible for less than one-third of the observed warming since the mid-20th century reported in the IPCC’s _Fourth Assessment Report_. Further, the warming from _all_ greenhouse gases amounts to something less than 60% of the total.   
  
There seems a disproportionate amount of handwringing about the climate influence of carbon dioxide, when the climate influence on black carbon is nearly as great. And, of course, soot doesn’t come with the plant fertilization benefits that carbon dioxide emissions provide (see here for example).   
  
Another eye-opening consequence of the Bond et al. finding is that the modeled climate change “fingerprints” are missing the influence of black carbon—which is now much larger (and consequently much more important) than has been recognized.   
  
That “fingerprint” studies have proclaimed success at matching observed patterns of climate change with those projected by climate models run with anthropogenic atmospheric inputs—yet which omit black carbon—can only be a sign of overfitting.   
  
All else being equal, if the black carbon absorption in climate models were to be increased by a factor of almost three (to better match the findings of Bond et al.), they would certainly predict far too much warming to have already occurred. But these models have already accomplished this _without_ black carbon!   
  
One potential reason is that “all else is _not_ equal.” When black carbon is emitted, so is all sorts of other stuff, like sulfur dioxide and organic carbon. These tend to have a cooling impact on the climate, as they generally act to increase the amount of solar energy that is reflected back into space.   
  
According to Bond et al., although the amount of (warming) black carbon emitted into the atmosphere has been underestimated, so too has the amount of the (cooling) co-emissions. When everything is tallied up in net, the effect turns out to be very near zero.   
  
One might argue that if the net impact is zero, it doesn’t matter that the climate models have the wrong amount of black carbon (and co-emissions) in them.   
  
But this would be a far too generous and simplistic. The historical (in both time and space) characteristics of black carbon emissions, although not well known, are almost certainly different from the characteristics of historical emissions of greenhouse gases (and sulfate aerosols). The difference arises because the sources of the different types of emissions are, to an important degree, not the same.   
  
Which means the behavior of the true climate system is different from the behavior of the (overfitted) model climate system.   
  
Until you have a pretty good handle on the sources, and how they have changed over time (in magnitude and space), there is no way to way to get an accurate handle on projections, either in the past or the future.   
  
So “fingerprint” studies which claim to find close correspondence between climate model projections and actual observations during the past 50 to 100 years are confused as to both causes and effects.   
  
The bottom line of the Bond et al. study is that the relative impact of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions is much less than widely thought, the relative impact of black carbon is greater than thought, and climate models’ views of the past and projections of the future must therefore be tainted.   
  
Tainted and confused models are the last thing we need for producing science-based policy.

Its economy shrank 3.2% in the July-to-September period compared with the prior quarter, figures showed, confirming earlier preliminary data.
It means the economy has contracted for two quarters in a row, which is the usual definition of a recession.
Tourists are staying away and shops are suffering amid battles between anti-government protesters and police.
""Domestic demand worsened significantly in the third quarter, as the local social incidents took a heavy toll on consumption-related activities and subdued economic prospects weighed on consumption and investment sentiment,"" the government said in a statement.
It now expects the economy to shrink 1.3% for the full year.
""Ending violence and restoring calm are pivotal to the recovery of the economy. The government will continue to closely monitor the situation and introduce measures as necessary to support enterprises and safeguard,"" the government added.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption and a number of deaths.
On Thursday, a 70-year-old cleaner died after he was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui.
Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head.
Dramatic scenes such as these have kept tourists away. In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003.
Some hotels have slashed prices as they struggle to fill their rooms.
On Thursday, two companies with major operations in Hong Kong revealed the financial impact of the protests.
Luxury fashion house Burberry said its sales in Hong Kong had fallen by more than 10% and would ""remain under pressure"".
Airline Cathay Pacific cut its profit guidance and said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.
Monday's protests followed a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died last week.
Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters.
In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said.
Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting the unpopular extradition bill that triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation.",2020-12-13T11:56:16.138843Z,1

The Cairns Post here has an article: Sea Shepherd guilty of diesel spill that dropped up to 500 litres of diesel into the Trinity Inlet.
Hat-tip: reader Jim
The article is from earlier this year, but it neither got media attention nor the attention it deserves.
What really strikes me is that the environmental organization comes in with its lawyers and fights tooth and nail in claiming that they really acted responsibly and that the accident was not entirely their fault. The excuses they presented are truly sad and pathetic and show an amazing ignorance when it comes to industrial safety regulation and management.
For example, the Cairns Post writes:
A FAULTY switch and instruction manuals written entirely in Japanese have been blamed in court for why a ship owned by conservation group Sea Shepherd dropped up to 500 litres of diesel into the Trinity Inlet.”
Sorry, but using a piece of equipment that you do not understand is gross negligence. Sea Shepard’s motto here obviously was: Let’s just get this thing running (and safety be damned!)

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




It’s not for nothing that the fundamental industry standard for any piece of such equipment is: Be sure you have read the manual and have UNDERSTOOD it! The crew obviously could not read Japanese, let alone understand it. Here they should have requested a manual in English from the manufacturer, or at least shelled out the money for a translation, before recklessly attempting to put it into operation at sea. They should especially have at least understood the critical technical points dealing with fuel.
The Cairns Times reports that “a crew member named Gabor Nosty failed to manually flick the “low level” switch during a fuel transfer, despite being aware the switch was faulty.”
If that isn’t gross negligence, then I don’t what is. It is management’s responsibility to be sure that its personnel are qualified and trained to carry out the work they have been assigned to do. Most industrial norms and regulations aren’t there to harass companies, but to prevent accidents involving human life and health, property and the environment. The Sea Shepard crew ignored this entirely.
And not only could they not read the vessel’s operating manual, according to the Cairns Times the Sea Shepherd Australia had bought the ship from Japan a week earlier and “had yet to translate signage and manuals or repair the switch“. Again putting a piece of equipment into operation when its crucial safety signs cannot be read is extremely reckless. The crew can count themselves fortunate nothing much worse happened. We are not talking about a TV here, rather a large piece of industrial equipment with lots of power – with people on board – and all around you.
The article also writes that because the chief engineer did not have a manual they could understand, the crew “had to work out the ship’s systems ‘by his own devices’“. This means they were guessing its operational function. This is something you never should do. You wait for a manual you can read, then you read it, and make sure you’ve understood it. Then you can start to use it.
The article also writes that the crew included some Germans. My wife’s company does a lot of translations of German industrial manuals and handbooks. The Germans are gurus when it comes to industrial safety regulation, policy and management. If any one should understand industrial regulation and the importance of adhering to safety standards, it is the Germans. Obviously the Germans on the Sea Shepard crew did not complete a German apprenticeship, or they slept through it.
All the crew members came from an advanced technological country. It’s amazing how activists are always calling for more stringent safety regulations and environmental protection laws, yet they themselves can’t even adhere to the most rudimentary and obvious safety rules. It’s the Japanese manufacturer’s fault!
Despite all the Sea Shepard’s gross negligence, recklessness and disregard for human, property and environmental safety, it appears the crew will get off real easy.

Diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays during August.
The Treasury said restaurants have so far made 130,000 claims worth Â£522m, figures likely to rise as outlets have until the end of September to claim.
Restaurant bookings surged during the scheme, especially on the final day.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""From the get-go our mission has been to protect jobs, and to do this we needed to be creative, brave and try things that no government has ever done before.
""Today's figures continue to show Eat Out to Help Out has been a success. I want to thank everyone, from restaurant owners to waiters, chefs and diners, for embracing it and helping drive our economic recovery.""
About 84,700 restaurants signed up for Eat Out to Help Out.
According to data from booking site OpenTable, restaurant reservations rose by 53% compared with the Monday-to-Wednesday period in August 2019.
In July, restaurant bookings were down 54% on Mondays-to-Wednesdays, compared with July 2019.
The final day of the scheme, Monday 31 August, saw a 216% jump in bookings against the equivalent day in 2019, according to OpenTable.
The government has set aside Â£500m to fund Eat Out to Help Out. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data.
However, the scheme has critics. Some pubs and restaurants pulled out in August, citing increased hostility towards staff trying to cope with the increased demand and need for social distancing. Some outlets were concerned the scheme could pull in diners earlier in the week to the detriment of weekend trade.
In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecast the scheme would most likely be a ""giveaway"" that benefitted those well-off enough to eat out. And anti-obesity campaigners said the scheme ""would be a green light to promote junk food"".
However, Stephen Wall, managing director and co-founder of the Pho restaurant chain, said it ""has really been amazing. It has certainly benefited our early-week figures and seems to have encouraged the British public to dine out safely, as our restaurants are filling up and staying busy throughout the weekend, too.""
And Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, said spending data collected by the bank suggested the scheme had given a ""real boost"" to the hospitality sector.
He added: ""Consumer feedback was also very encouraging, with almost one in five planning to continue dining out more often... and a similar number saying that they will return to restaurants that they would not have visited otherwise.""
Mr Sunak has ruled out extending the scheme, but some pub and restaurant chains, including Pizza Hut and Bill's, have said they will finance similar offers this month following the jump in demand.",2020-12-19T17:04:43.391119Z,1

Arabic records allow past climate to be reconstructed
The study has been published in Weather, a publication of the Royal Meteorological Society
Corals, trees and marine sediments, among others, are direct evidence of the climate of the past, but they are not the only indicators. A team led by Spanish scientists has interpreted records written in Iraq by Arabic historians for the first time and has made a chronology of climatic events from the year 816 to 1009, when cold waves and snow were normal.
The Arabic historians’ records chronologically narrate social, political and religious matters, and some of them mention climate. A study led by researchers from the University of Extremadura (Spain) has focused on ancient meteorological notes of the Iraqi city of Baghdad. 
“We have recovered an interesting chronology of climatic events, such as droughts, floods, rain, frost, heat and cold waves as well as strong winds during the period between 816-1009 in the areas now known as Iraq and Syria” Fernando Domínguez-Castro, lead author and researcher in the Physics department at the University of Extremadura, informed SINC.
This study, which has been published in the Weather journal, highlights a high number of cold waves. “The period between 902 and 944 had a high number if we compare them to current weather data. Examples of this are the six snowfalls that occurred in that period, whilst in our era, we only know of one snowfall in Baghdad on 11 January 2008” Domínguez-Castro highlights.
More cold days due to volcanic eruptions
The research team was especially surprised by the “unexpected” drop in temperatures in July 920. According to the documents analysed, the people of Baghdad had to come down from their roofs (where they would usually sleep in the summer) and go inside their houses and even use blankets. The temperatures could have dropped 9ºC compared to the current average for the month of July.
“It is difficult to identify the cause of this drop in temperature, but it could be due to a volcanic eruption the year before, as it is common for summer temperatures to drop in these cases” the expert points out and says that during some of those nights in July 920, temperatures did not exceed 18ºC.
There were two significant volcanic eruptions during that period, which could be the cause of the cold waves, “although there is a lot of doubt surrounding the dates”, the researcher states. One of those was the Ceboruco volcano (Mexico), around 930, and the other was the Guagua Pichincha (Ecuador), around 910. Nonetheless, “more evidence is necessary to confirm this hypothesis” the expert warns.
The research shows that during the first half of the tenth century, the cold climatic events in Baghdad were more frequent and more intense than today. Although in the Iraqi city only two days with temperatures below 0ºC were registered between 1954 and 2008, there were at least six very cold days in a 42 year period in the tenth century.
According to the researchers, “the Arabic records are very useful for reconstructing the climate in eras and places about which we know very little”. Thanks to the synergy of humans and science ‘robust climate information’ has been extracted” they conclude.
Baghdad, the centre of the empire
In 762, Abu Ja’far Abdallah al-Mansur, the second Abbasid Caliph (the second Islamic dynasty), founded the city of Baghdad and established it as the capital of the empire. The city soon became the most prosperous place at the time, and the centre of international trade and agricultural development, which attracted a growing population.
Historians of the era debated reasons as to why the Caliph gave so much importance to Baghdad. As well as its strategic location between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the city had good weather conditions. “There was plenty of water, the weather was very warm in the summer, very cold in the winter, and moderate in spring and autumn,” Al-Ya`qubi described, author of a geographical treatise in 891.

,2020-12-13T10:18:32.899111Z,474,118,12,"Reposted from MasterResource
By Robert Bradley Jr. — November 27, 2020
[Editor Note: It was during the Thanksgiving weekend 11 years ago that the Climategate’s unsettling oeuvre was first being disseminated and analyzed. This post summarizes some remembrances from that period.]
“The conflict between the two ideas about how science should be conducted–a closed system dominated by gatekeepers, or a more chaotic but less hierarchical open system–is the dominant story of the [Climategate] emails over more than a decade.” – Fred Pierce, The Climate Files (2010), p. 13.
“There is no doubt that these emails are embarrassing and a public-relations disaster for science.” – Andrew Dessler, “Climate E-Mails Cloud the Debate,” December 10, 2009.
Climategate lives in infamy. Then, and now, it is a case study of agendas driving science rather than science driving agendas.
Eleven years ago, climate alarmists and friends (including Dessler above) went into damage control. But with such an evidentiary record of scientific malpractice, books solidified the record such as:
The Hockey Stick Illusion, by A. W. Montford (2010)Hiding the Decline: A History of the Climategate Affair, by A. W. Montford (2012)Climategate: The Crutape Letters, by Steven Mosher and Thomas Fuller (2010)Climategate, by Brian Sussmanh (2010)A Disgrace to the Profession, by Mark Steyn (2015)
Perhaps the most revealing book was by a fair broker of mainstream climate science, Fred Pierce, The Climate Files (2010). Pierce fairly identified Michael Mann as the worst of the bad actors–and Steve McIntyre as the data liberator. Regarding Michael Mann (p. 90):
Mann has always been a tasty target. His voluble style has made enemies and exasperated his friends. “The goddam guy is a slick talker and super-confident. He won’t listen to anyone else,” one of climate science’s most senior figures … told me. “I don’t trust people like that. A lot of data sets he uses are shitty, you know. They are just not up to what he is trying to do….”
And in contrast, Steve McIntyre (pp. 13–14):
Climategate would not have happened without … Steve McIntyre. Whether you see him as a hero or a villain, his data wars with Mann, Jones, Briffa, and Santer helped create the siege mentality among the scientists, and set them on a path of opposition to freedom of information. By drawing in scores of data liberationists from both inside and outside the science community, he certainly inspired whoever stole and released the emails.
Here are some remembrances of the good guys and gals for the record.
James Delingpole
“Of course, if you believe the mainstream media, Climategate was little more than a fake news story concocted by a small cabal of wicked deniers in order to discredit the noble cause of climate science. This is a lie and a particularly dangerous lie at that.”
“Climategate was the scandal that exposed this truth to the world. And that’s why the increasingly powerful alarmist Establishment has long fought so hard to play down its significance. The alarmists — helped by a lazily complicit media — are trying to do to the scandal what Harvey Keitel’s Winston ‘The Wolf’ Wolfe character did in Pulp Fiction: clean up the bodies, pretend nothing untoward ever happened.”
“My own involvement in Climategate was actually quite modest. At least, the heavy lifting was done by people much more diligent and scientifically minded than me, such as Steve McIntyre, Willis Eschenbach, Joanna Nova, Anthony Watts, Lucia Liljegren, Andrew Montford, Ross McKitrick, Fred Pearce, Roger Tallbloke, Christopher Booker, David Rose, Jeff Id, Jean S, Steven Mosher, and many others.”
“What Climategate revealed, however, is that the climate change ‘experts’ we’re supposed to trust just aren’t trustworthy. They lie, they cheat, they’re motivated more by grant-troughing and dodgy political activism than they are by — lol — the disinterested quest for knowledge. That was the real shocker at the time of Climategate: that the people on whose ‘expert’ wisdom trillions of dollars worth of your money and my money are being spent on sundry green boondoggles are in fact a lousy bunch of fraudulent second-raters unfit to run a cookie bake sale, let alone a scam involving upwards of one percent of the global economy.”
Anthony Watts
“In November 2009 I was in Brussels at a climate skeptic conference being put on by Hans Lobohm. I remember the first message I got…. “You need to look at this!“. Then reading the emails, wide-eyed, and realizing I [decided] … under no circumstances would we write anything about it or release it until I was back on U.S. soil. Then, after clearing customs at Dulles two days later, I sat down in the airport, and wrote the story, breaking the news on the 19th.”
“Luckily, James Delingpole picked up the story for his column, and its entry into the British newspaper The Telegraph started the chain reaction that made the story grow, becoming the ‘worst scientific scandal of our generation‘.”
“But while proponents of ‘the cause’ (most notably the execrable Michael E. Mann in a recent op-ed for Newsweek) pat themselves on the back comforting each other with ‘there’s nothing to see here’, there are reasons to rejoice about Climategate ten years later.”
“Climategate brought chaos to Copenhagen aka COP15 – critically wounding the prospects of cap-and-trade legislation in the process. It helped the world dodge the climate mania bullet for 5 years, until the Paris accord in 2015.”
Donald Trump became aware of the Climategate story, years before he became President, and I have to think (since he has mentioned it) that it affected his opinion…. And as we know, as President, he fulfilled his campaign promises and pulled the USA out of the Paris Climate Accord, and gutted the draconian EPA.
“For [the above], I am proud to have had a part, along with the Heartland Institute, whose advice and support gave Trump even more ammunition to pull off the withdrawal from the Paris accord.”
Judith Curry
“There was no exoneration [of Climategate] by any objective analysis of the various inquiries. Ross McKitrick lays all this out in his article Understanding the Climategate Inquiries.”
“The scientists involved in the email exchanges manipulated evidence in IPCC and WMO reports with the effect of misleading readers, including policymakers. The divergence problem was concealed by deleting data to ‘hide the decline.’ The panels that examined the issue in detail, namely Muir Russell’s panel, concurred that the graph was ‘misleading.’ The ridiculous attempt by the Penn State Inquiry to defend an instance of deleting data and splicing in other data to conceal a divergence problem only discredits their claims to have investigated the issue.”
“The scientists privately expressed greater doubts or uncertainties about the science in their own professional writings and in their interactions with one another than they allowed to be stated in reports of the IPCC or WMO that were intended for policymakers. Rather than criticise the scientists for this, the inquiries (particularly the House of Commons and Oxburgh inquiries) took the astonishing view that as long as scientists expressed doubts and uncertainties in their academic papers and among themselves, it was acceptable for them to conceal those uncertainties in documents prepared for policy makers.”
“… academics reading the emails could see quite clearly the tribalism at work, and in comparison to other fields, climatology comes off looking juvenile, corrupt and in the grip of a handful of self-appointed gatekeepers and bullies.”
“Given the huge stakes and the serious structural issues surrounding the assessment of climate science and policy that had emerged from Climategate, these concerns of the climate scientists seem small-minded and naïve, not to mention counter-productive –  ‘circling the wagons’ even tighter made the situation even worse.”
“At the time of Climategate, public advocacy by climate scientists of climate policy was generally frowned upon, and only a few senior, well-established scientists dared to do this (e.g. Jim Hansen). At this point, climate scientist/activists are very large in number, and such activism seems to be a ticket to professional success.”
“… Climategate lives on in numerous lawsuits that Michael Mann has filed related to criticisms of his behavior related to the hockeystick. Most of these lawsuits continue to languish since they were filed about 8 years ago (although Mann did lose his lawsuit against Tim Ball). With these lawsuits, there is no denying that the impacts of Climategate are still playing out.”
Update: The New “Denialists”
Some of the involved scientists, such as Michael Mann, as well as a five-part series of blogs at DESMOG have felt it necessary to relive the controversy. None dare do the most simple thing: provide the quotations. (I provided a dirty dozen here that speak for themselves.)
Mann states:
While the fossil fuel industry had for decades sought to forestall regulation of carbon emissions, Climategate illustrated the depths of dishonesty to which denialists were willing to sink in their efforts to sabotage action on climate. It was a tacit admission on their part that they no longer had a legitimate case to make.And so citing “Climategate” as a reason for inaction has become a simple “tell” in the climate discourse. Those who do it are acting in bad faith. They are not honest actors expressing true belief. They are dissemblers intentionally misrepresenting the science and the scientists to score political points on behalf of the fossil fuel interests whose bidding they are doing.
Such an interpretation is wishful versus actual history. (It is still not known who hacked the emails; just that they were hacked.) And Michael Mann was at the center of it, inspiring one professional climatologist to humorously opine that Mann “belongs in the state pen, not Penn State.”

The Christion Science Monitor had a detailed article recently that brought in a surprisng source – NASA GISS – an entity that seems firmly entrenched in the AGW- CO2 theory of climate change. Here are some excerpts from the article:
Researchers say they’ve found puzzling correlations between changes in the sun’s output and weather and climate patterns on Earth. These links appear to rise above the level of misinterpreted data or faulty equipment.
“There are some empirical bits of evidence that show interesting relationships we don’t fully understand,” says Drew Shindell, a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.
For example, he cites a 2001 study in which scientists looked at cloud cover over the United States from 1900 to 1987 and found that average cloud cover increased and decreased in step with the sun’s 11-year sunspot cycle. The most plausible cause, they said: changes in the ultraviolet (UV) light the sun delivers to the stratosphere.

Researchers say they’ve found puzzling correlations between changes in the sun’s output and weather and climate patterns on Earth. These links appear to rise above the level of misinterpreted data or faulty equipment.
“There are some empirical bits of evidence that show interesting relationships we don’t fully understand,” says Drew Shindell, a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.
For example, he cites a 2001 study in which scientists looked at cloud cover over the United States from 1900 to 1987 and found that average cloud cover increased and decreased in step with the sun’s 11-year sunspot cycle. The most plausible cause, they said: changes in the ultraviolet (UV) light the sun delivers to the stratosphere.

Dr. Peter Stott of the U.K.’s Hadley Center was a contributing author to Chapter 10 “Global Climate Projections” of the 2007 U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) _Fourth Assessment_ _Report_.   
  
  
He is also the lead author of a new paper just published in the scientific journal _Environmental Research Letters_.   
  
  
For those of you who have been following much that we have been writing about climate change, the following will only be surprising in its candor.   
  
  
So, without further ado (we promise this time) here is the title of Stott and colleagues new paper:   




“The upper end of climate model temperature projections is inconsistent with past warming”

By Kirye
and Pierre Gosselin
We keep hearing how the ice at the poles is supposedly disappearing rapidly, yet a look at the latest data show this is not the case. Polar ice has remained steady for the last decades.
Antarctic rebounding, trending upwards
Antarctic ice has in fact trended upwards since satellite measurement began 40 years ago.

Data: JMA.
A brand new article here describes how “Antarctica is not rapidly melting.”
Svalbard sea ice well above average

Die kalte Sonne site writes that something unexpected has happened in the Atlantic Ocean around Svalbard: The extent of sea ice there is far greater than the long-term average, as the following graph from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute shows:

What’s going on in the North Atlantic? How does all this ice fit with the earlier warnings that the sea ice is getting less and less?
German meteorologist Klaus Paetzold shows on his website many more interesting observations of ice and snow in the northern hemisphere.
Canadian winters lasting longer?
Though climate alarmists often claim Canada is warming twice as fast as the globe, the real, untampered data show that 5 of 9 stations in Canada – for which the JMA has near complete data – have had no warming trend in the month of March since 1986.

Source: JMA
Additionally, only one station shows a warming trend since 1998. Spring seems to be taking more time to arrive in Canada. 
Summarizing: nothing dramatic is really happening at the earth’s poles.

Green Hell Blog writes: The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused late Friday to stop the EPA’s greenhouse gas rules from going into  effect on January 2, 2011. The litigation over the rules will continue,  but the court will allow them to go into effect pending the outcome of  the litigation.
From WaPo
A U.S. appellate court Friday turned down a request from utilities, oil  refiners and the state of Texas to delay the regulation of greenhouse  gas emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency.

As a result, the EPA and state agencies can begin to insist that  companies use the “best available control technologies” to restrict  emissions of carbon dioxide to obtain air permits.
The companies and Texas had sought a court order blocking the EPA from  moving ahead until the end of a lawsuit challenging the agency’s finding  that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants and large  industrial facilities endanger the health of Americans.
The companies contend in that lawsuit that the EPA regulations would be too costly.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the  companies “have not shown that the harms they allege are ‘certain,’  rather than speculative.”

Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades.
Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons.
Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city.
The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began.
The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force.
Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons.
A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday.
The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside.
Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT).
They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus.
Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated.
""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday.
""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back.""
Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university.
**By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time**
It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck.
Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped.
Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug.
The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police.
The government recently confirmed the city had entered its first recession for a decade.
In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators.
A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs.
In a statement the university had urged those occupying the campus to leave.
""Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations,"" it said.
On Saturday, in a move that sparked controversy, Chinese soldiers in shorts and T-shirts took to the streets to help clean up debris and remove barricades.
It was the first time since the protests erupted that Chinese soldiers, who very rarely leave their barracks in Hong Kong, had taken to the streets.
Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"".
Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China.
The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.",2020-12-13T11:57:05.006967Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:54:35.038796Z,482,122,709,"Tax credits provided by the federal government to developers of low‐​income housing are poorly monitored and have suffered from mission creep. Instead of providing housing to households whose incomes are below the poverty line, many states are using these funds to socially engineer people into living in high‐​density housing projects along transit corridors.



Low‐​Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) is the federal government’s largest program for building affordable housing, costing the Treasury $10 billion a year. This compares with less than $3 billion a year spent on the Department of Housing & Urban Development’s (HUD’s) public housing capital program. Yet LIHTCs are administered not by HUD but by the Internal Revenue Service, which relies on state housing agencies to oversee the program.



Many states, however, are more interested in using the funds to boost transit ridership than to provide housing for people living in poverty. The housing that is built is anything but affordable, often costing three times as much per square foot as housing built without subsidies. Only a few units of subsidized housing are affordable to people living below the poverty line; most are available to any household earning less than the urban area’s median income, which literally means half the households in the region.



The rules are based on assumptions that high‐​density housing and public transit are somehow more energy efficient and climate‐​friendly than single‐​family homes and driving. 



As the Los Angeles Tenants Union complains, “U.S. housing policy has become a market‐​driven, mixed‐​income program of ‘Affordable Housing’ for carefully selected, mostly middle‐​income tenants, largely excluding the very poor.”



Each year, the IRS apportions out LIHTCs to the states based on population. The states then give the tax credits to various for‐​profit or non‐​profit developers, which can use the credits to offset their federal income taxes or sell the credits to other companies. LIHTCs can be used to pay for up to 70 percent of the cost of supposedly affordable housing, with other state and local funds often making up most of the other 30 percent.



The result is that developers put up almost none of their own money to build low‐​income housing. The rents they collect are restricted to keep the housing affordable but certainly pay for the costs of operating the housing. After 30 years, the restrictions are lifted and the property owners can charge market rates, sometimes leading to a doubling or tripling of rents.



To see how this program works in detail, I recently examined dozens of housing projects funded in Seattle since 2008. Almost all of these projects were built or are being built by non‐​profit organizations such as Mercy Housing, which has low‐​income housing projects in 18 states ranging from California to Georgia.



These projects cost an average of about $300,000 per apartment unit, which sounds affordable in a region where the median home price is $780,000. But while the median home in Seattle is around 2,000 square feet in size, the average unit built with low‐​income housing funds is less than 700 square feet.



Current home construction costs in Seattle average $141 per square foot. The affordable housing projects, however, cost an average of $532 per square foot. This included basic construction costs (including contingencies) of $260 per square foot, plus all sorts of additional fees and costs including $40 of “developer fees” (meaning money for the non‐​profit), $38 per square foot for land acquisition, and the costs of constructing common areas such as hallways in multifamily dwellings. For comparison, new homes in Buckeye, Arizona sell for as low as $126.55 per square foot, including the land, all permits and hookups, developer fees, and other costs.



One reason construction is more expensive in Seattle is that Seattle has an urban‐​growth boundary that has driven average land prices to $1.3 million an acre, compared with under $300,000 an acre in fast‐​growing urban areas that have no urban‐​growth boundaries such as Atlanta, Houston, and Raleigh. Yet none of the non‐​profits that build low‐​income housing in Seattle make any effort to repeal the state’s growth‐​management law, which has more than doubled inflation‐​adjusted rental rates in Seattle since it was passed in 1990. Why should they, when high housing costs increase the demand for their projects?



An even bigger problem is that most of the Seattle projects weren’t really built to provide affordable housing; instead, they were built to provide customers to the region’s light‐​rail system. To be eligible for state and city housing funds covering the 30 percent of costs that LIHTCs won’t pay, Seattle projects have to comply with an “Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard” that requires, among other things, “compact development,” “access to public transportation,” and “walkable neighborhoods.” As a result, all but two of the 30 projects whose applications I examined in detail were mid‐​rises (4- to 6‐​story) or high‐​rises (7‐​plus stories). Such projects are much more expensive to build due to the need for more structural steel and concrete, not to mention all of the common areas they require that aren’t needed for single‐​family homes.



These rules are based on assumptions that high‐​density housing and public transit are somehow more energy efficient and climate‐​friendly than single‐​family homes and driving. In fact, midrise and high‐​rise construction uses far more energy and emits more greenhouse gases per square foot than low‐​rise construction. Multifamily housing also uses more energy per square foot than single‐​family housing. Furthermore, public transit uses more energy and emits more greenhouse gases per passenger mile than driving an average car. High‐​density housing is only more “sustainable” if people are willing to live in cramped apartments—but even then, smaller single‐​family homes would use even less energy.



“Government will malperform if an activity is under pressure to satisfy different constituencies with different values and different demands,’’ wrote Peter Drucker in his 1989 book, _The New Realities_. ‘‘Performance requires concentration on one goal.” Agencies administering affordable housing funds have lost sight of their goal and so the money they spend doesn’t help as many people as it could.



Not that the housing built in Seattle’s project helps many low‐​income people. Many of the units are available to any household that earns less than the Seattle-area’s median income, which was $93,000 in 2019, and only a few are affordable to those who truly have low incomes. Despite the fact that the non‐​profits that built the projects spent none of their own money on the capital costs, the rents they charge for most of the apartments are higher than truly low‐​income people can afford to pay.



According to the Census Bureau, the poverty line for a Seattle family of four is under $33,000 a year. Given requirements that households spend no more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing, a family earning $33,000 a year can afford to spend $825 a month on rent and utilities. Yet only ten of the 110 units of the Capitol Hill TOD (for transit‐​oriented development), a project now being built with low‐​income housing tax credits, will be priced this low, and only five of those are large enough for a family of four. The average unit in the complex will require an income of $40,000 a year, and the most expensive $56,000. This means that most of the 110 units are really middle‐​income housing.



Nor does low‐​income housing have much influence on the housing market as a whole. Since 2008, Seattle has built or under construction 6,700 units of low‐​income housing, which is about 8 percent of the growth in the number of homes in the city. But it is actually less than that on net because hundreds of homes were demolished to make room for some of these projects. This simply isn’t enough homes to significantly influence overall housing prices. To make matters worse, Seattle’s share of affordable housing subsidies is funded by a property tax on existing homes, reducing the affordability of homeownership.



This isn’t just a Seattle problem: such high‐​cost, high‐​density housing is being built using affordable housing subsidies in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, and many other states. The real aim of such housing is often to boost transit ridership as many of the high‐​density housing projects springing up along light‐​rail lines are partially or entirely financed with LIHTCs and other low‐​income housing funds.



For example, in another recent study I found 33 high‐​density projects costing $383 million built with low‐​income housing subsidies along Phoenix, Arizona’s light‐​rail line. To add insult to injury, Phoenix’s transit agency claimed that these projects were “stimulated” by the light‐​rail line when in fact they wouldn’t have been built, at least not in that form, without the housing subsidies.



It is clear that the low‐​income housing tax credit program is not accomplishing its goals and should be abolished. Voters in general should be suspicious of ballot measures that would supposedly fund low‐​income housing but really fund transit‐​oriented developments most of whose housing units will rent at rates that won’t be affordable to families below the poverty line.",2020-12-19T16:54:35.038829Z,1

,2020-12-21T17:34:35.466206Z,483,120,1248,"The era of trade liberalization is dead. Yet it could get worse still. Not only have prospects for liberalization over the next few years been dashed, but Congress is considering legislation that could precipitate a retreat from the trade policies and institutions that have served U.S. interests for 60 years.



These are indeed dark days for trade. The Democratic Party, which has grown increasingly hostile to trade over the past decade, controls the legislature. The president’s authority to negotiate trade agreements and present them to Congress for an up‐​or‐​down vote has expired, and will not be renewed. The bilateral trade agreements completed with South Korea, Colombia, Peru and Panama will likely rot on the vine, as Congress shunts them aside to consider instead trade legislation that is either antagonistic or protectionist. And for the first time in post‐​World War II history, a multilateral trade negotiating round has ended in failure. The era of negotiation and accommodation may yield to one of confrontation and litigation.



One thing that has become clear this year is that Democratic Party opposition to trade runs much deeper than the leadership has been willing to admit. When the Democrats assumed control of Congress in January, the party’s leadership whispered assurances that, notwithstanding the strident anti‐​trade rhetoric adopted by its rank and file, they understood the importance of continuity in U.S. trade policy. With some modifications to the U.S. trade agreement template to reflect Democratic priorities on labor and environmental issues, the Congressional leadership would be able to help the administration move the agenda forward.



A grand bargain was struck in the spring, which was nothing more than a wholesale capitulation by the administration to Congressional demands for strict, enforceable labor and environmental provisions in prospective trade agreements, including the four pending congressional consideration. But as the ink was drying, the Democrats moved the goalposts.



The South Korea agreement was deemed unsupportable by House Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel (DNY) and Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander Levin (D-MI) because its terms do not condition Korean automobile access to the U.S. market on the performance of U.S. automobile exporters in the Korean market. Of course, such a provision, which was put forward by Rangel and Levin in the waning days of the negotiations, would leave the U.S. auto producers in a position to decide just how much competition it wanted from Korean producers. Accordingly, that provision was a nonstarter.



The Colombia agreement was deemed unsupportable because the Uribe government allegedly has done an inadequate job of finding and prosecuting thugs who have terrorized and killed Colombian unionists over the years. Thus, Democratic disdain for a right‐​ofcenter Latin American government, which also happens to be one of the few regional governments not openly hostile to U.S. policy, suffices for justification to deprive Colombian citizens of the opportunity to improve their lots through better trade terms with the United States.



Consideration of the Peru agreement was sidelined until Chairman Rangel and others have a chance to visit Peru, see first hand how its factories are run, and possibly change the agreement’s terms, again. Democrats have used the labor conditions excuse to camouflage Big Labor’s real motive, which is to kill trade deals at all costs. At least that truth now has been exposed. But regrettably, the anti‐​trade objectives of organized labor and importcompeting interests have dovetailed conveniently with proliferating misconceptions and myths about imports, jobs, and manufacturing to produce a phony sense of crisis.



Most of the anti‐​trade legislation introduced this Congress is premised on the myth of U.S. manufacturing decline at the hands of rising imports, mostly from China. But U.S. manufacturing is thriving. In 2006 the manufacturing sector achieved record output, record sales, record profits, record profit rates, and record return on investment.



Imports are not a bane for U.S. producers. In fact, there is a strong correlation between manufactured imports and manufacturing output, as U.S. producers account for more than half of the value of all U.S. imports. When imports rise, output rises. When imports fall, output falls. In the past quarter century, imports have increased six‐​fold, while real GDP has grown by more than 130 percent, creating an average of 1.8 million net new jobs each year.



But policymakers fail to acknowledge this crucial relationship. Instead, too many in Congress view exports as good, imports as bad, and the trade account as the scoreboard. Given the large and growing U.S. trade deficit, policymakers conclude that we are losing at trade. And we are losing at trade because our trade partners are cheating.



In China’s case the alleged cheating involves currency manipulation, subsidization of industry, unfair labor practices, hidden market barriers, dumping, and other transgressions. Some of these allegations may carry a degree of truth, but by and large the trade relationship has been conducted within the rules and consensually, yielding huge benefits for Americans.



In any event, the proper course for redress for complaints is through the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization. The Bush administration lodged three formal complaints earlier this year, which are working their way through the process. Congress should allow that process to continue and restrain its urge to be seen doing something. There is a distinct risk that unilateral, punitive actions on trade could severely damage the trade relationship and lead to a contagious deterioration of respect for the WTO and its decisions. That, ultimately, would take us back to the days when tit‐​for‐​tat trade wars were common, and uncertainty in trade prevailed.



Plenty of blame for the current state of affairs rests with the Congressional Democratic leadership, which has reckoned there is very little political downside to receding on trade, economic consequences be damned. That position has the blessing of Big Labor, and opposing the initiatives of an unpopular president might prove to be good politics.



But Republicans are on the hook too. The strong pro‐​trade consensus among Republicans that was so evident in the 1990s began breaking down in the early part of this decade, as China’s economic emergence was becoming evident. Steel‐ and textile state Republicans have presented some of the greatest obstacles to the Bush administration’s trade policy agenda.



And by failing to make a comprehensive case for trade liberalization, the Bush administration itself bears some responsibility for the current state of affairs. Rather than talk about the benefits of imports, which keep prices in check for consumers and input costs competitive for producers, the administration has focused almost exclusively on the potential export gains from trade agreements, affirming the mercantilist world view of Congress. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office is fond of pitching further trade liberalization by pointing to the U.S. trade surplus with countries with which this administration has negotiated bilateral trade agreements. But by treating a trade surplus as a success metric, it’s only a small step to the conclusion that our overall trade policy is failing, given our nearly $1 trillion deficit.



The Bush administration’s quest for further trade liberalization came to a grinding halt when the 110th Congress convened. But in many ways the President’s trade policy legacy might be forged during its final 18 months. By holding the line against bad trade legislation from an increasingly confrontational Congress, the administration can make the task less arduous for a subsequent administration to rebuild the consensus for trade when the political climate improves.",2020-12-21T17:34:35.466239Z,1

The country’s ZDF national public television recently and energetically fanned the flames of Trump-hatred, going so far as to compare the U.S. President to Adolf Hitler.
Madonna has company – in Germany.

Smiling ZDF German moderator Ilka Brecht proudly introduces the Trump-Hitler comparison under the guise of a parody. All images cropped from ZDF Frontal 21.
The spread of hatred and the defamation of Trump in Germany has been going on for some months now, but has reached new shrill levels. Last September German SPD (Socialists) Martin Schulz told Spiegel magazine last September: “Trump is a danger to the entire world,” comparing the then US candidate’s rhetoric to that of pre-World War II Nazi Germany:
Behind it there is sometimes even a blood and earth rhetoric that strongly reminds me of the time between the two world wars of last century and whose demons we all indeed still know.”
And since Trump’s “surprise” election success and his inauguration, the rhetoric and raw emotion have boiled to a head among Germany’s state-supported flagship media and top political leaders. Yes — the top political leaders — and not solely among some regular citizens venting in beer-halls. Without any surprise, the anger and hate are now rapidly spreading and radicalizing increasingly the population.
Assassination as solution to Trump presidency
Last Sunday in a televised discussion round German national weekly Die Zeit publisher Josef Joffe sparked outrage by telling viewers “an assassination” would be a solution to the “Trump catastrophe”.

Josef Joffe of German weekly Die Zeit said that “assassination” could be one way to remove Trump from office. Image cropped from Phoenix.
German media/top pols portraying US president as mad and evil
Last Tuesday the hate-filled rhetoric from the ruling elitist classes intensified several notches more: On ZDF national television political show Frontal 21, President Trump was directly compared to Adolf Hitler in a clip disguised as a parody, which was far more offensive than it was funny.

 “They both have funny hairdos.”
The Frontal 21 “parody” also said that both Hitler and Trump promised to build new roads and infrastructure, and boasted about drawing “huge crowds”, The ZDF used the following image:

ZDF then portrayed the US President as a maniac…

“rather vague”, “clueless”, “from the grace of God”
What is disturbing is that this “parody” is not something produced by some fringe site, but by federal government supported German ZDF national television, and thus cannot be dismissed. It is “public television” and so all citizens are forced to pay mandatory annual fees. Non-payment involves severe penalties. Yes, as a resident in Germany, I also have to watch my money get used to pay for this hate-garbage aimed at my President.
Leading politicians involved in public broadcasting
Not only the German top media are defaming the US president, but ao are the country’s top political leaders. Thomas Oppermann of the SPD party announced: “Donald Trump is not playing with a full deck.” Soon to-be-President Frank Walter Steinmeier called Trump a “hate-preacher“.
Also the Chairman of the ZDF administrative council is Kurt Beck (SPD) and it includes Bernd Neumann (CDU). Germany’s powerful public television and radio media network is increasingly a communication arm of the the German government. Other ZDF higher ups include politicians Matthias Platzeck (SPD) Horst Seehofer (CSU), Stanislaw Tillich (CDU) and Olaf Scholz (SPD).
Designed to unleash an assassin?
What could be behind the spreading of so much Trump-hatred and the harboring of assassination thoughts? It would not be overreach to suspect that the German government is fantasizing about triggering its own twisted new version of Stauffenberg, as Joffe openly expressed. What’s the point of the Hitler-comparison? It’s supposed to be funny?
How all this is supposed to serve to strengthen transatlantic relations with Europe is puzzling. On the economics side Germany itself enjoys a hefty trade surplus with USA, it’s 3rd largest trading partner, and so risks inflicting more economic harm to itself than to Trump. Already some in Germany are proposing closer ties to China as an alternative.
Moreover, the dirty attacks by the country’s leaders/media will hardly help lead to a solution concerning the VW fuel emissions scandal, and those of the other German manufacturers. In fact the potential $18 billion in fines from VW would be more than enough to pay for the border wall to Mexico.

It’s a perception that the German greens are trying to infuse in it’s readers – the truth as they want to see it, but sadly for them it’s totally remote from reality.

What follow are reactions from some leading German skeptics (and others), who kindly provided their comments:
Dr. Sebastian Lüning
Geologist, co-author of “Die kalte Sonne“:
Lüning commented (by e-mail) on Die Zeit‘s claim the book “had been ripped apart by experts” and the 40% CO2 increase:
We’ve debunked the critiques on our blog in the ‘medienecho‘ section and have demonstrated that there was a lot of wishful thinking and bandwagon mentality. CO2 40% up: Well, that might be numerically true, if one takes 280 ppm to 390 ppm. But more important is the real CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which has gone up by 0.0110% = 110 ppm in real money. Sounds much less dramatic and is therefore not worded in this way.”
(Much more on Lüning‘s and Vahrenholt’s reaction later this week.)
Dr. Hans Labohm (Holland)
Journalist at Der Standaard: (left a reader comment)
As a Dutchman I’ve always thought ‘Die Zeit’ was a quality newspaper. Now I have to correct that impression. The article in question testifies of shoddy if not malicious journalism.
In the Netherlands the relationship between AGW protagonists and antagonists has markedly improved over the last few years. A broad majority of political parties in Parliament, including the Labour Party, has requested the government to include climate sceptics in the scientific debate. They would never have done so if they would have believed the story by Kohlenberg and Blasberg was a truthful reflection of reality.  The dialogue is now going on. One of the most visible manifestations to date is climatedialogue.org, which is run by a mixed group of scientists, including both AGW adherents and climate sceptics. It is sponsored by the government.
It shows that it can be done without polarization. Just follow the rules of sound scientific practice, including an open dialogue.”

The old, well-worn lie: ‘Singer is in the pay of the oil industry’ – copied, no doubt, from such discredited sources as desmogblog. AGAIN –just for the record  – I am not supported by any energy company – or by any industry for that matter.
My payments from Heartland are book royalties. Heartland has published three of my NIPCC books in the past 4 years. And we expect to do two more books in 2013. BTW, all my book royalties go to SEPP — not to me personally.

Amazing investigative journalism – they never even bothered to ask Singer about his funding!
Dr. Holger Thuß
President, EIKE (by e-mail):
I find it remarkable that there was no word about the scientific criticism on the hockey stick graph (which was completely discredited to its core by scientific circles). Quotes were taken out of context. 
Much paper was wasted chewing and chewing on nonsense put out by climate extremist Wikipedia and bloggers. I find this outrageous.
The subliminal criticism on the anti-communist view of climate skeptics, some of them children of Holocaust survivors, is a slap in the face to victims of dictatorships and an embarrassment for German journalism.”
Note: Fred Singer, for example, actually fled the Nazis. 
Michael Limburg
Vice President, EIKE:
It’s obvious that the hot scenarios coming from the computer models have not generated enough panic up to now. Therefore it is necessary in addition to unleash top investigative journalists in order to expose those who oppose the panic-mongering, the so-called “well-paid mercenaries”, and to disarm them.
Regarding the hundreds of millions of dollars that climate deniers supposedly received from evil industry, the authors happened to forget the sources of this funding. In the spirit of ‘good and investigative journalism’ The authors just claim the climate deniers simply received it.
Only blind journalists and those who are unwilling to see the truth are good journalists at Die Zeit. A classic example for Orwellian rhetoric.”
That’s some of the reaction so far to the drive-by smear of climate science skepticism in Germany. More is sure to come.

,2020-12-21T17:35:02.274169Z,489,120,924,"WASHINGTON  —   In his first days as President Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai’s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. “With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,” said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. “The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,” he added. “Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ” Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency’s legal authority. “These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,” Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. “Accordingly, they are being revoked. ” The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. “The speed of the ruling and the chairman’s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ” Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. “The key here is that it’s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said.",2020-12-21T17:35:02.274203Z,1

Abound Solar is yet another government subsidized solar company that gets burned.

Abound Solar Press Release excerpt:
Abound Solar’s closure is an unfortunate but very real consequence of the continued slide in crystalline silicon (c-Si) pricing and the increased competition for limited global demand of solar modules,” said MJ Shiao, Senior Analyst at GTM Research. “Abound was still in the earlier stages of technology and commercial development and despite over $220 million in private investment and $70 million drawn from its $400 million U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan guarantee, simply didn’t have the cost and downstream reach to survive in the tumultuous solar market.
Abound’s cadmium telluride (CdTe) product had little differentiation from First Solar and also suffered from lower efficiency,” said Shyam Mehta, a Senior Analyst at GTM. “Produced at lower scale and likely a higher cost, the chance for survival in the current market environment was always slim. Unfortunately, Abound and other module manufacturing closures including thin film and c-Si suppliers alike, is still just the tip of the iceberg. GTM Research forecasts at least 21 GW of PV module manufacturing capacity to retire by the end of 2015.”

Abound also had support from the Republican side. Indiana’s GOP governor, Mitch Daniels, supported an $11.85 million tax credit for the firm, and “two Abound investors were major Republican donors who have given more than $100,000 to Republicans in the last few years.” according to reports in the National Review.”

Physics Dept. Duke University
One of many, many problems with modern climate research is that the researchers seem to take their thermal reconstructions far too seriously and assign completely absurd measures of accuracy and precision, with a very few exceptions. In my opinion it is categorically impossible to “correct” for things like the UHI (Urban Heat Island) effect — it presupposes a knowledge of the uncorrected temperature that one simply cannot have or reliably infer from the data. The problem becomes greater and greater the further back in time one proceeds, with big jumps (in uncertainty) 250, 200, 100 and 40 odd years ago. The proxy-derived record from more than 250 years ago is uncertain in the extreme, with the thermal record of well over 70% of the Earth’s surface completely inaccessible and with an enormously sparse sampling of highly noisy and confounded proxies elsewhere. To claim accuracy greater than 2-3 K is almost certainly sheer piffle, given that we probably don’t know current “true” global average temperatures within 1 K, and 5K is more likely.

A recent news clipping on the research of an international climate scientist claimed rising temperatures during the other three seasons are actually cooling off winters in North America –all because of snowfalls in Siberia and an atmosphere pressure pattern in high latitudes called the Arctic Oscillation (AO).
The argument that is being made is that the recent warmer summers (due to global warming) are causing more negative Arctic Oscillation, which in turn causes colder winters in North America and Europe. This is totally opposite to what the IPCC predicted.
Here is what the actual abstract to an article called Arctic Warming, Increasing Snow Cover & Widespread Boreal Winter Cooling by Judah L. Cohen et al 2012 in the Environmental Research Letter said:
The most up to date consensus from global climate models predicts warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes to middle latitudes during boreal winter. However, recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections. For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia. We argue that this unforeseen trend is probably not due to internal variability alone. Instead, evidence suggests that summer and autumn warming trends are concurrent with increases in high-latitude moisture and an increase in Eurasian snow cover, which dynamically induces large-scale wintertime cooling. Understanding this counterintuitive response to radiative warming of the climate system has the potential for improving climate predictions at seasonal and longer timescales.”
I like the words ”most up to date consensus from global warming models” and “recent trends in observed NH winter surface temperatures diverge from these projections”. In plain English the AGW scientists are finally admitting that even their latest climate models are wrong with respect to global warming. I give the above authors credit for finally admitting what most of us have known for some time.
Also the statement “For the last two decades, large-scale cooling trends have existed instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern Eurasia “seems overstating the cooling. There has not been large-scale cooling for 2 decades, only the last 10 years in North America – as noted below-  and in Europe only the last 4-5 years.
As has been recently reported by this writer on this blog and at Anthony Watts on WUWT, the summers in both the contiguous US and Canada have not warmed but have actually cooled in US and the trend is quite flat in Canada over the last 10 years. Therefore warmer summers cannot be causing more negative AO and colder winters.
The colder winters are more likely due to changing spatial pattern of more cooler water in the North East Pacific than in the Central and North West Pacific Ocean, especially since 2007 (see PDO) and more recently the slow cooling of the Atlantic Ocean (see AMO) here.
While it is true that a negative AO can result in cooler winters, what causes the AO to cycle unpredictably is not yet clearly understood. Scientists have been unable to predict AO levels for more than a week or two. Whatever has been causing AO to cycle or to be negative, it has been causing this for at least a century and probably much longer – our records only go back to about 1899. This not a new phenomena caused by recent global warming. Below is a plot of winter AO provided by Jiaso.Washington.edu for the years 1899-2002.

More recent AO Index data after 2002 to 2011 can be found at NOAA:

Here is how the winter AO has varied during past warming and cooling phases of this planet for the last century:
JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH AVERAGE AO INDEX
1900s decade: 7 positive, 3 negative AO winters
WARMING PHASE [temperatures rising] 1910 -1939
1910s 6 positive, 4 negative
1920s 8 positive, 2 negative
1930s 6 positive, 4 negative

1970s 5 positive, 5 negative
1980s 5 positive, 5 negative
1990s 7 positive3 negative
TOTAL 17 , 13 negative
POTENTIAL COOLING PHASE? 2010-2030
2010s 6 positive, 4 negative (temperatures have been declining slightly during the past decade)
2010 negative AO WINTER
2011 positive AO winter
Final Comments
It would appear that the Winter AO Index has a significant impact on global winter temperatures. During recent two 30 year global warming phases there were more positive (warm) AO winters than negative (cold) AO winters and almost twice as many. During 30 year global cooling phases, there are more negative AO winters than positive AO winters and about 50% more. During individual peak warm decades (1920s and 1990s) there were 2 to 4 times as many positive AO winters as negative AO winters. During individual peak cooling decades [1940s, 1950’s and 1960s, there were 50% more negative AO winters.
Clearly the recent negative AO winters are not new phenomena caused by warmer summers due to global warming but is a continuing natural climate process that has been ongoing for centuries. A recent extreme cold spell in Canada during January 2012 was happening with mostly positive AO, so we have a lot to understand about our climate. There seems to be no end to some climate scientists trying to tie every climate phenomena, however small or varied, to global warming.

,2020-12-19T16:26:25.162460Z,497,120,1262,"Tony Blair is deeply unpopular and has already announced that he will soon step down as England’s prime minister. But that does not mean he will go quietly into that good night. As reported by the _Daily Mail_ , the UK government has announced a series of totalitarian steps to compel less energy use: 



Homeowners who refuse to make their properties energy efficient will face financial penalties under drastic government plans to transform Britain into the world's first 'green' economy. …The Government said that every new home should be ""carbon neutral"" within ten years — and existing properties subject to a ""home energy audit"" to assess how green they are.



Critics correctly note this is a massive intrusion into the private lives of homeowners:   
  
Blair Gibbs, of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: ""It's bad enough that politicians want to take so much of our money away in tax. For them also to intrude into our homes in order to have the ability to penalize us even further is simply unacceptable.""   
  
But the government is undaunted, and, in a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black, Tony Blair even has the gall to state that his totalitarian initiative is akin to the fight against fascism:



People are to be encouraged to make ""more sustainable"" travel choices, including greater use of public transport, walking and cycling. The Government is also to invest in solar, wind and wave power. …Mr Blair compared the fight against climate change to the battle against fascism.



Sadly, the British people cannot count on the Tories to defend individual freedom. Under the feckless leadership of David Cameron, the Conservative Party is even further to the left than Labor. The Party of Margaret Thatcher has become a hollow shell, judging from the _Daily Mail_ 's reporting: 



Opposition politicians and green campaigners said the Government's proposals did not go far enough, insisting binding targets on emissions should be annual. Tory spokesman Peter Ainsworth said: ""There is a danger that the fiveyear approach will enable responsibility for failure to be shunted on from one government to another.""",2020-12-19T16:26:25.162493Z,1
,2020-12-13T10:25:24.374991Z,498,118,192,"Ominous words are emanating again from the president on climate change and energy independence, this time as “a response” to the Gulf oil catastrophe. Somewhere between the war rhetoric and comparisons to the moon landing, President Obama last night (vaguely) told Congress to pass the energy legislation that’s been languishing there since last summer.



Add that to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel’s speculation on June 8 that the Senate can pass it “this year” and obvious election difficulties for conservative Democrats if they vote for it, and it would appear that we’re headed toward a lame duck session in Congress.



The leadership of the House of Representatives could very easily change hands in the next Congress, and it is likely that major changes — though probably not involving a switch in majority — are on the horizon in the Senate. So, if the Senate indeed does pass far‐​reaching climate legislation after the election but before the new Congress sits, a compromise House‐​Senate bill will likely be negotiated by the party that the people have just thrown out of power.



Whatever the Senate passes, and whatever the House agrees to do with it, the legislation will fail to effect any change on climate. The House’s radical Cap‐​and‐​Trade bill, rushed through last June 26 (before any one had read it) will have virtually no effect on global warming, even by the year 2100, even if every nation that agreed to emissions targets under the United Nations’ (also ineffectual) Kyoto Protocol did the same.



Richard Lugar’s (R‐​Ind.) current Senate proposal isn’t cap‐​and‐​trade. Instead, it’s a hodgepodge of subsidies for energy sources no one would normally buy, and an unrealistic fuel economy mandate for autos. It does even less for climate than the legislation the House passed last year.



There are other Senate bills out there, too, from John Kerry (D‐​Mass.) and Joe Lieberman (I‐​Conn.), which are pretty similar to the House bill; there is also a bill from Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) which mandates costly and inefficient “renewables” that can’t make it on their own economic merits, and various other bills that are variants upon either cap‐​and‐​trade or renewable mandates.



None are popular. No matter what people think about global warming, good or bad, indifferent, strong or weak, or nonexistent, they simply aren’t willing to pay thousands of dollars for fuel taxes, emissions permits, or energy subsidies.



The administration gets this. They knew that people didn’t want their health care program, either. They simply don’t care.



The serious question is whether the President and his chief of staff will indeed have the political muscle to push a climate bill through after the November elections. A smarter move for the White House might be to just punt and wait for the next Congress, which will be guaranteed to do nothing on climate change, pushing the issue into EPA’s regulatory lap. While letting the EPA control our energy economy through force of regulation is a really bad idea, it would be less suicidal for the next Senate class up for re‐​election in 2012.



I hope the White House does NOT take my advice.



Despite the pomp of an Oval Office address, nothing is really new here. The fact that the White House is now floating the notion of passing ineffectual, expensive, and unpopular climate change legislation through a lame duck Congress is merely consistent with its previous behavior.",2020-12-13T10:25:24.375023Z,1

LINK TO FULL REBUTTAL: Case Dismissed Open Letter to Law Professors A1FINAL In this document – “Case Dismissed…”  we rebut these claims with evidence showing that:Climate, temperature and weather evidence does not support the law professors’ claimsOfficial scientific documents by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) do not support the climate claims as presented by these law professorsThe degree of human influence on climate change is uncertain and undeterminedThe global warming ‘hiatus’ of ~20 years began before the Kyoto Accord on greenhouse gas reductions was ever ratified.Consumers voluntarily use fossil fuels and related products to benefit their lives while governments reap huge financial benefitsThe proposed legislation might create risk of serious unintended consequences for cities and taxpaying citizensThere is no evidence that extreme weather events are related to human causation on climateFossil fuel companies pay exorbitant taxes and engage in substantial charitable donations to universitiesThe law professors engage in faulty logic on the law, the Paris Agreement and global emissionsThe case should be dismissed on grounds of nonsense, not pushed forward based on nuisanceThe alleged harm of Canada vs the world is not well understood by these law professorsDramatic findings about oil companies’ apparent foreknowledge of fossil fuel causation and climate change are divorced from historic contextSuing a reliable provider of essential services would benefit citizens and cities in what way?Human influence on climate is only evident in computer climate models (simulations) so there is no evidenceThe law professors claim their legislative proposal would stimulate ‘sensible climate policies’ but fail to tell us what those might be.In conclusion, Canadians must reject the 28 law professors’ proposal for climate accountability legislation as the proposal is not founded on evidence and may also result in distressing unintended consequences.

By Ed Caryl
In my last article on this subject, Can We Expect Extreme Weather, we examined the tropics, the mid-latitudes including the Arctic. At the time I had not found a plot of the mid-latitudes in isolation. Thanks to a comment by Alex, the search was resumed. Once one knows that data exists, it becomes easier to actually find it.
In this article we will examine the mid-latitudes alone, the latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, where most people live, and where most of the earth’s land mass exists. Again, we are using Remote Sensing Systems satellite data. 

Figure 1: RSS lower troposphere temperature, (TLT) for the northern mid-latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, show cooling. The plot has been split between pre-1998 and post-1998.
1998 was the year of a very strong El Niño. In that year northern hemisphere temperatures took a step increase of about 0.4°C. Before that time, temperatures in the mid-latitudes were increasing from the 1970’s cooling at about 0.144°C per decade, despite the temporary cooling due to Mt. Pinatubo in 1992 and 93. After the 1998 El Niño step, the mid-latitudes began cooling again at about 0.123°C per decade. This natural recovery continues.
What are the extremes doing?

//-->




Figure 2 is a plot of the differential, point to point, of the temperature anomalies in Figure 1. These are the monthly extremes with the long term trend removed.
Note in Figure 2 that the northern mid-latitudes responded to the El Niño temperature step with several cold snaps (below zero) that continue to this day; monthly extremes that exceed the cold snaps of the 1980’s and 90’s. In contrast, the warm periods (above zero) are about the same in frequency and amplitude.

Figure 3 is a plot of the absolute value of the temperature extremes in Figure 2 with a 3rd order polynomial trend line applied.
If we look at the trend of all the extremes in the satellite era, we see a reduced trend in the 1980’s, an increase after the 1998 El Niño, particularly due to cold extremes, then a reduction in extremes in the last ten years.
Regarding the climate that most of us experience, in the northern mid-latitudes, we have cooling, a recent overall reduction in extreme weather, and no indication these conditions are radically changing.
It would be helpful if the Catastrophic Climate Clique would actually look at some data once in a while instead of hiding it and crying wolf. (How about a cartoon, Josh.)

The international conference, scheduled to take place in Bonn from June 21 till June 23, excludes all views that disagree with the extreme AGW gloom and doom, world downfall view.  However, because Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded institution, it is required by German Law to remain neutral and honest.
Instead, Deutsche Welle has decided on its own to abandon journalism and to resort to promoting one single extreme view on the topic of climate change, and to shut out the rest. It’s activism run amok.
One workshop is How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The workshop’s objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
This conference has infuriated a number of scientists and citizens. As a result EIKE has drafted and dispatched a letter of protest to Deutsche Welle. The letter states:

It certainly cannot be in the interest of a publicly financed broadcaster to put its own existence into question with a debate over its objectivity.

Enlightened thinking has always been at the centre of our culture, along with sceptical, critical and scrutinising thought. It is intolerable that, here in Germany, public funds are being illegally used under your supervision and under your responsibility to marginalise a large number persons (the majority!) who share a different opinion.

It’s well known that the United States suffered severe drought and record high temperatures back in the 1930s, which we know resulted in the famous Dust Bowl and economic hardship across North America.
But now, from a climate point of view, that period has become an embarrassment to the scientists who propose the anthropogenic global warming theory. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were much lower back then, and so according to their theory,  it should have been cooler than it is today. But it wasn’t.
But instead of questioning CO2’s role in driving global temperature, NASA GISS has decided to just rewrite the historical data so that it fits their flakey theory. This of course is scientific fraud.
Today we examine NASA GISS data for the Wellsboro station in Pennsylvania. First we look at the Version 4 “unadjusted” annual mean temperature data and compare it to the new Version 4 “homogenized” data:

Data: NASA GISS
Above we see how NASA scientists simply went back in the old datasets and simply rewrote them so that the hot years of the early 20th century are cooled tremendously – by over two degrees in many years.
Earlier Wellsboro saw a cooling trend. But now since NASA scientists have fiddled with the data, the trend has been forged to fit the AGW theory.
Next is a chart comparing version 3, which starts in 1883 and ends in 2019, to Version 4, which starts in 1882:

Version 4 data source: NASA GISS, Version 3 here.
The earlier Version 3 also showed cooling before NASA rewrote the data and wiped it out. The current Version 4 used to show cooling, but was that too was tampered with and now it shows strong warming.
Many would argue that this is not science, but outright Orwellian scientific fraud.

UPDATE2: New information from Bastardi here shows 4th of July nightmare is shaping up to be true.
The Case for Rapid Development Feedback of a Potential Tropical Storm: Arthur.
NASA Satellite image of the disturbance off the east coast of Florida at 8:40am.
Guest essay by Joe Bastardi, WeatherBell Analytics.
In the old days, one never had to worry about anything but hitting the forecast.  But times have changed. With an agenda out there to take any weather event that attracts attention and turn into into a reason that an AGW driven atmospheric apocalypse is upon us, one has to make sure the physical grounds are stated before hand for why the event can occur.
We are faced with a potential nightmare.. a tropical cyclone coming at the outer banks on the July 4 weekend. I already have this as an 80 knot storm by July 4th, right on top of the North Carolina coast. That represents the mid ground of a fear this can be stronger. The post Sunday on Weatherbell.com on this outlined why.  To refresh your memory, a look at the ECMWF 200 mb pattern Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, indicates why this can deepen so much, and as a matter of fact is in a prime area to do so.

The Wed AM outflow channel is developing to the northwest,  with  north winds on the east side. The storm position is marked by the X on the map below:

Thursday morning:

Finally,  Friday morning…Even here it is still in the “upward motion” quadrant of the jet to the north (right  front entrance) though by this time the best conditions start to fade. But by this time the center has battered the outer banks.

The seawater, like the end game of the last AMO in the 1950s, is very warm along the east coast.

from: http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/anomwnc.gif
Again this warm seawater is a product of the natural cyclical function of the AMO in its mature stage.
You can read about that here: http://patriotpost.us/opinion/26136
As I posted on it, and the Weatherbell.com preseason forecast outlined our great concern about in close development/intensification this season, a product of the overall climatic pattern we are in (again similar to the 1950s).
Storms coming to the coast in their intensification stage will often use frictional effects to feedback and intensify. A large powerful , mature hurricane in the same position might weaken, its expanse  and interaction with the trough  causing an extensive area of rain cooled air to be pulled in to the storm. But a smaller storm may actually intensify, since it is not yet large enough to pull in the rain cooled air and the frictional affects, may tighten the bands up.  The large scale pattern that may weaken a major storm, may be conducive to deepening a smaller one.
Look at it this way.  If you have 2 people, one used to 3000 calories a day, one used to 1000 calories and they sit down to a  2000 calorie meal every day for a week, the larger person would lose weight, the lighter gain weight.  The common thread of this is rarely recognized in storms.  But the smaller the storm, the better the chance it can deepen. Think of Katrina approaching Florida as a small storm with ideal conditions for development.
She deepened right to the coast. But when she got very large, a cat 5, in the same place the much smaller Camille in 1969 was a cat 5, she started to weaken, while Camille maintained the core winds right to the coast.  My point here being that what is good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and this storm has alot going for it.
Lets take a similar example:  Hurricane Alex in 2004 which battered the outer banks and was worse than the forecast from official sources had,  with wind gusts over 115 mph reported.
The track of Alex in 2004:

Alex exploded in 42 hours from a  35 kt minimal TS  to  85 kt storm. Notice the similar 200 mb pattern:
00z  Aug 2  2004

00a Aug  3 2004

00z  Aug  4,2004

By the way, a storm in the article above, Gerda in 1969, also “exploded” up the east coast in spite of interaction with an approaching trough. A first, with smaller storms, these troughs help ventilate the storms in the northwest quad. The smaller the storm, the tougher the forecast situation.
In addition, El Niño seasons are known for in-close deepeners. The strongest May storm on record in 1951 was Able, in a warm ENSO.  Audrey was  the strongest storm on record in June, 1957. Interestingly enough, in El Niño seasons, many of the first storms are strong ( more examples Betsy, 1965,  Alicia 1983,  Andrew was coming off the 91-92 El Niño and 2004 was an El Niño season, the year of the aforementioned Alex!
But if this does explode (again we have been on top of this…) the first alert for the HURRICANE  threat on the outer banks to clients, then public followers, was Saturday), it has nothing to do with .04% of the atmosphere. It has  everything to do with the physical reality of the pattern,  which we have seen before. Since we see a similar set up, we have to be on guard against a similar event.
There is nothing mystical or magical about it. That it would grab headlines of a major resort area on arguably the biggest summer holiday of the season, means the threat  of spinning it  for an agenda is there. I cherish the day when  the only kind of spinning we have to deal with is what the atmosphere  does, not what people using the atmosphere for their agenda spin it for.
There is a why before the what in a case like this if it does deepen, and it has nothing to do with global warming/climate change/AGW.
UPDATE: Latest GFDL model shows the speed, position, and central pressure forecasts for Friday, July 4th.

,2020-12-13T12:00:34.319297Z,511,118,968,"Guest post by David M. Hoffer
In my first two articles on the leaked AR5 Chapter 11 (near-term projections) I looked at the caveats with which the IPCC is now surrounding their projections, and the lengths to which they are going to preserve the alarmist narrative. The caveats go to such ridiculous lengths that there is actually a quote suggesting that reality may well be within, above, or below the range projected by the models. Falsify that! To maintain the alarmist narrative , they characterize record ice extent in the Antarctic as a “slight increase” and make no mention in the executive summary of the projection buried deep in the report that tropical cyclones may decrease in frequency by as much as one third by 2100.
But what of their temperature projections? Do they say how much they expect it to warm up in the next few decades? They do. But these are the high stakes projections for the IPCC because, unlike most of their projections, these ones will be falsified (or not) within the life times of most of this readership. True to form, they’ve surrounded their temperature projections with caveats while taking an interesting approach to maintaining the alarmist narrative.
The projection is for between 0.4 and 1.0 degrees of warming for the period 2016-2035 compared to the period 1986-2005. Now normally when the IPCC gives a range, we expect that their “best guess” is in the centre of the range. But oddly we find this phrase in Chapter 11: 
[…] it is more likely than not that actual warming will be closer to the lower bound of 0.4°C than the upper bound of 1.0°C
In fact, they go out of their way elsewhere to suggest that the most likely outcome will be about 0.2 degrees per decade. With 2035 only a smidge over two decades away, how do they justify an upper bound 2.5 times their most likely scenario? While delving into this, I came across some rather interesting information. Here’s the graphs they provide with their projections for the beginning of the reference period (1986-2005) through to the year 2050:

Figure 11.33: Synthesis of near-term projections of global mean surface air temperature. a) 4 Projections of global mean, annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) 1986–2050 (anomalies relative to 1986–2005) under all RCPs from CMIP5 models (grey and coloured lines, one ensemble member per model), with four observational estimates (HadCRUT3: Brohan et al., 2006; ERA-Interim: Simmons et al., 2010; GISTEMP: Hansen et al., 2010; NOAA: Smith et al., 2008) for the period 1986–2011 (black lines); b) as a) but showing the 5–95% range for RCP4.5 (light grey shades, with the multi-model median in white) and all RCPs (dark grey shades) of decadal mean CMIP5 projections using one ensemble member per model, and decadal mean observational estimates (black lines). The maximum and minimum values from CMIP5 are shown by the grey lines. An assessed likely range for the mean of the period 2016–2035 is indicated by the black solid bar. The ‘2°C above pre-industrial’ level is indicated with a thin black line, assuming a warming of global mean SAT prior to 1986–2005 of 0.6°C. c) A synthesis of ranges for the mean SAT for 2016–2035 using SRES CMIP3, RCPs CMIP5, observationally constrained projections (Stott et al., 2012; Rowlands et al., 2012; updated to remove simulations with large future volcanic eruptions), and an overall assessment. The box 1 and whiskers represent the likely (66%) and very likely (90%) ranges. The dots for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 estimates show the maximum and minimum values in the ensemble. The median (or maximum likelihood estimate for Rowlands et al., 2012) are indicated by a greyband.
Is the first graph serious? 154 data plots all scrambled together are supposed to have some meaning? So I started to focus on the second graph which is presented in a fashion that makes it useful. But in examining it, I noticed that something is missing. I’ll give everyone 5 minutes to go back and see if they can spot it for themselves.
Tick
Tick
Tick
Did you spot it?
They hid the decline! In the first graph, observational data ends about 2011 or 12. In the second graph though, it ends about 2007 or 8. There are four or five years of observational data missing from the second graph. Fortunately the two graphs are scaled identically which makes it very easy to use a highly sophisticated tool called “cut and paste” to move the observational data from the first graph to the second graph and see what it should have looked like:

Well oops. Once on brings the observational data up to date, it turns out that we are currently below the entire range of models in the 5% to 95% confidence range across all emission scenarios. The light gray shading is for RCP 4.5, the most likely emission scenario. But we’re also below the dark gray which is all emission scenarios for all models, including the ones where we strangle the global economy.
It gets worse.
I did a little back of the envelope math (OK, OK, a spreadsheet, who has envelopes anymore these days?) and calculated that, assuming a linear warming starting today, we’d need to get to 1.58 degrees above the reference period to get an average of +1.0 over the course of the reference period itself. If my calcs are correct, extrapolating a straight line from end of current observations through 1.6 degrees in 2035 ought to just catch the top of that black bar showing the “Likely Range” in the centre of the graph:

Hah! Nailed it!
But now it is even worse for the IPCC. To meet the upper bound of their estimated range, the IPCC would need warming that (according to their own data) is below projections for all their models in all emission scenarios to suddenly increase to a rate higher than all their projections from all their models across all emission scenarios. In brief, the upper range of their estimate cannot be supported by their own data from their own models.
In fact, just based on their own graph, we’ve seen less than 0.4 degrees over the last 26 years or so, less than 2 degrees per century. That brown line I’ve drawn in represents a warming trend beginning right now and continuing through 2035 of 6 degrees per century, triple recent rates. Since the range in their own graph already includes scenarios such as drastic reductions in aerosols as well as major increases in CO2, there simply is no justification in their own data and their own models to justify an upper bound of 1.0 degrees.
That’s not to say it is impossible, I suppose it is possible. It is also possible that I will be struck by lightning twice tomorrow and survive, only to die in airplane crash made all the more unlikely by the fact that I’m not flying anywhere tomorrow, so that plane will have to come and find me. Of course with my luck, the winning Powerball ticket will be found in my wallet just to cap things off.
Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely?
Not according to their own data and their own models. The current version of IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 takes deception (intended or otherwise) to new heights. First, by hiding the fact that observational data lies outside the 95% confidence range of their own models, and second by estimating an upper range of warming that their own models say is next to impossible.

,2020-12-19T16:55:36.072075Z,512,118,268,"Details of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s long‐​awaited Green New Deal have dropped. On Thursday, alongside Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, she published a resolution and Q&A document that laid out the aims and tools intended to transform the United States into a zero net emissions economy.



At least, that’s how it was sold.



Delve into the text, and the climate change‐​curbing veneer amounts to a Trojan horse for a bigger nationalization of the economy than seen under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The sponsors themselves say their goal is the “massive transformation of our society” in a progressive image, rather than simply stopping global warming.





Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal is the biggest single government expansion since the 1930s, masquerading as climate policy.



How else can one explain policies that include a federal jobs guarantee, economic security for those unable to work, provision of housing, free health care, higher education for all and a family living wage? Besides the plan’s calls for electrifying the whole transport system and undertaking a crippling federal financing of renewable energy over 10 years, it reads like a wish list for socializing the economy.



It is hard to make a good faith critique of this plan, because it features a nearly complete denial of trade‐​offs or costs. This is surprising given that Ocasio‐​Cortez herself has a degree in economics, for which the study of trade‐​offs is the basis. 



Take the environmental policy proposals, for example. Most Americans believe that climate change is happening, is influenced by human activity and has social costs. The idea that private action alone cannot overcome this, and governments must act, is a reasonable view. 



**The cost of going ‘green’**



But even in some parallel universe where it was possible to implement an agenda that would replace the whole country’s energy supply with government‐​financed renewables, refurbish every building to improve energy efficiency, eliminate gas burning cars, build extensive high‐​speed rail and cut the number of flights and cows to near zero, the cost would be astronomical. 



Previous estimates from Stanford engineers of meeting power demand through clean, renewable zero‐​emission energy sources put capital costs at $14.6 trillion (almost three‐​quarters of current annual GDP). The running costs, coupled with all the other environmental programs, would therefore take up a huge chunk of economic resources, effectively cutting vast private sector activity.



That’s why the resolution seeks to mobilize society as in World War II, which Ocasio‐​Cortez claims is the appropriate analogy.If the nation can be convinced the overwhelming social goal is countering the existential threat of climate change at all costs, then people would be willing to make sacrifices — be it lost economic growth, fewer flights or less beef.



Yet it’s difficult to make that case when you then tack on a myriad of unrelated policies to the program. According to the resolution, decarbonization must also be supported by a massive expansion of social spending. Ocasio-Cortez’s plan suggests it’s not true that we must take a hit today to ensure the planet’s future — according to this we’ll be richer too!



Just to ram home the absence of trade‐​offs, we are also told this will be financed by printed money. Ocasio‐​Cortez subscribes to the view that governments can apparently spend and spend forever, with the only constraint being the capacity of the economy. Yet, even under the crank Modern Monetary Theory model that recommends this, inflation will surely result from so much new government spending.



By investing in inefficient energy sources and taking labor and capital away from productive industries, economic capacity will shrink as well — making this outcome more likely.



Ordinarily, a pitch to put society on a war footing to adopt expensive power sources, restrict people’s ability to fly and eat what they want, and redistribute vast new sums of printed money would be considered politically bonkers. Yet remarkably, Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, have endorsed this resolution.



It’s easy to think they’ve lost their minds. But maybe they’ve noted that it’s easy to label those who disagree on climate policy as being “deniers” of science itself. By tagging this a “Green New Deal,” Democrats can shift debate toward radical unrelated positions, denouncing those who oppose them as wanting to kill the planet itself.



Make no mistake, this green‐​painted Trojan horse is filled with the biggest single government expansion the United States has seen since the 1930s.",2020-12-19T16:55:36.072108Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:36:47.075571Z,513,120,,"The supermarket chain Iceland has been denied clearance to screen its Christmas advert on British television. Consisting mainly of Greenpeace’s short “Rang-tan” animation, the ad highlights Iceland’s commitment to eliminate palm oil from its own-brand products. According to the advertising clearing body, Clearcast, it was disallowed not because of its content, but because of its connection with Greenpeace, a “body whose objects are wholly or mainly of a political nature”. Iceland reacted swiftly, tweeting that its ad had been “banned” from television because it was “seen to be in support of a political issue”. The tweet was picked up by mainstream media such as the Guardian, which ran the headline: “Iceland’s Christmas advert banned for being too political.” Furious responses followed, with nearly 100,000 people sharing Iceland’s original tweet and over 650,000 petitioning Clearcast to reverse its decision. Most of these responses revolve around the (inaccurate but powerful) claim that Iceland’s ad was “banned” for being “political”. How, ask critics, could highlighting the destruction of the rainforest be political? How could saving orangutans be anything but worthwhile? As one tweet put it, “since when is outrage about losing such beautiful animals political?” Such responses portray environmental and conservation causes as above politics: as built on unquestionable, universal truths. As such, they are too important to be used for petty point-scoring. In this view, Iceland’s ad reveals a devastating apolitical reality that the world needs to see and respond to.  But show the same footage to rural communities on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where most palm oil is produced, and we may well get a different response. Many would see the ad’s message as entirely political, for several reasons. The forests that the ad exhorts viewers to save are also these people’s homes: places filled with specific histories, social relations, assets and other living beings. But the relationships that forest dwellers have to these places are not always understood or recognised by the state or conservation bodies. Wildlife protection laws and the expansion of protected areas – often driven by conservation initiatives – have complicated the situation. These have turned access to forests and their resources into highly political issues. Many rural villagers across Indonesia and Malaysia also rely on small-scale cultivation of oil palm (the tree which produces palm oil) for their livelihoods. Some smallholders work for or in partnership with oil palm companies, and others operate independently. While participation in the industry has generated its own problems, it has also generated income and infrastructure in rural areas. Such smallholders will be rightly concerned about the damaging effects of attacks on palm oil on their futures, and their access to necessities like food and medicine. The Iceland ad is also a classic example of how life is unequally valued across the global political terrain. In certain parts of Borneo and Sumatra, where my team and I are currently conducting research, many forest residents see orangutans as dangerous and not particularly special creatures that can damage their crops and livelihoods. Yet they are acutely aware that many well-meaning foreigners would privilege the well-being of orangutans over their own. Why, they ask, do governments, NGOs and tourists put so much time and money into saving this one animal when people like us are struggling to get by?

      Palm oil boycott could actually increase deforestation – sustainable products are the solution


 Such concerns reveal a mismatch between Iceland’s conservation message and the experiences of rural people in Borneo and Sumatra. In Greenpeace’s film, humans are either intruders (represented by bulldozers) in the pristine rainforest home of the orangutan, or the “good guys” (represented by the girl) who are going to save them. This vision is built on a historically Western understanding of the world that treats “humans” and “nature” as fundamentally separate. But what it blots out are the people who live in and around the same forests, for whom such a separation is much harder – and by no means apolitical. The idea that environmental and conservation causes are above politics thus makes sense only from a particular Western perspective – one built around an image of the forest-as-wilderness that is not universally shared. The depiction of such causes as apolitical has facilitated their spread across the world, while shielding them from scrutiny and critique. Yet scrutiny and critique can reveal significant problems and oversimplifications in Iceland’s ad. The “palm oil kills orangutans” narrative, for example, sidesteps the fact that deforestation is only one of several factors driving orangutan extinction. Other key drivers include hunting and poaching, though these won’t be solved by oil palm activism. And as various analysts have pointed out, simply boycotting palm oil could ultimately backfire. A collapse in global demand would disproportionately affect smallholders, generating further poverty and resentment. It could also encourage the cultivation of other ecologically-damaging crops such as soy or rapeseed, which would displace rather than reduce forest conversion and biodiversity loss – an unfortunate geopolitical outcome. None of this mitigates the need to address the problems of environmental destruction and extinction. And it’s no bad thing that Iceland’s ad has helped raise awareness of these issues. But conservation isn’t a black-and-white morality tale, and depicting the advert’s message as apolitical is both misleading and counterproductive. For the sake of both orangutans and the people who share their forests, we need fewer emotive simplifications and more acknowledgement of the complex political realities at stake.",2020-12-21T17:36:47.075605Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:59:28.091347Z,514,123,,"Scott Morrison has struck a $2bn deal with the New South Wales government to increase gas supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. The deal includes at least $450m of federal grants and $510m more of federal grants or loans for “NSW-based emissions reduction initiatives”, to be matched by $1.01bn in direct funding from Gladys Berejiklian’s government.  The deal is the first of a series of bilateral energy agreements between the federal government and its state and territory counterparts. Morrison told reporters in Sydney the $2bn could be spent on “clean technology” including hydrogen research, energy efficiency measures, and “coal innovation to commercialise and employ technologies to reduce emissions from extraction, preparation and the use of coal”. Berejiklian said the plan should reassure citizens “we have a clear plan … [to] reduce our emissions, which we know many people feel strongly about”. Under the plan, the federal and NSW governments will jointly underwrite the delivery of HumeLink and the Queensland-NSW interconnectors to strengthen grid reliability. The NSW government has committed to facilitating investment opportunities to inject an additional 70 petajoules of gas a year into the east coast market and to remove barriers to coal supply to the Mount Piper power station, which is facing an acute shortage. Berejiklian told reporters the Narrabri gas project – to drill 900 coal seam gas wells, including within the Pilliga state forest – “may very well be” the source of extra gas and “will meet” the requirement, although she noted the project is still subject to final approval. She said NSW had three options, including Narrabri, and import terminals at Newcastle and Port Kembla to import more gas. To supply Mount Piper, Berejiklian suggested that “other [coal] power stations will be coming to the end of life in the next little while, so then there are opportunities for us to transfer those [supply] arrangements to Mount Piper”. The federal government’s $1bn electricity generation underwriting scheme will be used to support as-yet unspecified new generation projects in NSW. The shortlist of 12 projects for that scheme includes five gas projects, two of which have  been approved, six pumped hydro schemes, and the coal baron Trevor St Baker’s proposal for a coal upgrade at Vales Point at Lake Macquarie. The deal also promises financial support for the establishment of a pilot renewable energy zone in the state’s central west to help large-scale renewable generators. “I want households and businesses paying less for their electricity and I want to continue to get emissions down – this deal does both,” Morrison said. “There is no credible plan to lower emissions and keep electricity price down that does not involve the greater use of gas as an important transition fuel.” Berejiklian said the state “already has a pipeline of around $26bn of large-scale renewable and non-renewable energy projects and the NSW government has introduced a range of rebates to help keep prices down as well as a five-year $1.4bn climate change fund.” “Our agreement with the commonwealth today will ensure we continue to strengthen and diversify our energy sector here in New South Wales – securing traditional energy sources whilst growing renewable energy investment across the state,” she said. Relations between the federal and NSW governments have been strained after the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, linked the bushfires to Australia’s poor record on combating climate change, then suggested that Liberals in federal cabinet were pushing for more action. This earned a rebuke from the prime minister, who said Kean “doesn’t know what he’s talking about” with respect to federal cabinet. Morrison insisted that Australia was “carrying its load” in the global emissions reduction fight. He has refused to increase Australia’s targets but has opened the door to dropping the use of Kyoto carryover credits to achieve 2030 targets if it is possible to do so without increasing electricity prices.",2020-12-19T16:59:28.091381Z,1

,2020-12-18T17:24:57.203200Z,516,120,,"All over the world, countless conservation projects are taking place, attempting to achieve aims from reducing habitat loss, to restoring populations of threatened species. However there is growing awareness that conservationists have not always done a good enough job at evaluating whether the things they do really work.  Efforts that fail to make things better for species and ecosystems waste the limited resources available for conservation, and result in missed opportunities to stem the loss of biodiversity. Given that monitored populations of wildlife species have declined by 60% in the last 50 years, and large scale loss of forest continues, this is bad news. So, research to show whether conservation efforts work really matters. And those doing conservation need easy access to the results of this vital evidence. In many fields, when researchers want to know whether something works they conduct an experiment. For example, patients are often randomly assigned to receive a new drug (or not) and the results are compared to determine if the new treatment has the potential to help people. Despite calls for more use of experiments in conservation, they remain extremely rare. One common approach to conservation is encouraging owners to manage their land in a way which provides benefits for the environment. This has been done in the UK for decades. For example, farmers are paid to maintain hedgerows and leave stubble on fields to help farmland birds. These kinds of payments for ecosystem services schemes are increasingly used in the tropics as well.  In 2017, an experiment in Uganda revealed that paying farmers not to chop down trees was a cost effective way to slow deforestation. Now we have published the results of only the second experiment at such a scale. Our study evaluates whether providing incentives to farmers to protect forest and keep cattle out of streams improves water quality.  The research focuses on the efforts of the Bolivian NGO Natura, which has been working with communities in the Andes to help protect the area’s incredible forests. These are home to spectacled bears and other wonderful wildlife, and are seen locally as important for supplying clean water. In Natura’s Watershared programme, upstream landowners were offered incentives to shift their livelihood activities away from clearing forest or letting cattle graze untended in the forest. Natura wanted to know if their innovative approach to conservation was working, so they took the unusual step of setting up an experiment to find out.  In 2010, 129 communities were randomly placed in a control group, or given the chance to enrol their land in Watershared agreements. Households in the latter “treatment communities” could then choose to enrol as much of their land as they wished in the programme. Analysing the results of this experiment, we found that while keeping cattle out of rivers is (perhaps unsurprisingly) good for water quality at the location where it happens, the treatment communities did not have cleaner water in their taps. Further investigation revealed that this was at least in part because of the low level of uptake of the programme, and that the land most likely to be important for improving water quality was often not enrolled. Natura is already implementing the results of this research to improve the design of Watershared. They are working with communities to ensure that protection is targeted to areas most likely to benefit water quality. And our experience with running such a large-scale experiment holds useful lessons for others interested in increasing knowledge about what works in conservation. Away from conservation, there has been an explosion in the use of randomised experiments to evaluate the impact of other large scale interventions – in development and education, for example. However, there has been backlash from opponents who have pointed out, among other things, that these kinds of investigations will not always provide valid answers to the most important questions because these experiments can only normally answer the question “does it work?”, rather than “why does it work?”, and so can’t really answer the other key question, “will it work in other situations?”. This debate has got quite heated, and even acrimonious, at times. Running an experiment to evaluate the impact of a large-scale conservation intervention is certainly very challenging. It is often not possible to randomise which areas receive a new conservation project (can you imagine a government randomly allocating where it puts national parks?). There are also issues with achieving adequate replication, and there can be ethical concerns which prevent experimentation. However, given the importance of knowing what works in conservation, more high quality evaluations (which won’t always be experiments) are certainly needed. Only by learning from current practice can the future effectiveness of conservation be improved.",2020-12-18T17:24:57.203232Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:34:27.342230Z,517,120,,"Over the past two decades automated wildlife cameras – known as camera traps – have proven invaluable in ecological research and conservation management. Their sensitive motion detectors have enabled scientific surveys of rare or shy animals in dense forest and as a consequence have seen broader use around the world.  But camera traps frequently take pictures of people as well as wildlife. This has important implications for privacy and human rights and may ultimately undermine conservation goals. We conducted a survey of researchers who had deployed camera traps in ecological or conservation projects. More than 90% of the 235 respondents said that their cameras had taken images of people as well as wildlife. Fewer than 9% of researchers who had captured images of people had initially set out to do so. But most said that once they had the pictures they made use of them. For example, almost half of respondents who had pictures of apparently illegal activities (such as poaching) subsequently used them to inform conservation management or law enforcement, sometimes by sharing them with third parties (most notably the police and park management staff). Initially, for that reason, the ability of camera traps to monitor human as well as wildlife activity in areas of conservation importance may look like a double win for conservation. But the fact that these cameras often take pictures of people can be highly problematic for two main reasons. Firstly, many respondents said that they had captured images that either they considered to be private (for example of people going to the toilet), or which showed a person trying to avoid the camera (for example, images of people covering their faces). In some countries, distributing images of people without their consent can result in substantial penalties. Even where this is not against the law, steps should be taken to ensure that camera traps do not infringe reasonable rights to privacy.  Second, even if images of people are not used or shared, camera traps can still generate fear and anger – and this can lead to local opposition to camera trapping. With the long-term success of most conservation projects depending on the support of local people, it is vital that their issues with camera traps are taken seriously.  Three-quarters of the researchers we surveyed reported local objections to cameras, either in the form of complaints or direct interference such as damage or theft. Sometimes people went to great lengths to interfere with the cameras. For example, one respondent said that they once found a patch of burnt ground, only one square metre in area, exactly where their camera used to be. When we asked what researchers thought had caused these cases of interference and objections, the most common answer was “fear or concern about what might happen with the images”. This fear can take extreme forms. For instance, one of our respondents in South America said that they had found a woman next to a camera trap who thought it was being used to take pictures of her children with a view to kidnapping them.  Clearly, conservation projects whose cameras are damaged or stolen are going to face the cost of replacing equipment and often also lose data. For these reasons alone, it makes sense to avoid angering or scaring local people. More broadly, the antagonistic relations with local people caused by camera traps can give conservation projects a bad name and even promote damaging activities: several researchers reported that those who objected to the cameras retaliated by killing wildlife. Despite the frequency of these issues, they are almost never discussed in conservation or ecological scientific studies. And although most of our respondents recognised the potential problems with the use of pictures of people, the dilemma of how to best to handle them is not being publicly debated. Luckily, researchers themselves are thinking about this problem. Protocols established by our respondents to manage pictures of people caught on camera included blurring images, or not publicly sharing them. This blurring could even be done automatically, using machine algorithms, so that images containing people are blurred before they are seen by human eyes. Some individual researchers have gone further and have substantially involved local communities in their projects – reassuring them that the cameras were not there for law enforcement purposes, involving them in the process of deploying the cameras and sharing the images with them. But, despite these independent efforts, to date there are no standard guidelines agreed by conservationists.  The implications of camera trap technology for people’s privacy and well-being need to be more widely and openly discussed, and good practice shared. Conservation projects need to make sure they have proper protocols in place to minimise social impacts and stop useful wildlife research tools from damaging both the short and long-term success of wildlife conservation projects.",2020-12-19T15:34:27.342263Z,1
,2020-12-19T17:04:58.724447Z,519,120,,"Take a 12 hour ferry north from mainland Scotland, and you’ll reach the Shetland Isles – the northernmost place in the UK. The only part of Britain to be considered “subarctic”, the archipelago of about 100 islands is found at the same latitude as the southern tip of Greenland. It’s so far north that, on most maps of the UK or Scotland, Shetland is cut out and placed in an inserted box somewhere off the coast of Aberdeenshire or the Highlands. Yet this aspect of cartographic design has long been controversial among the 23,000 people who live on the islands. This was a point made recently by the their representative in the Scottish parliament, Tavish Scott MSP, who has passed an amendment to the Islands (Scotland) Bill which now prevents public bodies in Scotland from including the Shetland Islands in an “inset map” (in a box).  The Ordnance Survey, Britain’s national mapping agency, was against the move as it would imply “publishing maps that are mostly sea”, while we must now wait and see how this actually impacts maps produced by Scotland’s various public bodies, which do have a get-out clause if they use an inset, but explain their reasons. Nonetheless, the idea behind the law change is certainly laudable. With Shetland in a box off the coast, it is easy to forget how much of a logistical and financial challenge it is to travel from the island to the mainland. It is a full 125 miles from the northern coast of the mainland to Shetland – about the same distance going from London to Nottingham. Placing the islands in their true geographical location should remind people of this reality. However, Scott has perhaps forgotten why the islands were put in a box in the first place, and this reason hasn’t changed in the hundreds of years that people have been making maps of Scotland. Due to their geographical isolation, including them in a box allows the rest of Scotland to be shown in much more detail. If the Shetland Isles were mapped in their true location, we would end up with a map that is largely sea, with the rest of the Scottish mainland around 40% smaller. When creating any map, whoever is making it has to decide what to include and what not to include. If you had a map of the town or city where you live, would you include the internal layout of your home? Obviously not – marking out the distance you need to travel from your sofa to your kitchen to make a cup of tea would be both impractical and irrelevant for almost all users of the map. So what to include in a map depends on what the map is for. The London Underground map is a great example of one that only includes what it needs to: it lists the stations, the tube lines and is very clear on which lines connect where. (It also includes the River Thames, which is arguably not vital, but helps people orientate themselves and so was reinstated after it was removed in 2009). As a map to work out where to go in Central London on foot it is no help at all, but that’s not the point.  Hexagon-based maps used in parliamentary elections are another iconic example. Most viewers are not interested in the geographic area of each constituency, but do want to easily assess the total number of seats and which party has a majority. Decisions made at the design stage can alter how a map is interpreted, sometimes quite significantly. We can automate some of the process using Geographic Information Science (GIS) computer programs, but we have to use these tools carefully, with the end product in mind. Insets are just one element of a map that can have an impact on the message it conveys. The Worldmapper website uses cartograms to adjust maps to show variables other than space geographically, and Vox has a great video explaining different projection systems used to display the globe. And the Shetland Isles? Some maps of Scotland should include the islands in their true geographic location in order to highlight their remoteness and logistical issues, as Scott says. However, not all maps need to: sometimes this is not relevant to the map, and it is more important to give more prominence to the central belt of Edinburgh and Glasgow where many more people live.  It all depends on what the aim of the map is. The choices made by the map maker have a big impact on the output of the process and how the map is viewed. It is impossible to represent everything on a map, and sometimes what we decide to leave out is much more important than what we decide to include.",2020-12-19T17:04:58.724481Z,1

According to Piao _et al_. (2015), the reliable detection and attribution of changes in vegetation growth are essential prerequisites for “the development of successful strategies for the sustainable management of ecosystems.” And indeed they are, especially in today’s world in which so many scientists and policy makers are concerned with what to do (or not do) about the potential impacts of CO2-induced climate change. However, detecting vegetative change, let alone determining its cause, can be an extraordinarily difficult task to accomplish. Nevertheless, that is exactly what Piao _et al_. set out to do in their recent study.   
  
More specifically, the team of sixteen Chinese, Australian and American researchers set out to investigate trends in vegetational change across China over the past three decades (1982-2009), quantifying the contributions from different factors including (1) climate change, (2) rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, (3) nitrogen deposition and (4) afforestation. To do so, they used three different satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) datasets (GLOBMAP, GLASS, and GIMMIS) to detect spatial and temporal changes in vegetation during the growing season (GS, defined as April to October), and five process-based ecosystem models (CABLE, CLM4, ORCHIDEE, LPJ and VEGAS) to determine the _attribution_.   




With respect to _detection_ , this work revealed that most regions of China experienced a greening trend indicative of enhanced growth across the time period studied (see Figure 1). Overall, 56 percent of the area studied experienced a significant increase in greening (95% level) when using the GLOBMAP dataset, compared with 54 and 31 percent using the GLASS and GIMMIS datasets. Those regions with the largest greening trends include southwest China and part of the North China Plain.

In considering the researchers' several findings, it is clear that the fossil fuel combustion that has resulted in the rise in atmospheric CO2 and enhanced nitrogen deposition over the past three decades has provided a great benefit to Chinese vegetation. As illustrated in Figure 2, led primarily by the increase in CO2, that benefit has been _more than sufficient_ to compensate for the negative effects of climate change that also occurred over that time period. Thus, it would seem far more prudent to _celebrate_ CO2 instead of _demonizing_ it, like so many people incorrectly do these days; for atmospheric CO2 is truly the _elixir of life!_

According to Piao _et al_. (2015), the reliable detection and attribution of changes in vegetation growth are essential prerequisites for “the development of successful strategies for the sustainable management of ecosystems.” And indeed they are, especially in today’s world in which so many scientists and policy makers are concerned with what to do (or not do) about the potential impacts of CO2-induced climate change. However, detecting vegetative change, let alone determining its cause, can be an extraordinarily difficult task to accomplish. Nevertheless, that is exactly what Piao _et al_. set out to do in their recent study.   
  
More specifically, the team of sixteen Chinese, Australian and American researchers set out to investigate trends in vegetational change across China over the past three decades (1982-2009), quantifying the contributions from different factors including (1) climate change, (2) rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, (3) nitrogen deposition and (4) afforestation. To do so, they used three different satellite-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) datasets (GLOBMAP, GLASS, and GIMMIS) to detect spatial and temporal changes in vegetation during the growing season (GS, defined as April to October), and five process-based ecosystem models (CABLE, CLM4, ORCHIDEE, LPJ and VEGAS) to determine the _attribution_.   




With respect to _detection_ , this work revealed that most regions of China experienced a greening trend indicative of enhanced growth across the time period studied (see Figure 1). Overall, 56 percent of the area studied experienced a significant increase in greening (95% level) when using the GLOBMAP dataset, compared with 54 and 31 percent using the GLASS and GIMMIS datasets. Those regions with the largest greening trends include southwest China and part of the North China Plain.

,2020-12-19T16:00:20.267154Z,523,119,,"The oil industry is at risk of a global market shock that could halve the value of fossil fuel investments if governments delay setting policies to tackle the climate crisis, according to new analysis. A report by Carbon Tracker, a financial thinktank, warned that a “handbrake turn” in climate policy could have a “forceful, abrupt, and disorderly” impact on the global oil industry by derailing fossil fuel demand.  The report warned that the longer governments wait to set new regulations to drive climate action the tougher they will need to be to avert the risk of runaway greenhouse gas emissions and dangerous global heating. The report modelled the impact of a swift government crackdown on fossil fuels from 2025. It predicted that the impact could cause global oil prices to collapse, wiping out billions of dollars worth of fossil fuel investments. Andrew Grant, a Carbon Tracker analyst and author of the report, said oil companies “risk being left with stranded assets” by assuming that governments will stop short of “forceful action to limit climate change”. The thinktank urged policymakers to act soon to limit new investment in fossil fuel projects which risk being stranded, and warned oil companies to anticipate a step change in climate action. Under existing forecasts oil demand is expected to grow by 0.6% a year over the next five years, but the report found that a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions could cause demand to shrink by 2.6% a year between 2025 to 2040. “The loss of value is driven not by the oil industry throwing money away but simply by investing based on signals sent by the oil price,” the report said. Many oil companies may have been “lulled into a false sense of security by industry scenarios” which continue to forecast steadily rising demand, according to Carbon Tracker. The thinktank also warned investors against oil market scenarios published by the International Energy Agency which predict a steady decline in demand rather than a sudden collapse. Oil companies in the US, China and Russia are more exposed to a sudden oil market shock than their European peers due to their slow progress in adopting cleaner energy sources alongside fossil fuels. Within the world’s largest listed oil companies, the so-called “super-majors”, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron are most exposed to an oil price collapse. Europe’s most vulnerable oil company is BP, according to the report, followed by Norway’s Equinor, Paris-headquartered Total, Italy’s Eni and Anglo-Dutch energy giant Shell. However, Saudi Arabia could prove to be relatively resilient to an oil price crash because its reserves are by far the cheapest to produce in the world.",2020-12-19T16:00:20.267188Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:36:56.893071Z,525,119,,"At 89, Claudia Andujar still has her work cut out. For five decades she has photographed the Yanomami indigenous people, an Amer-Indian tribe who number 33,000 and live in 192,000 square kilometres of rainforest that straddle the borders of Brazil and Venezuela. Until the early 20th century they had lived almost entirely in isolation from the outside world, but since then disease, deforestation and climate change have taken their toll. The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has proved a further threat. Vehemently against legislation protecting indigenous lands, last week the far-right president commented: “Indians are undoubtedly changing … They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.”  “I now put all my efforts into the activism, into addressing Brazil’s political situation,” Andujar says as she prepares a retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, which shows a selection from a personal collection that runs to several thousand photographs. “I no longer take photographs, but use my archive to show how I saw the Yanomami. This present government has no respect for them. They have no understanding of who they are as people.” The changing nature of Andujar’s work is chronicled in the show. Though the earliest images are straight documentary, the artist notes she was always more interested in striking up a human bond with her subjects than in approaching the work with professional detachment. “I decided very early that I would not photograph if I felt I did not have a connection with the person whose picture I was taking,” she says. “Developing an intimacy with the individual and community came first. The photography was always secondary to that.” Immersing herself in the culture of the Yanomami, it soon became clear that she would never represent their worldview through conventional composition. Instead, employing techniques, including double exposure, long exposures, the use of coloured filters or smearing of vaseline on the lens, Andujar started to produce a body of work a lot stranger and more faithful, she says, to the experience of the Yanomami people. A room of the Paris show is dedicated to the shamanic rituals that are a key aspect to Yanomami cosmology. During these ceremonies the tribe believe spirits – xapiri – descend on the forest leaving trails of brilliant white light in their wake. Andujar represented this by shaking her camera as she took each photograph of the convulsing, gyrating shamans. One image shows a woman with her face obscured by curling trails of smoky white light dancing across the picture’s surface. In another, a man, naked but for streaks of body paint, lies on the ground near a burning ball of light emitting from an unknown source. A funeral ceremony, in which the deceased is encased in a woven casket hung from a tree, is photographed through an otherworldly orange filter. A group of Yanomami are shown in layered multiples, using a double exposure, a way of reflecting the rhythm, movement and intense noise of the indigenous ceremonies.  Davi Kopenawa, a Yanomami activist and shaman, first met Andujar in 1977. “It was quite unusual for a white woman to come, a woman who wasn’t a missionary especially. Claudia took her time to get to know us; she slept in our shabono,” he says, referring to the ring-shaped wooden buildings that the Yanomami live in communally. “When the white people invaded our land, they took us by surprise and we weren’t prepared to deal with that first contact. Non-indigenous people wanted us to vanish, they wanted us to die ... It is still a dangerous battlefield out there for us, but to survive we need to confront it. These pictures are part of that. She was able to show them, show us, to the people of the city.” Born in Switzerland in 1931, Andujar was raised in Oradea, a border town that has switched between Romania and Hungary. Her parents separated when she was nine. In 1944, as the German army closed in on the town, her mother took her to Switzerland, leaving her father, Siegfried, behind. He, and his entire extended Jewish family, perished in Auschwitz and Dachau. This, Andujar says, lies behind the affinity she felt with the Yanomami. “I want to help the Yanomami to survive like my family did not. I think my work is dependent on the suffering of my childhood. My friends from school all died in Auschwitz. Everyone. Nobody, nobody survived.” Kopenawa agrees Andujar’s childhood holds the key to her relationship with the Yanomami. “When the people of the world waged war against each other, Claudia suffered a lot. But that gave her the experience that is required to take images of the Yanomami.” After the war, Andujar moved first to New York, before settling in São Paulo in 1955. “I was conscious that I was looking for something that was missing from my life,” she says. “I never forced the relationship with the Yanomami, but there was something within me that was searching for a connection or purpose that they provided.” The longest of her repeated trips living with the tribe was over a year. Did she feel at home with them? “Yes, yes I did.” The exhibition in Paris makes clear that Andujar’s journey from outsider to champion of the Yanomami was a long one. On one wall, showing her early work, is a fashion shoot from 1970 for Sententa magazine, in which a white model poses against the exoticised backdrop of an indigenous village. Elsewhere, the Yanomami are shown sympathetically, romanticised perhaps, with no hint to what some conservative anthropologists claim to be a violent culture inherent to the tribe. In 1968, the American anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon reported the tribe lived in a “a state of chronic warfare”. While disputes undoubtedly occur, Kopenawa rejects the generalisation, a claim backed by numerous studies since. Andujar says that while she feels close to the Yanomami, and never felt scared, there is a power dynamic between her and them. “There are various beliefs in Yanomami about photography, and the capturing of what we call the soul,” Andujar says. “They have this fear, this suspicion of the camera. I only took pictures of Yanomami who got to know me first, when they knew why I was there. After a while they trusted me and would take no notice of the camera.” In 1976, Adujar was back in São Paulo, struggling to get permission to return to the Amazon, when she heard of an ensuing measles epidemic among the Amerindian people. “I heard whole villages had disappeared, so many I knew died.” Kopenawa says that the disease was part of the ongoing persecution of his people by Brazil’s military dictatorship. “The white men were bringing all these diseases as the Transamazonian road was being built. I saw my mother and father die.” The tragedy precipitated a major change to Andujar’s career. Bruce Albert, a French anthropologist working in the area at the time, recalls that there was a strong desire by the dictatorship to keep news of the situation spreading. “The government agencies were spreading a lot of xenophobic, malicious rumours about us. They were furious we were there and one guy went round telling the Yanomami people we Europeans had come to steal their riches.” Albert recalls Andujar arriving on the scene in a black VW Beetle. “I was asleep in my hammock when I heard this engine noise. Back in Paris I drove a white Beetle and this was the exact same sound. I thought I must be hallucinating, but I got up, went outside and there was Claudia silhouetted against the headlights of the car on the dirt track, composed as if it were one of her photographs. She was someone I had heard about from the Indians but not met. Here she arrived like a character in her own work.” “I was undoubtedly aware that I was causing the government problems,” Andujar says, “They were watching me.” Albert and Andujar, alongside Carlo Zacquini, a liberal Catholic missionary, went on to form Comissão Pró-Yanomami (CCPY), an activist group that campaigned on behalf of the Yanomami, and who were instrumental in pushing for a continuous tract of officially demarcated land for the tribe. Granted in 1992, this now stretches over 96,650 square kilometres. However, despite legal protections, Kopenawa estimates 20,000 illegal gold miners are operating in the Yanomami Park with the tactic permission of Brazil’s government. It was through the CCPY, working with a group of doctors from São Paulo, that Andujar began coordinating a medical programme and the camera became but a tool in this activism. Yet the change of direction gave rise to what have proved to be her most haunting photographs. Traditionally, Yanomami do not give each other names, referring only to their relationships with one another. In order to keep medical records, the team needed a way of identifying each patient. Each of the Yanomami were assigned a number, written on a wood necklace, which Andujar photographed them wearing. In their pragmatic simplicity, and numbering in their hundreds, the images show the Yanomami at their most vulnerable, facing the onslaught of sickness brought in by outsiders. And, while this process was born out of administrative need, it has become Andujar’s most biographical project, the young and old staring back at the camera, their numbers recalling those branded on the victims of the Holocaust. Despite the power inherent in her photography, Andujar says she does not think art has a political agency. Gesturing to her life’s work, the artist shrugs. “This won’t change the attitude of Bolsonaro. All I can hope is when people look at my pictures they experience a connection with these people as people, people who, under this president, are suffering again.” • Claudia Andujar: The Yanomami Struggle is at the Fondation Cartier, Paris, 30 January – 10 May.

We stopped by the fire shed on the top of the hill. They seemed to think we were going to be all right, so we thought we’d be back the next day. We grabbed some dirty clothes baskets, a few things. But when we looked at Fires Near Me the next morning, we were horrified at how big it had got overnight. They reckon the fire spread at 60km an hour. It was a shock for days. It wasn’t until the third time we came back that I took everything in: the neighbours’ houses all gone, just a wasteland. It was as if we’d never been here before. We’ve lived here around 17 years. I had a lot of things – my grandmother’s and my mum’s. It’s taken me two weeks of saying, “Oh, it’s just stuff”, until my daughter said, “Stop saying that, Mum, it’s not just stuff.” But it was; that’s been a lesson for me, not to get attached to things, because it doesn’t matter. We don’t have any insurance, so we’ll be starting from scratch again. We started off here in a tent, anyway, so I guess we’ll be going back to one. It’s like Seasick Steve sang: “I started out with nothing, and I’ve still got most of it left.” We lived simply. We had one solar panel that was enough to give us lights, and a gas fridge; we used a lot of recycled materials. So that makes it a bit easier to start over. Our chief concern is our daughter, who moved in with us before Christmas with two babies; we’ll probably rush to get something up for her. Jenni Bruce, 63, artist, Upper Brogo, New South Wales I’ve lived here for 44 years. It’s fringe farming country and we’ve got all kinds of people: tradies, chippies, sparkies; life-changers as well, retirees and artists who have come to live in the bush. It was New Year’s Eve when we knew we’d have to evacuate, but we thought we had a great deal more time – that it wasn’t going to reach us until the next day. I was planning to stay in that night, but some of my friends had already evacuated to Quaama, a nearby village – I thought I’d just pop in and see them. When I turned around to come home, I saw the fire front. It was just a land-eating monster, tearing through with a ferocity like nothing I’d ever seen. I knew there was no going back into that. We waited in Quaama and watched until it became very evident that we needed to move. I helped a couple of locals evacuate, so I was probably one of the last cars out. By the time I was on the highway, the fire was only a few metres away; it was just so hot and so loud – the noise was unbelievable. At 5am we arrived in the tiny beach town of Bermagui and spent the day there. It was chaotic, a thousand people poured into a small space with only four toilets. None of us had much in the way of supplies, but the shops, bowling club, pub – everybody was doing their best to make people comfortable. Coming back home for the first time, after a few nights, was awful. You always hold out that tiny bit of hope that, just maybe, there’s something. But it was all gone. I had a great workshop with tools that I had spent a lifetime gathering. There was a beautiful garden, with lots of blueberry plants and fruit trees. I’d recently sold a lot of things to fix the place up, so I could stay as I grew older, and I’d just finished renovating. I had a huge collection of paints and canvases, and I was working on a new body of work to exhibit. It was just devastating to lose that amount of hard work. All I could do was keen – it’s a really weird noise; I’d only made it once before in my life, but I keened. There’s not a single person in the entire region who is not traumatised – all over the Great Dividing Range. I wish the people in power would listen; I wish they would stop using industries that are so bad for our environment. I hope that the underlying anger, because of mismanagement from our leaders, does not overrule the kindness and compassion that people are showing in the present moment. I don’t really know what my life lesson is: I’m just very glad to be alive. Sharyn Wotton, 61, teacher’s aide, and Tom Wotton (AKA Swampy Tom), 66, retiree, Wandella Sharyn Tom and I have been together 45 years and lived at Wandella for 24. We have 100 acres about 15km from the nearest town. It’s not a hobby farm – we don’t raise animals. We just live here for the peace and quiet, the serenity. We had always agreed we wouldn’t stay and fight a fire. We had used planks of foam, pontoons from Sydney harbour, as insulation for our walls. But the 75 acres we had behind us were wooded, and we’re in a gully, so we thought: we don’t have enough water. On 30 December, our eldest daughter, Carly, texted and said: “Mum, it’s doubled again.” Our two sons-in-law hooked up our 1979 Millard deluxe caravan, and we put a few bits and pieces in there and the car. I remember my daughter Teagan saying, “Mum do you want this, this?”, and I said, “No, I’ll come back tomorrow.” But there wasn’t a tomorrow. After a few days, we went to Canberra, where we got word from our neighbour who had stayed to defend his property. He said a huge firewall just came from nowhere, up one side of their house, and he knew then our place was probably gone. He was alive, and his kids were alive, but there have been so many horror stories. We’ve got friends who ran through firewalls to save themselves and ended up with burns. One family lost a father and son. We might have lost property, but there are people out there who are traumatised for ever. For me, it comes in waves. If I’m not talking about it, I’m OK. When we drove back, I was stunned. I joke that I’m a collector, not a hoarder, but I had a lot of stuff – big bookcases and stuff hanging from ceilings, and it’s all gone. We didn’t have insurance at the time of the bushfire. One of our children, without asking, started a GoFundMe page. When he found out, Tom was really angry and said, “We’re not a charity case.” Carly sat him down and said, “For 24 years, you have watered and fed people. People have come for two days and stayed for five because you make them feel welcome.” She said, “They’re donating to you. They want you to rebuild.” We’ve pissed mother nature off big time, and she’s paying us back. We’ve just been watching it get drier and drier – the whole valley’s been a tinderbox. Nobody heeded the warnings. Surely they’ll listen now.  Fina Montagner, 49, care nurse, and Anthony Montagner, 64, former electrician, with their sons Christian, 10, and Dylan, six, Upper Brogo Anthony We had gone into Bega to do some shopping on New Year’s Eve, and Fina and the boys decided to stay because everyone was talking about the fire. At about 5.30 that afternoon I came back here with the dogs to get the farm ready, thinking I could stay and fight the fire. At eight o’clock, there was no sign of fire. At 10 o’clock I went out to turn the generator off and noticed the glow to the west, 10, 15km out at least. I’ve had fires here in the past and I thought, well, that won’t be here till the morning. Forty-five minutes later, and the fire’s in my next gully. So I barely had 15 minutes to grab the dogs, a couple of cans of fuel, the kids’ bikes, a pair of jeans and I took off. I was only ever 10 minutes from the fire all the way to the coast.  I’ve had fires get away on me in the early years. This was a monster; it was racing as fast as my van would go. And the noise sounded like a couple of freight trains. It was sucking air in from all directions. It was a fire-breathing dragon, spitting hot flames everywhere. But it’s not climate change – I’ve heard of at least 180 people arrested for arson.  I haven’t been insured for 25 years. I’ve built what I had by scrounging. When I met Fina, she got a job so we were able to buy some new materials, but other than that everything in the house was built from bush wood. It was all repurposed junk. But I’m not going to do that again, there’s nothing left here to do it with. I’m not prepared to start scrounging again. We’ve got a caravan for the boys. We’ve got another coming for us. So we’re just going to camp here for the time being, maybe six months, a year.  Fina The little one seems OK, because he’s only six. But Christian is having issues. He gets very angry and then he’s anxious. He’s been really sad in the last few weeks. Anthony I don’t have one photo to show them what their grandmother looked like. I’m hoping my siblings might have some. I don’t have photos of my childhood or anything I’ve done as a teenager. It’s like I’ve never existed.  Fina We’re just hoping to be strong, emotionally, for the boys. They have got no one but us, so we need to show them that we are tough. Ron Corby Snr, 87, farmer; his son, Ron Jr, 67, farmer, and his wife Gloria, 71, housewife; granddaughter Tammie, 42, carer, with Brett Jee, 45, painter, and their sons (from left) Blake, 16, Myles, 12, Beau, 10, Mason, 14, in Wandella Ronald At 2.30am, I received an urgent call: “If you want to get out, get out now!” I looked out the window – everything looked normal and I went back to bed. Ten minutes later, my daughter pulled up and said, “Pop, get in the car and go! My house just burned down and the fire followed me, nearly as fast as I could drive.” When I came back a couple of days later, there was just charcoal. This fire was hotter than anything. I saw cars’ aluminium wheels melted and running down the gutter like a stream. The fire came from all angles, in whirling winds and twisters. It’s 35 years since the bush was last burnt out. The stuff in the mountains has been building up; you couldn’t walk through it, there’s that much rubbish. When the fire came, the whole mountain seemed to explode. I don’t think it was the climate crisis that caused this; I think it was neglect, not keeping the mountains clean.  I grew up in the Great Depression. Back then, it was a bit like this. We had nothing. But when someone was sick, the community would come together. I thought, in this modern age, that was gone – it looked like people would rather cut your throat. But I was wrong. A man who didn’t know me gave me A$500, and he’d probably lost his job the same as anyone. But the human love is there and stronger than ever.  Ron All my life I’ve fought bushfires, but there’s never been one like this: the fireballs, the way it roared, the flames, 50-60ft high. Sometimes it seemed to be above the ground, just burning the air. It sucked the roof off the house and threw our cars a kilometre away.  Tammie Forensics think two fire fronts collided and created their own storm. My brother had a bull that was killed in the fire and is still sitting upright. It was just instantly cooked, mummified. They told us that for that to happen, it had to reach 2,000 degrees. I don’t think it’s climate change; the bush here hasn’t been burned back in 15, 20 years. We have five boys. Mason has muscular dystrophy and we’d set up an aviary for him. He can’t do anything active, but loves birds and wanted to breed them. They were all lost. He was hard hit and cried quite a bit, but we’ve told him we’ll build him a new one.  We didn’t bring the boys straight out here. But our youngest, who’s 10, would not stop asking what it was like. Is this still OK? Is that still OK? So we thought we should show them that there is nothing salvageable. But he found a few garden ornaments and said, “Look, Mum, you can put this in the new garden.” Brett and I have been together 24 years. So when the insurance company says, “Can you write down a few lists of your assets?” there aren’t enough notebooks. I’ve not seen my husband cry like this. Brett’s father passed away a few years ago and he had a lot of his belongings here, tools and stuff you’ll never get again. But we’re just thankful that none of us are lost. All our family’s still here. Veronica Coen, 59, mental health clinician, and Murray Gibbs, 62, trike tour guide, Quaama Veronica We were away, visiting my daughter and her family. But this just wasn’t a fire that human beings could tame. It’s become very political. I call myself a fire refugee, and think about the people in the Pacific Ocean on the low-lying islands, and war refugees – because it’s as if there has been a war.  For a while I had a great deal of hope that the people who run the country would have to get it. That’s dissipating now. There has to be some kind of transformation in the way we govern. This two-party system is combative: they consume too much energy on the ego stuff and don’t respond to human need. A lot of people I’ve spoken to are clearly dealing with post-traumatic stress. I had a meltdown the other day and made someone else really sad. I was able to collect myself the next day and was welcomed back with open arms, because everybody’s falling apart. I’m a trauma-informed practitioner, and it’s a slow process. I’m not someone who usually posts my status on Facebook, but before I knew it, I just put it up there: “Don’t rush my recovery.” That’s really what it feels like.  In my work, we talk about collective trauma. Until now, I’ve only read papers and heard it spoken about in relation to Indigenous communities, for example. We talk about intergenerational trauma and collective trauma – this is what we have.  Pam Sweeny, 63, nurse, Cobargo My husband, Michael, and I had four children, and brought them up here in a way that’s kind to the environment. We’ve been using stand-alone solar power for 31 years. We’ve got our own water, and got rid of our own effluent in a way that’s friendly to mother nature. We had our family of native birds, too. We’d lie on the grass with the kids at night and watch the little gliders glide out. When we came back, the trees were still falling. It felt sad and unsafe. There was a big tree across the driveway, and piles of tin from the sheds that had been burned out. I wake up with tears, but then you just get busy. What we’ve done to Australia in the years that we’ve been here, us whitefellas, we’ve got to learn – we’ve done too much damage and mother nature’s hitting back. We didn’t even have a lock on the door, so we couldn’t get insurance. That is not unusual here. There’s loss, but we can replace it. New year, new beginning. We’ll be fine, but people who were used to spending five minutes in the shower and leaving their lights on [will struggle]. We’ve got to stop being such consumers, and think about where things come from: from mother nature. David Wilson, 59 (on right), and Kyle Moser, 41, both post office workers, Cobargo David I’m the licensee of Cobargo post office. Kyle and I moved here four years ago from the city, and we love the place. It’s the most unique community: 50% old-style farmers, 50% new people, often very musical or artistic. One in three says they’ve lost their house. We’re still hearing of people in hospital. Each one that dies is just a blackness, a real sadness. We didn’t really sleep on New Year’s Eve; we just watched and waited. It got to a point where it was coming in all directions. There’s only one road out, and it looked like the single bridge that leads into town was on fire, too. We headed for the ocean with four dogs, two cats and two rescued wallabies in the car.  The community response has been amazing: we had a relief centre, operational pretty much from that night, and it just grew. There were toilets, showers; they quickly got a generator on site. When Kyle and I came here, we were widely accepted as a gay couple. Quite a few families, although they might seem tough on the exterior, have a gay son or a gay nephew. During the marriage equality debate, we raised the rainbow flag, and Australia Post told us to take it down – they wanted to remain impartial. The response of the community was: “Well, if the boys can’t fly their flags, we’ll do it for them.” Shops put rainbow-coloured clothes over the balconies, the bookshop put rainbow-coloured books in the windows. It was amazing. We’re lucky that we’re insured, but precious things were lost. For my 50th birthday, we had a ring made with diamonds and my date of birth on – that’s gone.  But what upsets me most is the political inaction of the last two years, when they’ve been warned of these conditions. People had been asked for additional firefighting aircraft. They should be held criminally responsible.  Seraphina Leahy, 20, artist and barista, Wandella  I moved out here to get away from everyday life, and to try not to have an impact on the environment. When we heard there were fires coming, we packed up a few things and went to my mum’s house in Bermagui. Then the Rural Fire Service said we needed to evacuate. We went down to the beach, and when you looked back, you couldn’t see the mountain any more: it was pitch dark and a huge glow reflected on the ocean. We camped on the beach, and went fishing to calm our nerves, so we kept ourselves fed. We had my nana with us, who’s in her 80s. We had word that the house was gone, but until we saw it I didn’t really believe it. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, mentally and physically. The support’s been amazing; if we didn’t have that we probably wouldn’t be doing OK. You’ve got social media, and sometimes it feels as if everyone’s always arguing, but when something like this happens, humans pull together and look after each other. We were doing our best not to make an impact, having a carbon offset with all our trees. In two years it’s gone from lush green pastures and forest, to the leaves on the trees just dropping. The flowers don’t come out, the animals are struggling, everything is yellow and brown.  I think the prime minister needs to have more empathy. The government cut so much funding to forestry and national parks. Everyone’s dry in terms of resources; we need the land managed properly.  • Additional research by Annette Widitz.

,2020-12-18T17:28:08.840071Z,528,118,,"In an abstract presented at the 26th PACLIM Conference that was published in a recent issue of Quaternary International, Verosub (2015) writes about the challenges of maintaining and utilizing water supplies in California. However, the geologist from the University of California notes that what is often missing from discussions of water security is a consideration of the effects of natural climate variability beyond the historical record. As an example of such variability, Verosub cites the fact that river flow and lake measurements during the 20th century “document the occurrence of several multi‐​year droughts in the past 100 years while tree ring records show that 20‐​year and 70‐​year droughts occurred during the last 300 years.”   
  
  
On an even _longer_ time scale, the scientist reports that “at least once and probably several times in the last few thousand years, there have been droughts severe enough to drop the level of Lake Tahoe by several tens of meters, which allowed Douglas fir trees to grow to maturity on exposed lake beds.” Furthermore, other data indicate episodes of extreme flooding, such as the water year of 1861–1862 that brought extensive rainfall from Oregon down through southern California.   
  
  
In consequence of these realities, Verosub concludes that “the paleoclimate history of California suggests that even in the absence of climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases, decadal, multi‐​decadal, or even century‐​long droughts are a real possibility in the future for California as is flooding on a greater scale than was seen in the twentieth century.” According to Verosub, if such _natural_ events were to occur today, they would easily “wreck havoc with California’s delicately balanced water delivery system” in the case of drought, and “overwhelm the levee system and destroy California’s ability to transfer water from north to south” in the case of flooding. No doubt, such events would quickly be labeled by climate alarmists and advantage‐​seeking politicians as “human‐​caused.” Yet, given the historic periodicity of these events, there would be no way to prove that they weren’t natural. In fact, their mere occurrence would simply confirm that they _are_ natural, recurring over and over again throughout history, human influence notwithstanding. As such, the title of the author’s work provides some good advice for Californians: _Don’t worry about climate change; California’s natural climate variability will probably “get us” first_.

It’s been a particularly mild winter in Europe this year. But that hasn’t changed the long-term trend over the past 30 years.
Now that the February 2020 data have been coming in, we plot the mean February temperatures for some countries in Europe.
Sweden
Three of 5 stations show February mean temperature in Greta Thunberg’s Sweden have had a cooling trend since 1988! The real data will probably make the climate alarmists upset.

Data source: JMA. 
Great Britain
Twelve of 14 stations in UK show February mean temperatures have had a cooling or no warming trend since 1992! (Note: those 14 stations have data dating back at least to 1980s):

As a whole this northern European country has seen very little warming over the past 3 decades for the month of February:

Three of six stations in Finland show no warming since the 1980s. Data: JMA.
Ireland
Ireland, situated in the North Atlantic, also shows no warming for the month of February since 1987:

Four of 6 stations with data going back to the 1980s show no February warming. Data source: JMA
Netherlands
The story is the same in the Netherlands for the month of February. All 5 of 5 stations there with data going back to at least 1995 show February temperatures having a cooling trend:

Mean February temperatures have been falling at stations in the Netherlands since 1995. Data source: JMA. 
So it remains a mystery as to why global warming alarmists claim rapid warming is happening.

This will come as a surprise to Europeans, who have seen one of the mildest winters on record. According to RTL, “In those places where it was cold enough for snow at all, there was a lot of snow. The snow is meters high, higher than usual.”

By Die kalte Sonne
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
It almost hurts a little that “specialist for renewable energies” (own claim on Twitter) Prof. Volker Quaschning gets mentioned here so often. This is simply due to the absurd tweets the man continuously puts out.
His latest prank has to do with the storm Sabine, which earlier this week swept across Germany. It supplied a lot of energy in the form of wind, which made the wind turbines rotate strongly.
Even in the otherwise regulated electricity market, the laws of the market cannot simply be levered out. Supply and demand determine the price. If supply is higher than demand, the price falls.
In the case of electricity, even money might be included with the product when this electricity is purchased, meaning negative prices. Electricity is an extremely perishable “commodity”, it must be consumed at the moment of production. However, the “expert” Quaschning does not blame this oversupply and the negative prices on the volatile wind power plants, but rather on nuclear power and coal. They deliver very reliably and not wildly fluctuating like wind power.
Prof. Volker Quaschning tweeted in response to the negative electricity prices from overproduction which Germany saw during the recent storm:

Sturm und viel Wind sorgen wieder für negative Börsenstrompreise. Ein klares Zeichen, dass Kohle- und Atomkraftwerke zu unflexibel sind und nicht als Backup für erneuerbare Energien taugen. Wir brauchen darum einen schnelleren #Kohleausstieg. #FridaysForFuture #Scientists4Future pic.twitter.com/w7CRrEruoq
— Volker Quaschning (@VQuaschning) February 10, 2020

In English: “Storm and lots of wind are again causing negative stock market electricity prices. This is a clear sign that coal-fired and nuclear power plants are too inflexible and are not suitable as back-up for renewable energies. We therefore need a faster #coal exit.
#FridaysForFuture #Scientists4Future.”
A logical train of thought actually would have been to realize that highly volatile power sources such as wind and the simultaneous provision of base load are difficult to reconcile. Unfortunately, the energy source gas is also being massively fought by people like Quaschning, although it is more flexible and at the same time more CO2-friendly. In any case, however, it is only a crutch that might have to supply a great deal of energy, namely when we have the well-known lulls in wind and sun.
Every wind turbine and every photovoltaic system needs a backup. And anyone who has ever wondered why the wind countries of Denmark and Germany have such high electricity prices knows the reason. We are paying for a double power infrastructure. The prices will not decrease with an increasing share of renewable energies, but rather will continue to rise.

And believe me, these are the last people who want to make this argument. 



**CAMPAIGN 2006: Voters cool to climate issue in torrid midterm races**   
  
  
**Darren Samuelsohn, _Greenwire_ senior reporter**   
  
  
Five Northeastern Republicans facing fierce re‐​election battles turned just before the latest congressional recess to global warming in hopes the issue would boost their chances in their suburban House districts.   
  
  
But the lawmakers apparently got little traction from climate change in a campaign dominated by voter concerns about the Iraq war, President Bush’s unpopularity and overall dissatisfaction with Republican leadership.   
  
  
“It’s been very difficult for any of these incumbents whose problems are bigger than themselves, or whose problems have been themselves,” said Bernadette Budde, a senior vice president for the Business and Industry Political Action Committee. “They have had a hard time changing the subject.”   
  
  
The five — Reps. Curt Weldon (Pa.), Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Christopher Shays (Conn.), Nancy Johnson (Conn.) and Rob Simmons (Conn.) — cosponsored in September what some consider the most aggressive bill to date aimed at limiting heat‐​trapping greenhouse gas emissions. The bill’s lead sponsor is Rep. Henry Waxman (D‐​Calif.), the presumed new chairman of the House Government Reform Committee if his party wins a majority of House seats.   
  
  
“Doing it before Congress goes off to campaign is telling,” said Howard Reiter, chairman of the political science department at the University of Connecticut. He added that global warming is a nuanced subject that comes with an important caveat: It may require constituents to make sacrifices in their day‐​to‐​day lives.   
  
  
“The problem with global warming is its incremental,” Reiter said. “It’s not as if there’s an immediate crisis people can see.”   
  
  
Massie Ritsch, spokesman for The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending, said the recent media frenzy over climate change — from Hollywood‐​style documentaries to mainstream press coverage — did little to stir voters this year. “For all of the attention Al Gore’s movie got, it hasn’t stayed a major election issue,” he said.   
  
  
The lack of voter interest in climate change is not due to a lack of effort from environmental groups .…

,2020-12-21T17:37:19.188579Z,537,118,,"Warren Meyer, one of the first surfacestations.org volunteers, delivered Tucson for us Saturday. It was discovered during an analysis of climate stations around the USA on the Climate Audit blog that Tucson had the greatest positive temperature trend for any USHCN station after the TOBS adjustment was applied. The TOBS adjustment corrects for differences in local times of observation of temperature by the observer. The picture says it all:

Yes folks, this is an official climate station of record, the temperatures it measures go into our National Climatic Database and are used in research such as the graph produced by NASA Goddard Institute for Spaceflight Studies here:

There’s a British word that has been bandied about to describe the reaction to pictures like this one: “gobsmacked”. The word applies even more so since this station is operated by science faculty members at the University of Arizona.
They are so proud of this station they even had a sign made for it to hang on the chain link fence enclosure:

The complete photo essay is available at the Tucson album at www.surfacestations.org The satellite and aerial photo images there are telling of the environment being measured.

Besides the obvious questions like “why is it in the middle of a parking lot?” and “why would scientists who should know better allow such a bizarre siting for a USHCN climate station of record?” Then there is this burning question: “Why did they go to the trouble of installing a precision aspirated temperature sensor and then not even bother to place it at the standard observing height?”. 

It appears that the Stevenson Screen serves no other purpose except as an equipment holder, as Warren Meyer reports the Stevenson Screen to be empty. Originally the inside standard mounting board for the mercury max/min thermometers were mounted about 1.5 foot higher than the air inlet of the precision aspirated temperature sensor. So the lower mounting height for the precision sensor adds a positive bias.
Is there no diligence left in basic measurement? Is this what they teach in college science departments these days?

Among the findings:
■ Widespread instances of people and organisations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions.
■ Industrial companies profiting from doing very little – or from gaining carbon credits on the basis of efficiency gains from which they have already benefited substantially.
■ Brokers providing services of questionable or no value.
■ A shortage of verification, making it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits.
■ Companies and individuals being charged over the odds for the private purchase of European Union carbon permits that have plummeted in value because they do not result in emissions cuts.
From the article:
Some companies are benefiting by asking “green” consumers to pay them for cleaning up their own pollution. For instance, DuPont, the chemicals company, invites consumers to pay $4 to eliminate a ton of carbon dioxide from its plant in Kentucky that produces a potent greenhouse gas called HFC-23. But the equipment required to reduce such gases is relatively cheap. DuPont refused to comment and declined to specify its earnings from the project, saying it was at too early a stage to discuss.
The burgeoning regulated market for carbon credits is expected to more than double in size to about $68.2bn by 2010, with the unregulated voluntary sector rising to $4bn in the same period. 
Seems like the “green” here is not about Gaia…but all about Benjamins.

,2020-12-18T17:28:44.192221Z,540,120,,"Carmakers are bracing for a hybrid electric car price war this year as they try to avoid steep EU fines for carbon dioxide emissions. Some carmakers are struggling to hit tough new EU carbon emission rules introduced in January, which force them to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide their vehicles emit. This may force auto firms to slash prices on lower-emitting plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to encourage consumers to buy them, according to the investment bank UBS. Average CO2 emissions of almost all cars sold in the EU during the next two years must fall below 95g a kilometre, with heavy fines for carmakers that miss individual targets designed to meet the goal. The rules include the UK until at least 1 January 2021. Around €8.4bn (£7.1bn) will be wiped from carmakers’ profits over the next two years as they try to comply with the regulations. That’s €1bn more than previously expected, due to electric car delays and consumers’ desire for more polluting SUVs, according to calculations by UBS analysts led by Patrick Hummel. Sales of PHEVs, which can be charged from an external source without using the internal combustion engine, need to grow sevenfold between 2019 and 2021, they said. “As [carmakers] likely need to aggressively push PHEVs to their customers, we see risk of a price war in the course of 2020,” wrote Hummel. Germany’s Daimler, the maker of Mercedes Benz cars, and France’s Renault are particularly at risk of missing their targets and having to pay large fines. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is also at risk, despite a deal thought to be worth hundreds of millions of euros to “pool” its emissions with Tesla’s zero-emissions cars. While legal, the deal has been heavily criticised by campaigners. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, is also exposed, with costs of £179m expected over the next two years. Britain’s largest carmaker, which has just launched a second round of tough cost-cutting as it struggles with electric investments, needs to increase its hybrid sales rapidly, UBS said. The green credentials of some hybrid cars are controversial because of their continued use of polluting internal combustion engines alongside battery motors. Julia Poliscanova, clean vehicles director at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based thinktank, said there is evidence that plug-in hybrids rarely achieve the emissions reductions predicted by lab tests because users fail to charge them. “In the real world, their emissions are often two or three times higher,” she said, referencing findings from the Miles Consultancy which said many business users never used their charging cables. If plug-in hybrids are not charged, they can even emit more carbon dioxide and air pollution than the equivalent car without a battery, because a smaller engine is pulling more weight and therefore running less efficiently. Nevertheless, plug-in hybrids, which can be charged from external sources, are a key part of carmakers’ emission-reduction efforts, because they can use the same factories in which they have already sunk billions of euros in investment. The emissions limits could hardly have come at a worse time for the car industry, with China’s market suffering two years of recession even before the coronavirus outbreak and sales of their profitable diesel cars in freefall following the “dieselgate” emissions cheating scandal. At the same time, consumer confidence is weakening across some key European markets and Brexit uncertainty has dented sales in Britain. “The new car market is soft at the moment so dealers are having to work hard,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT, the UK car industry’s lobby group. “It’s a buyer’s market.” The costs of complying with the regulations are expected to vary across carmakers, which have radically different strategies. For instance, Volkswagen, the world’s largest carmaker by volume, has launched an all-out electric assault, with plans to produce 1m battery electric cars by the end of 2023. Rival executives believe the company panicked after its reputation was sullied by the dieselgate scandal. Rival manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have instead focused in the short term on hybrids, which are easier to produce using existing factories and avoid problems such as shortages of lithium ion batteries. Car executives argue that hybrids are essential to reduce society’s emissions. However, they are also particularly attractive from a regulatory perspective. All hybrids that emit less than 50g of CO2 per kilometre under test conditions qualify for “supercredits” for the next two years. This means they count double under the EU regulations, so carmakers are equally incentivised to sell hybrids and battery electric vehicles. “Plug-in hybrids are a short-term compliance strategy for vehicle manufacturers,” said Poliscanova. “They are unavoidably costly because you are locked into two engines and a motor. They should not be part of the future.”",2020-12-18T17:28:44.192253Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:01:31.159033Z,541,120,,"At 07:30 on July 1, 1916, a private in the British army – let’s call him Tommy Atkins – scrambled out of a trench in front lines and advanced across no man’s land towards the German trenches in the Battle of Albert, the opening phase of the Battle of the Somme. He had covered no more than 30 yards when he felt as if someone had hit him on the back of the head with a mallet. Checking himself dazedly, he realised that he must have taken a bullet in the left shoulder because the whole area was suddenly bright crimson. Private Tommy Atkins had just become one of the 57,470 British casualties on the now-notorious first day of the Somme. His actions in the next few seconds would ultimately save his life. He tore off the field dressing sewn to the inside of his uniform jacket, ripped it open and applied the contents to his wound before making his way back to the aid post. Tommy Atkins was lucky, not merely because the bullet had not killed him. He was lucky because this was 1916 and not 1914, and the nature of his field dressing therefore meant he had a good chance of staying alive rather than subsequently dying of sepsis caused by infection of his wound.  Death as a result of even relatively minor injuries due to sepsis and gas gangrene had been a major problem in the first years of World War I. Appalling conditions in the trenches meant that wounds were generally accompanied by fragments of dirty clothing and the bodily filth plastered about the battlefields.   In 1915, however, an army surgeon named Charles Cathcart recalled that even quite terrible wounds had been successfully dressed on the battlefield in ancient times using a group of bog mosses known as sphagnum. On the basis of some successful trials, he instigated a nationwide programme of bog moss collection to create what would become the standard field dressing issued to all UK and Imperial land forces as an integral part of their uniform. People gathered the humble bog moss across the country, from Bodmin Moor to the far north of Shetland. Moss provided a number of improvements over the cotton-based dressings used in the early period of the war. Sphagnum is primarily adapted to storing water – vast quantities of it – and it was capable of absorbing more than twice as much blood and fluids as cotton wool, thus initially helping to dry out the wound.  It was fibrous like cotton, and therefore helped to seal the wound, but unlike cotton wool it also appeared to prevent infection of the wound in some mysterious way. It was later discovered that sphagnum releases a chemical called “sphagnan” which inhibits nitrogen uptake by decomposer organisms, sending them into a form of stasis. This is what saved Private Tommy Atkins and thousands like him from a lingering death by sepsis even though the original injury trauma may have been successfully treated. Despite this record of success, the medical use of sphagnum was largely discontinued after World War I. In part, this may have been because supply chains relied on the rather laborious process of harvesting the moss in the wild. Its later use in certain sanitary products ended more recently, however, when significant concerns were raised about the environmental damage caused by such wild harvesting.   Indeed, it is the environmental damage caused by the unsustainable harvesting of sphagnum and its semi-decomposed remains – which we know as peat – that has led colleagues and I to investigate a new type of farming called “paludiculture”, namely harvesting wetland products on the re-wetted soils of former wetlands. In their natural state, such peat soils represent long-term carbon storage, often on millennial timescales. If such soils are damaged, this long-term carbon store is progressively oxidised, releasing lots of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Studies have indicated that turning peat soils into farmland is potentially the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions per unit area in the UK lowlands. Working with various partners, our research is investigating ways of growing sphagnum as a commercial crop on re-wetted organic soils. We are seeking to produce a sustainable growing medium with a view to replacing the use of peat – which is essentially just ancient sphagnum – within both the professional horticulture industry and the retail trade.  We are also exploring with Greenwich University the possibility of re-establishing sphagnum as a modern medical material for use in wound treatment and anti-microbial action, thereby coming full circle to that day on the Somme when the life of Private Tommy Atkins was saved by the extraordinary properties of the material in his field dressing.

The paper, in press, journal pre-proof, analyzes natural variability in European monthly temperatures on decadal and multidecadal timescales and their possible drivers.
NAO, AMO, sun behind temperature variability 
The authors claim to have established characteristic correlations of temperature with ocean cycles, here NAO and AMO, and solar activity for many regions and seasons. This means it is likely that NAO, AMO and solar activity are the actual drivers of a lot of the temperature variability.

Image: Decadal and multidecadal natural variability in European temperature, Lüdecke et al, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics (journal pre-proof).
The authors did NOT look at the anthropogenic component of the long term warming of the past 150 years and its attribution but feel the results will hopefully help to better attribute shorter-term temperature changes and their typical patterns.
Chance for midterm temperature prognoses
This is important because efforts by the scientific community are progressing to better predict NAO and AMO for months and a few years in advance, This opens up new chances for more robust mid term temperature prognoses that also includes natural climate variability which the  paper documents.
The paper’s preliminary abstract (emphasis added):




European monthly temperatures undergo strong fluctuations from one year to the other. The variability is controlled by natural processes such as Atlantic cycles, changes in solar activity, volcanic eruptions, unforced internal atmospheric variability, as well as anthropogenic factors. This contribution investigates the role of key natural drivers for European temperature variability, namely the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity changes. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients r for AMO, NAO and sunspots compared to monthly temperature data of 39 European countries for the period 1901–2015 in order to search for ‘fingerprints’ of the natural drivers. A cross correlation window of 11 months was chosen for AMO, NAO and of 120 months for SILSO to account for possible time lags or phase shifts. The r coefficients were mapped out across Europe on a monthly basis to document regional and seasonal changes of the correlation strength. The NAO dominates European temperature variability during the winter months, with strongest relationship in February. The AMO modulates temperatures in March to November, with best correlations occurring in summer, but also in April. Regions of strongest AMO and NAO impacts shift across the continent from month to month, forming systematic patterns. Direct correlation of the solar 11-year Schwabe cycle with temperatures was identified only in some countries in certain multidecadal intervals during February, March, June and September. Previous studies have suggested a significant solar influence on the AMO and NAO. It is likely that the greatest impact of solar activity on European temperatures is of a non-linear, indirect nature by way of interaction with Atlantic cycles.”






The paper’s graphs show an oscillation of temperature that challenge the sharply rising GISS-like narrative for Europe.

,2020-12-18T17:29:54.651292Z,546,120,,"Deer, bison and pronghorn traverse the plains in large herds…scavengers quickly sniff out carrion, sockeye salmon leap upstream, wolves attack in packs surrounding their prey, geese fly in fixed formations, possums play dead, rodents scamper into tree hollows, grizzly bears bluff charge when threatened and birds of prey soar on thermals. That may sound like a mountie’s report on the Canadian wilderness, but it’s actually how Rockstar recently promoted Red Dead Redemption 2 – its critically acclaimed game, which transports players to a sprawling and immersive Wild West. Red Dead Redemption 2 features more than 200 species of animal in a variety of habitats, and its record breaking success  suggests that authentic natural environments which mimic the ecology of the real world will become a mainstay of future titles.  Video games have grown in scale and complexity to the point where intricate virtual ecosystems of this kind are now possible, with flora and fauna living and behaving in these virtual worlds as they do in ours. As of 2018, the worldwide games industry was estimated to be worth around £100 billion. To put that into perspective, it’s 1.5 times bigger than the movie industry and five times bigger than the music industry, with one in three people on the planet being a gamer. Not bad for an industry that is only around 50 years old. Alongside the huge financial success of modern games is the ever-growing size of “open-world games”, in which players are free to explore vast and interactive virtual worlds. These virtual environments have gone from simple mono-block representations of landscapes to dynamic and interactive ecosystems. They have plants that can be foraged and a variety of wildlife that demonstrate complex AI-driven behaviour, interacting with the player and each other.  Within Red Dead Redemption 2, apex predators such as alligators lurk patiently underwater, anything (including other animals) in the game that venture too close to the water’s edge quickly meets its demise. Deer will also react to unseen predators, alerting the player to cougars lurking in nearby grass. Horses, one of the most important animals in the game, also react to other wildlife – bolting at the sign of a bear or hidden rattlesnake – demonstrating authentic animal intelligence. Guerrilla Games’s open world role playing game Horizon Zero Dawn features machine as well as organic “animals”. The machine animals in particular exhibit behaviours that don’t primarily rely on the player’s interaction. “Corrupted” machines will often attack their non-corrupted counterparts, with the player often coming across the bodies of dead machines, alluding to a dynamic world that exists outside the player’s attention.  The bodies of fallen machine animals, like in any real ecosystem, are not wasted. If not engaged in combat or roaming territory, “scrappers” (machines resembling hyenas), and “glinthawks” (giant vulture-type machines) will consume fallen machine animals they detect nearby – replicating decomposition and nutrient cycling.  Nintendo’s open world game Zelda: Breath of The Wild uses “virtual foraging” which is required to progress through the game. However just like the real world, players also need to be careful as flora and fauna can be easily over-foraged, forcing the player to  wait for stocks to replenish. All of this is more impressive when we consider that it has all been achieved in a single generation. Video games as a medium are relative newcomers – the industry only emerged in the 1970s. After the same length of time, films were still black and white. One can only wonder what gamers will be playing ten, 20 or even 50 years from now. Ecosystems in games are increasingly dynamic and “lived-in”, which opens the potential for education. Anna Groves, an American ecologist and gamer explained:  A kid who loves lighting the Hyrulian grassland on fire just might get excited about grassland restoration ecology when they find out it involves lighting real-life grasslands on fire. As games increasingly use ecology as a core gameplay feature, its value and relevance as a subject field will inevitably increase – exposing children to an academic subject in an accessible and enjoyable manner. Video games offer unparalleled creative freedom to explore subjects like ecology. Designers can create environments filled with long extinct species or pristine ecosystems that recreate how wilderness may have looked before human intervention. Children may “play” with imagined scenarios of the natural world in an intuitive, immersive and fun manner, far surpassing what is possible in traditional educational approaches.  As a result, they may gain a deeper appreciation of what natural states are possible through conservation than even a student engaging with depleted ecosystems in the real world could. With the advent of virtual ecology, video games are increasingly functioning as “conduits” to other disciplines. Landscape architecture and psychology are increasingly feeding into contemporary game design. In the future, disciplines such as engineering, geology and even medicine could start to inform the next generation of games.  When designing the worlds we play in, future game designers might increasingly be educated in “traditional” elements of landscape design, including ecology and architecture. With this also comes the opportunity for people in different fields to collaborate in shaping the worlds of future video games, radically reshaping both professions in the process.",2020-12-18T17:29:54.651325Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:35:32.638022Z,547,119,,"Coalition MPs and the Australian newspaper have accused the New Zealand government of hypocrisy over its objections to Australia’s use of what are known as carryover credits to meet climate targets under the Paris agreement. Are they right?  The Australian published comments by four Coalition backbenchers suggesting New Zealand’s climate change minister, James Shaw, was a hypocrite for saying there had been an “allergic reaction” in the international community to countries wanting to use an accounting measure to meet their 2030 climate target under the Paris agreement. There is no question Shaw was referring to Australia: it is the only country planning to use the measure – carryover credits claimed for having emitted less than previous self-set targets – under the Paris agreement. The backbenchers said New Zealand government was itself relying on carryover credits, in this case to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol. The newspaper followed up with an editorial on Wednesday headed “Jacinda Ardern’s climate policy virtue signal exposed”, saying among other things that New Zealand was not on track to meet the 2030 target it lodged in Paris. Jason Falinski, a moderate from New South Wales, said NZ had shown a “lack of consistency and standards” in criticising countries for using the credits. James Paterson, a Victorian senator and former staff member at climate change-denying Institute of Public Affairs, said it was appropriate for Australia to “reserve the right to get credit for its success in reducing emissions”. The former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce said New Zealand should not be lecturing Australia about environmental policy. Gerard Rennick, a Queensland senator who does not accept mainstream climate science, suggested Australia could reduce its emissions by deporting 600,000 New Zealanders. The Australian editorial adopted the language of the Morrison government, including claiming it was “working towards” meeting its 2030 target (a 26% to 28% cut below 2005 levels) “with or without Kyoto carry-over credits”, while New Zealand was forecast to miss its target. At one highly qualified level, yes: New Zealand says it will use 27.7m tonnes of carry-over credits to meet its 2020 target under the Kyoto protocol. Like Australia, it “beat” its target under the first stage of the Kyoto protocol, the precursor to the Paris agreement, which included targets for developed countries up to 2012. It means that, like Australia, it could carry those credits forward and count them against its target for the second stage of the Kyoto deal, which ends this year. Unlike Australia, New Zealand would need the credits to meet its 2020 Kyoto target (a 5% cut below 1990 levels). Australia will meet its 2020 target without them. Not really. But before we get to that, a couple of caveats. Firstly, New Zealand did not actually sign up to the second period of the Kyoto protocol. The former National party government opted not to make its 2020 target legally binding, but said it would still meet the goal using UN rules. Jacinda Ardern has focused on the Paris agreement, including committing the country to net zero emissions by 2050, with a lower target for methane from agriculture. Secondly, it is arguable whether Australia is actually meeting its 2020 target. The government usually describes its 2020 target as a 5% cut below 2000 levels. But, according to government projections, national emissions this year will be only 0.3% lower than in 2000. The reason that, despite this, it can still claim to be beating its 2020 target is explained here. New Zealand deserves criticism for not meeting its Kyoto target. But under the most important test – is what the countries are doing enough? – both Australia and New Zealand have failed under the Kyoto protocol. Both set inadequate targets based on what scientists say would be their fair share of emissions cuts would be under a meaningful climate deal. Both used creative accounting and loopholes to further limit action. New Zealand is not meeting its low 2020 target and assessments suggest it is not on track to meet its 2030 target (a 30% cut compared with 2005). But it recently passed a zero-carbon act for 2050 and is revising its emissions trading scheme. Australia is meeting its low target using accounting rules, but has not reduced its emissions below what they were 20 years ago. Despite what the government says, it has no evidence it it is on track to meet its 2030 target without using carryover credits. It has no long-term target or, at this point, new policies. Shaw is not being hypocritical in suggesting Australia shouldn’t use Kyoto carryover credits to meet its 2030 Paris target for one, simple reason: the agreement struck in the French capital is a completely different treaty to Kyoto. The rules of the Kyoto protocol are clear: countries can claim credit against future targets if they beat earlier targets. The Paris agreement does not mention carryover credits, and is legally separate to the Kyoto agreement. Credits from Kyoto have no formal status under it, and New Zealand has no plan to use them its 2030 target. The implied goal of the Paris deal is net zero emissions, which means boosting cuts over time, not finding ways to limit them. While the Morrison government claims otherwise, Australia’s attempt to use Kyoto credits under Paris has been widely criticised by other countries and remains a point of unresolved disagreement at UN negotiations. Laurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris accord, told the Financial Times: “If you want this carryover, it is just cheating. Australia was willing, in a way, to destroy the whole system, because that is the way to destroy the whole Paris agreement.” Shaw’s claim that there has been an “allergic reaction” to Australia’s planned reliance on carry over credits might be colourful, but is not hypocritical nor inaccurate. With at least 100 countries signed up to groups that oppose them, it seems a pretty reasonable call. Bill Hare, from policy and science institute Climate Analytics, puts it more bluntly. He says New Zealand should be applauded for rejecting the use of carryover in the Paris deal, and the hypocrites in this exchange are the Australian politicians who profess to be concerned about climate change while promoting policies, including the use of carryover credits, that will result in higher emissions.",2020-12-19T16:35:32.638054Z,1

,2020-12-18T17:30:53.816403Z,552,120,,"You may recall that back in May I did a simple preliminary experiment to give me guidance on a hypothesis: That changes in paint on Stevenson Screens over time make a measurable difference on the temperatures recorded inside them. This stems from the fact that when the Weather Bureau commissioned the design in 1892, whitewash was specified. But whitewash is no longer commonly available, and the National Weather Service changed the specification in 1979 to be semi-gloss latex paint.
But, cured whitewash is composed of Calcium Carbonate, while latex paint uses Titanium Dioxide as a pigment. While they both appear “white” in visible light, they have vastly different properties in infrared.
My first simple experiment used thermistors in boreholes into 3 wood slats; 1 bare wood as a control, the other two painted with whitewash and latex, showed me that there was a measurable difference in the temperature of the wood by as much as 2-4 degrees at times. I needed to do that experiment before I embarked on the full scale test, since each of the Stevenson Screens you see here in the pictures cost me about $1000.00 Since I’m doing this out of pocket, with no funding or grants, I had to try a small scale test first.
The photos show 3 standard Stevenson Screens as used today in the United States. One is bare wood, unpainted, as a control, the middle one is latex, as sent from the supplier, and the third is painted with a historically accurate (for early 20th century) whitewash mixture that I obtained both materials and formula from the head chemist at the National Lime Company.

The device on the tripod is a stacked plate IR shield with a small fan to pull air through, commonly called an aspirated shield. It is the air temperature reference and placed at the same exposure height as the thermistiors in the screens. Also nearby but not shown is a pyranometer to measure solar insolation and wind speed/direction sensors that are being datalogged as well.
Each Stevenson Screen and the air temperature reference sensor are fitted with matched, calibrated thermistors, NIST traceable with certificates, that are connected to a calibrated data-logger, also with a certificate. The resolution is .01 degree Fahrenheit with an accuracy of +/- 0.1 degree over the range.
I expect that the air temperature differences inside the screens will be less than the 2-4 degrees I observed in the paint slat test. It’s possible that there will be no significant difference at all. I won”t know until I run about a months worth of datalogging.
The site, while not ideal due to the trees, is the best I could get permission to use.  Fortunately the trees do not directly shade the screens except for a short portion of the day. It’s also out of the way, so vandalism will not be likely. Since it had to be an unwatered grass field, concerns over fire danger were raised from some I asked because of the electronics package, so I had limited choices. Perhaps later I’ll be able to find a better site but for now it will have to do.
The whitewash on the third Stevenson Screen is still curing, as the chemical reaction is not yet complete to convert Calcium Hydroxide to Calcium Carbonate. In about a week, I’ll make the data available via a web link in near real-time.

,2020-12-19T16:03:37.548647Z,554,120,,"Polychaetes are a class of segmented worms that live under a wide range of oceanic conditions. Often, they are the dominant organisms found living in the sea floor, but they also thrive in the open ocean. According to Ricevuto _et al_. (2015), although knowledge of the potential response of these organisms to ocean acidification is growing, much remains to be learned, including “how their trophic behavior might change in response to low [less basic, or more acidic] pH.” In an effort to fill this informational void, Ricevuto _et al_. thus set out to examine food-chain interactions of three polychaete species ( _Platynereis dumerilii_ , _Polyophthalmus pictus_ and _Syllis prolifera_ ) and their organic matter (food) sources (macroalgae, seagrass and epiphytes) in a naturally acidified region of the Mediterranean Sea.   




The location for their study was a shallow water reef area on the north-eastern coast of Ischia, an island off the coast of Italy known for volcanic features, including underwater vents that release copious quantities of CO2. The vents produce a pH gradient in the area that provides “a natural laboratory for ocean acidification studies,” which the researchers further describe as “an ideal model system to conduct experiments investigating the effect of climate changes (particularly ocean acidification) on benthic community composition and structure, as well as on functional aspects, such as tropic interactions,” which was the focus of this study. And what did the study show?   
  
After collecting data and conducting a series of complex analyses, the three Italian researchers report “increased pCO2 did not alter the trophic interactions dramatically,” adding “there seems to be a resilience in the trophic pattern, possibly due to the tolerance of the target species to acidification and potential local acclimatization and/or adaptation (see Calosi _et al_., 2013).” Such “phenotypic plasticity” (the ability to alter biochemical reactions based on environmental changes such as increasing temperature or acidity) observed in the three polychaete species studied, according to Ricevuto _et al_., “may allow them to respond well to alterations in the environment and eventually offset near-future ocean acidification scenarios.” Thus, as the researchers ultimately conclude, “for some species, like the ones considered in this study, ocean acidification may not represent a dramatic stress.” And that’s good news worth reporting.

As we learn about the environmental impacts of mass cattle farming, the future is looking bleak for the beef and dairy lobbies. US citizens need to cut milk by 60% and beef by 90% to prevent global heating changes, according to researchers. If dairy’s out, then, what milk is best for the world? You can now get milk from soy beans, cashews or tiger nuts - just to name a few. All are far better for the planet than dairy, according to a 2018 study. (The Guardian’s own analysis of vegan options was published this week.) But the dairy lobby is not going down without a fight, going as far as demanding that milk alternatives cannot be called “milk”. Today, Virginia’s legislature has proposed to make alternative milks parading as real milk “unlawful”. What is real milk, you ask? According to them, it is “the lacteal secretion of a healthy, hooved mammal.” (Yum!) This has led to existential questions such as “do we have to change the name of peanut butter?” and “what about breast-milk?” There is, in fact, an exception in the bill that accepts that breast-milk is the real deal, but the fact that a loophole needs to exist does make you wonder what this whole thing is really about. In the words of Shakespeare, “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” Perhaps that’s the problem. This article was amended on 31 January 2020 to correct that the Virginia legislature has proposed the change, but it has not been signed off by the Senate and governor.",2020-12-22T13:20:50.870084Z,1

Dr. Gavin Schmidt replied on June 22nd, 2007 with:
My comments stand. The station data are not used *in* climate models, and
they are not used to predict future climate. So yes, the sentence you have
is just wrong. I’m not sure how you could edit it to make it correct.
We compare the models to the gridded products that deal with individual
station problems as best they can. We have used the GISTEMP and CRU
products to do so. (Semantic note, ‘compare to’ is not the same as
‘include in’). For the specific station you have highlighted, the grid
point trends in the products (~0.5 deg – eveballing it, since I’m on
travel) are significantly less than the trend you show (2 deg or so).
Climate model results for the 20th C are similar (i.e. 0.5 deg). Thus
reductions of the trend at this station would actually improve the match
to the model – always being clear that you shouldn’t really compare
model grid boxes to individual stations…
If you are of the opinion that this station is contaminated, then you have
to admit that the process designed to remove artefacts in the GISS or CRU
products has in fact done so – (i.e. that grid box in the product does not
have a 2 deg/Century trend).
Improvements to that process and the data are always welcome, but do not
ascribe consequences to your project that clearly do not follow.

So one has to wonder.
If Dr. Schmidt’s point is only the observation that they do not reconcile their models with every individual station (as opposed to gridcell composites calculated by GISS and CRU), then there is no misunderstanding.
However, it is very clear that the NASA GISS and CRU (Climate Research Unit) use this station data in arriving at their gridcell values which are what is presumably used in testing the models.  From 53 USHCN site surveys done so far we know that a number of stations do not meet published WMO (World Meteorological or NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published standards.
There is no evidence at present that NASA GISS or CRU have made any effort to verify quality control standards at these USHCN stations. Whether these quality control issues will have a significant impact on overall averages remains to be seen.  The only way to tell for certain is by examining individual stations though the site survey process as is being done on www.surfacestations.org and then doing an assessment of how pervasive the quality control problems are and what the potential impact of these problems may be.
But, any problems in individual USHCN stations will affect gridcell values. For non meteorologists, a gridcell is a box on a map that has been divided up into a x-y  lines and specific data applied to each box. This helps in computer modeling because with computer programs it is easier to divide into cells, then calculate and display. Below is an example  map that may help you visualize gridcells:

Whether it’s a big problem or a little problem remains to be seen, but it’s odd for Dr. Schmidt to pretend that it’s not a problem because they use the gridded version of the data.

,2020-12-19T16:35:57.596484Z,559,120,,"Stephanie Kelton’s _The Deficit Myth_ is quite the talk of the town. To quote Amazon’s webpage:



It’s an attractive vision, but it doesn’t work.



I am reminded of Einstein’s time at the Swiss Patent Office where he used to check applications to patent perpetual motion machines. They don’t work, but the fun is working out why. The same applies to proposals to bring about prosperity that depend on loosening the monetary spigots. MMT is a perfect example.



MMT is a macroeconomic school of thought in the post‐​Keynesian tradition. Its central tenets: fiscal deficits don’t matter; monetary policy should be subordinate to fiscal policy; and the monetary authorities should be willing to issue base money to finance government spending. MMT is associated with large‐​scale government spending, a focus on ending involuntary unemployment, and programs to alleviate poverty and fight climate change.



Kelton’s book builds on earlier work by Warren Mosler and Randall Wray but has its roots in Abba Lerner’s system of “functional finance,” which goes back to the 1960s. She builds on Lerner primarily by adding a federal job guarantee that would eliminate involuntary unemployment and provide an automatic economic stabilizer.



MMT makes _big_ promises. It would “build a more just economy that works for the many and not just the few” and put “people and planet first.” “MMT’s lens enables us to see that another kind of society is possible, one in which we can afford to invest in health care, education, and resilient infrastructure. In contrast to narratives of scarcity, MMT promotes a narrative of opportunity.”



But does MMT deliver? Let’s see what she says.



“The idea that taxes pay for what the government spends is pure fantasy,” writes Kelton. Really? Let’s go back to basics. The government must finance all its expenditures. In a world in which it does not issue debt and does not issue currency, and assuming away any gifts it might receive, all its expenditures must be financed by current taxation.



If the government can issue debt but not issue currency, then it can finance its expenditures by current taxation or by issuing debt. But to issue debt is to pass on the obligation to repay that debt to future taxpayers. If that debt is to be repaid, then it must be repaid out of future tax proceeds.



If the government can issue its own currency and monopolizes the issuance of currency, then it can also pay off its debt obligations as they come due by issuing additional base money (“printing money”). Does this mean that printing money allows the government to avoid the need to raise taxes? No, because printing money lowers its value against goods and services, and so operates as a tax on money holdings and other holdings of wealth that are fixed in nominal terms (such as level annuities). So, barring gifts, all government expenditures must be financed by taxation in one form or another.



Kelton explains:



This sounds great: involuntary unemployment eliminated and everyone willing to work gets a high federal minimum wage or more, to the extent that market wages are forced higher to compete. But hold on. If it is such a good idea, why not raise the minimum wage beyond the $15 an hour she suggests? Why not $30 an hour? Or $50? The problem is that there are a raft of jobs that are profitable to provide at existing wages but would disappear at higher wages.1 It is not just the existing unemployed who would end up on federal payrolls but these newly unemployed too, and many of their employers. Think of the restaurant sector. That sector and others in the same position could only survive by hiking their prices: dining out would become a lot dearer. Ordering in, too. The federal government, the employer of last resort, would find itself with the problem of what to do with all these people also turning up for guaranteed jobs. The feds would have crowded out much of the labor market and wiped out the lower paid sectors of the economy.



“Why does the financing have to come from Uncle Sam?” asks Kelton. “Simple. He can’t run out of money.” Imagine that the government pays debts coming due by handing over dollar bills that it has in a chest in the basement. If it runs out of bills, then it will default the next time a payment comes due. But then imagine if it can also print money. If it runs out of bills, it can avoid default when the next payment comes due by printing more. It does not follow, however, that the government can _always_ meet its payment obligations by printing more money.



Suppose the government prints money at an accelerating rate and we end up with an accelerating hyperinflation. The traditional tax‐​collection apparatus will break down because the tax revenue will be worth almost nothing by the time it comes in. Similarly, the government will effectively be unable to borrow in its own currency because the borrowed funds would also be worth next to nothing by the time they come in. As the hyperinflation accelerates further, the real value of the revenue from printing money also goes to zero. The government then faces the prospect of default despite being able to print any amount of its own money. To give an example, by the end of the Hungarian hyperinflation of 1946, the total value of all Hungarian notes in circulation was a thousandth of a U.S. cent (see Judt 2006: 87). The Hungarian government didn’t have a cent, let alone a dime. The Hungarian government would have been unable to make repayments denominated in other currencies or make inflation‐​linked payments in its own.



The mistake is to presume that what is correct at the margin (i.e., that the government can avoid default by issuing a few extra dollar bills) is also correct under any circumstances, that is, at any scale. There is also the related point that issuing a small amount of money will have a negligible impact on prices but issuing a lot of money will not.



It is a “myth,” writes Kelton, “that deficits will burden the next generation.” This claim is also wrong. Suppose Congress passes a Boomers Boomtime Act to provide for a humongous 75th birthday payout to each surviving member of the first Boomer cohort born in 1946. They will reach 75 in 2021. These payments are to be financed by a zero‐​coupon bond with a 40‐​year maturity. Since none of the beneficiaries will be around to pay taxes when the bond is due to be repaid, they get a free handout.



Who bears the burden of paying for it? When the Boomer bond comes due in 2061, the government faces the following choices: (a) pay it off by raising taxes, (b) pay it off by issuing money, (c) default, (d) pay it off by rolling over, that is, by issuing a new bond.



If (a), then the burden is borne by taxpayers in 2016.



If (b), the subsequent price level is higher, so the burden takes the form of a tax on money holdings and other instruments of fixed nominal value.



If (c), default, the burden is borne by those who suffer the adverse consequences of default.



If (d), then the rollover will mean that there will more debt after 2061 than there would otherwise have been and we have the same choices again when the new payments come due. If the decision is to roll over each time, then the debt/​GDP ratio will hit a level at which the government defaults sooner than otherwise.2 Thus, however the government responds when the Boomer bond matures, some group born after 1946 bears a burden from it.



More generally, any arrangement that involves one group issuing a debt that another group is expected to pay for _necessarily_ burdens the second group. The injustice is all the worse because the second group has no say in the matter.



There are also the government’s entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicaid, etc. This takes us to Kelton’s “myth” that “entitlements are propelling us toward a long‐​term fiscal crisis.… There is absolutely no good reason for Social Security benefits, for example, to ever face cuts. Our government will always be able to meet future obligations because it can never run out of money.”



These programs however are just another form of debt insofar as they create obligations on the government’s part to make future payments. Consequently, my earlier argument, that programs that create future obligations burden future generations, applies here also.



Entitlements are large, so the corresponding burdens would be large as well. To illustrate, there are perhaps $210 trillion in entitlements, and possibly more.3 If these entitlements are to be paid for by future taxation, then that is a lot of future taxation. If they are to be paid for by rolling over, then we would anticipate the ratio of debt (including entitlements) to GDP rising considerably, possibly to default levels.



Then there is the option of meeting those obligations by printing money. Given that the current stock of base money is just over $5 trillion, that response implies a possible 42‐​fold‐​plus expansion of the monetary base. That, in turn, implies a considerable increase in prices. Making entitlement payments is one thing, but the purchasing power of those payments is another.



We have here another instance of the margin vs. scale issue. The government can increase entitlements a little with next to no impact on their real value. But if the government creates huge entitlements to be financed by printing money, then those entitlements are going to be greatly devalued in purchasing power terms. And what the government must absolutely _not_ do is create huge entitlements that are inflation‐​linked and then rely on printing money to finance them. If it does that, it will produce both hyperinflation and default. The “myth,” that the national debt is a problem, is not a myth.



We can break down MMT into a set of policy _ends_ (what the government spends _on_ ), and a set of policy _means_ (how the government finances its spending), which in the case of MMT would involve large deficits and a lot of borrowing and money printing. The expenditure and the financing of that expenditure are two different issues. Bernie Sanders might use MMT to advance a more right‐​wing version of the Kelton agenda, but Donald Trump might seize upon the spending opportunities promised by MMT to advance his own, even more right‐​wing, agenda, for example, to promote policies that work for the few and not the many.



My point is that it is short‐​sighted and potentially counterproductive to promote a particular policy package such as MMT because _you_ can use it to finance projects that _you_ like, because someone else might use it to finance projects that you do _not_ like. To the extent that MMTers persuade people that MMT‐​based government finance is a good idea, they can hardly restrict that message to people who share their own political views. If you think of MMT as a government‐​financing package, then that financing package can be used to finance any government spending program, whatever its political hue.



A deeper issue is that any policy that gives policymakers the appearance of being able to spend a lot without having to bear the unpopularity of the high taxes needed to finance that spending is a dangerous one and invites abuse. Any such policy entails a major shift in power away from the legislative branch to the executive branch, because it gives the latter additional means of finance that bypass constitutional constraints against government overspending. To elaborate, the Constitution says that fiscal policy, the power to tax and spend, is constrained by the need to obtain congressional approval. If there were no Fed, or if the Fed were genuinely independent, then Congress could deny appropriations for spending projects of which it does not approve. But if the executive branch has the power to print money, then it has a potential means to circumvent Congress. If Trump wants his wall and Congress denies the appropriations, he can then order the Treasury secretary to print the necessary money instead. From this perspective, MMT is something of a constitutional abomination.4



It is a fundamental principle of constitutional political economy that economic policymakers operate under rules that constrain the decisions they make, and that these rules should be designed in ways that prevent undesirable behavior on their part. Under this way of thinking, the rules operate as bulwarks that constrain policy makers in order to protect everyone else from the misuse of the powers entrusted to those policymakers.



For proponents of MMT and for many other advocates of big government, however, those rules serve no real purpose and merely constrain policymakers from achieving the lofty ends that they seek to pursue. Yet they fail to appreciate that lofty ends do not justify giving those in power unrestrained discretionary powers. As Adam Smith observed:



Should MMT be adopted, then the Fed would become subservient to the Department of the Treasury, but in a more nakedly obvious way than it was during the years before the 1951 Treasury‐​Fed Accord, and without operating under the constraints of the Bretton Woods watered‐​down gold standard. Personally, I would suggest that, if MMT were adopted, then the government should make the new monetary policy arrangements transparently obvious. The Fed’s independence, such as it was, would be history and there would be no point pretending otherwise. The government should nationalize the Fed and make it a division of the Treasury, whose responsibilities would then be to issue currency and manage the national debt. Nationalizing the Fed would highlight the underlying chartalism of MMT (i.e., the idea that money is a creature of the state),5 and would also simplify analysis going forward because it would cut out the need to consider Fed/​Treasury interactions that only mask the underlying reality. We could then talk openly about the _government printing money_. If the United States is going to embark on a monetary policy worthy of a banana republic, then it should look the part.



Suppose then that the government goes full throttle MMT à la Kelton. This spending must be financed, however, and the government would have to do so by some combination of levying taxes, borrowing, and printing money. In essence, she proposes high government spending and a big deficit financed by borrowing (“debt finance”) and printing money (“monetary finance”).



If such a policy were launched at a time when there is considerable unemployment, then one would suppose that unemployment would fall. But there must eventually come a time when the economy returns to more or less “full” employment, whether because of those policies or despite them being a separate question. What happens then? To examine this question, I built a model along “unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” (see Sargent and Wallace 1981) lines and got some interesting results.



Let’s consider the following three possible MMT policies: (1) the government pursues pure debt finance; (2) the government pursues pure monetary finance; and (3) the government pursues debt finance for as long as possible, up to the point where it is about to default, and then switches to monetary finance.



Let _d_ be the long‐​term growth rate of the deficit and _g_ the long‐​term rate of economic growth. It is reasonable to suppose that MMTers would want _d_ considerably in excess of _g_ , so let us assume that this is so. Under a policy of pure debt finance, the debt/​GDP ratio would grow relentlessly and must at some point reach a level at which the government defaults. Hence, debt finance makes government default inevitable if pursued for long enough—that is, pure debt finance is unsustainable.



Under a policy of pure monetary finance, _d_ becomes the key driver of the inflation rate. If _d_ is steady in the long‐​term, then the inflation rate will converge to a long‐​term steady state. But if _d_ itself grows, so the deficit grows at an _accelerating_ rate, then long‐​term inflation will also accelerate.



Under the third policy, the debt/​GDP ratio rackets up to the brink of default, then the government switches to monetary finance with similar long‐​term outcomes as pure monetary finance.



It is important to emphasize that under monetary finance there is no way in which the government can simultaneously pursue an inflation target. Instead, the inflation rate becomes a residual outcome from the government’s fiscal policy and the government loses all control over the inflation rate. To make matters worse, the inflation rate also becomes the macroeconomy’s main shock absorber, so any shocks that produce unexpected increases in the deficit will lead to unexpected increases in inflation, which makes inflation highly uncertain too. A policy of monetary finance is therefore dangerous, because it can easily lead to runaway inflation or even hyperinflation. Externally, these effects on prices and inflation will be reflected in a falling, volatile and uncertain exchange rate.



In sum, we have a variety of possible long‐​term consequences, ranging from merely bad (highish and uncertain inflation, loss of control over inflation, a volatile exchange rate) to positively catastrophic (huge levels of national debt, high future taxation, national default and all that might entail, runaway inflation, hyperinflation). I could go into a long discussion of why any other fiscal‐​monetary policy mix would produce better long‐​term outcomes. On the fiscal side: a balanced budget or lower deficit financing. On the monetary side: a monetarist rule, a nominal GDP target, a Taylor Rule, a gold standard, whatever.



Suffice to say that the poor performance of MMT is not a coincidence. On the fiscal side, it encourages a much more rapid run‐​up of the debt/​GDP ratio than any alternative, which has got to be the worst possible fiscal policy in the long term. On the monetary side, it throws away any attempt at controlling inflation or maintaining monetary stability by making monetary policy subservient to runaway government spending. MMT performs so badly _precisely because_ it represents the extremes of fiscal and monetary excess.



Indeed, MMT does not even work on its own terms. Kelton herself indicates that an MMT policy package is constrained by the requirement that inflation should not rise. Unfortunately, she hasn’t thought it through.



Current U.S. inflation is 2.3 percent. Is she suggesting that the government should pursue MMT subject to the constraint that the inflation rate should not rise above 2.3 percent? If so, she should advertise the fact to help dispel the concerns of those who might have gotten the impression that MMT is some sort of funny money scheme. If she did so, much of the knee‐​jerk opposition from sound‐​money people would dissipate. The problem, however, is that a commitment to maintaining inflation at no more than its current rate would severely constrain the ability of MMT to deliver on its promises.



A looser interpretation of her “inflation shouldn’t rise” constraint would apply to inflation in the long run. But then consider my unpleasant monetarist arithmetic results. Since pure debt finance is fiscally unsustainable, any MMT package must involve some element of monetary finance. But, _ex hypothesi_ , the monetary finance must be constrained by the need to avoid rising inflation in the long run. A necessary condition to prevent rising inflation is that the rate of growth of the deficit should not itself increase. This constraint is not as severe as requiring that current inflation should never rise, but it is a severe constraint nonetheless. The problem is that it is not at all clear how much of what she promises can be delivered while satisfying this constraint. That she does not address this issue is the central failing of her book.



In effect, she offers us the prospect of a bunch of goodies but doesn’t explain why those goodies fall within the economy’s production possibility frontier, that is, are actually attainable—an intriguing oversight for an economist.6



She offers a revealing anecdote when she recalls a discussion between James Tobin and President Kennedy:



“Everything else is just talk” captures it perfectly. Indeed, it undermines the entire book.



We shouldn’t forget what subsequently happened. Government spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society overdid it, and the United States ended up with rising inflation and the monetary troubles of the 70s and early 80s. MMT’s fiscal proposals are akin to the Great Society and its monetary proposals are akin to relying on the pre‐​NAIRU, or fixed, Philips Curve that was discredited by Milton Friedman. From this perspective, MMT has a distinct sixties feel to it.



In both cases, the root problem is the same: the absence of a coherent theory of inflation. The Keynesians of the sixties didn’t have one and neither does Kelton. Now, as then, the solution to that problem is the same: their macro model needs some version of the quantity theory of money to connect the money supply to the price level, and thence to the inflation rate. If the central bank or the government pursue policies that lead to too much monetary growth, then the result will be a higher than desired inflation rate. The solution to that problem is also the same as it was then: to rein in the rate of monetary growth. In short, MMT is not particularly modern and the monetary theory has too much money and not enough theory.



Kelton might object that these negative outcomes would not occur under MMT because counter measures would be taken once (or even before) inflation started to rise. So, what counter measures would she pull from her MMT toolbox? The answer is a rise in taxes.7



One can imagine the howls that would follow a proposal to raise taxes “merely” because inflation had gone over some “arbitrary” threshold. Why abandon The Project? Why stop policies that were on the verge of making the world a better place just as the going gets tough? MMTers attempting to stick to the “if inflation rises” script on which The Project was predicated would be cast into the role of fiscal conservatives. Don’t they know that deficits don’t matter, etc.? They then reap the downside of overpromising.



If and when taxes were increased, it is doubtful that doing so would get inflation back down again. We know from monetarism that the inflation rate will only come down once the underlying monetary growth rate has slowed. But since the MMTers lack a decent model of inflation the likely policy responses would be some muddle akin to what we experienced in the late 1960s and much of the 70s, and with similar results: rising inflation followed by stagflation, a new Keynesians vs. monetarists controversy, and inflation only being brought under control again when policymakers relearn the lessons learned then—namely, the importance of the quantity theory of money.



The poor long‐​term performance of MMT under my simulations is a perfect illustration of why policymakers need to be constrained by rules. To illustrate the benefits of such rules, consider the following. Recall that we can think of MMT as a set of policies that break down into two subsets:



(1)MMT = {MMT spending program; MMT financing program}.



The former is about what goes out of the government’s coffers and the latter is about what goes in.



It seems to me that for most people inclined toward MMT, the big attraction is the MMT spending program. For the sake of argument, let’s hypothetically agree with that spending program and then ask if we can replace the MMT financing program with something better.



The MMT financing program consists of a combination of high deficits, tax, borrowing, and monetary finance. This financing program is a key reason why MMT performs so badly, so let’s replace it with an alternative financing program that is a combination of, let’s say, more restrained deficits, tax and borrowing, and no monetary finance. The monetary side of this program would be taken care of by some monetary policy or rule that focuses on a stable inflation rate or something similar. We then come to:



(2)Alternative to MMT = {MMT spending program; alternative financing program}.



My models indicate that this “Alternative to MMT” would produce considerably better outcomes, including a less rapid run‐​up of national debt and lower inflation.



Why then would you not prefer the “alternative” to MMT? The “alternative” still delivers the spending goodies you want, but in a less damaging way in the long‐​term. But the “alternative” is old‐​fashioned tax and spend!



My point is that even if you support MMT because of its spending program, there is no good reason to support MMT in preference to some tax and spend policy mix with the same spending program. Whatever your preferred government spending program, MMT is a poor way to finance it.



So, if you are a hard‐​left socialist who supports the Kelton government spending platform, you should support tax and spend, not MMT. And if you do not support her spending platform, say because you are not politically hard left or because you support sound money, then you would also not support MMT. Whatever your politics, MMT is not for you; MMT is just bad economics.



In the end, MMT comes down to this: the government spends a lot, issues a lot of debt, and prints a lot of money. It is not as if it hasn’t been tried before.

1 “There’s no reason every job—all the way down to retail clerk or fast food worker or janitor in a luxury Chicago hotel—can’t be a good job, with dignified pay, hours, security, and benefits,” she says. The question however is how many of these jobs would still exist.



2 I implicitly assume, as seems reasonable in this (MMT) context, that the rate of growth of the national debt, including entitlement commitments (see below), exceeds the economic growth rate. In that case, the ratio of debt (including entitlements) to GDP will keep growing, and default is then inevitable unless the government resorts to (a) taxation or (b) printing money.



3 This figure comes from Laurence Kotlikoff’s testimony to Congress in 2014 (see Haskins 2015).



4 Few presidents would have the self‐​restraint to refrain from taking advantage of such powers, but the point is that if the Constitution were properly followed, we wouldn’t have to rely on his or her self‐​restraint in the first place.



5 One might even go as far as to say that MMT is the apotheosis of chartalism and I do not mean that as a compliment. Chartalism maintains that the state is entitled to monopoly privileges regarding the issue of currency. In response: a government monopoly is always a bad idea, period.



6 As she says, “The real challenge lies in managing your available resources—labor, equipment, technology, natural resources, and so on—so that inflation does not accelerate.” This passage describes the problem nicely but does not give the solution to it.



7 Wrong again. The only way to reduce inflation is to rein in the excessive monetary growth that is the proximate cause of rising inflation. So, Kelton’s statement that “MMT … offers a more sophisticated array of techniques for managing inflationary pressures than what we have today,” does not instill much confidence.",2020-12-19T16:35:57.596519Z,1
,2020-12-19T17:00:03.674528Z,562,119,,"Over the last few years Arctic scientists have reported a surprising finding: large areas of the Arctic are turning brown. This is in part due to extreme events linked to winter weather, such as sudden, short-lived periods of extreme warmth. These events are occurring as the climate warms, which is happening twice as fast in the Arctic compared with the rest of the planet. Extreme events are therefore happening more and more often, with increasingly severe effects – including widespread damage and death in Arctic plants. This “browning” of plant communities has happened over thousands of square kilometres or more. However, until recently we knew very little about what this might mean for the balance between carbon uptake and release in Arctic ecosystems. Given that the Arctic stores twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, this is a pressing concern. Now, our study has shown that extreme climatic events can significantly reduce the ability of Arctic ecosystems to take up carbon –- with implications for whether the Arctic will help combat climate change, or accelerate it. To understand how extreme events are affecting Arctic heathlands, we travelled to the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway where coastal, sub-Arctic plant communities act as a bellwether for future climate change in the far north by exhibiting the effects of warming in the region first. Here we found the effects of two extreme winter weather events. First, “frost drought” had caused extensive plant dieback. Frost drought occurs when the insulating layer of snow which usually protects plants from the harsh Arctic winter is melted, typically by unusually high winter temperatures. If plants remain exposed to cold, windy conditions for long enough, they continually lose water and are unable to replace it from the frozen soil. Eventually, they succumb to drought. The second event was “extreme winter warming” – a sudden burst of high temperatures during winter which melts the snow and tricks evergreen plants into preparing for spring by shedding their cold tolerance. When the warm period is over, the return of cold temperatures usually kills the plant. In this case, however, we found something unexpected. Heathland plants had survived this extreme winter warming event, but were showing evidence of severe stress, visible as a deep, persistent dark red colour in shoots and leaves. We measured how much carbon dioxide was being taken in and released by the plants in three vegetation types: damaged heathland (where the dominant evergreen species had been killed by frost drought), stressed heathland, and healthy, green heathland which had escaped the effects of either extreme event. This was done in three measurement periods across the growing season. We found that these extreme winter conditions reduced how much carbon was absorbed in heathland ecosystems by up to 50% across the entire growing season. This is a huge reduction in the ability of a widespread Arctic ecosystem to remove carbon from the atmosphere.  Surprisingly, this was the case both in damaged heathland, where a large part of the vegetation had been killed, and in stressed heathland. Although the processes driving this change were different in each type of heathland, this clearly shows that we need to consider the role of plant stress in limiting plant carbon uptake to fully appreciate the consequences of extreme climatic events. What does this mean for the Arctic? We now know that extreme climatic events could significantly reduce the ability of Arctic ecosystems to take up carbon and combat climate change. This is especially concerning as the impacts of browning are in stark contrast to those of a better understood response of Arctic ecosystems to climate change: “Arctic greening”, or the tendency for plants to become taller and more productive as Arctic summers warm. Many climate models currently assume arbitrary levels of greening across the Arctic,  and therefore that Arctic ecosystems will take up more carbon in the future – slowing climate change. The scale of the browning we’ve seen in recent years combined with the negative impacts on carbon uptake reported here suggests that the reality may be more complex, calling into question our understanding of the role of the Arctic in the Earth’s climate. What does this mean for us? The impact of extreme weather events in the Arctic has global consequences. It is clear that our current efforts to tackle climate change are dangerously inadequate, but ambitious action now could cut how much the Arctic is expected to warm by as much as 7°C. This is critical to minimising the impacts of climate change both in Arctic ecosystems and worldwide.",2020-12-19T17:00:03.674567Z,1
,2020-12-19T12:56:00.126343Z,564,120,,"Scott Brown’s stunning upset in the Massachusetts special election may have done what the best policy arguments could not – defeat the Democrats’ plans for a massive government takeover of the U.S. health care system.



Democrats will undoubtedly offer a variety of excuses for Brown’s win. The Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, was a poor candidate. The “political climate” was bad. The dog ate their ballots. But in reality, there can be no denying that this election was a clear cut rejection of the Democratic health care bills.



There were no blurred differences on this issue. Scott Brown made his opposition to the bill a centerpiece of his campaign. He promised to be the 41st vote to sustain a filibuster and kill the bill, even signing autographs as “Scott41.” Coakley, on the other hand, pledged to vote for the bill.





[T]here can be no denying that this election was a clear cut rejection of the Democratic health care bills.



The issue was featured in ads, debates, and public discussions. In the end, according to polls, in the home of Ted Kennedy, more than half of voters opposed the version of health care reform being rushed through Congress. Voters knew what they were saying. And what they were saying was a resounding “No!”



What do Democrats do now? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that they will pass health care reform “one way or another.” Those “ways” are:



 **Hurry up and stall:** New York Democratic congressman Anthony Wiener both named and defined this strategy. Democrats would slow‐​walk certification of Brown’s victory, preventing him from taking his seat in the Senate. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin has hinted that he won’t certify election results for at least the 10 days that local officials have to report on absentee and overseas ballots and has noted that state election law gives him as long as 50 days beyond that. Meanwhile, Pelosi and Harry Reid will rush their negotiations to merge the House and Senate bills, allowing the appointed interim Massachusetts Senator Paul Kirk to vote on the bill before Brown takes his seat.



Democrats legitimately fear that such a blatant disregard for the democratic process would spark an enormous backlash. There would be no way to pretend it was anything other than the most corrupt power politics. After previous special elections the winners have been seated within days. In fact, when Kennedy first won the seat in a 1962 special election, he was sworn in the very next day. Would Democratic moderates, already frightened by the election outcome, be willing to go along with such an approach?



 **The House Surrenders:** Democrats could try to avoid a Senate vote altogether by having the House simply pass the already Senate approved measure. But that would require the House to accept the Senate bill with no changes at all. Pro‐​life Democrats like Bart Stupak (D‐​Mich.) would have to accept much weaker Senate restrictions on government funding of abortions. Liberals would have to accept the so‐​called “Cadillac tax” on high value insurance plans — without the exemption demanded by labor unions. And what about nervous moderate and blue dog Democrats? Are the Massachusetts results going to make them more or less likely to go out on a limb for health care reform? Remember, the House only passed their bill by a three vote margin, and one of those, Rep. Robert Wexler (D‐​Fl.) has since resigned his seat.



 **Let It Snowe:** Democrats could try to reach a compromise with Republican moderates like Olympia Snowe of Maine. Snowe did vote for a version of health reform in the Finance Committee and has spoken positively of the need for reform. But she also voted in favor of a resolution declaring that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and has raised a number of other objections. Any bill she agreed to would have to be substantially different than the ones currently being considered. That would almost certainly jeopardize already tenuous support from liberals. If the current Senate version is hard for them to swallow, just imagine how they will react to one watered down even further.



 **Go for 51:** The last, desperate gasp would be to use an arcane procedure known as reconciliation to pass health care reform with just 51 votes. But doing so would require Senate Democrats to overcome all manner of procedural hurdles. Reconciliation cannot be used for policy as opposed to budgetary issues. That means Democrats would have to drop some of their more popular proposals like the ban on preexisting conditions. They would be left with a bill that did little more than expand Medicaid and other subsidies, raise taxes, and cut Medicare. How popular would that be?



So far Democrats have been willing to do almost anything, cut any deal, sacrifice any principle, to force this bill through. But they may be running out of options at last. And for that, we can thank Scott Brown and the voters of Massachusetts.",2020-12-19T12:56:00.126377Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:36:36.613006Z,565,120,,"Electricity generated by fossil fuels is increasingly unsustainable and a shift towards renewable energy – principally from the sun and wind – is vital. Renewable generation is already less expensive per unit than its polluting counterparts, but the fact the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow presents an obstacle to a serious takeover of the energy sector. Energy storage could overcome this pressing “intermittancy” issue. If storage was available at sufficiently low cost and high performance, renewable energy would rapidly displace all other generation forms. Energy is already stored, of course, in batteries or various other technologies. Even reservoirs can act as huge stores of energy. However nothing that exists or is in development can store energy as well, and as cheaply, as compressed air. The concept seems simple: you just suck in some air from the atmosphere, compress it using electrically-driven compressors and store the energy in the form of pressurised air. When you need that energy you just let the air out and pass it through a machine that takes the energy from the air and turns an electrical generator. Compressed air energy storage (or CAES), to give it its full name, can involve storing air in steel tanks or in much less expensive containments deep underwater. In some cases, high pressure air can be stored in caverns deep underground, either excavated directly out of hard rock or formed in large salt deposits by so-called “solution mining”, where water is pumped in and salty water comes out. Such salt caverns are often used to store natural gas. Compressed air could easily deliver the required scale of storage, but it remains grossly undervalued by policymakers, funding bodies and the energy industry itself. This has stunted the development of the technology and means it is likely that much more expensive and less effective solutions will instead be adopted. At present, three key problems stand in the way of compressed air: The above description of how it works is an over-simplification. CAES is, in fact, not a single technology but a wide family that includes compression machinery, expansion machinery, heat exchangers, the design of air stores and the design of thermal stores. These all require meticulous engineering to get right.  At the moment, wind and solar still make up only a small proportion of the overall sector. As electricity generated from fossil fuels can cover the overcast or wind-free days, renewable energy is often used straight away and only needs to be stored for short amounts of time. For these situations, batteries work quite well and can be economically viable.  Large-scale decarbonisation will require us to store energy for much longer periods, however, for instance from a sunny day to use on a cloudy day. CAES is especially suited for storage durations of some hours through to several days.  All affordable energy storage involves converting energy from the form of electricity to some other form and storing it in that other form. For pumped-hydro storage, for instance, the other form is water that has been lifted up to a great height. For CAES, that other form includes both heat and high-pressure air. For such systems, there are separate costs for the equipment that does the conversion and for the storage itself. Systems like CAES and pumped-hydro involve relatively expensive equipment for the power conversion but very inexpensive provisions for the storage of energy. These systems, where small amounts of power can fill up very large amounts of storage, are therefore very economical for storing energy over a long period. Private investment requires high rates of return. An indirect effect of this is that investors place less value on what utility may be left in an asset in the longer term.  In most CAES systems, costs are concentrated in things that naturally have very long lifetimes. For example, a solution-mined cavern in a salt deposit might reasonably be expected to operate for at least 100 years, while high power machines for compressing and expanding air can typically operate for 50 years or more. With returns over such a long timescale, there is a strong argument that at least some large-scale compressed air installations should be treated as national infrastructure projects financed by governments. Two large compressed air plants were built decades ago, one in Huntorf, Germany and the other in McIntosh, Alabama. Both are still working extremely well. Many refer to these two plants to draw conclusions about how efficient CAES can be and how much or little it can cost.  But this is misleading and pointless. Both plants were designed with very different priorities from those relevant today. It is imperative that we now think again about compressed air energy storage and evaluate it properly in light of what can be achieved by exploiting modern methods and knowledge.",2020-12-19T16:36:36.613038Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:03:49.813530Z,566,119,,"In a bid to reduce our carbon footprint, confront greenwashing and increase our focus on the climate crisis, the Guardian this week announced it will no longer run ads from fossil fuel extractors alongside any of its content in print or online. The move will come into immediate effect, and follows the announcement in October last year that we intend to reduce our net emissions to zero by 2030. Once upon a time, a newspaper was a rather straightforward business. You generated enough material of interest to attract a significant number of readers. You then ‘sold’ those readers to advertisers happy to pay to get their ideas, products or brands in front of consumers with cash to spend.  Of course, digital disruption over the past 20 years has upended that model, but advertising remains an important part of the media business ecosystem. At the Guardian, it is still responsible for about two-fifths of our income. But what happens when the readers don’t like the adverts? What do you do when the message that advertisers want to spread jars awkwardly with the work your journalists are doing? What if your journalists are some of the best in the world at revealing and investigating the deepening climate catastrophe and the disaster that is fossil fuel growth, while some of your advertisers are the very people digging the stuff out of the ground? This contradiction has bothered us - and some of you - for some time. We came up with a rather bold answer this week: turn away the money and double down on the journalism. “It’s something we thought about for a long time,” says Anna Bateson, the interim chief executive officer of Guardian Media Group, the Guardian’s parent company. “We always felt it was in line with our editorial values but were cautious for commercial reasons.” She said it was the logical next step after the Guardian committed last year to becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and was certified as a B Corp – a company that puts purpose before profit. But she added that the move had to be weighed carefully, given the fact that the Guardian only recently returned to breakeven after years in the red. “You have to be careful you are not making cavalier decisions,” she said. “ We are still having to fight for our financial future. But because of the support we get from our readers, it is less of a risk.” On the advertising side of our business, Adam Foley said there were no complaints at all that potential customers were suddenly off-limits, adding that staff felt that “being part of a company that shares their values” was the biggest motivation for his teams. “A statement like this reaffirms to all of us that we’re contributing to a business that really lives those values - to the extent where it is prepared to sacrifice profit for purpose.” The response from the wider world has been a pleasant surprise. Hundreds of you have written in, pledging your support, and in some cases, one-off contributions to start making up the shortfall.  The environmental movement was instantly appreciative, with activists quickly urging our peers to follow suit. “The Guardian will no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies,” Greta Thunberg tweeted. “A good start, who will take this further?” Greenpeace called it “a huge moment in the battle against oil and gas for all of us.” Some readers have been calling for the Guardian to go the whole hog and forsake advertising from any company with a substantial carbon footprint. Bateson said that was not realistic, adding that such a move would result in less money for journalism. She said the fossil fuel extractors were specifically targeted because of their efforts to skew the climate change debate through their lobbying effort.“We are committed to advertising,” she said. “It will continue to be part of our future. We want advertisers who want to be appear alongside our high quality journalism.” And how will we know if this has worked?“We will listen to our readers, we will listen to our advertisers. The response so far has been gratifying. If we continue to hear positive noises from our readers and supporters, then it will have been a success.” Responses from our supporters That is such a brilliant decision and it will be tough, but it is the correct one and I am very proud of The Guardian. Barbara Syer Following the Guardian’s decision to ban ads from fossil fuel companies I’m making a monthly contribution to support its fearless journalism: reader support is essential for independent scrutiny of the powerful in business, finance and politics. Titus Alexander, Hertfordshire, England I live at present in Canada, home to the Alberta Tar Sands: another name for ecological devastation resulting from fossil fuel extraction. I fully support The Guardian’s action in ceasing to be a vehicle for advertising by fossil fuel extractive companies, and I’m proud to be a supporter. My monthly donation is small, but when I can I will make it much greater. Rosemary Delnavine, Canada Congratulations. At this time it may be a bold step, indeed, within this industry, but true leaders have to take bold steps for the betterment of the quality of life, and more importantly for the life of future generations. I applaud this decision, and will spread the word. Raphael Sulkovitz, Boston MA What a bravery! This is what the life on earth needs, thank you. Karri Kuikka, Finland  Keep it up. Here in Canada, we’re still trying to have it both ways -- sell the product internationally but discourage buying domestically. As I recall, it was the same with tobacco. Eventually, it took a change in public opinion to solve the problem. As a news source, your efforts are part of this solution. Robert Shotton, Ottawa I applaud your decision to”walk the talk.” I will therefore continue to contribute to The Guardian. Bob Wagenseil Bravo yr decision to eschew $ from the FFI. Please do continue to hold to the fire(s) the feet of the deniers and the willfully ignorant. Sydney Alonso, Vermont, US I am very happy to hear that good news. It’s quite courageous on your part, and I’m happy to support you! Have a great year ahead, you’ll have my continuous support! Julien Psomas I completely support your plan to refuse ads from fossils, despite the  financial hit to the Guardian. I have made a donation to help out. David Thompson A very commendable decision, very much in keeping with the Guardian’s position as leader of green issues to leave a better planet for following generations. Richard Vernon, Oxford Yay! I’m so proud of the Guardian! We can no longer support or fund in any manner the fossil fuel industry if we have any chance of survival as a civilization on this planet. You’ve taken a courageous and moral step that will hopefully embolden others to join you. Good on you! Best, Carol Ross, Missouri, US Good decision. I’ll support you as much as I can, which unfortunately is not much as I live on age pension only. Keep up the good work, we need it desperately! Ursula Brandt, South Australia I am absolutely delighted by this decision. So many people pledge to do something about Climate Change, but few actually are willing to get uncomfortable and DO it. I am very proud of you as my favourite source of Information and this only makes a case for me to donate next time to you again. Christiane Gross It was great reading what The Guardian is doing re the climate. As a Guardian on-line reader from The Netherlands I’m going to contribute monthly now instead of ‘now and again’. The amount will be relatively small as I do not have a great income. I really hope more of your supporters will do so, because it is really great what you are doing.  With kind regards, Aleida Oostendorp, Netherlands I congratulate you and your team on taking this step regarding fossil fuel companies. The Guardian’s stance on the environment and its excellent coverage of related stories and events is the major reason for my support. Well done, and good luck in the future. Deirdre Moore Love your new policy about accepting money from fossil fuels. Will contribute more to help make up for the shortfall. Todd Misk I live on a fixed income with a strict budget so my continuing support of your excellent news organisation represents my commitment to the fight to address climate change. Every step counts. Barbara Hirsch, Texas, US Only when we speak truth to power can change take place. thank yo for your courageous and expensive decision. Nancy Shepherd, Vermont, US Love your journalism, especially your investigative work and the climate change topic. And with the bold statement about not receiving any more sponsorship from the fossil extracting companies? Well, the already great newspapers became even more impressive now. Keep up the good work. Miroslav Řezníček, Czech RepublicThank you for taking the bold step of refusing advertising from fossil fuel extractive companies. I think it is the right thing to do & hope many more companies do the same. We must all work together if we want to save our planet. It is one of the most important issues of our times.

The Stevenson Screen is sinking into the swamp and the MMTS sensor is kept at a comfortable temperature thanks to the nearby A/C units.

The complete set of pictures is here
From NASA’s GISS, the plot makes it pretty easy to see there was no discernible multi-decadal temperature trend until the A/C units were installed. And it’s not hard to figure out when that was.

But hey, thy can “fix” the problem with math and adjustments to the temperature record.

,2020-12-19T12:57:00.338437Z,570,122,,"The Bush Administration caught unshirted hell from environmentalists last month for ordering a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency standards for air conditioners sold after 2006. The Clinton administration, you see, had proposed a 30 percent increase in standards, so the Bush administration is once again being hammered for relaxing environmental standards, promoting wasteful energy consumption, accelerating global climate change, and risking California‐​style blackouts during hot summer months for years to come.



While the Greens would have us believe that Bush was once again carrying water for corporate America, the president was actually doing us all a small favor. 



First, the Clinton standards would have imposed huge costs on consumers. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the Clinton standards would have increased the price of your typical air conditioner by a whopping $332 to $435. The Bush administration standards would increase prices by only (!) $144 to $213. 



Second, the DOE had failed to adequately consider the possibility that some manufacturers would be driven out of business by the Clinton standards, thus reducing competition that helps restrain prices. So even those expected astronomical price increases were almost certainly low‐​ball estimates. 



Third, the DOE concluded that over 40 percent of consumers buying air conditioners that meet Clinton’s standards would never recover the higher costs through energy cost savings. Under the Bush administration standards, only about 25 percent of consumers would be net losers. 



The Greens are right, however, to point out that the Bush standards will accomplish little on the environmental front, but the Clinton standards would not have achieved much either. Consider: The DOE estimates that the Bush standards will reduce growth in energy consumption by “about 3 quads” between 2006–2030, a figure deemed by the department as “significant.” The nation, however, is expected to use about 3,200 quads of energy from 2006–2030, so “3 quads” equals but 9/100 of 1 percent of projected energy use. The DOE’s claims about avoided emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides are equally overblown.



While we should be grateful that the Bush administration has adopted efficiency standards that are somewhat less costly than those planned by the Clinton administration, the unwarranted economic burden and restrictions on consumer choice remain too great. Consumers, not bureaucrats, should have the final say about what’s in the home.



The chance of recovering the higher cost of air conditioners through reduced energy consumption, after all, depends heavily on electricity prices and the frequency with which the air conditioner is used. Given that electricity prices vary widely throughout the United States (highest unit prices are more than double the lowest), and that consumers’ usage patterns vary for dozens of reasons (e.g., geographic location, family size, tolerance for warm temperatures), paying more up‐​front at the cash register to reduce operating costs by a small amount for years to come makes sense for some but not for others. 



While that observation should be rather obvious, it is — for practical purposes — ignored by appliance efficiency standards that apply to everyone whether it makes sense or not. The result is that many consumers are forced to incur higher costs than they would if allowed to base their decision on factors affecting their energy bills. The requirement is roughly equivalent to an attempt to restrain hat costs by requiring that everyone wear a size seven hat. 



Moreover, the entire regulatory exercise is fraught with uncertainty. The government, for instance, assumes that it can accurately forecast the conditions affecting future appliance manufacture, sales, and use during the next 30 years, including changes in technology, markets, energy prices, consumer and appliance manufacturer behavior, raw material, labor and overhead costs, and wholesale and retail markups. How likely is that, particularly when much of the data comes from appliance manufacturers with a direct financial interest in the DOE’s decisions? 



The upshot is that all analytic uncertainties in the exercise are resolved in favor of tighter standards because only the well organized — typically those positioned to gain the most from government action — can affect the rulemaking process. Big appliance manufacturers, for instance, are happy to have the government impose regulatory barriers to entry into their market, barriers that serve to cartelize the industry. Bureaucrats are always on the lookout to expand their power and reach. Green political lobbies consider energy conservation a religious virtue regardless of economic realities and are in the business of delivering such mandates in return for contributions from the faithful. 



Everyone wins but the poor consumer who is for the most part oblivious to these regulatory machinations undertaken at his expense. The administration did us a favor by minimizing the hunk of flesh taken out of our economic hides. But it would be better to junk these standards and make the consumer, once again, king of his own pocketbook.",2020-12-19T12:57:00.338471Z,1

There have been some claims on the blogosphere of limited or no value to the taking of pictures for the www.surfacestations.org project. This is my view of why pictures are vitally important to an assessment of the accuracy of the near surface temperature record gathered by USHCN and other weather stations, where the data gathered is used in climate studies.
Photography is well established as a diagnostic tool in many fields. Take astronomy for example. If data and computer models of the universe is all that was needed to move the science forward, we certainly wouldn’t need the Hubble Space Telescope.
Do pictures work very well in illustrating problems that need correction?  Well I say ask any doctor who uses xrays, or MRI images, or ultrasound. Do you think doctors can define an illness solely on chart data such as BP and body temperature? No of course not, they need pictures. They DEMAND pictures.
Or how about the NASA’s loss of the space shuttle Columbia in 2004? The spacecraft is covered in sensors, yet after a photo showed foam striking the shuttle during booster burn, engineers pleaded to get photos under the wing from Department of Defense DOD. NASA Engineering made three separate requests for DOD imaging of the shuttle in orbit to get photos to determine if there was damage. NASA management did not honor the requests for DOD photos and in some cases intervened to stop the DOD from assisting.
On reentry, sensors on the shuttle started showing problems, and flight controllers struggled to understand what was happening. Photos and video taken by amateurs on the ground showed clearly what had happened. I don’t recall CNN showing pictures of sensor data in announcing this failure to the world.
Given NASA’s unwillingness to listen to engineers first with Challenger (frost and o-rings) and Columbia (possible wing damage – just get us a picture so we can be sure) I have even less respect for the NASA armchair UHI analysis called “lights = x” ironically done by counting the number of streetlights near weather stations using DOD nighttime photos. This method can give an approximation of the urbanization around a weather station, but it can’t possibly discern the nearby microsite effects like asphalt and air conditioners that have seen so far.
The worlds of science, engineering, medicine, forensics, astronomy, biology, and many more use photos to cross check gathered data or to confirm observations or theory. Climatology shall be no exception.
We are getting pictures of stations, lots of them, and we’ll get every one if possible. Then we are going to analyse them against existing published standards, and then we will publish the results of that analysis. And unlike some prominent climatologists, the pictures, the methods, the code, and the results will be publicly available to anybody, be it scientist, layman, or citizen. And, it will be done without wasting once cent of taxpayer money.
Then after that, critics can determine just how useful the pictures are.

,2020-12-19T17:05:16.070664Z,573,119,,"Claire O’Neill, the former UK energy minister who was to lead the UN climate talks this year in Glasgow, has been removed from the post. Her sacking comes as Boris Johnson prepares to launch the UK’s strategy for hosting November’s crunch climate talks, known as COP26.  O’Neill, under her Twitter handle of @COP26President, wrote on Friday evening: “Very sad that the role I was offered by Boris Johnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall ‘can’t cope’ with an indy COP unit. A shame we haven’t had one climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the COP team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.” The dramatic last-minute change of plan follows murmurings over the past month that O’Neill, known under her previous married name of Perry when she was a minister, lacked the gravitas for one of the most important jobs in international politics this year. A source in the COP26 unit said: “Claire has seriously underperformed, including at Davos and on a recent ministerial visit to India. She had said ‘the Paris agreement is dead’ in key meetings to the surprise of everyone. “She didn’t seem to get that this is a diplomatic job. The senior team of officials in the unit couldn’t work with her and her erratic behaviour and poor performance has spooked key stakeholders in the UK and internationally. She had to go. The PM now needs to show he is taking this seriously by appointing a heavy-hitting minister.” Governments must come to COP26 prepared to scale up their commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, or risk the failure of the 2015 Paris agreement on the climate. Achieving the consensus needed among world governments will be a mammoth task – many countries, including the US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are now hostile to the Paris agreement, and others including China and India have been unwilling to make big new public commitments under the accord. O’Neill’s previous experience peaked at junior minister, which was regarded by some diplomats as not enough to gain her the respect needed to get meetings with premiers and top officials around the world. Observers of the UN talks interpreted her removal as a sign that Johnson was taking COP26 more seriously. He will make his first public intervention on the issue next Tuesday, when he will launch the UK’s COP26 strategy, at an event with Sir David Attenborough, the climate expert Lord Stern, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the UN’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, and a host of dignitaries. “A good COP president makes all the difference between success and failure,” said one former high-level diplomat and COP veteran. “They direct the negotiations, they play the key role in determining the outcome.” Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G, said he thought that either William Hague or Michael Howard, both former Conservative party leaders, could be possible choices to replace O’Neill. “If this is a sign that the government really wants to signal its intent to make a success of COP26, it has to appoint some more senior people, and those two candidates come to mind,” he said. The Cabinet Office, which has been leading on the COP26 talks, declined to say whether a successor had been chosen. There have been rumours among climate activists that Zac Goldsmith could take on the role, and O’Neill’s tweet appeared to suggest that responsibility for COP26 could be taken away from the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office put out a statement: “Claire Perry O’Neill will no longer be UK COP26 president. The prime minister is grateful to Claire for her work preparing for what will be a very successful and ambitious climate change summit in Glasgow in November. Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly. Going forward, this will be a ministerial role.” That could leave the way open for a House of Lords appointee. Responsibility for the UK’s participation in the annual talks was previously held by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, after the closure of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Another COP expert said whoever took on the job must have the clear and public backing of the prime minister, and that Johnson must take a much stronger public role on the issue. In her parliamentary career, O’Neill was best known for having to apologise when, unable to catch the Speaker’s eye, she wondered aloud in the House of Commons to whom she needed to “give a blowjob” in order to get her say. She also issued a putdown to David Davis when he confused her with another female Tory minister, Caroline Nokes. Referring to Davis’s previous campaigning slogan, she is reported to have told him: “David, let me help you: Caroline is a C cup, I am a double D.” Her exuberant manner also led to trouble. In November 2018, three unions wrote to BEIS, where she was a minister, to raise allegations of shouting and bullying civil servants. O’Neill started out as a political radical. The environmentalist George Monbiot recalls her at Brasenose College, Oxford, where she studied geography, as “a leftwing firebrand who wanted to overthrow capitalism and nationalise the banks. She was impressive and persuasive, and had some influence on my thinking. You can imagine my disappointment when she took a City job and became a Tory.” She entered parliament with the coalition government in 2010, her no-nonsense approach belying the patronising “Cameron cutie” label. O’Neill announced her decision to resign as an MP last September, citing the pressures of the COP26 presidency, and she stood down in December’s election. That left her free to jet to foreign capitals, but outside cabinet discussions. Johnson’s government is vulnerable to charges that ministers are not prepared to make the hard decisions required against vested interests in fossil fuels and finance. There was a major hiccup at the Africa summit last week when, as Johnson pledged not to invest in coal in Africa, the Guardian drew attention to the almost £2bn finance from the UK pouring into African oil and gas.",2020-12-19T17:05:16.070697Z,1

,2020-12-19T12:57:37.302816Z,576,118,,"Share this...FacebookTwitterSeveral new studies use evidence from temperature-sensitive plant species and megafauna remains to reconstruct an Arctic climate that was 6°C to 22°C warmer than today when CO2 concentrations lingered near 300 ppm.
Navigating the Arctic Ocean
William Barentsz discovered Arctic Svalbard as he sailed through an open-water Arctic Ocean using a wooden boat in early June, 1596.

Image Source: Wikipedia
In September, 2019 (the month of the year with least extensive sea ice), 16 scientists needed to be rescued by helicopters because the massive ship they were using to study climate change couldn’t cut through the ice-covered waters near Svalbard.
In the 1500s, the Western Arctic was sea ice free for about 4-5 months of the year. Today – and steadily since 1800 – the Western Arctic is sea ice free only about 2 weeks of the year (Porter et al., 2019).

Image Source: Porter et al., 2019
In fact, according to Rosel et al., 2018, Arctic sea ice was actually thicker in 2015 (1.56 m) and 2017 (1.65 m) than it was in 1955 (0.94 m).

Image Source: Rosel et al., 2018
The paleoclimate Arctic record
1. Voldstad et al., 2020  A much broader distribution of thermophilous (warmth-dependent) plant species suggest the sea surface temperatures near Svalbard were as much as 6°C warmer than they are today earlier in the Holocene, which effectively means the Arctic was sea ice free throughout the year.

2. Kirillova et al., 2020  About 115-100,000 years ago, “semi-dwarf” wooly mammoths thrived in an Arctic Siberia teeming with lakes, rivers, aquatic plants, grassy meadows, and forests. July temperatures were 8-10°C warmer than today’s. CO2 levels ranged between 260-280 ppm.

Image Source: Kirillova et al., 2020
3. Schenk et al., 2020  Plant species’ thermal tolerance limits (Finland) suggest July temperatures had already reached “near-modern” (~16°C vs. 17°C) levels 15,000 to 11,000 years ago, or during the last late glacial, when CO2 hovered near ~220 ppm CO2. By about 10,000 to 9,000 years ago, Greenland was “4-7°C warmer than today”.

Image Source: Schenk et al., 2020
4. Fedorov et al., 2020  The Eurasian Arctic was up to 8°C warmer than today during the last interglacial (130,000 to 110,000 years ago). Extensive forests lined the Arctic Ocean coast from 10,000 to 3,000 years ago, when the region was also much warmer than today. Today’s Eurasian Arctic coast is treeless tundra. The cold-preferring collared lemming has 25% more habitat now than it did earlier in the Holocene due to today’s tundra expansion and cooler climate.

Image Source: Fedorov et al., 2020
5. Rybczynski et al., 2013  Giant camels and horses were hedged by plants, forests, and wetlands in a balmy High Arctic until at least the late Pleistocene (~79k yrs ago). CO2 ranged from 190 to 280 ppm back then (Pleistocene) and averaged about 300 ppm during the Pliocene, but yet the Arctic climate was 18.3°C warmer than today.

Image Source: Rybczynski et al., 2013
6. Fletcher et al., 2019  From 2 to 4 million years ago, as CO2 pivoted around 300 ppm, the Arctic was 15-22°C warmer than it is today.

By Die kalte Sonne
(Text translated by P. Gosselin)

Red kites have little chance against wind turbines. Image: Thomas Kraft (ThKraft) – Own work, CC BY-SA 2.5
Red kites and wind power just do go well together. These predatory birds can find good prey especially where farmers mow meadows or plow fields. Lethal are cases such as the one in Baden-Württemberg, where areas with green fodder have been planted in the immediate vicinity of a wind park.
When these fields are mowed, the red kites search for food within the hay. It is ideal for them, but also possibly deadly because they cast their view downward when hunting, and not forward. The Hilpensberg wind farm was even approved in a red kite area. Now one of the beautiful animals has fallen victim again, as the Nature Conservation Initiative reports:
According to biologist Immo Vollmer, the conclusion can only be that we should not build any more wind turbines in areas where red kites nest or where buzzards often seek food. Otherwise the red kite, which has its largest distribution center in the world in Germany, will have no future here, because the loss rate is already almost in the same order of magnitude as the rate of offspring.”
And another sad case has just been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. A female, nesting red kite was shot dead near Paderborn.
In an earlier trial, a judge even gave the controversial wind projects approval – precisely where the shot bird was found – under the condition that no protected species be proven to exist there. Now that the animal has been executed, this condition has been met. Probably just a coincidence, or maybe suicide, to make the wind turbines possible and to get out of the way?

The Hilpensberg wind farm was even approved in a red kite area. Now one of the beautiful animals has fallen victim again, as the Nature Conservation Initiative reports:
According to biologist Immo Vollmer, the conclusion can only be that we should not build any more wind turbines in areas where red kites nest or where buzzards often seek food. Otherwise the red kite, which has its largest distribution center in the world in Germany, will have no future here, because the loss rate is already almost in the same order of magnitude as the rate of offspring.”
And another sad case has just been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. A female, nesting red kite was shot dead near Paderborn.
In an earlier trial, a judge even gave the controversial wind projects approval – precisely where the shot bird was found – under the condition that no protected species be proven to exist there. Now that the animal has been executed, this condition has been met. Probably just a coincidence, or maybe suicide, to make the wind turbines possible and to get out of the way?

This neglect of China needs to change. 



Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s recent trips to South Asia (to try to defuse Indo‐​Pakistani tensions in the aftermath of the Mumbai terrorism) and to the Middle East (to attempt to re‐​energise Israeli‐​Palestinian negotiations) have been highlighted in leading US newspapers. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s meetings in Beijing, as part of the ongoing Strategic Economic Dialogue, have, however, only been minor news as far as the US media is concerned. 



After president‐​elect Barack Obama recently unveiled his national security team, most of the discussion among Washington’s pundits centred on how the selection of Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and the retaining of Robert Gates as defence chief would affect US policies in the Middle East. China and East Asia were largely ignored. 



Earlier, in the foreign policy debates during the presidential election campaign, when China was mentioned, it was mostly in the context of criticising its trade policies, and warnings of its rise as a geoeconomic “threat” to US interests. 



Certainly Mr Obama needs capable people in his administration to manage the challenges in the Middle East. But he and his foreign policy aides must realise that all the major geostrategic and geoeconomic problems facing the US in the next four years, including energy policy, climate change, nuclear proliferation — and the current global economic crisis — will require co‐​operation with Beijing. 



During his discussions with officials in Beijing, Mr Paulson expressed concern that lowering the value of the yuan to stimulate the Chinese economy could worsen the US slowdown by keeping Chinese export prices relatively low and import prices high, which would hurt US exporters. In the past, US lawmakers have threatened to punish China if it refuses to change its exchange rate policies. But it is unlikely that Congress will risk a trade war now, given that America’s effort to spend itself out of recession will depend so much on the willingness of the Chinese to continue financing the US deficit. 



This dilemma highlights the need for a long‐​term strategy to manage the Sino‐​US relationship in a way that encourages China to assume greater leadership in multilateral economic organisations like the International Monetary Fund. 



During the cold war, the first question on the minds of America’s allies and rivals following the election of a new president was: “How is he going to handle Moscow?” Today, and in the future, America’s friends and adversaries should be more concerned about the approach a new White House occupant will take towards Beijing.",2020-12-19T17:05:45.104847Z,1

,2020-12-22T13:25:15.397614Z,586,119,,"Ecosystems will continue to collapse around the world unless humanity listens to the expertise of indigenous communities on how to live alongside nature, a prominent Amazon leader has warned. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people, who is vice-president of the pan-Amazon organisation representing communities in the river basin, said governments were spending millions of dollars on environmental consultants while largely ignoring the land management skills of the planet’s indigenous people that could help combat the climate crisis and biodiversity loss.  Speaking to the Guardian from the Ecuadorian Amazon, Katan, who became the first indigenous representative at a UN climate action summit last year, said environmental “catastrophes” such as the fires that devastated the world’s largest rainforest in 2019 would continue unless the contributions and human rights of indigenous people were respected. Indigenous communities support around 80% of the planet’s biodiversity despite accounting for less than one twentieth of the human population, according to the World Bank. Katan’s warning came as a new study revealed that parts of the Amazon rainforest under the stewardship of indigenous peoples sequester carbon better than areas with little protection, leading to less deforestation and degradation. “We are the defenders of nature, of the life of the forests, of our territories,” said Katan, vice-president of Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (Coica). “The world is investing lots of money to implement public policy to combat climate change, help conservation and restoration. But these policies are made in offices by technical experts with little or no knowledge of the Earth.” Biodiversity loss was named as the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity this year by the World Economic Forum, ahead of terror attacks, infectious diseases and interstate conflict. Despite the concerns expressed by the global elite in Davos, there was no indigenous representation at last week’s forum in the Swiss ski resort, according to Katan. He said he would welcome the opportunity to attend next year’s forum to outline an indigenous economic model based on maintaining the health of the world’s soils, rivers and the forest. “If the proposals, knowledge and management practices of indigenous people are not listened to, there will be more big catastrophes. The issue of fires in the Amazon will continue, the degradation of forests and water will continue, deforestation will continue,” Katan added. This month, the UN unveiled the draft of a Paris-style agreement on nature calling for a commitment to protect at least 30% of the planet, dramatically reduce pollution and promote the participation and practices of indigenous people. Katan said: “We are well-coordinated with our brothers and sisters from Indonesia, the Congo, communities in the Arctic and from the Pacific. We’ve been discussing issues with our brothers and sisters from all parts of the world. “In Indonesia, for example, they also have a lot of knowledge about how to manage tropical forests. But the same story is being repeated here as in other parts of the world: the lack of recognition of their knowledge and the lack of respect for the human rights of indigenous populations.” Anti-indigenous sentiment is increasing in some parts of the planet. This month activists said they would sue Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro for his latest racist comments in which he questioned the humanity of indigenous communities. In one of his weekly Facebook broadcasts, Bolsonaro declared: “Indians are undoubtedly changing … They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.” The new study from the Woods Hole Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts, found that between 2003 and 2016, 90% of net emissions came from outside protected lands in the Amazon. Scientist and lead author Wayne Walker said: “Our work shows that forests under the stewardship of indigenous peoples and local communities continue to have better carbon outcomes than lands lacking protection, meaning that their role is critical and must be strengthened if Amazon basin countries are to succeed in maintaining this globally important resource, while also achieving their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.” The findings add weight to the recommendations of a report on land use and the climate crisis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which found that areas held or managed by indigenous peoples had much less human impact on the environment. The report also highlighted the lack of consideration of indigenous views and knowledge in understanding large regions and ecosystems.

,2020-12-19T12:58:31.773584Z,588,120,,"_ **Editor’s note**_ _: In 2014, Cato released_A Dangerous World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security, _an edited volume of papers originally presented ata Cato conference the previous year. In each chapter, experts on international security assessed, and put in context, the supposed dangers to American security, from nuclear proliferation and a rising China, to terrorism and climate change._



 _As part of ourProject on Threat Inflation, Cato is republishing each chapter in an easily readable online format. Even six years after its publication, much of the book remains relevant. Policymakers and influencers continue to tout a dizzying range of threats, and Americans are still afraid. We invited each author to revisit their arguments and offer a few new observations in light of recent events. The first of these, by Brendan Rittenhouse Green, appeared ___here__ _last week._



 _Paul R. Pillar, a n_ _on‐​resident senior fellow at the Center for Security Studies of Georgetown University, and a non‐​resident fellow of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, provides his thoughts below. His reflections on hischapter are informed by his 28‐​year career in the U.S. intelligence community, and his voluminous writing and research, including his most recent book, _Why America Misunderstands the World: National Experience and Roots of Misperception _(Columbia University Press, 2016), whichhe discussed at Cato in late 2016. _



—–



Prevailing American thinking about substate threats—and more specifically the thinking that shapes U.S. policy—exhibits at least as much of a disconnect between perception and reality as when _A Dangerous World?_ was published six years ago. The policy players and their principal bugbears have changed, but broader patterns my earlier essay identified persist. Perhaps the most glaring demonstration of this persistence is the continued presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan—more than eighteen years after the original intervention, in what has become America’s longest war. A major impediment to withdrawing those troops continues to be the notion of Afghanistan as a unique “safe haven” for terrorists who, because of that haven, are supposedly more likely than they otherwise would be to inflict harm on Americans. The result is an interminable military expedition that in important respects is doing more harm than good.



The evolution of international terrorism during the last six years has challenged other common but flawed thought patterns about terrorism. The biggest development in that evolution has been the rise and, as a territorial entity, fall of the Islamic State or ISIS. This group’s split from, and competition with, Al Qaeda underscore the error of the earlier tendency to treat violent Sunni radicalism as monolithic, with the accompanying habit of applying the label “Al Qaeda” to the whole phenomenon. ISIS’s history also further refutes the thinking about terrorist safe havens. When ISIS had its mini‐​state in Iraq and Syria, it was focused primarily on running and maintaining that entity and less focused on international terrorism than it has been when lacking such a territory.



The Trump administration appears to have centered its threat perceptions more on states than on substate phenomena. Nonetheless, its foreign policies demonstrate some of the patterns identified in the earlier essay, including the tendency to divide the perceived world simplistically into competing camps of good guys and bad guys. A prime example is the administration’s idea of a NATO‐​like security alliance in the Middle East that would unite the United States, Israel, and some favored Arab states against a presumed bad guys’ bloc led by Iran. Nonstate actors such as Lebanese Hezbollah, the Houthi movement in Yemen, and some militias in Iraq are placed in the bad guys’ camp because of their association with Iran. The idea hasn’t gotten anywhere partly because it does not correspond to the more complicated lines of conflict and competition in the Middle East.



The administration’s obsession with Iran also illustrates a corollary to a pattern the earlier essay identified regarding perceptions of revolutionary violence and regime change. The pattern is the habitual assumption that regime change in any state the United States currently considers a friend or ally is assumed to be a threat to the United States. The corollary is that any regime change in a state the United States considers an adversary is assumed to be good. Thus, the Trump administration presses on with its “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, which, in the absence of feasible demands or constructive diplomacy, can only be aimed at collapse of the current Iranian regime. It presses on—and in so doing raises the risk of escalation to a wider war—oblivious to the likelihood that a replacement regime, such as a Revolutionary Guard dictatorship, would be even worse than what Iran has now.



Now the United States and the world are confronting a nonstate threat, in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, that is inflicting death and damage orders of magnitude beyond what was ever inflicted by the substate actors that for years have been the focus of American threat perceptions. Unlike with, say, terrorism, there certainly has been no problem of previously prevailing threat perceptions exceeding the reality. With terrorism, more sober voices have had to point out that in most years more Americans drown in bathtubs than fall victim to terrorism. Even after an outlier event such as 9/11, the casualties have been many times fewer than, say, the number of Americans who die in traffic accidents. But in only a couple of months, COVID-19 has left bathtub drownings in the dust and has killed more Americans than a year’s worth of traffic deaths.



One pattern applicable to other nonstate threats that does apply to the current pandemic is the tendency—a characteristically American tendency—to overstate the newness of a threat. The novel coronavirus may be novel in terms of virology, but infectious disease epidemics certainly are not. Plagues go back to ancient times. A failure to think in such terms is one factor underlying the inadequacy of preparations to deal with the likes of COVID-19.



Some of the U.S. responses to COVID-19 can be attributed to Trump’s habits, such as the flagellation of China as a way to deflect blame and attention away from the administration’s performance. But a more general American tendency is in play as well. COVID-19 is a nonstate threat, but it also is a nonhuman threat. As such, it does not conform well with the way Americans habitually think of their _bêtes noires_. Americans have long looked for monsters to destroy, but they expect the monster to have a face, in the form of a loathed leader, regime, or substate group. They have difficulty thinking ahead about meeting faceless threats such as a disease or a changing climate.



This is one reason to temper silver‐​lining hopes that the pandemic will get people and their government to think more about threats that are most likely to kill them and less about foreign regimes or groups that are unlikely to do so. Just look at how the Trump administration has continued with its maximum pressure campaign against Iran. As thoughtful and expert observers on both sides of the Atlantic have observed, any nation’s inability to get the virus under control impedes efforts to contain the pandemic globally and thus threatens other nations’ citizens. A prudent step, therefore, would be to ease the U.S. sanctions that are impairing Iran’s ability to contain COVID-19. At a time when tens of thousands of American deaths ought to make control of the pandemic an overriding priority, the Trump administration ignores this advice.

,2020-12-19T17:08:32.197107Z,593,119,,"Ameth Diagne points to a single tree submerged in the ocean. It is barely visible from the patch of land where he is standing, 50 metres away. The few branches emerging from the water mark the place where he proposed to his wife 35 years earlier. It used to be the town square of Doun Baba Dieye, a vibrant fishing community on the outskirts of Saint-Louis in northern Senegal. The village has been wiped off the map, with only the tree and crumbling walls of an abandoned school remaining as testament to its existence. Everything else is 1.5 metres under water.  “This was home. I was born here. Everything which was important to me happened here,” says Ameth, the former village chief. Doun Baba Dieye is in the southern part of Langue de Barbarie, a thin, sandy strip of land protecting Saint-Louis, former colonial capital of Senegal, from the ocean. Saint-Louis, a city of 230,000 and a Unesco world heritage site, is nestled between the mouth of the Senegal river and the Atlantic. The French chose Saint-Louis as the capital because of its strategic location, which allowed the city to flourish in colonial times. But today the “Venice of Africa” is being eaten up by the rising waters. Crossing the Faidherbe bridge, which connects the colourful city centre to the mainland, it seems as if you can almost touch the water. This state of a permanent flood alert has become the city’s new normal. In Saint-Louis, the consequences of climate crisis are tangible: thousands of people uprooted; houses destroyed; hundreds of children attending classes in the evening instead of in the morning because their school has been swept into the ocean. The World Bank, which recently allotted €24m (£20m) to combat the effects of climate change in Saint-Louis, estimates that 10,000 people in the city are either already displaced or live within 20 metres of the waterline, the high-risk zone. And this is just the beginning. According to a study commissioned by the Senegalese government, 80% of Saint-Louis territory will be at risk of flooding by 2080, and 150,000 people will have to relocate. Most of west Africa’s coastal cities, home to 105 million people, face a similar threat. Mangone Diagné, from the regional division of Senegal’s environment ministry, puts it bluntly: “Saint-Louis is surrounded by water and is incredibly vulnerable to climate change. But the damage was caused both by nature and by men.” He is referring to an engineering mistake, which contributed to the deterioration of the Langue de Barbarie. In 2003, heavy rainfall caused the Senegal river to rise rapidly, putting Saint-Louis at risk of flooding. As a quick fix, local government dug a four-metre-wide breach, or canal, cutting through the Langue de Barbarie. The effect has been the opposite of the one intended. Although at first the river level dropped, the breach quickly started to expand. It is now 6km wide and has cut off part of the peninsula, turning it into an island – and flooding Doun Baba Dieye. It has also upset the delicate balance of the local ecosystem. The canal brought seawater into the river, increasing its salinity level. This has affected the population of rare bird species and river fish – forcing fishermen to venture into Mauritanian waters, which is dangerous and illegal – as well as wiping out the coconut trees and mangroves that once protected the shores. Local crops, already destabilised by irregular rainy seasons and sand storms, were further damaged. Ameth, along with more than 800 former inhabitants of Doun Baba Dieye, are among the victims forced to move away from the peninsula without any support from the state. “We are fishermen, we know the ocean, so we left at the good moment – and nobody got hurt,” says Ameth, before correcting himself: “We were fishermen.” Since his community was dispersed, Ameth’s fishing boat, a pirogue, remains largely unused: “We live too far from the ocean now. I was not only deprived of my home, but also of my livelihood.” Inhabitants of the Langue de Barbarie are from the Lebou ethnic group who have been fishermen for centuries. Boys learn the necessary skills from an early age. But Ameth wants his sons to have an education: three of them are in primary school and two are at university. “For us Lebou, the ocean is our lifeblood. But it is hard to make a living as a fisherman today. This is why so many young men from our community are migrating. I want my sons to have a choice.” North of the Langue de Barbarie peninsula, the fishing district of Guet N’dar was hit by a 4-metre wave one night in September 2017. The ensuing flood affected more than 100 houses, a school, a mosque, and part of the cemetery. The homeless were put in a makeshift camp next to the airport. The ocean eventually receded, leaving a scene of devastation. Against the backdrop of crumbling walls and half-wrecked buildings, French president Emmanuel Macron visited in February 2018 and pledged an extra €15m to build a sea wall to protect the remaining infrastructure. But by April of that year, a part of the sea wall had collapsed, letting the ocean take over. Ameth is counting neither on the World Bank, nor on Macron. Thanks to financing from the UN, he returns once a year to the place where his old village stood, and plants trees. He hopes that mangroves and filaos, an exotic species of pine, can stop the destruction of the shoreline. “Although we had to move physically, my mind and spirit stayed here. And I hope one day I can move back,” he says.",2020-12-19T17:08:32.197140Z,1
,2020-12-19T12:58:54.142808Z,594,120,,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein has introduced the Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act, a proposal to regulate social media bots in a roundabout fashion. The bill has several shortcomings.   
  
  
Automation of social media use exists on a continuum, from simple software that allows users to schedule posts throughout the day, to programs that scrape and share information about concert ticket availability, or automatically respond to climate change skeptics. Bots may provide useful services, or flood popular topics with nonsense statements in an effort to derail debate. They often behave differently across different social media platforms; Reddit bots serve different functions than Twitter bots.   
  
  
What level of automation renders a social media account a bot? Sen. Feinstein isn’t sure, so she’s relinquishing that responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission:   




The term ‘‘automated software program or process intended to impersonate or replicate human activity online’’ has the meaning given the term by the [Federal Trade] Commission



If Congress wants to attempt to regulate Americans’ use of social media management software, they should do so themselves. Instead, they would hand the hard and controversial work of defining a bot to the FTC, dodging democratic accountability in the process. Moreover, the bill demands that the FTC define bots “broadly enough so that the definition is not limited to current technology”, virtually guaranteeing initial overbreadth.   
  
  
While the responsibility of defining bots is improperly passed to the FTC, the enforcement of Feinstein’s proposed bot disclosure regulations is accomplished through a further, even less desirable delegation. The Bot Disclosure and Accountability Act compels social media firms to adopt policies requiring the operators of automated accounts to “provide clear and conspicuous notice of the automated program.” Platforms would need to continually “identify, assess, and verify whether the activity of any user of the social media website is conducted by an automated software program”, and “remove posts, images, or any other online activity” of users that fail to disclose their use of automated account management software. Failure to reasonably follow this rubric is to be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice.   
  
  
This grossly infringes on the ability of private firms, from social media giants like Facebook to local newspapers that solicit readers’ comments, to manage their digital real‐​estate as they see fit, while tipping the balance of private content moderation against free expression. Social media firms already work to limit the malicious use of bots on their platforms, but no method of bot‐​identification is foolproof. If failure to flag or remove automated accounts is met with FTC censure, social media firms will be artificially incentivized to remove more than necessary.   
  
  
The bill also separately, and more stringently, regulates automation in social media use by political campaigns, PACs, and labor unions. No candidate or political party may make any use of bots, however the FTC defines the term, while political action committees and labor unions are prohibited from using or purchasing automated posting software to disseminate messages advocating for the election of any specific candidate. It is as if Congress banned parties and groups from using megaphones at rallies. Would that prohibition reduce political speech? No doubt it would. How then can the prohibitions in this bill comport with the constitutional demand to make no law abridging the freedom of speech? They cannot.   
  
  
Feinstein’s bill attempts to automate the process of regulating social media bots. In doing so, it dodges the difficult questions that attend regulation, like what, exactly, should be regulated, and foists the burden of enforcement on a collection of private firms ill‐​equipped to integrate congressional mandates into their content moderation processes. Automation may provide for the efficient delivery of many services, but regulation is not among them. Most importantly, the bill does not simply limit spending on bots. It _prohibits_ political (and only political) speech by banning the use of an instrument for speaking to the public. Online bots may worry Americans, but this blanket prohibition of speech should worry us more.",2020-12-19T12:58:54.142840Z,1

The thickening has been so profound the ice elevations are nearly back to 2010-2011 levels. The nearby ocean has cooled ~1.5°C – a return to 1980s-era temperatures.
The world’s glaciers have not been following along with the CO2-driven catastrophic melting narrative.
Alaska

For example, in a study of 50 Alaskan glaciers for the warming period between 1972-2012, researchers (McNabb and Hock, 2014) found there was

“…no corresponding change in the number of glaciers retreating nor do we see corresponding acceleration of retreat rates. To the contrary, many glaciers in the region have advanced…”

Antarctica
In the Southern Hemisphere, an accumulating collection of (29) referenced studies (Lüning et al.,2019) indicate that not only has the Southern Ocean, Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, and East Antarctica been cooling or not warming in recent decades, but many regional glaciers have begun advancing again.

Greenland
Greenland’s ice sheet mass losses have significantly decelerated since 2013 – a reversal from the rapid retreat from the 1990s to 2012 driven by cloud forcing and the NAO (Ruan et al., 2019).
The 47 largest Greenland glaciers also experienced a “relatively stable” period of rather insignificant retreat from 2013 to 2018 (Andersen et al., 2019).

Only 21 of the 47 Greenland glaciers retreated in 2018, 12 advanced, and the other 14 showed no trends in either direction (Polar Portal, 2019).
Greenland’s largest glacier, Jakobshavn, earned headlines in 2019 for it’s surprising and non-predicted rapid thickening in recent years.

New Study
A new study (Joughin et al., 2020) finds that the Jakobshavn glacier thickening that began in 2016 has continued apace, and ice elevation has now nearly completely returned to 2010/2011 amplitudes.
The authors attribute much of the glacier advance to the rapid 1.5°C ocean cooling impacting the region in recent years.
Ocean temperatures have returned to 1980s-era levels.

A 2017 study suggested the solar activity during the “modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015” is a “relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago” (Yndestad and Solheim, 2017). Variations in solar activity since the 18th century were shown to have ranged between about 1357.5 W/m² and 1362 W/m² (~4.5 W/m²).
In contrast, the total radiative forcing due to the increase in the CO2 concentration since 1750 is suggested to be 1.82 W/m² (Feldman et al., 2015).

A new study (Judge et al., 2020) also affirms our highly uncertain estimations of solar forcing variations since 1750 may be “of the order of 3 W/m², far larger than the IPCC estimate of −0.30 to +0.10 W/m²” and also greater than the uncertain IPCC estimates of total anthropogenic forcing (+2.2 ± 1.1 W/m²) since 1750.
Large estimate ranges for solar forcing variability should reduce the certainty that Earth’s radiative forcing has been dominated by anthropogenic activity in recent centuries.

Sea-level curves obtained from several sites along the Brazilian coast show that a mean sea level (m.s.l.) equal to the present one was reached at ~7 ka b2k, and continued to rise until reaching up to +5 meters between 6 and 5 ka b2k (Martin et al., 2003; Angulo et al., 2006). In the CPRS the PMT formed the Barrier IV, and the estimates based on geologic and fossil records indicate that it reached amplitude of about 2-3 meters above the present m.s.l.

“The altitude of the terrace T3 above the fossils of Toxodon found in situ indicates this was cut by the Holocene sea-level highstand that reached a maximum altitude of 3 meters [above present] between 6 and 5.1 ka b2k. At that time Mirim Lake was invaded by the Atlantic Ocean through Taim and São Gonçalo channel, becoming a large paleo-lagoon with conditions suitable for its occupation by marine organisms, including sharks, rays, teleost fishes and whales. The coastal waters were warmer than today, as indicated by the presence of fossils of the shark Carcharhinus leucas, common in tropical areas.”

The past winter in central and northern Europe was quite warm. Why is that? The Norwegian Centre for Climate Research CICERO explains it in an article from 6 January 2020:
Unseasonal temperatures for Norway
The unusual warm temperatures this winter and forecasts indicating milder winter conditions for January, February and March in Europe are partly due to an atmospheric circulation pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation, or NAO. This atmospheric circulation pattern explains well the weather we get in Europe, especially in winter.
As explained in a CICERO-article from November 2019, seasonal forecast models are sometimes able to correctly forecast the phase of the NAO. 6 different seasonal forecast models are run at the beginning of each month by their respective weather centres from around the globe. The October simulations gave us a hint that we might get a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation for November, December and January. The signal was quite strong, and 4 out of the 6 models were clearly in that direction, while 2 suggested normal winter conditions. The November simulations gave similar results, the majority of the models showed a positive NAO for December, January and February. Experts were a bit puzzled, as at the same time the snow cover over Siberia was already quite extensive, and the Arctic was very warm, two things that usually suggest a cold winter for Europe.
And then came the December simulations, the most recent ones, where all six models hinted to a positive NAO for January, February and March, and therefore milder conditions than normal for northern Europe in particular.
Read more at CICERO. An excellent report, which also applies to Central Europe.
For those who don’t know it yet: The NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) controls the winter temperature in Northern and Central Europe. Positive NAO brings warm winters, negative NAO brings cold winters. Please note!
Now some of you will ask, what is this NAO actually? Well, it is the difference in air pressure between Iceland and the Azores. If the difference is big (pronounced low and pronounced high), then the NAO is positive (NAO+). If low and high are a bit thin, so the difference is smaller, then the NAO is negative. It’s as simple as that.

Why is it important? This pressure difference pushes the westerly winds a little bit more to the north or south. In an NAO+, the westerly wind belt lies further north and meets central Europe. This is where the humidity (wet February 2020, does anyone remember?) and the relative warmth of the Atlantic occur.
In a negative NAO (NAO-), the westerly winds blow further south and discharge their humidity as rain in Portugal and Spain.
For those who want to know more, the NAO website of the British MetOffice is recommended. We take the liberty of reproducing the two most important graphs of the website here. And this is how it looks with a positive NAO:

And this is how a negative looks:

And now, of course, you want to know where to check the current NAO status. To do so, simply google NAO and NOAA, or click on this NOAA page. There you can follow the last months of the NAO in high resolution. There is also a forecast for the next 2 weeks.
We see: In fact, the NAO was mostly positive during the winter. The forecasts for the next 2 weeks are not consistent. Bad luck. But if all models show a sharp downward trend in winter, you urgently need to buy road salt.
If you understand the NAO, you will get along better in life and in the climate change labyrinth. Finally we allow ourselves the question:
Why can’t the DWD German Weather Service explain such contexts to us?

Today we post before-and-after mean annual temperature charts for 6 US stations in the midwest region with a low brightness index (BI), meaning low impact from the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which arises from widespread asphalt, concrete and infrastucture.
The low BI index tells us that the stations are sited in a rural-type environment. Five of the six stations have a BI of 0, while one (Thibodaux, LA) has a relatively low BI of 11.
Shown will be comparisons of NASA GISS Version 4 unadjusted, versus Version 4 adjusted. In each case the unadjusted data showed a cooling or little warming, while the adjusted data all ended up to show warming.
First we plot the station at Plainville, Kansas, which I already posted at Twitter. Shown is the plot going back over 100 years, before NASA adjustments and after adjustments.

It's obvious, as far as Plainville's temperature goes, NASA made the false warming trend.Why do many media pretend to know nothing about that?https://t.co/35Itt16sN0~#地球温暖化? #温暖化？ #気候変動 #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/WTD380BGxN

Data source: NASA GISS.
As the 2 plots show, the data from the past were changed by NASA and made cooler. The new result: a warming trend! In other words, a cooling climate was fudged into one that is supposedly warming.
Next we move to the station of Hobart, Oklahoma. A slight cooling trend there was transformed by NASA into a warming trend:

Data source: NASA GISS.
The third station we look at is Carrizo Springs, Texas:

Data source: NASA GISS.
Originally in the V4 unadjusted, the past at Carrizo Springs was warmer than today. But NASA didn’t like that, and so they adjusted the temperatures from earlier in the 20th century downward. Again a modest cooling trend was changed into warming.
The story is the same at the station at Conception Missouri:

Data source: NASA GISS.
At Conception, Missouri, we originally saw no warming over the past 130. years. But then NASA fiddled with the data and now tell us there’s been warming at there as well.
Looking at the temperature charts for the station at El Dorado, Arkansas:

Data source: NASA GISS.
Note how warm it was in the 1920s. But NASA said that this couldn’t be right, and so cooled the mean annual temperatures in the early 20th century byalmost a whopping 2 degrees! Result: (fake) warming!
Finally we plot the NASA GISS data from the station located at Thibodaux, Louisiana – i.e. the U.S. South:

Data source: NASA GISS.
Above we see how the unadjusted V4 data were changed to create more warming.
NASA changed the data several times until they got the warming they want to us believe is taking place. The original data tell us there has been any real warming over the past century at these 6 stations.

,2020-12-19T16:37:09.801340Z,607,119,,"In his acceptance speech, Brazil’s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro said he will “change the destiny of Brazil”. He may be right. For the Amazon and its indigenous residents, things will get worse before they get better, but this election may also be a tipping point for change. The staunchly anti-environment Bolsonaro may sow the seeds for radical environmental politics both in Brazil and worldwide. When the night comes, I wonder what might happen, who will be next, and hope that the dawn will come soon. With these words, Kum'tum, a leader of the indigenous Gamela people in the heart of the Amazon, shared his fear of being an environmental defender in Brazil. His community had been trying to occupy a portion of their ancestral lands claimed by farmers but, in April this year, they were attacked by men armed with machetes and firearms. Some had their hands cut off. Others like Kum'tum were shot. Indigenous groups have good reason to be scared. Over the past decade, Brazil has been the most dangerous country in the world to be a land or environmental defender and 57 of these people were murdered last year alone. According to the NGO Global Witness, this kind of violence stems from sections of the agribusiness sector, in particular parts of the Amazon’s cattle industry which is the largest single cause of deforestation globally. The Amazon and its indigenous residents may now be persecuted with even more ferocity, as Bolsonaro promises a new alliance between the security state, agricultural interests and far-right political power. Fortunately, where there’s hegemony, there’s resistance. NYU sociologist and theorist Steven Lukes famously broke power itself down into “three faces”: decision-making power, non-decision-making power, and ideological power. The Amazon’s future and that of its residents will be fought across these three key battlegrounds. First, Bolsonaro’s government will have to win the visible battles of decision-making processes shaping Brazil’s environmental governance. For instance, Bolsonaro would have to break free from present institutional and legal frameworks tying Brazil to its environmental commitments, such as the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. And that’s tricky because of the global backlash. Perhaps this is why Bolsonaro has now scrapped his pledge to quit Paris.   Other challenges to Bolsonaro’s decision-making power will come from below. While Brazil’s balance of power has historically favoured big corporations like those in the agribusiness sector, the country also hosts massive grass roots movements of resistance. These include the Marxist-inspired Landless Workers’ Movement (MST), with an informal membership of 1.5m people and, in the Amazon itself, the Cainquiama, a resistance coalition of tens of thousands of persecuted indigenous peoples and other communities.  In this case, the “non-decision-making power” concerns Bolsonaro’s ability to set the development agenda. The country’s new leader wants to reverse green agreements and return to a form of violent pro-growth neoliberalism which is blind to both democracy and environmental concerns.  But the Amazon acts as the world’s lung and is a globally shared priority. The existential threats it faces would be met in a similar combative spirit as those facing the melting Arctic – by environmental defenders, pro-sustainable development governments, global institutions and civil society. Collectively, these actors have the moral power to set the agenda and pressure for legal, institutional and economic sanctions and limits to stop the predatory march of Brazilian agribusiness further into the forest. If they can manage to frame actions against the Amazon as crimes against humanity and the planet, they could even be effective. The third conflict is the invisible ideological battle to control Brazilian hearts and minds. By democratically electing a far-right candidate, Brazilians have sent a crystal clear message that they want radical change for the better. The problem is what people understand by “better” and what this “better” means for the environment.  The “Bolsonaro way” is ideologically powerful because it is ambiguous about what it is, but sharply clear on what it is not. Just like Trump, it is unashamedly pro-growth regardless of the collateral damage to the environment, but Bolsonaro’s vague development utopia lacks depth. It resurrects zombie ideas of dictatorship style governance and pro-growth violent neoliberalism, fuelled by popular disillusionment with corruption and a failure to lift people out of poverty. Another ideological battle will concern the church, a powerful institution in the world’s largest Catholic country. In his 2015 encyclical message Laudato Si, Pope Francis attacked environmental degradation and climate change and called for “swift and unified” global action. That, and his later claim that to harm the environment is to sin, may prove a powerful ideological tool for environmental activism. The rising wave of Brazilian evangelicals may also question how Christian it would be to slay the Amazon and its people. A final key ideological battle concerns the normalisation of indifference towards the environment. According to the World Values Survey and Latinobarometro, the largest opinion polls that have investigated what Brazilians value as important, the only topics ranking high in everyday life are corruption, the unstable political situation and the economy. The challenge is that too many Brazilians fail to see how crucial the environment, the Amazon and its indigenous inhabitants are to their own well-being and development.",2020-12-19T16:37:09.801374Z,1
,2020-12-19T20:04:29.961178Z,608,118,,"This week’s report, by Elizabeth Thomas and colleagues from the British Antarctic Survey, that snowfall has been increasing in Antarctica is hardly surprising. What is different that it is much more comprehensive than previous studies, which were largely limited by a virtual lack of pre‐​1957 data. That was the “International Geophysical Year”, in which systematic observations of Antarctica’s climate began.   
  
  
The new study looks at the last 200 years of snowfall trapped in 79 ice cores taken from around the continent. It supplements other recent findings that also made headlines.   
  
  
Determining Antarctica’s overall ice balance has been, well, slippery. One favored method has been to look at gravitational data measured by satellite. Thicker ice means more mass, which means greater gravity. These studies usually come up with a net loss, translating to from 6/1000 of an inch of sea level rise per year to 12/1000 (both values being rather small beer). But different measurements show otherwise. Three years ago, Jay Zwally and his colleagues at NASA used satellite‐​based altimetry and concluded Antarctica was undergoing a net gain in ice.   
  
  
Common sense dictates that it should be snowing more in Antarctica. Think of it as Buffalo on steroids when it comes to snow. In the fall, when Lake Erie isn’t frozen, cold air passing over it from the west picks up evaporated moisture and dumps it on the land in the form of snow squalls. The warmer the water and/​or the colder the air is, the more is snows. Unlike a mere Great Lake, Antarctica is surrounded by a largely unfrozen ocean, and when any atmospheric disturbance sends moisture onshore, it snows too.   
  
  
Around Antarctica, there’s been a slight—meaning a couple of tenths of a degree—warming of the surrounding ocean, which means that the air blowing over it picks up a bit more moisture than it used to. Unlike Lake Erie, the Southern Ocean is huge, and any atmospheric disturbance that shoves more oceanic air up onto the continent is going to be pushing a substantial stream inland with ever more moisture, even for a very slight ocean temperature rise.   
  
  
The “surface mass balance” of a glacier or an ice sheet is the difference between accumulated snowfall and what either melts or evaporates. In anticipation of increased snowfall, the last (2013) scientific summary by the United Nations’ Intertgovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that the projected 21st change in the Antarctic mass balance to be weakly _positive_. That’s why it’s perplexing that the new finding is so newsworthy.   
  
  
But now we know that the snow has been increasing down there for the past 200 years…and that the increase started before the major emissions of atmospheric carbon dioxide.",2020-12-19T20:04:29.961214Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:10:34.154486Z,609,119,,"A report by the WWF published on October 30 reveals how our actions are degrading the natural world – the very basis on which our livelihood depends. The Living Planet Report 2018 shows that between 1970 and 2014, vertebrate – mammal, fish, bird, amphibian and reptile – population sizes have been reduced by 60%. South and Central America have been hit particularly hard, suffering population declines of 89%.  The report is one of the most comprehensive global analyses of biodiversity, yet it does have its limitations. It only tracks vertebrates, sampling is not standardised across different biomes, and it ignores genetic diversity.  It’s also worth noting that other global studies have reported different figures for biomass decline. A study in Nature looking at plant and insect species, estimates declines in species abundance of around 11%, and a study from Germany found a 75% decline in flying insect biomass in the 27 years up to 2016.  These are large discrepancies and clearly this topic needs further exploration. However, all these studies support the conclusion that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate. There are two main strands of argument when it comes to the loss of wildlife. The first is that the loss of nature is a necessary and acceptable consequence of human progress. Historically, our wealth has increased through exploiting the natural environment, and it has allowed us to live richer lives with more freedom of opportunity.  Counter to this, the argument runs that we can only push biodiversity loss so far before we threaten the life support systems of our small planet – the capacity of the biosphere to regulate our climate, pollinate our crops, purify our water and decompose our waste. The biologist Paul Ehrlich once made the analogy that losing species in an ecosystem is like progressively removing rivets from an aeroplane: the plane may fly on for a while, but eventually it will fall out of the sky. Such concerns have led to attempts to quantify “safe limits” of biodiversity loss, or so-called planetary boundaries that we must not cross else we risk a catastrophic tipping point. Although a compelling concept, there remains serious issues in implementing it. One is the uncertainty in the extent of biodiversity loss, the other is in the impact these losses will have on human livelihoods.  To make a comparison with climate change, many governments only committed to action after the likely economic impacts were quantified through meticulous analysis combining climate science and economics. Therefore, new approaches to more precisely quantify risk are urgently needed in order to galvanise action. But even if we can ascertain the risks, will we actually be able to stop biodiversity loss?  We know with some confidence the risks of global warming, yet countries are struggling to stick to their Paris commitments, let alone the even greater emission reductions needed to avoid a warmer world.  I was recently involved in an interdisciplinary analysis of the global food system (one of the major culprits of biodiversity loss), which identified a range of mechanisms that keep our food system “locked” into an unsustainable trajectory.  People often feel powerless to change such global systems and point to factors at the level of government policy, such as the upcoming extension and renewal of the Convention for Biological Diversity. Although wise governance is essential, many factors that contribute to a decline in biodiversity operate at the individual level, such as our dietary and consumer choices. Also, the structure of our institutions ultimately reflects our individual mindsets, so we have the opportunity to initiate positive change by acknowledging our dependency on nature. Rising levels of individualism, however, have encouraged an economy that provides for private interests at the expense of nature.  Through our purchases we can destroy the environment on the other side of the world, which is why the WWF report calls for better data to connect consumers to the consequences of their actions. On the positive side, our increasingly connected world could allow for social contagion of positive and responsible ways of acting. Small individual changes can cascade and cause a different kind of “tipping point” towards a more sustainable way of life.  If we really want to halt biodiversity loss and ensure a safe course for current and future generations on Spaceship Earth, we need to think beyond government, and forget the selfish “I” – the solutions start with “us”.",2020-12-19T16:10:34.154520Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:26:54.176629Z,610,119,,"The global crisis of climate change is one of the most complex and wicked of problems we currently face. It is a physical, technological and economic challenge, and one that raises questions right at the heart of our relationship with the environment in which we live. In the light of the IPCC’s most recent report, we face difficult decisions that will change every aspect of how we live. Yet providing people with more scientific information has been shown to have little effect on the degree to which people care about the climate or understand the impact of human activity. Something else is needed to jolt us out of our current trajectory. I am exploring the role of art as a route to knowing the environment in an alternative way. For my latest work, The Matter of the Soul, I hacked the electronics of lab equipment to transform them into musical instruments that play the sounds of melting ice. In the musical compositions and sculptural installations for this work, I explore the possibility of art to engender empathy with the Arctic ecosystem, and how dispersal of water, human movement and digital identity are three intrinsically interlinked processes of transformation relevant to climate change. I began the research for The Matter of the Soul sailing around Baffin Island in the Canadian High Arctic. I set up a temporary studio on the top deck of the ship Akademik Sergei Vavilov, where I could tinker with all of my equipment and explore the aesthetic of this fascinating place, so different from my European home. The light in the Arctic was incredible. It felt like the sun touched me differently. But what struck me most was how much personality the water there had. Lumps of ice and mini-icebergs are strewn across the barren landscape, perching on top of rocks like seagulls or floating next to tiny islands as if they’re biding their time, waiting for their chance. The meltwater from glaciers crashed joyously down rock faces, surging into the ocean. Icebergs created a time all for themselves, distorting our reality when we intersected them. Around the ship, and on land in the open, rocky landscapes, I interviewed visitors to and residents based around Baffin Island. But I also captured the voice of the ocean and ice. I wanted to draw an analogy between bodies of water and human culture. To capture the voice of the water, I decided to explore the chemical consequences of ice melting. Ice and seawater are the coming together of individual water molecules, just as culture emerges from the coming together of individual human beings. Water in ice both has its behaviour shaped by its environment and constructs this environment, just as we human beings are shaped by and construct our culture. When glaciers and icebergs melt, individual water molecules begin an adventure of dispersal that could take them as far as Mexico. The behaviour and trajectories of molecules are changed by the ocean that they have joined and become part of, just as when we travel – either for tourism or migration – we change and exchange with the cultures we encounter, and within ourselves. There are plenty of scientific instruments for gathering data on how water changes due to climate change, but not many pianos that do it. I decided to merge artistic and scientific methods of encountering the world, by hacking the scientific instruments to make sounds that I could use in my musical compositions. I took a pH meter and conductivity meter, which measures the water’s saltiness, with me to the Arctic. To get sound out of these scientific instruments I used a process called circuit bending. This process allows me to make audible the changes in voltage in the equipment when they measure the physical properties of the water. I can then record them. It took a while for me to succeed in this. Immersed in the Arctic, having spent days in open water due to fog and ice, I had been struggling to find the sound in the circuit of the conductivity meter. Hunched in my little studio, dipping the probe in and out of my sample of “Open Seawater 2”, I suddenly heard it. A faint hum, followed by a diminishing click, with periodic surges in the sound. I had found a temporal representation of the salinity – the sound of the the dying off of the saltiness of the sea as icebergs melt. The sound of the dying of the ice. Importantly, these recordings are not directly representative of the value of the measurements. They are rather derived from what happens inside the machines during the process of measurement. As such, the recordings are not a sonification of data, but rather a reflection on the process of measurement as a passive way of knowing, which can evoke the same sense of achievement as acting (and therefore can act as a placeholder for real action). On October 23, I played my hacked instruments at Howard Assembly Rooms at Opera North in Leeds, accompanied by pianist Matthew Bourne and cornet player Alex Bonney. The hour-long symphony tells the narrative of transformation and dispersal in the Arctic: of ice and seawater, of changing culture and climate change. The raw material and compositions from the project will also be released online under Creative Commons, with a call for others to remix the work’s identity as it disperses through the internet. I am also releasing all compositions of The Matter of the Soul on audio cassette, with the full symphony coming out on cassette in November. I chose this physical format because it’s easy to remix it while preserving the audio quality. We are at a tipping point, a moment where the decisions we make will drastically affect the future well-being of humanity. A wicked problem like climate change can’t be fixed by one action alone. It takes a collection of actions to tip the system. I hope that by connecting in an embodied way with the processes of transformation in the Arctic, it might be possible for a few of us to connect with transformations within ourselves, enabling us to take action without.",2020-12-22T13:26:54.176661Z,1

Run by Dutch start-up Ocean Cleanup, the scheme involves a 600m-long floating pipe connected to a net, which herds plastic into place before it is gathered and taken to shore by specialist boats.  The question of why we should bother to clean up the oceans may seem obvious to you but, as an economist who studies these things, I like to put a number on it. We can therefore say that plastic in the ocean has a direct financial impact through things such as lost tourism, damaged ships or fewer fish to catch. But it also has a wider and harder to quantify economic impact on lost marine life or reduced beach and water quality.  These damages, estimated at US$1.25 billion annually, imply that recovering marine plastics is worthwhile. But my research suggests that it might not be financially viable to do so. This is partly because the clean-up is so expensive. Unsurprisingly, towing a massive boom out to the middle of the ocean and then periodically transporting plastics to and from it is not cheap.  The Ocean Cleanup’s own 2014 feasibility study suggested that, once a full fleet of 100km of these floating barriers was deployed at a cost of US$372.73m (currency converted by myself in August 2018), it would collect plastic at around US$5.32 per kilogram.  This wouldn’t be a problem if discarded plastic was more valuable. The scheme could even pay for itself. But the clean-up will remain unprofitable for the time being because the market price for discarded plastic remains incredibly low. I looked at four possible options for recovered plastic: 1. Landfill: This is the easiest option although it leads to actual net losses rather than any benefit. Revenue per kg: -$0.12 2. Incineration: Burning all waste generates electricity which is reportedly as much as 60% cleaner than a fossil fuel equivalent. However, this negates the possibility of recycling or reusing the plastics. Revenue per kg: $0.10 3. Pyrolysis: Similar to incineration, except the plastic is heated in the absence of oxygen, so it doesn’t burn. Instead, the process generates oils which can be refined and sold. However, the viability of pyrolysis is dependent on economies of scale which may not suit it to the infrequent collection of marine plastics. Furthermore, at a low level, it is unlikely that the generated oil from plastics can be price competitive with conventional oil sources. Revenue per kg: $0.27 4. Recycling: This is the preferred option, as it is a more efficient use of existing resources. But volatile recycled plastic prices and low virgin plastic prices suggest that this, too, is unlikely to be a profitable option. Revenue per kg: variable, but a weighted average of $0.15 is a reasonable assumption All this means it costs more than $5 to gather a kilo of plastic from the ocean, while that same plastic will only be valued at – at best – 30 cents. With about 8 billion kilos (8,000 tonnes) of plastic added to the ocean each year, the costs – and losses – involved are huge. Of course, such a massive loss is not likely to persist in the long term. For instance, increasing oil prices will push up the price of virgin plastics hence making recycling a more valuable option. Furthermore, the high cost expectations are primarily due to this being the first system of its type. With further experience, research and development in recovering debris at sea, it is likely that a lower-cost method will arise. However, there is no immediate indication of such improvements, and so big losses are expected to persist in the short to medium term. The financial loss contrasts with the economic benefits of recovering marine plastics. Even conservative underestimates of the costs of marine plastics suggest annual damages to be in the billions.  Using estimates of how much plastic is in the ocean, I was able to estimate that removing each kilogram would lead to a net benefit of at least US$7 and as much as US$38. But that still leaves us with a direct financial loss of nearly US$5 per kilogram recovered, versus a more than US$7 net benefit to society for every kilogram recovered. So we are at an impasse. It is nowhere near profitable to recover marine plastics, yet it is imperative to do so. Thankfully, a few solutions are at hand.  The first is crowdfunding. This avenue worked before for the scheme in question which managed to raise more than $2m in just 100 days. But there are doubts about how viable such a fickle and inconsistent funding source is for a longer-running scheme that would operate at a global scale.  Philanthropy is another option. Conceivably, with the support of just a few wealthy benefactors, viable ocean clean-up could be a reality. However, it is unclear whether leaving ocean clean-up to the whim of a few individuals is a sustainable model in the longer term. Finally, the international nature of plastic pollution suggests no single government is going to foot the bill – especially if all the financial benefits are privately appropriated. However, one suggestion is that if taxpayers are already paying environmental charges aimed at reducing plastic pollution, such as the plastic bag tax or proposed latte levy, then perhaps these revenues could be earmarked to fund the scheme.  So future policymakers must pay particular attention to the various mechanisms and agreements that may bridge the gap between financial losses and economic benefits. Indeed, evidence suggests a healthy degree of public support for cleaning up the environment, but whether the public feels strongly enough to support efforts via crowdfunding or earmarked taxes remains to be seen.

Region NOAA 10953 is currently beta-gamma magnetic class, and may increase in complexity.
The region is bright in H-alpha as well. This region has a chance of producing M-class
events.
NOAA 10953, S10 E41.  Beta-gamma region. Position as of April 28, 2007 at 13:30 UT.
And this is in the middle of our solar minimum, indicating our sun still has a few belches to pass out before completely settling down.
One of the best tools we have is the ACE Spacecraft, which monitors the sun 24/7 and provides us with a plethora of real-time data, of the magnetic
field, the solar wind, and  inter-galactic cosmic ray counts.

For the latest ""dial"" info (including our ""space weather stoplight"") go to
http://space.rice.edu/ISTP/dials.html
For the latest 10-minute averages of the Boyle Index from realtime ACE
spacecraft data, go to http://space.rice.edu/ISTP/wind.html
Some guides to interpret the gauges
If the hourly-average of the Boyle index exceeds 110, then Kp 4-6 storms
will likely occur within the next three hours
If the hourly average of the Boyle index exceeds 200, then major magnetic
storms will occur within the next three hours
If the hourly average of the Boyle index exceeds 250, major low-latitude
auroras will occur within the next three hours.
A magnetic storm generally occurs about an hour or two after the CME arrives at Earth, which is roughly 26-48 hours *after* a major solar flare. The Boyle Index is derived from real-time ACE spacecraft data, which gives about 45 minutes of warning before it hits the Earth.

,2020-12-19T17:01:22.842826Z,616,119,,"As the Brexit negotiations wrap up and Theresa May’s deal is lambasted by Remainers and Leavers alike, it’s still far from clear what the future holds for the United Kingdom. On March 29 2019, it is due to leave the European Union. Brexit is the first time a member state has voted to withdraw from the EU and it has caused a geopolitical earthquake, unleashing uncertainty in the UK and abroad. We don’t know what the impact on the UK will be when (and if) it actually leaves the EU. If it does so on poor terms, or via the still possible “no deal” eventuality, there are a wealth of devastating projections which may materialise. The only thing that we can be sure of is that Brexit represents a moment of huge social, political and economic rupture. However, history tells us that such moments are also moments of opportunity for radical departure from the status quo. Let’s be frank, Brexit is not a progressive endeavour. It threatens social and economic turmoil in which the most vulnerable in society will – as always – be the hardest hit. Leaving the EU could jeopardise benefits to UK citizens in the form of workers’ rights, environmental protections and food standards. The political climate outside of the EU also offers an increasingly undesirable community of potential allies and traders, dominated by the rise of the far-right in North and South America. On the other hand, uncritical adoration of the EU overlooks the reality of what the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis has described as “a regressive set of vile institutions”. It cannot be denied: the EU is a large and brutal force for neoliberalism. From this critical stance on the EU, I still voted Remain in the referendum. I believed then – and still believe now – that regressive forces will profit from the UK’s exit and that the vulnerable will suffer. So, as we approach the March deadline, if the UK does indeed crash out of the EU, the left needs to be prepared with visions of alternative futures, and be ready to fight for them.  The realities of a post-Brexit UK appear bleak, certainly in the short term. But separation opens the door for alternatives to the dominance of free-market fundamentalism. We could move from a society centred around financialised capital and the City of London, to one that promotes social and environmental justice in the UK and internationally. Reports claim that Brexit will mean lower levels of economic growth for the UK. For politicians this is a horrifying prospect. But falling growth need not be feared, if it is integrated within a broader transformation of society. The degrowth movement emerging amongst academics and activists argues that the logic of infinite growth is driving ecosystem collapse and climate breakdown. As stated in the latest IPCC report, we now have only 12 years to radically restructure society to cap global temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. If we fail, we will face catastrophic climate impacts.  Degrowth argues that the wealthy and heavily polluting countries of the global north – such as the UK – must undergo a phase of managed and socially equitable economic contraction. This is necessary to downscale rich economies to within safe ecological limits. The need for endless economic growth pushes us to produce more, consume more and make more profit. It has left our society overworked, over-stressed and plagued by extreme levels of inequality.  These dire social conditions have been blamed for the Brexit vote itself and unlimited growth also fuels climate breakdown, with the UK as a big contributor to global carbon emissions. Simply, our slavish devotion to growth is making us miserable and destroying the planet. Degrowth could liberate us by arguing that more growth is not the solution, but the problem. We can and must live better with less, shared more fairly. Degrowth would rid our society of pointless production and consumption. We could say goodbye to “bullshit jobs” – the pointless make-work that keeps workers stressed without any obvious value to society beyond enriching corporate elites. Production and consumption could be organised in service of social and environmental well-being rather than profit. This degrowth transition could be pursued through ideas which confront the relentless treadmill of work, such as a four-day week. Poverty and inequality could be tackled by implementing a universal basic income and a maximum income. A fundamental decentralisation of the UK’s political and economic landscape could end London’s dominance by distributing more democratic autonomy to the regions. Degrowth thus acknowledges that liberating society from the growth imperative is not only an ecological necessity, but also loosens the grip of the capitalist wage-labour market. This frees people to dedicate more of their lives to the things that really matter to them. Is degrowth a likely future for the UK after Brexit? Certainly not in the short term. But, as Brexit and climate breakdown destabilise our politics, nothing much is certain. Only that we must be prepared with visions of a better future, and be ready to fight for them.",2020-12-19T17:01:22.842860Z,1
,2020-12-19T17:09:59.599158Z,617,119,,"One of the principal arguments in favour of HS2 was the positive effect it would have on the environment – and this was rooted in the belief that high-speed electric trains could help the UK cut its carbon emissions. The rail project, supporters have argued, will lessen demand for carbon-intensive air travel, road freight and car journeys by linking northern England – and potentially Scotland – with the Midlands, London and HS1 to the Channel tunnel and continental Europe. Providing low-carbon alternatives is urgently needed because transport (mostly road) is now Britain’s largest greenhouse gas emitting sector, accounting for 28% of all GHG emissions in 2017. The government has a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but there is disagreement over whether HS2 will really help deliver. At face value, the project should be a good way to cut carbon. Electric trains, particularly if powered by renewable energy, provide low-carbon transport. HS2 claims it can achieve 8g of carbon emissions per person per km. The same journey by car would generate 67g of emissions – and by plane, 170g. But carbon modelling – predicting a new infrastructure’s carbon emissions – is, like all future-gazing, imprecise and dependent on computer modelling. The government’s own calculations for HS2 suggest its carbon emissions could exceed potential savings, even over the railway’s projected 120-year lifetime. HS2 will not cut carbon emissions. According to HS2’s own forecasts, even over 120 years, its overall construction and operation cause carbon emissions of 1.49m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This represents just 1.18% of Britain’s annual transport emissions, but critics say it is still an increase when emissions need to be falling rapidly to reach net zero. HS2’s construction requires vast quantities of concrete and steel, as well as diesel-powered machines moving millions of tonnes of earth. A 2019 report for the High Speed Rail Group (HSRIL), which represents companies with an interest in high-speed rail, estimates construction could be reduced by 20% to 30% with low-carbon innovations, such as hydrogen-powered floodlights and hybrid excavators. HS2’s calculations show its emissions will be offset by the wider decarbonisation of transport it helps create. Some road freight will move to rail as HS2 will enable the wider rail network to take more freight. There will also be a “modal shift” – people choosing to travel by HS2 instead of driving or flying – but this is likely to be small. The Department for Transport suggests only 1% of HS2 passengers will be people who would have flown, and 4% those who would have driven. Some analysts argue that HS2 has presented an overly pessimistic carbon-saving forecast because it is obliged by law to give worst-case scenarios. The HSRILG report points out HS2’s forecasts of 4% and 1% are based on assuming that driving and flying become more affordable while rail fares increase above inflation. In practice, the European average for high speed rail modal shift is 15% from cars and 30% from planes. Furthermore, HS2’s forecasts do not include carbon-saving from increased use of local passenger rail, with HS2 freeing up lines such as the west coast mainline to provide better local services. Julia King, the deputy chair of the committee on climate change, reviewed HS2’s carbon forecasts for Tony Berkeley’s minority report on HS2 and judged them “sensible and conservative” – they do not include highly speculative future scenarios, such as HS2 leading to fewer new roads. If HS2 was well integrated with the European high speed network (and critics say it is not, because it does not connect to HS1) it could become part of a European-wide system saving up to 5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if all journeys under 1,000km moved to rail. Potential emissions Construction: • Huge quantities of steel and concrete including concrete slab-track • Moving construction materials to site • Tunnelling (more carbon-intensive than open-air construction) • Construction machines • Removing soil by truck • Manufacture of rolling stock • Journey to work of HS2 employees Operation: • Power source not guaranteed to be renewable. Speed of HS2 requires more power • Ongoing maintenance • Increased car journeys to HS2 stations • HS2’s better airport connections could increase flying • Domestic flights reduced by HS2 could lead to increase in international routes Potential savings • Increased rail capacity shifts freight from road to rail • Increased capacity leads to more local/regional rail journeys • Modal shift with travellers choosing rail over more carbon-emitting road • Travellers also switching from flying to high-speed rail • Carbon sequestration from tree-planting • HS2 could be powered by all-renewable energy • HS2 prevents other carbon-intensive infrastructure projects Sources: HS2 Limited, 2019, High Speed Two phase 2a, Informationa Paper, E27: carbon Friends of the Earth, Opportunity Costs of HS2, 2019 Lord Berkeley’s Dissenting Report, 2020 [Size of emissions not included because different scenarios give different estimates; figures have not been modelled for all these factors] But Lord Berkeley and other critics argue there are risks that HS2 could increase emissions. More people might drive to HS2 “parkway” stations. And by connecting airports more effectively in London, Birmingham and Manchester, HS2 could lead to an increase in flights. If HS2 cuts demand for domestic flights, says Friends of the Earth, that could simply encourage the aviation industry to switch domestic flight slots to more profitable, and carbon-intensive, international routes. HS2 could be made less carbon intensive. Critics such as Berkeley point out that if HS2 was not built to such a high specification (with top speeds supposedly in excess of continental high speed rail), emissions would be reduced both in operation and construction; it wouldn’t require carbon intensive concrete slab-track, for instance. An independent report by the rail consultants Greengauge in 2012 said HS2’s sustainability would be maximised by reducing its top speed, fully using freed-up capacity on the existing rail network, and creating city-centre stations rather than edge-of-town parkways. Supporters claim HS2’s plans for parkway stations are already morphing into “sustainable urban extensions” with high-density housing and tramways. Ultimately, HS2’s future emissions will depend on wider – and more joined-up – transport and energy policies. It would use less carbon if there was a decarbonisation of electricity supply (rather than another dash for gas), and coherent national policies to reduce car use and air travel.  Friends of the Earth and other critics highlight the “opportunity cost” of HS2: its £106bn price (at least £5bn a year for 20 years) will lead to less investment in more effective carbon-saving transport, such as regional rail, buses, cycling and walking. Berkeley concluded that electrifying existing railways would have a much greater environmental benefit. Friends of the Earth suggest an even less glamorous low-carbon option: making all UK buses free would cost £3bn a year.",2020-12-19T17:09:59.599191Z,1

The global meat industry not only damages our health and is ethically dubious – it is unsustainable because of the damage it does to the environmental prospects of our planet.   Yet politicians have little desire to do anything meaningful about it. Instead, they have a long history of ignoring or suppressing inconvenient evidence that is detrimental to the major industries of a free market economy.  But we need them to speak out. Back in 1722, when Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island in the south Pacific, they found a human population in terminal decline. The Rapa Nui people had deforested most of the island, and the variety of plant and fauna had considerably decreased.  Left alone for centuries, and without governmental legislation to protect the environment from human behaviours, the inhabitants of the island had been slowly committing ecocide against the terrain that sustained their very existence.  This historic example – and our current relationship with the environment – present interesting questions about human denial, idleness and avoidance within the individual and collective psyche. It also suggests that only compassionate authoritarianism, which holds that our ecosystem is more important than individual and collective egos, can prevent us from our current path towards global ecocide.  The meat industry is one of the largest political lobby groups across the world, providing financial support to many mainstream political parties and their candidates. Politicians, many of whom are meat eaters, stay clear. They likely conclude that confronting such a powerful interest group is not in their career (or meal time) interests.  The mainstream media also regularly falls short. Earlier this year, the BBC’s Today programme included an interview with a sheep farmer from Northumberland. It followed publication of a study which pointed to its detrimental impact on the environment. The interview was essentially the meat industry’s PR response – broadcast on Radio 4’s flagship news show.  In the programme, the farmer was referred to as a “shepherdess”, and her work described in terms of romantic walks on windswept moors. The discussion was emotional rather than rational, with the main argument of the interviewee being that if the meat industry was to decline it would be “very sad”.  She was then given a platform to make claims, without challenge, about what she thought were the main causes of environmental degradation (unsurprisingly, not the meat industry).  Such instances regarding environmental issues are unfortunately all too common. The Today programme could have (instead, or in addition) interviewed an independent academic on the matter. But it appears to have considered the opinion of a commercial sheep farmer to be at least on a par with the latest scientific evidence.  Indeed, my collaborator Rachael Hillyer and I have found that most politicians and mainstream media continue to place environmental concerns in a sphere of debate where industry interests are presented as having equal importance as the future of the planet.  This at a time when scientific evidence on the environmental effects of the meat industry, and how those effects can be reduced, has been compellingly presented. That this debate continues to sit in the sphere of “legitimate controversy” is a bit like having a debate in 2018 on whether smoking is detrimental to your health.  But then democracy has never been very good at tackling the global issue of environmental degradation. Instead politicians often go to great lengths to avoid the topic. When they do engage, they do so begrudgingly, putting all their rigour into a division of responsibility that excuses themselves to the greatest extent.    On the whole, democracies are dominated by chronic short term decision making. And while they often act as safeguards to individual human liberties, democracy, and its preference for compromise, are often part of the problem when it comes to the environment – the biggest issue of them all.  Politicians avoid the reality that only immediate alterations to human behaviour can prevent this crisis. Put simply, the planet urgently needs more compassion for the environment and much less individual ego. The weight of democratic political experience also sits heavy on the minds of politicians. Previous democratically elected leaders have tried to persuade their electorates to think more collectively and to consider the environment before their own selfish pleasures.  US President Jimmy Carter (1977 – 1981), for example, was a keen but moderate environmentalist. Despite his considerable personal wealth he led by example by living modestly, and tried to encourage Americans to lower their carbon footprint and energy consumption.  However, it turned out that America did not like being told to rein in their habits – and Carter was decisively beaten by Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Reagan’s neo-liberal campaign message was: “Make America great again.” Yes, the very same message used by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. It was a campaign which emphasised the primacy of the economy over the environment.  To this end, democracy cannot fix our environmental issues. Because for every democratically elected environmentally conscious politician in a leadership position, there is another one waiting in the wings to denounce and depose them for economic weaknesses. And in doing so, to relinquish the voters of their duty towards the upkeep of this planet.",2020-12-19T13:01:52.549739Z,1

As I’ve written several times, governments throughout the decades have taken advantage of wars and economic crises to expand their size, scope, and power. Bob Higgs wrote about “Crisis and Leviathan” long before Naomi Klein called it “The Shock Doctrine.”   
  
  
But the striking thing about the Obama administration is that they openly acknowledge that’s what they’re doing — using a crisis to ram through their entire policy agenda while people are in a state of panic. Projects like national health insurance, raising the price of energy, and subsidizing more schooling — the three prongs of President Obama’s speech to Congress — have nothing to do with solving the current economic crisis. But the administration is trying to push them all through as “stimulus” measures. And they keep proclaiming their strategy.

And this crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.” Then Joe Biden: “Opportunity presents itself in the middle of a crisis.” Not to mention Paul Krugman and Arianna Huffington. And now Hillary.

,2020-12-19T16:04:38.937174Z,620,120,,"On Tuesday the Supreme Court will hear arguments in _South Dakota v. Wayfair,_ which will force it to decide whether to end the ban on states charging sales taxes on goods sold via the internet from retailers without a nexus in the state. Should it effectively reverse a pair of previous Supreme Court decisions and permit states to do such a thing, it will constitute a significant change in our economy—but those changes won’t include rescuing embattled terrestrial retailers or filling states’ coffers with new tax revenue.



The main outcome will be slower economic growth.



The Supreme Court’s 1992 ruling in _Quill v. North Dakota_ imposed a prohibition on states taxing the sales of remote retailers that exists to this day. The Court found at the time that it was impossibly complex for a remote retailer to know or compute the sales tax owed in thousands of different jurisdictions, and determined that if a retailer had no operations–such as a store or warehouse—in a state, then it did not make sense for it to pay taxes on sales made in that state.



The timing of the _Quill_ case proved to be propitious: Less than two years after its decision Jeff Bezos introduced Amazon to the world. Today, of course, internet retail is enormous, and many of the terrestrial retailers that are struggling these days blame the company for their woes.





The Supreme Court will decide whether to end the ban on states charging sales taxes on goods sold via the internet from retailers without a nexus in the state.



The states have been enthusiastic in having the court—or Congress—end that ban as well: They have blamed the expansion of internet retail for everything from their budget woes to climate change.



However, the notion that states will reap a revenue bonanza by taxing remote retailers is as dubious as the Glengarry leads. Every estimate that has previously been made of the revenue to be gained from such a tax vastly overstated reality, simply because most sales on the internet are already taxed (roughly two thirds, according to a recent study) and internet sales still comprise a small fraction of all retail sales—roughly 11 percent in 2016.



The Government Accountability Office estimates that ending _Quill_ would raise an additional $8 to $13 billion for the states, or roughly 1–2 percent of the $700 billion of revenue the states anticipate collecting in 2018. Or, put in a different context, it roughly amounts to Walmart’s annual tax bill.



And that revenue comes at a significant opportunity cost to the economy. A plethora of research over the last two decades has found that it has been the hyper‐​competitive retail economy of the U.S. that has driven much of the productivity gains that the country has achieved since the mid‐​1990s. Both Walmart and–next–Amazon have ruthlessly pursued methods to reduce costs and increase worker productivity, and they have forced their suppliers to follow suit.



Productivity growth is important because it ultimately determines a nation’s standard of living, economists believe, and the retail sector plays an outsized role in its determination. William Lewis, the founding director of the McKinsey Global Institute, and former Obama CEA chair Jason Furman have both concluded that the nation’s competitive retail sector distinguished us from most other developed countries, and that this is an important reason–if not _the_ main reason–that we have had greater productivity growth the last three or four decades.



Right now, Amazon is winning that productivity race hands down–its sales per employee exceeds $100,000, or twice that of Walmart. It is likely that as Amazon expands its terrestrial offerings and Walmart beefs up its online presence that this gap will shrink, but no one thinks it will disappear anytime soon.



If Amazon can withstand any competitive threat from Walmart, Target, or other big‐​box retail stores, then who _is_ the next retailer who has a chance of beating it at its own game? We can safely venture that it will originate as an internet retailer, much like Amazon did.



However, taxing remote retail constitutes a barrier to future internet retail startups. Amazon undoubtedly benefited in its early years from not having to pay sales taxes in most states when it was competing remotely from a relatively small number of distribution centers and faced more difficult shipping and return logistics, and that ultimately came to benefit consumers–that advantage helped Amazon to hasten the internet marketplace.



Today, Amazon now has a presence in all fifty states in the form of its logistics network and therefore pays sales taxes in each state that has one—to provide the level of service it feels compelled to offer in order to compete against Walmart and Target it has to have warehouses and stores and pickup facilities near its customers.



The retail sector of the economy has, of course, changed dramatically in the last quarter century and in ways that no one anticipated then, or even a decade later. Until the last decade or so retailers were, generally, either solely remote retailers or else sold their wares only via their stores. Today, almost all retail sales are completed by an entity that is an omnichannel retailer, with both an internet presence as well as one or more physical stores.



The notion—implicit in the plaintiffs’ argument—that there are distinct internet and distinct non‐​internet retailers does not at all reflect the reality today. Most existing internet‐​only retailers are small mom and pop businesses selling goods that aren’t readily found elsewhere–a chia pet in the shape of Jerry Garcia’s beard or vintage Buffalo Braves shirts, for instance. A sales tax on these operators reduces the breadth of goods available to consumers without increasing demand for anything from their terrestrial “competitors.”



And for all of the bluster and talk of Amazon acting like a monopoly, it is worth remembering that its annual sales are only one third that of Walmart and behind CVS as well, and it is unclear whether its retail operations—which it doesn’t break out from its other operations—have ever turned a profit for the company; its most lucrative division appears to be its cloud services.



The history of retail shows that a company can dominate the field for only a short period of time. Before Walmart and Amazon there was Sears, Kmart, JC Penney, Montgomery Ward, and Woolworths, each of which innovated the retail environment in some way and became the top dog in the market before being supplanted by a competitor. Today, these companies are defunct or nearly so.



It is a history that Bezos is keenly aware of: He constantly refers to his company being at Day One of its history, explaining that his goal is to forever maintain that same competitive culture so that it can resist the new competitors that will inevitably arise. It is a noble goal but an impossible one.



But one way Bezos can put off its future rivals is to make it more difficult for small companies to grow—and imposing a retail sales tax on even the smallest remote retailer presents a significant barrier for retail start ups. That is undoubtedly the reason why Amazon now _advocates_ for a sales tax on all internet retail.



Imposing an internet sales tax on remote sales won’t make us like France, which carefully circumscribes the retailers’ hours, prices, number of sales, and other behaviors in order to keep at bay the nonexistent bogeyman of unfair competition, but it’s a step in that direction.



State governments with a fiscal problem—and there are many, despite the fact that we are in the ninth year of an economic expansion and unemployment rates are nearing record lows—agitate for the right to tax out of state retailers because they need to place blame somewhere besides their profligacy and inability to coherently govern. Taxing out‐​of‐​state retail sales won’t fix anything–and it will hurt the economy to boot.



Despite the ancient principle of _stare decisis_ , the betting seems to be that this court will indeed rule with the plaintiffs and effectively overturn _Quill._ If so, the U.S. economy would be worse off for it in the long run.",2020-12-19T16:04:38.937207Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:16:51.682581Z,622,119,,"With their own sense of dark irony, the bushfires that have ravaged much of Australia over summer are now closing in on Canberra – just as our leaders prepare to return to the capital to put the nation back together. The profound human cost of lives lost, sacrifices made, wildlife destroyed and dreams shattered has moved the nation, the work of the volunteer firefighters tapping a spirit of mutuality and civic-mindedness that we thought we’d lost. The economic cost of the fires is still being reckoned: from insurance to tourism to ruined local economies, the numbers guys are starting to draft their response to Bill Shorten’s unanswered pre-election question: what is the cost of climate inaction? But what is less clear is the political impact the fires will have on climate policy.  Here are a few things we do know. The prime minister has taken a serious hit to his personal authority for his dereliction of duty before, during and since the fires. He limps back to parliament a diminished leader, facing twin crises of a looming pandemic and an orchestrated vote-buying scandal.  Yet as I pointed out last month, the PM is holding on to his base, aided and abetted by those who create a parallel universe where the fires are the work of greenies and arsonists and nothing the experts say will convince them differently. Despite these determined efforts to gaslight the debate, there is a sense that the summer carnage will shift the needle on climate change and our global laggard of a government will be compelled into more meaningful action. To understand the moment we find ourselves in, I’ll defer to a construct that political scientists use to model how political activism can deliver meaningful policy change: the Overton window.  The Overton window of political possibilities holds that for every issue, there are range of policy responses that sit on a spectrum from radical to sensible and back to radical. As a rule, support for these policy options will follow a bell curve: policies seen as sensible will also be the most popular. When a policy is seen as sensible and popular, it will offer a window for political action. In a static world this would hardly be a revelation – indeed it would be a recipe for both incrementalism and stasis. Except there’s a twist: the Overton window moves over time, influenced by public activism, policy advocacy and external events. That was the idea first laid down by Joseph Overton, head of a libertarian Michigan thinktank in the mid-1990s when trying to articulate a plan to deregulate education in that state. Rather than championing radical, unpopular ideas direct to legislators, he urged the long game, advocating instead to extend the window of what was acceptable, and only when it was in your zone would you pounce through it. Overton died in a plane crash a few years later and never lived to see the malign impact of his theory, but its thinking has driven the right’s success for more than three decades, from mainstreaming market deregulation to marginalising healthcare reform. The left has been less inclined to adopt the window, too often pushing for policy purity rather than the long game of moving the policy spectrum, although the successful campaign for marriage equality is a great example of how this type of fenestration can work. Indeed, the failure of the 2019 election campaign can be explained in part by Labor’s failure to situate their policies within this framework. Instead of demanding policy be set within the Overton zone, Labor presented a patchwork of radical deals without the necessary ballast to make them viable. So is there an Overton climate window? And if so, have the bushfires extended it? We have known for many years that there is passive support for climate action. Our benchmark polls show about 60% of Australians accept climate change is real and a similar number believe the government is not doing enough.  The problem has been when concrete policies have become contested: support for market mechanisms, when compared to the perceived costs in jobs and prices, left the Overton window shut. There has also been consistent support for renewable energy, but the cashed-up efforts from the fossil fuel lobby and their ties to media and government have provided an effective counterpoint to seriously scaling the industry in Australia. But as results in this week’s Essential Report suggest, now there is overwhelming support for concrete action to back renewables and increase targets, while a number of policies that have sat on the fringes of the debate now have majority support. On first blush these are strong numbers for comprehensive climate action, but I would lay down a couple of caveats before we break any glass. First, while the combined support for measures looks strong, only the accelerated development of renewable energy has more passionate supporters than passive. Additionally, by choosing not to offer the chance to give a “no response”, we were forcing a choice on the issue, rather than allowing a shrug of the shoulders. This in itself is an element of the political challenge. Other points worth contemplating are that longer-term options are more popular than shorter-term targets (compare the 2030 and 2050 targets), while proposals for the government to actually ban new coal mines garner much stronger opposition. Based on these findings, the Overton window then would be open around aggressive support for renewables and long-term emissions targets, perhaps with some specific measures to ensure mining companies contribute to the cost of fires. This is reinforced when you look at support for measures via voting intention, where a majority of conservative voters appear to be within the edges of the window. They are right on board with renewables, and while there is majority support for the next layer issues, that support slips below majority once targets become more ambitious and government action more punitive. The idea of pushing for centrist, reasonable and sensible policies may chafe when the world is on the brink. It does not dispel the need to campaign hard at the margins – climate rebellions and school strikes are essential to shifting the window to make other policy change possible. But the risk is to confuse the movement with the moment. If political change is the answer and Australia can’t wait until 2022, then locating the Overton window and finding a way through it now seems the only viable way forward. • Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company",2020-12-19T16:16:51.682614Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:48:08.525084Z,623,119,,"At the southern tip of the Maldives, on the tiny island of Villingili, a patch of ground rises to tower a whole 2.4m above the sea. It’s the world’s lowest high point.  With most islands just a metre or so above the sea level, it is often suggested that the world’s lowest country may drown beneath rising sea levels by the end of the century. For tourists, this ranks the Maldives atop bucket lists of destinations to visit before they disappear. For the 400,000 people who live on the islands, things are rather more serious: rising sea levels could render them climate change refugees.  However, such scenarios of inundation and drowning assume that the land surface remains static and unchanged. But, what if the land could build vertically as sea level rises?  This is what colleagues and I have been examining in our research, now published in Geophysical Research Letters. We studied five reef islands in the southern Maldives and found that they were actually built when sea levels were higher than they are today. The Maldives is a nation of around 1,200 coral reef islands. Reef islands are unique landforms in that they are formed entirely of sediments produced by organisms such as corals, molluscs and gastropods that live on coral reefs in the surrounding waters.  However, this reliance on the coral reef for island-building sediments, combined with elevations rarely more than a few metres above the sea, means that reef islands are often considered among the most vulnerable environments to climate change, particularly to sea level rise. This is of particular concern for nations such as the Maldives that are built entirely on reef islands, and have nowhere else to go.

 To improve predictions of how reef islands may respond to future environmental change, it is important to understand how they responded to environmental change in the past. To this end, we reconstructed the island-building histories of five islands in the southern Maldives. We first collected 28 reef island “cores”. This essentially involved sledgehammering an aluminium pipe into the reef island until it reached the island “foundations” – a point lower than the live coral in the surrounding ocean. The cores enabled us to access the layers of sediment that have built up throughout the island’s history. We then analysed these sediments under the microscope to find out what exactly the island is made of. In addition, we radiocarbon dated the sediments to determine the when the various layers were created. Results showed that the key phase of reef island building occurred between 4,200 and 1,600 years ago, when sea levels reached around 0.5m higher than they are today.  In addition, this was likely under the influence of large wave events caused by distant storms. These waves would have had the power to break pieces of coral off the reef. Over time, these pieces of coral, as well as sand from the the reef, built up to form the islands. Climate change will mean rising sea levels and even stronger large wave events. It may therefore recreate conditions that are conducive to reef island building, which may enable these islands to keep growing vertically.  This would make the islands more resilient and may even be necessary simply to keep pace with rising sea levels. Our work complements other studies which are showing that islands are in fact dynamic landforms that are able to move and adjust in response to environmental change. All this should make reef islands in the Maldives more physically resilient. However, large waves can also make islands less habitable for humans, for instance by damaging buildings and farmland, or by dumping salt into supplies of fresh water. Reef island nations will have to develop infrastructure that can withstand, or be adaptable to, such powerful waves. Such infrastructure must still allow natural processes to take place however, so that reef islands can maintain active connections to their surrounding coral reefs. While our study suggests that rising sea levels could benefit reef islands in some regards, they still remain at risk. For instance, we also found the islands in our study were made predominantly (about 75%) of coral. This means a healthy reef will be vital if the islands are to keep growing in future, and the Maldives are to remain above the waves. However, coral reefs are also threatened by climate change, not just by rising sea levels, but also by warmer and more acidic oceans. Under climate change, we may therefore end up in an odd situation where we have the perfect conditions to build coral reef islands, but an absence of any building materials.",2020-12-19T15:48:08.525119Z,1

Some of them, including a musicologist, are of questionable scientific disciplines.

In spring 2020, six members of Die Junge Akademie from the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina from a range of disciplines – departed on “Expedition Anthropocene”.
“One of the focal points of the expedition,” the website says, “is climate change and its consequences for the environment as well as the transition of a region over the past 200 years.”
“In this, humans are consistently viewed as the instigators, those affected and the observers of these events.”
Lots of hiking
Their research took them to Ecuador and the volcanic mountain Chimborazo. Due to its location close to the equator, the summit of Chimborazo is the highest point on the planet when measured from the Earth’s center.
Impacts from “advancing climate change”
According to the six German researchers, “Together with our local partners, we go in search of traces of human activity in this environment” by using “methods from glaciology, biology, chemistry, acoustic ecology, computer science and medicine, we will investigate the human impact on Chimborazo at different altitudes – from advancing climate change and its consequences for humans, glacial retreat and biodiversity, to acoustic ecological changes and the question of whether microplastics can be detected in the snow and ice.”

A junket disguised as science?
But already some are criticizing the expedition. Not only because of the carbon footprint the long travel and extensive accommodation, but because of it has the appearance of a junket disguised as a scientific expedition.
“The first stop on our expedition is Quito, the capital of Ecuador and the world’s highest capital city. We will spend a few days in the city to give ourselves time to acclimatize to the altitude, and set out from here on our first day trips,” the site explains.

Locations to be studied by among others,  a musicology professor. Chart source: Expedition Anthropocene.
The team were planned to hike to the active volcano Pichincha and the inactive volcano Chimborazo – the highest point above Earth’s center – as well as to the Ambato and the Llanganates National Park where they would “spend a few days in a complementary vegetation zone to the mountainous regions of the Andes.”
Not a single climate-related scientist – one musicologist
Of course long hikes to sites are all part of many expeditions and thus perfectly legitimate. But controversy swirls concerning the background of members of the German team.
Many have nothing or little to do with climate science. German science site Die kalte Sonne here noted: “No single geologist, geographer or glaciologist is involved. Instead there is a musicologist, a medical doctor (okay, maybe because of the altitude), a computer scientist and (EVEN!!) a physicist. The physicist comes from the PIK!”
“Six young people simply claimed that they would study the consequences of climate change and without further ado they jetted off to Ecuador. A nice example of a real-life satire: young up-and-coming artists (some of them really artists) are “researching” climate change in South America in Humboldt’s footsteps,” Die kalte Sonne writes.

,2020-12-19T16:16:59.213889Z,628,119,,"It is widely agreed that today’s global agriculture system is a social and environmental failure. Business as usual is no longer an option: biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution are exceeding planetary limits, and catastrophic risks of climate change demand immediate action. Most concede that there is an urgent need to radically transform our food systems. But the proposed innovations for more sustainable food systems are drastically different. Which we choose will have long-lasting effects on human society and the planet. Suggested innovations in food systems can be broadly understood as either seeking to conform with – or to transform – the status quo.  Some want to keep the agriculture industry as close to existing practices as possible. This is true of the increasing number of corporate and financial actors who seek to solve the food crisis by developing new technologies. These technologies are envisaged as being part of what is being called the “fourth industrial revolution” (4IR). The “answer” here is thought to lie in a fusion of technologies that blurs the lines between physical, digital and biological domains. For example, the World Economic Forum is currently supporting agricultural transitions in 21 countries through its “New Vision for Agriculture” initiative. This initiative supports “innovation ecosystems” to re-engineer food systems based on “12 transforming technologies”. In this imagined future, next generation biotechnologies will re-engineer plants and animals. Precision farming will optimise use of water and pesticides. Global food systems will rely on smart robots, blockchain and the internet of things to manufacture synthetic foods for personalised nutrition. Like previous green revolution technologies in agriculture, this effort is designed by and for powerful agricultural giants. These technological innovations reinforce the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of a small number of corporations. Indeed, the latter have a growing monopoly control over the “12 transforming technologies” protected by patents. Most notably, the spread of these technologies will expand the technosphere at the expense of the biosphere. Flying robots will pollinate crops instead of living bees. Automated machines will replace farmers’ work on soil preparation, seeding, weeding, fertility, pest control and harvesting of crops.  These hi-tech innovations radically depart from most farming practices. They are moving us towards an increasingly people-less food system. Yet they show a remarkable continuity with the logic of capitalist accumulation – hence their staying power despite their significant risks. The spread of automated, de-localised and digitalised production and commercialisation of food is part of the “financialisation” of the global food system. Financial markets play an increasing role in controlling food systems from a distance. This generates huge social and human risks. For example, the significant growth in the sale and purchase of financial products linked to food commodities was one of the determining factors in the 2008 world food crisis. But there is an alternative to this future. Agroecology involves the application of ecological principles for the design and management of sustainable agroecosystems. Our research on agroecology focuses on how it can contribute to food sovereignty, which emphasises the democratisation of food systems. Agroecology’s contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals is now recognised. In contrast to the technological vision described above, agroecological innovations promote circular systems that involve recycling, reuse and combining resources to reduce dependency on external inputs, in particular fossil fuels. They mimic natural cycles and the functional diversity of natural ecosystems.  Farming systems are designed in a way that is based on beneficial interactions between plants, animals and environments. Trees and shrubs might be planted amongst or around crops, say. Or two or more crops might be grown in proximity. Agroecology reduces the dependence of food producers on expensive external inputs, distant commodity markets and patented technologies. This is achieved by relying on appropriate biodiversity to ward off pests and increase farm yields. At broader scales, agroecology involves circular systems that combine food and energy production with water and waste management. Pollution is minimised and synergies achieved by carefully clustering industries into functional wholes. The re-localisation of production and consumption within territories enhances local economic regeneration and sustainability.  Agroecological innovations in transitions to sustainable food systems are being driven largely from the bottom up by civil society, social movements and allied researchers. In this context, priorities for innovations are ones that increase citizen control for food sovereignty and decentralise power. This is in direct contrast to the monopoly control enabled by 4IR technologies. Government, civil society and private sector representatives will soon meet in Rome at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization to discuss the future of farming. Who controls the global governance of innovation will be a hotly debated topic. But given these highly contested views on innovations for food and agriculture, it is vital that everyone is able to exercise their right to have a say on the future of their food supply. Deliberative and inclusive processes such as citizens’ juries, peoples’ assemblies and community-led participatory processes are urgently needed to decide priorities for food and agricultural innovations. This is all the more important in today’s context of rapid global change and uncertainty.  So. Do you want to live in a world in which artificial food is produced by intelligent robots and corporations that put profits before people? Or one where agroecological innovations ensure we can nourish ourselves and our communities in a fair, ecologically regenerative, and culturally rich way?",2020-12-19T16:16:59.213922Z,1

The online German national daily Die Welt here writes, “Virologists and physicians fear for their freedom of expression in the Corona crisis.” Climate scientists are getting some company!
Scientific freedom “under threat”
Citing the results of a recent survey, to Die Welt reports “many experts believe that freedom of expression in science is under threat” and “virologists have begun to change their attitude towards the measures taken by the German government.”
As the economy reels from the stringent restrictions enacted by authorities across Europe, the discussion about how to respond to the spread of the virus has become bitter. Public health experts opposing the restrictions and lock downs have found themselves marginalized and attacked by the media, other virologists and most politicians.

Shift: COVID-19 alarmism waning, frustration growing
Using a survey, “Researchers at the University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg (UKE), the Society for Virology (GfV) and the University of Tübingen have tried to determine the mood among experts,” Die Welt reports. “178 experts from the fields of virology, immunology, hygiene, internal medicine and intensive care medicine” were surveyed anonymously. The results show that “more than more than 70 percent of the participants support the distance rule of two metres and the prohibition of major events” but that the other restrictions were “far more controversial”.
One third feel freedom in science is “being threatened”
What’s surprising: “One third even see freedom of expression in science as being threatened” and today 63 percent think “it would be sensible to restore public and economic life”. Also: “social distancing” is apparently losing support, according to the survey.
Overall, the findings show that the pandemic skeptics are finally beginning to assert their views to the public.
Unfortunately this is not even close to happening in climate science, where in Germany the ultra-alarmists continue to control the message. That freedom to express science is under threat, “is probably what many climate scientists secretly think,” Die kalte Sonne site here commented.
Perhaps COVID-19 tells us how moods can change quickly once restrictions start eroding freedom and prosperity.

In contrast, transitions from croplands and urban centers to forests leads to cooling. Europe has been cooling recently (1992-2015) from land cover transitions to forests.

Urbanization adds multiple degrees of warming over decades
A few years ago a compelling analysis (Levermore et al., 2018) found the urban heat island effect can reach intensities of 8°C warmer temperatures than nearby rural sites.
Further, reducing the green (trees and vegetated areas) in an urban center by as little as 11% can lead to a 0.21°C per decade (non-climatic) warming trend in the local thermometer record.

Global warming can be reversed via land cover changes
While forest losses can heat up local temperatures by as much as 1°C within 10 years (Alkama and Cescatti, 2016), a new study (Huang et al., 2020) has assessed the opposite can occur too.
From 1992 to 2015, there were about 70 million hectares (Mha) of land cover changes (LCCs) occurring across the European continent.
A substantial portion of these LCCs were “cropland-to-forest” transitions due to agricultural abandonment.

When a region returns to forest and tree cover, cooling ensues.
And with a growing percentage of European forested areas returning, a “predominant regional biophysical cooling” with “an average temperature change of −0.12 ± 0.20 °C, with widespread cooling (up to −1.0 °C) in western and central Europe in summer and spring” has swept across Europe due to LCCs in recent decades.

Image Source: Huang et al., 2020
The substantial impact of land cover changes
The implications of this study are profound.
First, the human effect on CO2 concentration changes appears to have minimal effect on local and regional temperatures relative to the much larger impact from land use changes.
More importantly, if reducing global warming is indeed the goal of policy makers, then denuding forests so as to install hundreds of steel-and-concrete wind turbines would appear to achieve the opposite of what it is claimed to do (reduce warming).
So why on Earth are we doing this?

,2020-12-22T13:27:14.656894Z,634,119,,"A group of more than 200 scientists will on Monday urge returning parliamentarians to urgently reduce Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and work diplomatically to achieve coordinated global climate action, after a catastrophic summer of fires. In an open letter timed to coincide with the resumption of the parliamentary year in Canberra, the group says scientific evidence unequivocally links human-caused climate change to the increasing risk of frequent and severe bushfires in the Australian landscape.  It says that same science tells us “these extreme events will only grow worse in the future without genuine concerted action to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases”. The letter says the science suggests a need for immediate action to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, and manage a rapid transition to net zero emissions by 2050. One of the signatories to the open letter, the Australian National University climate scientist Nerilie Abram, says the letter is “the product of despair as scientists witnessed the deadly fire season unfold”. “Scientists have been warning policymakers for decades that climate change would worsen Australia’s fire risk, and yet those warnings have been ignored,” she said. Given the catastrophic summer, with the bushfires triggering a barrage of commentary about the inadequacy of the Morrison government’s current policy, a number of Liberal MPs are returning to Canberra for the opening session parliament with the view that the government needs to do more on climate change and energy policy. Cabinet has also discussed the issue. The strongly worded appeal by scientists comes as a new energy market analysis by Reputex predicts Australia will hit 50% renewable electricity by 2030, despite the lack of a federal energy policy. But it also warns a slump in new investment in wind and solar investment could threaten a continued decline in wholesale electricity prices. Reputex says the current drive to 50% renewables by 2030 is being driven by state renewable energy targets and rooftop solar schemes that are predicted to make higher cost gas and coal-fired power less competitive. It says that transition is expected to deliver a decline in wholesale prices in the national energy market from around $80 per megawatt-hour (/MWh) in 2020 toward $70/MWh over the next three years, which translates as a fall of 15% from today’s levels. But it warns investment in renewable energy plunged by 50% last year compared with the year before, and it predicts that decline will continue – a development that will put upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, particularly as major coal-fired facilities begin to close. “In the absence of an effective policy framework to guide new investment, the decline of our ageing generation fleet will lead to higher electricity prices before the new supply is developed, hurting both businesses and consumers,” the assessment says. In an effort to emphasise a positive message on the issue, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the ABC on Sunday the Morrison government’s 2030 emissions reduction target of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 was a floor and not a cap, “and we hope to beat our target”. But while declaring the government wanted to beat the 2030 target, Frydenberg said the target wasn’t going to be adjusted. “We took to the Australian people a very clear target, so we’re not about to lift that target,” the treasurer said. “What we are endeavouring to do is to meet our commitments now.” Frydenberg did not mention that the government intends to use an accounting measure, carryover credits from the Kyoto period, to meet the 2030 target, with carryover credits, not practical abatement, supplying about half the pollution reduction load to 2030. The treasurer also played up the government’s commitment to renewable energy. Frydenberg said on Sunday that more than $7bn was invested in renewables last year. He omitted the Coalition’s efforts under Tony Abbott to gut the renewable energy target (RET), and the fact the RET winds down from this year – with policy uncertainty triggering the decline in new investment captured in the Reputex analysis. Asked whether he believed there was now a climate emergency, the treasurer hedged. “Climate change is a significant challenge, a global challenge that needs a global solution,” he said. “We’re doing our bit and we’re also working on the international stage.” Pressed to explain how climate change was not an emergency, Frydenberg said “it’s an important issue, but as the prime minister has outlined, there are a lot of things that we can do with mitigation and adaptation to try to reduce the impact of climate change on the Australian community”.",2020-12-22T13:27:14.656924Z,1

German left-wing activist, former FFF participant Tom Radke quits movement after experiencing its inner working. Image cropped from Tom Radke.de.
In a statement published at his site, Tom Radke wrote he wishes “to concentrate on left-wing patriotic politics: environmental protection, a strong welfare state and peace” instead of “Green voters and ‘green’ corporations”.
FFF not about the environment
Radke writes how he “found out through very negative practical experiences with Fridays for Future that many people never cared about environmental protection” and that he “misjudged the other ‘climate activists”.
He wrote: “Of all activists at FFF Hamburg, only a few were really interested in preserving our environment, clean air and healthy food.”
Radke blasts the FFF leader “Longhaul Luisa” Neubauer who he believes was “obviously in it for a career” and “her luxury life” while she called on others to save money.

Radke also had the impression that FFF movement leader Greta Thunberg was “being taken advantage of by her family but that she was “personally a nice person”.
Climate science “largely manipulation and fraud”
He recognized “the nonsensical and anti-people content of the climate movement” and that the movement’s “climate science is largely manipulation and fraud”.
Movement based on “pure emotions and blind faith”
Radke also explains how he came to realize that the FFF activists in fact had very little knowledge about climate science itself and that “their fanaticism is largely based on pure emotions and blind faith” and “also based on fear-mongering”.
“The young people are told that they, their families and everyone they love will die if we don’t act immediately.”
“Leaving the cult”
Radke accuses the German Green Party Using “a lot of psychological pressure” to coerce donations from followers despite the fact that “there are major donors in the background, who are completely unknown to the ordinary members.”
Radke also writes that the FFF movement “has nothing to to do with real environmental protection” and that “the CO2-tax serves to squeeze even more out of ordinary people.
He summarizes his departure as follows: “I feel a little like a person who is leaving the cult. It is a liberating feeling. Through my experience I will try to help other students to leave FFF and the climate religion.”

(Text translated and summarized by P. Gosselin)
Manufacturer “Streetscooter”, purchased by Deutsche Post (German Post) in 2014, will be scrapped. The German media of course blame it on “bad management” by the large company.
Which city dweller doesn’t know the small, yellow electric scooters of the German post office that the postmen and women deliver letters and small packages to citizens comfortably and efficiently? Not long ago I received news via Facebook on how the e-delivery-vehicles just barely made it back to the post office, especially in winter, and only when the heating is off.
Now the management of the Swiss Post is also following suit and ending the experiment with delivery street scooters.
The company used to be a small startup, a young dynamic private company in a “sexy” field – just like artificial intelligence or climate protection technology. Deutsche Post bought the company with the benevolent support of the eco-loving press and used it to polish up its otherwise staid image a bit.
However, any PR coup based on electro-chemistry ultimately has to prove itself in everyday life over years. The post office scooters obviously couldn’t. Pushing an electric vehicle still loaded with letters back to the local depot when the battery is empty is not possible: the scooter is too big and heavy for that. Or you have to plan shorter routes (in winter), which reduces efficiency. Since letters are only delivered during the day, the scooters can be conveniently charged at night. But if you have to reload during working hours, it takes hours, and you don’t have the time for that.
Berlin e-bus failure

Take, for example, the Berlin E-bus experiment: the lithium buses run from 8 to 12 a.m., then the diesel vehicles take over. Our speaker Prof. Alt talks in this context about a double infrastructure, which is of course also roughly twice as expensive. Presumably Deutsche Post had to manage a similarly inefficient double fleet of about 13,000 street scooters. The scooters broke down more often and then soon had to be repaired, and replaced by diesel-powered delivery vans.
A commentator from ntv television, however, blames it on the slow management of Deutsche Post: A project like an electric fleet of electric cars has to be run by flexible start-up managers with heart and attitude, then it would work.
The Streetscooter deserved a dynamic, creative and risk-taking management – and the opportunity to obtain the necessary funds independently on the capital market.”
This claim is not convincing. Whether it’s a startup or the Deutsche Post, both must adhere to the main laws of physics and economics. One thing must never be forgotten: Deutsche Post is a business group that has to make money.
The city administration of Berlin, on the other hand, can waste money at will with misguided planning. They work with funds from taxes levied by force. And Berlin’s eco-socialist politicians, who are poor in arithmetic, are elected and are not held accountable for their failures with their own private assets.
Of course some will claim that Tesla has achieved what the N-TV quote above calls for. But this is not true: Elon Musk is an eco-media darling who has already received billions of dollars in US subsidies. Without these billions he would have long since gone bankrupt or become a mini-manufacturer for a niche.
We Germans are now experiencing the same thing in Brandenburg: because Merkel’s “grand coalition” wants to have a share in the media sexiness of Tesla, the “Gigafactory” is being heavily subsidized there.
The fact that an entire forest is being cut down and cheaper Polish workers have to be hired is of no consequence to someone like Federal Economics Minister Peter Altmaier. The press as well.

,2020-12-19T16:11:52.838075Z,639,120,,"This is an article from Head to Head, a series in which academics from different disciplines chew over current debates. Let us know what else you’d like covered – all questions are welcome. Details of how to contact us are at the end of the article. Sharon George: Plastics are ingrained in our everyday lives. Since 1950, it’s estimated that we have produced billions of tonnes of plastic, and most of this is not recycled. Plastics have spread around the world through oceans, rivers and the air to every part of the planet. In rivers and oceans, plastic moves vast distances and is now found right through the water column of the oceans, from the surface to the deepest trenches. We don’t yet know how long this material will prevail in these environments but it will certainly be longer than the lifespan of the person who used it. And it’s accumulating. This impact, like rising CO₂ levels, is man-made. No amount of recycling schemes and ocean clean-ups are going to totally remove the mark that we have left. Plastics are a scar that will hopefully warn future generations of the folly of unsustainable over-consumption. Matt Edgeworth: As well as spreading through air, rivers and ocean currents, plastics are finding their way into soils, landfills and deep ocean sediments. As such, they are infiltrating into strata – layers of rock and mud in the ground – thus becoming part of the archaeological and geological records. They are not only to be found in surface environments, where they are highly visible, but are getting into subsurface layers too.  In some of these buried environments, plastic objects stand a good chance of being fossilised – a process whereby the hard material may decay or dissolve, but its exterior form survives as a mould which then gets filled with other minerals and becomes a cast of the original object. In this way, familiar forms of commonplace plastic items such as drinking straws may survive as traces in the ground not just for a few hundred, but for millions of years. SG: Polymers from natural materials were used by people as early as 1200BC, when the Olmec people used latex and vine extract to create rubber. In the 1840s, sulphur was used to vulcanise rubber, stabilising it and making tyre production possible. A closely-related material, gutta-percha, is a natural latex. This early thermoplastic was used from the mid-1800s, enabling telegraph wires to be laid at the bottom of the sea and electrical wires to be insulated. Other natural polymers resembling modern plastic were developed from cellulose, a natural polymer found in wood. The first, parkesine, was developed to produce celluloid in 1870, a medium for cinema film. But it was during the 20th century that plastics really took off. In 1907, Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic plastic, bakelite, from fossil fuel-based chemicals. These revolutionary plastics were easy to mould and could be quickly mass produced. These materials were popular, cheap and built to last. The pace of development increased and by 1935 other polymers, such as polystyrene, polyester, PVC, polythene and nylon were all being manufactured from fossil fuels. ME: That’s an excellent historical summary of plastics as a modern material. But as an archaeologist, I see the development of plastics as part of a much longer and broader set of technological trends, extending back over the last 20,000 years or so to the first appearance of “novel materials” in strata.  Novel materials are characterised by their geological novelty, being unprecedented in earlier deposits. Made by humans rather than by natural process, they are entirely new in the four-and-a-half-billion-year history of the Earth. Ceramics appeared first – then bricks and tiles, glass, metal alloys, concrete, paper and so on. Look in any rubbish dump today and you will find all these novel materials and more in the profusion of items thrown away.  Plastics may be a relatively new development, but they are part of this trend towards greater diversification of humanly manufactured materials, all of which eventually find their way into the ground. SG: Despite their relative novelty and permanence, we continue to produce and pour plastics into the environment. Today it is thought that around 80% of the 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic ever made is still somewhere out there. ME: A large proportion of plastic waste is being dumped in landfill, where it remains “out of sight, out of mind”. What we see in the oceans is only the more visible tip of a largely invisible iceberg. Let me give an example. Close to my home in south Bedfordshire are a series of landfilled quarries, now low artificial hills. The old clay pits, some of them over a kilometre wide and up to 55m deep, made convenient receptacles for landfill waste from London and other nearby cities and towns from the 1980s on. Even when the pits were full to the brim, more landfill was mounded up to form hills.  If you stand on top of the highest of these newly created hills, where the former quarry was deepest, over 65m of compacted landfill lies directly beneath your feet. In landfills of similar age in the USA, the proportion of plastic was found to be 20-24% by volume when sorted, reducing to about 16% by volume when compacted in the ground. Assuming the same proportion of plastic at this location, that would be the equivalent of a layer of plastic 10m thick.  Meanwhile, landfill material by no means always stays where it has been deposited. For example, many thousands of landfills are situated in lowland situations and therefore at risk from marine incursion, especially in view of anticipated sea-level rise due to climate change. Coastal erosion, river flooding and tsunamis can decimate landfills, leaving the heavier material where it is but taking the lighter and more mobile material such as plastic away. A significant proportion of plastic currently in the oceans derives from inundated landfills. SG: Once plastic escapes from landfill it will continue to degrade into smaller fragments. It can be ingested by creatures like birds and fish and get into drinking water. Microplastics and nanoparticles are already showing up in our food chain and tapwater.  The risks to human health of ingestion of nanoplastics is not fully known. But with rising numbers, our exposure is bound to increase and people reliant on fishing from highly polluted regions will be more exposed. The pollution is wreaking havoc on wildlife, with animals being entangled or ingesting the plastic. Around 90% of seabirds have ingested plastic. We are adding around 8m tonnes of waste every year to the ocean and unless this stream of waste is cut off, the problem is going to get much worse. ME: But with all the focus today on the harm caused by plastics in rivers and oceans, is there not a danger that putting plastic waste into landfill might be seen as a less controversial alternative? In conveniently burying it out of sight, often oblivious to the fact that it might get released back into the wider environment at a later date, are we just storing up problems for future generations? Should we not be focusing on the dangers of disposal of plastics in earth as well as in water? SG: Yes, we should be focusing on the dangers of plastic disposal in earth as well as in water. I think there is a real danger that people could assume that locking it in landfill means it will stay put until it finally degrades. ME: It is generally assumed that plastics will decay in just a few hundred years or less, but more scientific research needs to be undertaken on this crucial point. It seems likely that plastic in the ocean will break down relatively quickly into microparticles, to be ingested into the food chain or otherwise to sink into the sediment on the ocean floor.  But plastics buried in earth could prove to be much longer lasting. Archaeological studies show that some modern landfills are so tightly sealed and capped they protect material within from erosive forces, effectively mummifying them. Neither rain nor sunlight nor air can penetrate in, and decomposition processes typically slow down after 20 years or so. In such an artificially sheltered environment, materials like paper and plastic may survive for surprisingly long times. SG: Deep sea environments at low temperature, low light preventing photo degradation and higher pressure are thought to have a preserving effect too. But landfill could be just preserving this waste as well? It’s amazing to think that future archaeological finds could be the everyday items and gadgets we are using today.   ME: Well, a recent excavation of Atari computer game products buried 10m down in a New Mexico landfill in 1983 revealed that the plastic game cartridges with associated packaging and shrink-wrapping showed little sign of decomposition after 30 years in the ground! Those cartridges which were not crushed were still playable, and were sold on eBay for thousands of dollars. SG: Despite its durability, we are using plastic as if it is disposable. Efforts to recycle have been shown to be seriously flawed, with supply chains for waste not all that they seemed.  Earlier this year it was reported that the UK sends out around half of its recycling abroad with insufficient checks on what was actually happening to it. The system was found to be open to fraud, leading to concerns that instead of being recycled the waste was being dumped in landfill, rivers and oceans. Exporters of UK waste were sending out contaminated and worthless mixed waste and fraudulently claiming the recovery notes that they would then sell.  It is clear that recycling alone, in its present form, does not work. We have to either stop using plastics or find alternative routes to dispose of plastic waste in a more sustainable way. Consumers are much more aware of the impact of plastics in the environment and are receptive to change, but there are limited choices. ME: Yes. We need to explore possible alternatives, for example by re-using plastics in large-scale engineering projects such as road and building construction. There are promising projects currently underway looking at the feasibility of using processed plastic waste as a replacement aggregate in concrete manufacture. SG: Using plastic waste to replace raw materials makes a lot of sense. Pyrolysis is a really good way to break down the plastic to produce raw materials.  We could also develop new ways to break it down faster into useful chemical components. One way would be to digest the plastics using enzymes. Fungi and bacteria have been found that have a taste for plastic and can break it down to be able to use the carbon from it. Scientists in Portsmouth tried to reproduce the enzyme that PET-eating bacteria uses, and accidentally produced an even more efficient enzyme.      Reprocessing the plastic like this would help cut the amount of waste building up as pollution. Long-term, even if we stop pouring this waste into our environment, we will still shed millions of fibres and microplastics through washing synthetic clothes and wearing down tyres.  The problem is that conventional plastics are just too cheap. A price increase would level the playing field to make the use of new plastics more expensive compared to recycled plastic. Because the price of plastic should include the true downstream disposal costs. If this was the case, then we could afford better waste sorting and more viable recycling facilities to prevent the exporting of waste. ME: We’re both agreed that the amount of plastic being produced and discarded without being recycled is doing irreparable harm to other creatures and habitats. So much plastic is choking river and ocean environments that many forms of life are threatened. So much plastic is entering geological cycles that it is creating a substantial stratigraphic signal of the Anthropocene in its own right. Even when the plastic itself has decomposed, the forms of some of the plastic objects that now litter the ocean floor may be preserved as trace fossils in sedimentary rock.  We might imagine picking up a stone in tens of millions of years’ time and finding – instead of the shells of former sea creatures – the shapes of cotton buds, coffee spoons, fishing nets, CD cases, water bottles, biros … SG: and game cartridges.

,2020-12-22T13:27:57.634425Z,640,118,,"The Current Wisdom _is a series of monthly articles in which Patrick J. Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science, reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press._   




The new paper’s lead author is Jonathan Gregory of the U.K.’s University of Reading, and the other authors are a who’s who of sea level researchers (repeating my professions nauseating belief that putting a large number of authors (most of whom have—at best—just read the manuscript) somehow makes it more persuasive). The paper concludes that the causes of sea level rise, and its temporal variations, across the 20th century were many, and that a link to anthropogenic global climate changes has been weak or absent over this period. Basing future sea level rise projections on a presumed historical relationship between anthropogenic global warming and corresponding sea level rise turns out to be a bad idea.   
  
Here is how Gregory et al., 2012 put it:   




The implication of our closure of the [global mean sea level rise, GMSLR] budget is that a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR is weak or absent in the past. The lack of a strong relationship is consistent with the evidence from the tide-gauge datasets, whose authors find acceleration of GMSLR during the 20th century to be either insignificant or small. It also calls into question the basis of the semi-empirical methods for projecting GMSLR, which depend on calibrating a relationship between global climate change or radiative forcing and the rate of GMSLR from observational data (Rahmstorf, 2007; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Jevrejeva et al., 2010).



And here are the main conclusions, now seriously questioned, from the semi-empiricical citations included in the above quote:   
  
Rahmstorf (2007):   




When applied to future warming scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this relationship results in a projected sea-level rise in 2100 of 0.5 to 1.4 meters above the 1990 level [by 2100].



Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009):   




For future global temperature scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fourth Assessment Report, the relationship projects a sea-level rise ranging from 75 to 190 cm for the period 1990–2100.



Jevrejeva et al. (2010):   




With six IPCC radiative forcing scenarios we estimate sea level rise of 0.6–1.6 m, with confidence limits of 0.59 m and 1.8 m.



Seems like three strikes against projecting those high rates of sea level rise.   
  
For a little reality check, the current rate of rise is somewhere in the range of 1.8 to 3.5 mm/yr (0.07 to 0 .14 in/yr) depending on the time period over which you calculate the trend.   
  
Further, as we have previously written, it doesn’t look as if the recent increased rates of ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica are sustainable—much less going to linearly increase to the end of the century. All of this strongly argues that the 21st century sea level rise is not a problem that we can’t keep up with.

,2020-12-18T17:34:38.186247Z,642,119,,"Climate breakdown and the global crisis of environmental degradation are increasing violence against women and girls, while gender-based exploitation is in turn hampering our ability to tackle the crises, a major report has concluded. Attempts to repair environmental degradation and adapt to climate breakdown, particularly in poorer countries, are failing, and resources are being wasted because they do not take gender inequality and the effects on women and girls into account.  Campaigners called for governments and institutions to take note, saying that the impacts on women and girls must be at the heart of any viable strategies on the climate and ecology. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) carried out what is understood to be the biggest and most comprehensive study yet of the issue, taking two years and involving more than 1,000 sources of research. “We found gender-based violence to be pervasive, and there is enough clear evidence to suggest that climate change is increasing gender-based violence,” said Cate Owren, a lead author of the report, published on Wednesday. “As environmental degradation and stress on ecosystems increases, that in turn creates scarcity and stress for people, and the evidence shows that, where environmental pressures increase, gender-based violence increases.” Six in 10 respondents to a survey by IUCN, with more than 300 responses from organisations around the world, said they had observed gender-based violence among female environmental rights defenders, environmental migrants and refugees, and in areas where environmental crimes and environmental degradation were taking place. More than 80 case studies clearly showing such links were uncovered as part of the research. Gender-based violence includes domestic violence, sexual assault and rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage and child marriage, as well as other forms of the exploitation of women. The report found human trafficking rises in areas where the natural environment is under stress, and links between gender-based violence and environmental crimes such as wildlife poaching and illegal resource extraction. “Gender-based violence is one of the most pervasive but least talked-about barriers that face us in conservation and climate work,” said Owern. “We need to take the blinders off, and pay this concerted attention.” Owren found abundant examples of the close links between gender-based violence and the exploitation of women and girls, and the competition for resources engendered by the impacts of global heating and our destruction of the natural environment. For instance, sexual abuse was found in the illegal fishing industry in south-east Asia, and in eastern and southern Africa fishermen reportedly refused to sell fish to women if they did not engage in sex. The illegal logging and charcoal trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo is linked to sexual exploitation, and in Colombia and Peru illegal mines are strongly associated with an increase in sex trafficking. There have also been numerous examples of gender-based violence directed against environmental defenders and activists, who try to stop the destruction or degradation of their land, natural resources and communities. Sexual violence is used to suppress them, undermine their status within the community and discourage others from coming forward. Yet few projects that are aimed at conservation and improving the environment, or tackling the climate crisis, display any recognition of these issues, according to the report.  Global heating puts pressure on resources, as extreme weather, including heatwaves, droughts, floods and fiercer storms, grows more frequent and devastating. In most parts of the world, women are already disadvantaged and lack land rights and legal rights, so are vulnerable to exploitation. When the additional stresses caused by the climate crises bite, they are the first to be targeted. For instance, in some communities, young girls are married off as early as possible when the family faces hardship exacerbated by the climate. Globally, about 12 million more young girls are thought to have been married off after increasing natural disasters, and weather related disasters have been shown to increase sexual trafficking by 20-30%. Women and girls are also burdened with tasks such as drawing water and finding firewood, which are becoming more scarce in many areas under the ecological impact of our scramble for resources, and which expose them to further dangers of violence. Grethel Aguilar, acting director-general of the IUCN, said: “Environmental degradation now affects our lives in ways that are becoming impossible to ignore, from food to jobs to security. This study shows that the damage humanity is inflicting on nature is also fuelling violence against women around the world – a link that has so far been largely overlooked.” At the UN climate conference in Madrid last December, governments were criticised by campaigners for ignoring the plight of women and children and the threats they face.  Some governments are moving to put action for women and girls into their climate and development policies, and the UN in Madrid moved to include a gender action plan as part of the climate negotiations. Campaigners and some countries are hoping for even greater focus on the issue at the crunch UN climate talks in November, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. The UK’s department for international development said it was already factoring in gender issues in climate change funding, including a large-scale study on violence against women and girls during the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, where about three quarters of women and girls who had been in a relationship experienced violence at the hands of their partner. A spokesperson said: “Women and girls can be disproportionately affected by climate change. This is why we’re spending UK aid on helping to promote gender equality, as well as leading the fight against climate change.” Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in writing the report, said: “This report highlights the complex but clear link between growing climate change impacts and violence against women and girls.  He pointed to the role that female campaigners were playing in bringing the world’s attention to the problems. “When we see the inspiring leadership of female activists like Greta Thunberg, we should recognise that the lives and livelihoods of women and girls around the world are particularly threatened by climate change,” said Ward. “The empowerment of women and girls and their protection from the direct and indirect consequences of climate change must lie at the heart of the just transition to zero-carbon and climate-resilient societies.” The report also provided a timely reminder that “concerted action to tackle inequality can unlock new opportunities for climate action and women’s empowerment”, added Mary Robinson, chair of The Elders. “We need to recognise the unequal effects of the climate crisis on women, but also that women’s participation brings with it creative and sustainable solutions to both the climate emergency and social injustices. Tackling climate change and environmental degradation without the full inclusion of women will not succeed: gender equality is a prerequisite to the collective effort needed to address the climate emergency.”",2020-12-18T17:34:38.186281Z,1

You could either use your other senses, such as touch, to find your way out – or better yet, you could get someone who can see the way out to direct you. But either way you need information. For birds, non-visual information can provide the same helping hand while flying. Even though they can see the world around them, the air is a dynamic, invisible environment – and airflow is much more complex environment to move through than the ground with its static obstacles. Imagine you are hanging from a glider and racing to a finish line. You can see two other paragliders ahead of you, one looks like they are having a smooth ride and moving quickly, the other looks like they are in trouble and finding it difficult to control their glider. You would choose to follow the first one, right? By observing the other pilots around you and responding in accordance to what happens to them, you tap into information that helps you make a good decision and keep up with the race. Similarly, it makes sense that an animal may do the same to move through their environment – observing those around them that have the same objective. Soaring birds not only move through the air, they rely on updrafts, such as thermals (a column of warm rising air), to gain lift rather than flapping their wings. It’s a bit like a big game of invisible snakes and ladders – but the costs of sliding all the way down without finding the next ladder are high. They must reach that next ladder before they hit the ground. Like the gliders, birds that rely on soaring – including vultures – often share the air with other birds. But until now we didn’t know if soaring birds do indeed observe each other to “see” these invisible thermal ladders. For our recently published study, we designed an experiment that would test this idea. We tracked the movements of each bird in a small group of vultures at a bird of prey centre in the mountains of France, and recorded their behaviour. Only by using the latest tagging technology could we investigate this concept. Each bird had a backpack with a GPS logger, a movement logger and camera recording all aspects of their movement. In the movement logger was a range of sensors, sensitive to different movement types – an accelerometer to pick up wing beats, a magnetometer for directional changes, and an airspeed sensor.  There is a well known theory, by aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready, which states that birds and gliders should glide at high airspeed when they have just left a strong thermal and expect to be approaching another strong thermal. But gliding quickly is risky, as the flyer is more likely to hit the ground before reaching the next thermal. So our hypothesis was that these vultures, and other soaring birds, are able to take this risk and glide quickly when they have clues provided by the soaring of others, on the whereabouts of the next thermal.  When we mapped the movements of all the vultures and analysed their gliding airspeeds, we found that – on making a decision to leave one thermal and glide to the next – vultures which had tapped into this extra information by “eavesdropping” on the movements of others (they weren’t flocked together but were watching how the other vultures were acting) chose to take the risk and adopt significantly higher airspeeds than those going it alone.  This finding helps us to understand what is going on in the invisible world above us and just how these birds make decisions to navigate this challenging environment. We are all quite used to seeing birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in flocks, and it may be quite reasonable to assume that by flying together these birds are interacting with each other. But our work reveals for the first time that even when birds are not flying together in a flock, they may observe others to sense the world around them. This suggests, for vultures at least, that it is important that there are other birds in the sky with them, as numbers may be needed to maintain a healthy network of information.",2020-12-19T19:37:14.132183Z,1

,2020-12-18T17:38:19.816569Z,654,120,,"That’s the topic of my _Washington Examiner_ column this week. In it, I discuss last week’s budget battle and the failure of “policy riders” designed to rein in the Obama EPA’s attempts to regulate greenhouse gases without a congressional vote specifically authorizing it. The Obama team believes it has the authority to implement comprehensive climate change regulation, Congress be damned. Worse still, under current constitutional law–which has little to do with the actual Constitution–they’re probably right. Thanks to overbroad congressional delegation, “the Imperial Presidency Comes in Green, Too.” At home and abroad, the legislative branch sits on the sidelines as the executive state makes the law and wages war, despite the fact that “all legislative powers” the Constitution grants are vested in Congress, among them the power “to declare War.”   
  
  
Yet, as I point out in the column, Congress retains every power the Constitution gave it–powers broad enough that talk of “co‐​equal branches” is a misnomer. Excerpt: 



The constitutional scholar Charles Black once commented, “My classes think I am trying to be funny when I say that, by simple majorities,” Congress could shrink the White House staff to one secretary, and that, with a two‐​thirds vote, “Congress could put the White House up at auction.” (I sometimes find myself wishing they would.)   
  
  
But Professor Black wasn’t trying to be funny: it’s in Congress’s power to do that. And if Congress can sell the White House, surely it can defund an illegal war and rein in a runaway bureaucracy.   
  
  
If they don’t, it’s because they like the current system. And why wouldn’t they? It lets them take credit for passing high‐​minded, vaguely worded statutes, and take it again by railing against the bureaucracy when it imposes costs in the course of deciding what those statutes mean.



Last year, in the journal _White House Studies_ [.pdf], I explored some of the reasons we’ve drifted so far from the original design: 



_Federalist_ 51 envisions a constitutional balance of power reinforced by the connection   
between “the interests of the man and the constitutional rights of the place.” Yet, as NYU‘s Daryl Levinson notes, ―beyond the vague suggestion of a psychological identification between official and institution, Madison failed to offer any mechanism by which this connection would take hold.… for most members, the psychological identification with party appears greatly to outweigh loyalty to the institution. Levinson notes that when one party holds both branches, presidential vetoes greatly decrease, and delegation skyrockets. Under unified government, “the shared policy goals of, or common sources of political reward for, officials in the legislative and executive branches create cross‐​cutting, cooperative political dynamics rather than conflictual ones.”



Individual presidents have every reason to protect and expand their power; but individual senators and representatives lack similar incentive to defend Congress’s constitutional prerogatives. “Congress” is an abstraction. Congressmen are not, and their most basic interest is getting reelected. Ceding power can be a means toward that end: it allows members to have their cake and eat it too. They can let the president launch a war, reserving the right to criticize him if things go badly. And they can take credit for passing high‐​minded, vaguely worded statutes, and take it again by railing against the executive‐​branch bureaucracy when it imposes costs in the course of deciding what those statutes mean.   
  
  
In David Schoenbrod’s metaphor, modern American governance is a “shell game,” with We the People as the rubes. That game will go on unless and until the voters start holding Congress accountable for dodging responsibility.",2020-12-18T17:38:19.816603Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:38:00.343308Z,657,119,,"As the air’s CO2 concentration rises in the years and decades to come, the negative impacts of drought on wheat biomass and grain yield should diminish, a conclusion that can be derived from the recent work of Dias de Oliveira _et al_. (2015).   
  
The five-member Australian research team noted that “elevated CO2 and high temperature are climate change drivers that, when combined, are likely to have an interactive effect on biomass and grain yield,” leading to three possible outcomes: (1) a “reduced positive effect of elevated CO2,” (2) an “amelioration of the effect of high temperature, or (3) a “synergistic effect where high temperature increases the positive effect of elevated CO2.” They also note that the resultant response “may be influenced by [plant] genotypic differences.” In an effort to study these interactions and possibilities, Dias de Oliveira _et al_. designed a field experiment to determine the interactive effects of CO2 and temperature, as well as those of a third variable—drought—on two pairs of sister lines of wheat ( _Triticum aestivum_ L.) over the course of a growing season, where one of the contrasting pairs of wheat sister lines differed in tillering, or branching (free vs. reduced), while the other differed in early vigor (high vs. low). The experiment was conducted out-of-doors in Western Australia in poly-tunnels under all possible combinations of CO2 concentration (400 or 700 ppm), temperature (ambient or + 3°C above ambient daytime temperature), and water status (well-watered or terminal drought post anthesis). So what did it reveal?   




After presenting a very long list of findings, Dias de Oliveira _et al_. summarized their results as follows: (1) elevated CO2 “increased grain yield and aboveground biomass,” (2) terminal drought “reduced grain yield and aboveground biomass,” but elevated CO2 “was the key driver in the amelioration of [its negative] effects,” (3) “temperature did not have a major effect on ameliorating the effects of terminal drought,” and (4) although “the mechanisms by which [the CO2-induced] enhancements were brought about differed in each pair of sister lines,” there was “no difference in aboveground biomass or grain yield within each pair.” Thus, it would appear that the overall outcome the researchers observed in this study was one in which elevated CO2, acted alone, overpowered the negative effects of a debilitating environmental stress (drought). Consequently, as the air’s CO2 concentration rises in the years and decades to come, the negative impacts of drought on wheat biomass and grain yield should diminish. And that is good news worth celebrating!

,2020-12-18T17:38:38.368849Z,660,119,,"According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to avoid a climate change catastrophe. Although efforts are already being made to reduce the production of greenhouse gasses, they are by most estimations not enough.  It is therefore critical that we find ways to drastically reduce the amount of pollutants in the atmosphere. Ecosystems capable of absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide know as “carbon sinks” are ideal for this.  In principle, all living organisms – all animals, plants, algae and bacteria – consist of carbon and so function as a carbon sink. For example, as long as a tree lives it will absorb and store carbon. Given the sheer volume of all the trees contained in tropical forests, it’s no wonder most people imagine such forests when they think of a carbon sink. However, once chopped down and turned into firewood, the carbon in those trees will be released and emitted back into the atmosphere as CO₂. So while a forest is a moderately efficient carbon sink, its capacity to retain carbon in the forest floor is limited.  In fact, new research by colleagues and I has found that such forests are actually only the fifth most efficient ecosystem in the carbon storage cycle behind salt marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and, best of all, tundra. Tundra is found in polar or mountainous regions where temperatures are too low for trees to grow, and the landscape is dominated by grasses or moss. As a large part of the carbon is stored in the frozen soil and so is harder to disturb, it makes a very efficient sink. However, rising temperatures are melting the tundra in many parts of the world, releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere, and as a consequence its capacity to store carbon is decreasing.  While forests and tundras are losing capacity for carbon storage, another often forgotten ecosystem may hold the answer: seagrass.  Seagrass plants have an excellent capacity for taking up and storing carbon in the oxygen-depleted seabed, where it decomposes much slower than on land. This oxygen-free sediment traps the carbon in the dead plant material which may then remain buried for hundreds of years.   Seagrass meadows are, for the most part, in recession across the globe due to human activity. As a result the re-establishment of these meadows will make it possible to greatly increase the carbon storage potential of our oceans. Many factors influence the exact amount of carbon that can be taken up by a seagrass meadow, but rough calculations show that if we restore one hectare of seagrass, it would correspond to at least ten hectares of dry-land forest and even as much as 40. Planting vast areas of seagrass meadow is also an eminently doable task as these plants are not seaweeds, but plants with flowers, leaves and roots just like plants on land. This means they produce seeds that can be sown in the seabed or small shoots that can be planted by divers. To develop new techniques for actually planting all this seagrass on a massive scale, colleagues and I have been involved in the Novagrass project, which trialled seagrass planting in the coastal zone around Denmark. We tested various techniques, involving both seeds and seedlings, and had the most success when planting seedlings in chequerboard patterns on the seabed. The lessons from this project are now being applied in a larger scale trial, where muddy seabed is topped up with a layer of sand before seedlings are planted. We are waiting on the results, but so far this technique appears to be a promising way to re-establish eelgrass in coastal areas. There are about 60 seagrass species in the world to choose from, but we focused on common eelgrass (Zostera marina). It cannot tolerate warm seas but it’s the most common species in temperate areas and grows well around coasts in the northern hemisphere. Seagrasses thrive in coastal zones, they have the potential to grow all over the world (except Antarctica) and are even expanding into the Arctic as the ice recedes.  There is some evidence of natural recovery after excessive nutrients from fertilisers and other human pressures have been relieved. But much more action is needed to avoid further loss – and indeed new growth – of these valuable ecosystems.",2020-12-18T17:38:38.368883Z,1

——-



Many world leaders today could tell you, earnestly and genuinely, that their country faces major security threats. Historically, such threats have been endemic to the international system, and they have tended to consume most of the time, attention, and social resources of national policymakers. Moreover, statesmen from the past and present alike could probably adopt a common definition of what a “security threat” is: the possibility of outside actors using large scale violence to menace a state’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the physical safety of a substantial portion of its populace; or the emergence of a state that could obtain enough material power to do these things.



But the modern United States does not have this kind of problem. To be sure, its foreign policy discourse has been suffused with the language of security threats for a hundred years. The regnant American grand strategy, which I term primacy, is justified largely—though not exclusively—on security grounds. Yet no state with enough military power to reach inside the Western Hemisphere is likely to emerge any time soon. In short, there is a major disjunction between the language sometimes used to explain and justify American foreign policy commitments and the actual purpose of its strategy.



This, at any rate, was the premise of my essay “Security Threats in Contemporary World Politics.” In it, I made three basic arguments. First, I tried to show that America’s most powerful rival, China, looks nothing like the most plausible past security threats faced by the United States—the Nazi and Soviet empires. Indeed, China would have to jump over a series enormous hurdles before it even came within shouting distance of such dangerous states. Second, I claimed that the political commitments entailed by primacy had only a small prospect of reducing competition in China’s backyard below what it otherwise might be. That is, primacy has a “goldilocks problem”: the highly revisionist states that would propel any East Asian competition are likely to be either absent, or too highly motivated for American power to discourage them from risky behavior. Third, I argued that American political commitments were themselves the most plausible sources of threats to national security. Though unlikely to successfully depress regional competition, primacy’s political connections provide several mechanisms by which America could become involved in a major war.



Looking back on this essay from nearly a decade’s distance, I continue to endorse its major claims. Though I might make a few marginal changes here and there, my views are still roughly the same. But national security discourse, recent history, and my own intellectual temperament have all been altered in important ways. These changes would make for a very different essay, were it written today.



For one thing, the essay’s overwhelming focus on security issues seems less necessary today. Over the past decade, national security discourse has increasingly centered on the defense of the “liberal (or rules‐​based) international order” as the key object of American foreign policy. I think the idea of the “order” borders on conceptually incoherent. But it does have a key virtue: it has enabled more and more analysts to admit that American grand strategy is concerned with something other than traditional security problems. It has therefore made the trade‐​off at the heart of American grand strategy more obvious: American leaders are risking major war, and thereby making the American people less secure, for the purpose of shaping the international environment in ways they consider favorable. Was I re‐​writing this essay today, I would devote more attention to examining the supposed benefits of the international order. Essays by Daniel Drezner and Eugene Gholz from _A Dangerous World?_ provide excellent examples of this kind of analysis.



Another idea I would emphasize more is the idea of “tail risk.” The world today is living through a global pandemic, which will probably kill hundreds of thousands of people and induce the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. This turn of events was unexpected, even though the potential for a devastating global pandemic has been well‐​known for decades. Nevertheless, most countries were underprepared.



Many rare phenomena pose a similar problem. Society lacks the data that would justify the assumption that certain kinds of apparently rare events are in fact extreme outliers on a bell‐​shaped curve of event frequencies, rather than merely uncommon results of some other kind of frequency distribution.. In fact, it turns out that many rare events—for example, earthquakes, rogue waves, and importantly, war—do not follow a normal distribution. In many cases, the statistical likelihood of such events is far greater than the traditional bell‐​shaped curve would imply—the tail ends of the actual distribution of events are “fat.”



Societies are therefore likely to underestimate the risk associated with rare events. I suspect that the probability that America’s primacy strategy will produce a major war is similarly underestimated. The probability may be relatively low, but the scale of disaster would be very large. Over the long‐​term I worry that the chances of such a war would exceed the tolerance threshold of even the most aggressive strategist. Considering and analyzing this possibility seems like an especially salient task in light of recent events.



Finally, if I wrote the essay today, I would focus more attention on the idea of “second best” strategies. Early in the last decade, I still had something of the zeal of youth about me. I retained hopes that normal politics might produce non‐​trivial change in American grand strategy. After all, the country had been somewhat chastened by its exhausting wars in Southwest Asia. The Tea Party, whatever its faults, was a live political force that had managed to achieve temporary restraint in the defense budget, a feat whose last occurrence had required the collapse of the Soviet Union. Obama was pursuing a second‐​term foreign policy that, if not exactly worth defending, at least challenged the elite consensus on grand strategy in a couple of respects.



Well, there is nothing that the world likes better than nice, tasty hopes. The forces enumerated at the end of Christopher Preble and John Glaser’s lead essay turned out to be significantly stronger than I estimated. American power has proven so extensive that a grand strategy explicitly justified in terms of many varied goals like the liberal order is now plausible to the foreign policy establishment. The material and ideological consensus in favor of primacy among the national security elite has proven so robust that American commitments have been able to resist the election of a president like Donald Trump, who is no one’s idea of an internationalist. The American people turned out to give even less of a damn about foreign policy than I expected.



Today I believe that the probability of normal politics producing a genuinely restrained grand strategy is exceedingly slight. The best hope for a major change is probably a crisis that exposes the unexpected risks and costs of primacy. For this reason alone, the task of making the case for restraint remains vital: policymakers will need to have good ideas lying around if and when the bankruptcy of primacy is revealed.



However, I increasingly believe that more effort should be devoted among partisans of restraint to “second‐​best” policies, in case my pessimistic political assessment proves out. And I am not confident that the standard answer—that the second‐​best policy is “less of whatever primacy is proposing”—is always true.



For instance, if we are not going to abandon American alliances, I am not certain that loosening those ties is worthwhile, as it may encourage bad behavior among allies and adversaries alike. If we are going to retain American political commitments, then I suspect that will require more robust military capabilities than I would like as a matter of first preference. I worry that grand strategies may best be plotted on a U‐​shaped curve, where the tail strategies of primacy and restraint both produce reasonably coherent and stable outcomes, but where the strategies in the middle—“off-shore balancing,” “selective engagement,” and “liberal internationalism”—turn out to be ineffective and destabilizing to world politics.



But working out whether there is anything to these concerns would be the subject of a completely different essay. And the present essay, I believe, retains real value. Its fundamental conclusion is still true: “the United States spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year—and risks war—largely to stop other people from fighting among themselves. The common story that reducing regional competition abroad makes America more secure at home is close to being backwards.”



My essay is not the most original or brilliant exposition of this basic point — but as bottom line conclusions go, I think one could do a lot worse.

In such a place, with all that open space, you’d think it would be an easy matter to place something as important as an official NOAA temperature sensor used to contribute measurements to the national climatic database in some of that open space.
No such luck. In fact, the sensor recording the wide open plains has four air conditioners near it!

But lets not forget, in keeping with current observed trends, that any weather station with air conditioning also needs close-by parking.

It’s not like there’s no other open space to put the sensor in Fort Morgan.

The pictures above, courtesy of the Pielke Research Group shows an electronic Min/Max Temperature Sensor placed near a grain elevator office. Cable length limitations on this sensor have caused hundreds of similar placements in the USHCN network where Stevenson Screens used before could be placed a good distance away from such influences.

It is the USHCN Climate Station of Record for Lewiston, Maine, placed at the Union Water Power Company there.

It features an air conditioner unit, a portable barbecue grill, pavement and a nearby building. No close-by parking though as we’ve seen with other stations.
It also features a curious non-standard instrument shelter, of a design I’ve not seen before. The observing height appears to be non-standard, and lower to the ground than usual.

In addition to the close by hard surfaces like concrete pavement, the shelter also is located on an up-slope. That’s a no-no according to NOAA siting specs for a good reason – hot air rises.
Ms. Byrnes found another interesting station in Eastport, Maine. Ms. Byrnes found another interesting station in Eastport, Maine. While it is not part of the USHCN climatic network it is worth looking at because it shows how something simple and obvious that was missed can skew any experiment.
This station is a state operated, NOAA funded special monitoring station with high accuracy, very expensive laboratory grade sensors. The temperature sensor is aspirated, meaning it has a powered fan to draw air in from the outside, and is considered the most accurate way to measure air temperature. The same temperature sensor is used in the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) specs of which can be seen here and photos here.
The setup also has a portable electronics building to go with it, to house all the data logging and analysis electronics. All that electronics needs to be kept cool, so these building are fitted with an air conditioner.
But the scientists who placed the temperature sensor were apparently so transfixed on the goal, they didn’t notice the air conditioner for the electronics building:

Fortunately, the US Climate Reference Network sites I’ve seen are much better thought out than this station in Eastport Maine.

In a letter signed by 80 ARC laureate fellows, some of Australia’s top researchers said claims strong action to cut emissions would be economically destructive have no basis and are not “consistent with Australia’s traditional optimism and ingenuity, nor with historical experience”.  “Reducing emissions is a global challenge that requires collective action,” the letter said. “But Australia’s current visibility as ground zero for both climate impacts and climate policy uncertainty presents a unique opportunity for us to emerge as a leader on this challenge.” The ARC laureate fellows are a small group of researchers selected by the ARC as the top researchers across all fields in Australia. The letter, whose signatories include decorated academics in mathematics, science, economics, and language and culture, said the government’s focus on adapting to changed fire patterns “is not enough”. It was written as the country’s unprecedented bushfire season continues, with emergency warnings in place on Tuesday for a fire burning in the Namadgi national park near Canberra. “We welcome government actions to help current victims and improve adaptation to future fires, as well as its acceptance of a role for climate change in the catastrophe,” the letter said. “But this is not enough, because the greenhouse gas amounts driving warming are still rising: the world is only at the beginning of the climate change phenomenon.” The bushfire emergency has brought the Coalition government’s climate policies into sharp focus. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, was criticised for his handling of the crisis through Christmas and early January, and for his failure to meet with former emergency chiefs who warned of the coming catastrophe last year. Morrison said this month that the government’s response to the increasingly visible effects of the climate crisis would be to address “adaptation and resilience” rather than strengthening policies to reduce emissions. But the letter warns that without stronger action to curb emissions, the impacts of further temperature rises could be such that adaptation is not achievable. “This dire outlook demands stronger mitigation of carbon emissions,” it said. “Many argue that actions to achieve this would be economically destructive. This claim has no basis, nor is it consistent with Australia’s traditional optimism and ingenuity, nor with historical experience.” They wrote that achieving net zero emissions was a large but achievable task, and “far less risky and irresponsible” than allowing continued global heating. Australia faced international criticism as one of a handful of countries at the United Nations climate conference in Madrid in December that were responsible for thwarting a deal on the rulebook for the Paris climate agreement. Australia is the only country that plans to use carryover credits from the Kyoto period to meet its targets under the Paris agreement.",2020-12-19T15:23:43.109404Z,1

For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Carbon dioxide regulations promulgated by the EPA are based upon the assumption that they will actually _do_ something about climate change in the U.S., and that the rest of the world, which had been needling the U.S. for decades of inaction, will now follow our virtuous lead.   
  
Neither is going to happen.   
  
This _Report_ is based upon just-released data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing that the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the U.S in the last year was the about the same as was emitted in 1994—nearly two decades years ago. During that time, emissions grew steadily for 14 years, peaking in 2007, and then fell dramatically (Figure 1). The emissions in 2012 were 12% less than those of 2007.   






**Figure 1. U.S. annual carbon dioxide emissions, 1994-2012 (data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration).** Given this non-trivial decline in carbon dioxide emissions, let’s see how the government’s assumptions are holding up.   




**Assumption 1: Reducing U.S. carbon dioxide emissions will do something about global warming-related weather/climate impacts in the U.S.**   
  
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) compiles the number of “Billion Dollar Weather/Climate Disasters” in the U.S. The higher this number is the more media attention they get and the more global-warming-is-making-the-weather-worse-and-we-must-immediately-act-to-stop-it furor it engenders.   
  
With U.S. emissions on the decline, so too, certainly, are the number of billion dollar weather disasters, right?   
  
Figure 2 shows the annual tally of the number of billion dollar “disasters.” Despite the rapid U.S. emissions decline for the past 5 years, the number of weather disasters in the U.S. is increasing.   






**Figure 2. Number of billion dollar weather/climate disasters in the U.S., 1994-2012 (data compiled by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).** There are two primary reasons why this is the case. The first is that the number of people and the amount of stuff that we all have continues to increase (i.e., there is more stuff in harm’s way), and the second, _there is no relationship between U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and extreme weather events in the United States_. U.S. emissions could have been _zero_ and the result would have been even worse—because rebuilding infrastructure in the extremely expensive energy economy that would ensue would cost much, much more.   
  
  
  
**Assumption 2: The rest of the world will follow our lead and reduce emissions.**   
  
As we like to point out, the magnitude of future global warming (and accompanying climate change) rests not on the future carbon dioxide emissions pathway of the U.S., but rather on that taken by the rest of the world. In the typical mid-range emissions scenario employed by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming projected to occur between 1990 and 2095 is 2.8°C (5.0°F). Of this amount, only about 0.2°C (0.38°F)—about 7%—is expected to result from U.S. emissions. Big deal.   
  
Further, these forecasts are likely way too high. We’ve experienced 0.33°C of warming since 1990, or about 12% of the forecast total, even as 22% of the forecast period is has already passed.   
  
So then why is there so much focus by President Obama on regulations aimed at reducing U.S. carbon dioxide emissions when they will result in no meaningful climatic consequence?   
  
Because our emissions declines are supposed to set an example and other nations of the world will follow suit.   
  
That’s not happening, either.   
  
Figure 3 shows the carbon dioxide emissions from the rest of the world over the same time period as the U.S. emissions in Figure 1. When U.S. emissions increased 14% from 1994-2007, emissions from the rest of the world increased. When U.S. emissions then declined 12% from 2007-2012, emissions from the rest of the world increased even faster.   
  




**Figure 3. Global (less U.S.) annual carbon dioxide emissions, 1994-2012 (data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration updated through 2012 according to Peters et al., 2013).** Why? Because the emissions growth in the rest of the world is primarily being driven by China and other developing countries that are more interested in growing their economies then they are in emulating the U.S.   
  
All which has to make you wonder. As the data show that the premises upon which U.S. greenhouse gas regulations have been promulgated are wrong, why do we persist with such silly notions?

They find “the warmest 30-year period since 730 CE occurred during high Medieval times (876–905 CE=+0.78 °C w.r.t. 1961–1990) and has been slightly warmer than the recent period from 1985–2014 (+0.71 °C)“.
The proxy evidence and instrumental record also show there has been no obvious net warming in Southern Europe since the 1940s.
Past reconstructions for Northern and Central Europe also show no unusual warming has occurred over the last century, with as-warm or warmer temperatures during the 1940s.

,2020-12-21T17:40:22.315773Z,675,120,,"During my time as a zookeeper I had the privilege of working with both Sumatran and Amur tigers. If they did not both have stripes, you would think they were different species altogether.  The Sumatran tiger is the smallest alive today. At around 100kg, it’s “only” about the weight of a large adult male human. It is suited to the warm and wet forests of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, which is reflected in its smaller size and short, dark rusty orange coat which has many thin black stripes to conceal it in dense vegetation from their prey.  The Amur – or Siberian – tiger is much larger, averaging around 170kg (though there are historic reports of males clocking in at 300kg or more) and is now found mainly one corner of far-eastern Russia. It has a thicker but relatively pale coat, with sparse dark brown stripes, which enables it to survive in freezing and snowy winters.  Tiger experts have long debated what such differences mean scientifically. Should the biggest of the big cats be divided into various subspecies, or are all tigers simply “tigers”? It’s an issue with serious implications for conservation. About 3,500 or so tigers remain in the wild, in just 7% of their former range. And if those tigers are all the same, or if even most of them are the same, then saving individual populations matters slightly less – and tigers can be moved around to assist breeding in the wild.  Traditionally, eight subspecies were considered to exist. They are the two already mentioned, plus the Bengal tiger, found mainly in India, the Indochinese, the South China tiger and then three extinct subspecies: the Bali (extinct in the 1940s) and Javan (80s), both closely related to surviving tigers on nearby Sumatra, and the Caspian tiger from Central Asia which went extinct in the 1970s. As genetic techniques evolved, a 2004 study found there was little genetic diversity among tigers, but enough to support the separation of subspecies. It also suggested that Indochinese tigers living on the Malayan peninsular were different enough to those living further north to warrant a ninth subspecies: the Malayan tiger.  These ideas were contested by a group of researchers in 2015, who argued that the relative lack of variation among the mainland Asian subspecies and large overlaps in their shape, size and ecology meant that all tigers from India to Siberia or Thailand should be considered the same subspecies. The researchers called for just two recognised subspecies: the continental tiger, and the Sunda tiger, found on the various Indonesian islands. However the various subspecies are classified, one of the consistent findings is that tigers follow Bergmann’s rule: a principle in zoology which states that animals within the same overall species will tend to be larger in colder environments and vice versa. The Amur tiger, for instance, benefits from the fact that larger animals are better at retaining heat as they have a smaller surface area relative to their overall mass.  This is where a new study published in the journal Current Biology fits in. Researchers from China and the US looked at the whole genomes of 32 representative tigers and found that there were indeed nine subspecies of tiger – of which six survive today. But their work also demonstrates that the various adaptations to temperature – Amur big and hairy, Sumatran small and sleek – were triggered by significant prehistoric events that changed global and local temperatures.  The findings confirm previous speculation that the low genetic diversity in tigers was caused by a population decline during an ice age 110,000 years ago. Thousands of years later, the earliest split from a single common ancestor species occurred between island and mainland subspecies, with the former developing a smaller body size thanks to natural selection. The super eruption of the Sumatran volcano Toba 75,000 years ago followed by an extreme cooling period was the likely cause. Further splits into more specialised tigers reflect other significant extreme climatic changes.  So why is this important in terms of tiger conservation? As past research has argued, the lack of genetic and morphological differences between mainland tigers could allow them to be managed as single subspecies. Theoretically individuals from any region, wild or captive, could be relocated to repopulate former areas or increase numbers of failing local populations. This could help to increase general tiger numbers and local genetic diversity.  But the recent study suggests that tiger adaptations may be more subtle and intricate than first appeared. If tigers are allowed to hybridise either in captive or wild populations it could drive the more vulnerable subspecies to extinction before we fully understand exactly how they have adapted to their particular area.  There is a downside to considering tigers as separate subspecies and attempting to protect them on this basis, without mixing in tigers from elsewhere. Numbers of each subspecies are very small – there are only around 500 wild Amurs, for instance – and smaller populations are more vulnerable to extinction. This could be caused by the regular threats of habitat loss and poaching or simply due to reduced genetic diversity making a small population vulnerable to disease and other selective pressures. Genetic diversity is key for adaptation and ultimately species survival. As our understanding increases, more informed decisions can be made regarding how best to conserve the tiger. We might not have enough time to solve all the riddles but perhaps this is one step closer to ensuring one of the world’s most iconic animals does not disappear forever.",2020-12-21T17:40:22.315807Z,1

One person here in Germany even tweeted that he had not seen such clean air since his childhood, and attributed it to scale-down of human activity.
But German wetteronline.de here reports the clean air central Europe has seen recently since the COVID 19 crisis began is not the result of the shutdown, but is mostly due to the current weather pattern over Europe.
Wetteronline.de reports:
The lower volume of traffic and the largely idle economy certainly has an impact on the concentration of dust and dirt in the air. However, the current weather situation is much more important. On the verge of a powerful high over the Baltic, dry and cold air is being carried from Siberia to Central Europe. It is very clear and pure. In addition, there is a gusty easterly wind, which leaves no chance for a so-called inversion. Under such an inversion the concentration of dust, soot and dirt would increase rapidly.”
Wood burning the biggest threat
Moreover, a heated debate has been unleashed by Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann, who says the biggest threat to clean air in Germany is the now increasing use of wood burning for home heating.

Das ist immer die grösste Lüge. Nichts verbrennt dreckiger als Holz mit so vielen Zusatzsubstanzen.

40 times dirtier than natural gas
According to the veteran meteorologist, “nothing burns dirtier than wood and its additives” and “every wood stove is an environmental catastrophe”. The following chart shows the fine particle emissions from various heating fuels:

Wood pellets are 40 times worse than natural gas.
With governments moving to restrict fossil heating fuels and encouraging “renewable” wood, more and more Germans are opting for wood heat. Thus climate activists have to expect the air to become dirtier – much dirtier – and not cleaner should restrictions be enacted against the fossil fuel economy.

Citing data from Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
In the interview, the prominent professor, once an adviser to former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, cited a chart from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) that was issued on April 15th:

As the RKI chart shows, in early March the reproduction number had risen rapidly before reaching a peak on about March 10. By March 21st, the reproduction number dropped below 1.0.
“Ineffective”, “completely unnecessary”
It wasn’t until March 23 that the German government decreed a lockdown. As the chart shows, since the lockdown was enacted, the reproduction number did not change at all. It’s had no effect.
“It is not the case that the reproduction number went down after the lockdown”, Professor Homburg says. “There are two points we can draw from this: First, the lockdown was not necessary because the number was below 1, and secondly, the lockdown was not effective because the number didn’t drop afterwards.”
“Enormous economic damage”

Homburg agrees that the lockdown led to “enormous economic damage” and was “completely unnecessary”. In view of the data, Homburg does not know why the lockdown continues even today. Currently the reproduction rate stands at 0.7.
Homburg tells Preradovic that the politicians issued the lockdown in panic, came too late and thus so served no purpose. “It was not only unbelievably damaging for the economy, but also for other human factors. It’s about suicides and delayed operations.”
Panic fanned by absurd numbers
Citing the RKO numbers, Homburg also says: “There is not going to be any terrible epidemic. All the panic was fanned by the Robert Koch Institute, who said on March 20th that in the best case we will see 300,000 dead, and maybe 1.5 million dead.” Today the number is well under 5000.
One single alarmist paper
Homburg explains that the origin of the alarming death projections were adopted by the RKI from one single alarmist paper and that “it’s unbelievable that the government allowed itself to be so misled.”
Financial ruin for no reason at all
On the overall situation, Homburg comments: “It’s completely unimaginable. Huge damage is being caused. People and businesses are being financially ruined without any reason at all.”
On why it’s happening, Homburg says that German politicians, such as Angela Merkel, have gotten full cover from the media, and today enjoy high approval ratings because of the appearance of being competent crisis managers. And as long as the polls remain so, Homburg says, there’s little incentive for politicians to relax the lockdown.
Trump may wish to take a look at what’s happening in Germany, and move fast to end the destructive lockdown in USA.

,2020-12-21T17:40:43.096025Z,681,119,,"People in Sydney woke on the morning of Thursday November 22 to see a bright orange sky as the sun was blotted out by a dust storm. Visibility and air quality were very poor and people with heart and lung conditions were advised to stay indoors. Ambulance call-outs spiked and extra paramedics were called upon to deal with the crisis. The dust cloud originated from north-western New South Wales, where strong winds ahead of a cold front met with dry, dusty soil. This lofted tiny dust particles into the atmosphere, which were carried hundreds of kilometers towards Sydney, and then onwards over the Pacific Ocean. Any parts of the world which have an ample supply of soil dust particles, dry conditions, and strong winds are susceptible to dust storms. The “dust belt” –- a train of dust hotspots stretching from the Sahara desert across the Middle East to Central Asia, dominates global dust activity.  Once dust particles are lifted into the atmosphere, they are transported thousands of kilometres by the prevailing winds due to their small size –- around 1 to 10 microns – smaller than the width of a human hair. Over the Sahara during summertime, intense solar heating and convection allow dust to reach altitudes of up to 5 km, from where the dust particles can take up to ten days to sediment out of the atmosphere and travel as far as the Americas, degrading Caribbean air quality.  Although Australia has its fair share of dust hotspots, they are more abundant across the global dust belt and atmospheric dust loadings are much higher in these regions. However, many of the world’s largest dust hotspots are in sparsely inhabited regions such as the Sahara, so some of the worst impacts of dust storms are less frequently experienced by humans. So what can we expect from the future in terms of dust storms? Predicting their frequency, intensity and transport requires forecasts of surface wind speeds, surface conditions such as land surface type and soil moisture, and therefore also precipitation. Accurately simulating these properties over remote, sparsely observed regions such as the Sahara even in the present day is a challenge to models due to the complex nature of the interaction between these parts of the climate system. Climate models are a valuable tool for forecasting dust storms and how they will affect us in the future. It might be expected that, in a warmer future with more drought conditions, we would experience more dust storms. However, the environmental conditions that drive dust storms must be considered in combination.  For example, one study actually predicts a decrease in African dust emissions throughout the 21st century due to a slowdown of tropical circulation and therefore surface winds, which drive the dust uplift. This scenario would result in improved air quality in West Africa.  However elsewhere in North America, dust activity is predicted to increase by the end of the century over the Southern Great Plains largely due to reduced precipitation, enhanced land surface bareness and increased surface wind speed, while the opposite trend can be expected over the northern Great Plains. Globally, the trend in dust activity projected across the next century by climate models is highly variable regionally and seasonally. For Australia, climate models predict more dust activity during the southern hemisphere autumn, driven by increases in surface wind speeds. Our ability to forecast dust both in the short and long term requires an accurate understanding of the processes which drive dust uplift. Climate models need to be able to simulate surface wind speeds, precipitation, soil bareness and soil moisture, as well as the processes which drive transport in the atmosphere and allow dust particles to be carried over long distances.  Dust storms highlight how vulnerable societies are to these extreme weather events and how difficult predicting them is under a changing climate. They’re affected by soil conditions on a microscopic scale and large-scale atmospheric circulation, and so dust storms are uniquely challenging to predict and we urgently need to find out more about them if we are to adequately prepare ourselves for the future.",2020-12-21T17:40:43.096060Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:47:47.354209Z,683,120,,"In part three of the BBC’s new nature series Dynasties, the protagonists, Charm and Sienna, show us how hard it is to be a successful lioness in a land filled with enemies.  Under constant threat of marauding hyenas and cub-killing male lions, the two mothers have to fight for their lives to ensure their offspring have a chance of making it to adulthood. But the episode also shows us that the biggest enemy of lions isn’t other wild predators – it’s humans. Down from as many as 200,000 lions a century ago, some experts believe that we could now have as few as 20,000 individuals remaining in the wild – and that number is likely to be falling by the day. Worryingly, the general public are mostly unaware of their precarious conservation status. We have done a bad job of showing the perilous state of these big cats. Lions face attack by humans on many fronts. Panthera, a wild cat conservation organisation, believes the most serious causes for their decline include habitat loss, humans killing them to protect their livestock, wild prey depletion, accidental snaring, poorly managed trophy hunting and the illegal wildlife trade. Since their threats are so varied, there is no single solution for protecting lions and overcoming these threats will be no mean feat. It will require locally-tailored solutions that fit each specific context. For instance, for lions that reside alongside people in areas outside national parks, research has shown that it is absolutely vital to reduce the perceived costs of lions to local people, like livestock depredation, while increasing their benefits, such as income from photographic tourism or trophy hunting. For lions inside protected areas, some experts argue that we must fence lions in to stop them causing problems with people. However, this has earned criticism from others, who believe that fences incur significant ecological and economic costs by disrupting the migration of herbivores. The issue over “to fence or not to fence” has turned into a bit of cat fight and shows the political nuances and ecological complexities of conserving such a charismatic species. In a bold attempt to reunite conservationists, Pride, the Lion Conservation Alliance, has brought together five lion NGOs to pool their efforts and share funding. It may come as no surprise that, like the species they’re fighting to conserve, they have realised the benefits of coming together and working as a team rather than competing.  Focusing on lion populations in Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, their community conservation efforts empower locals to be stewards of wildlife. By turning lion poachers into guardians, their initiatives have reduced lion killing by up to 99% in some of the areas in which they work.  By building on the cultural significance of lion hunts, young warriors that would usually show their bravery by killing lions are now employed to track lions and monitor their activities. They also inform their community if lions are approaching so that farmers can guard their livestock. While TV shows such as Dynasties are helping to raise the profile of this threatened carnivore, what the lion needs now more than anything is funding. Conserving lions is an expensive business: one recent paper showed that to effectively manage the protected areas where lions currently reside would require a whopping US$0.9 billion to US$2.1 billion in additional income per year – on top of the money that is already raised.  Where this cash comes from remains a bit of a mystery. We have to go beyond financing conservation from the meagre income of photographic tourism in national parks. Solutions could involve more corporate partnerships and financially linking lion lovers in the West to Africans living with lions.  An idea from Sir David Attenborough himself argues that companies that use lions in their marketing should pay for lion conservation. What is abundantly clear is that if we want lions to have a future, we must start stumping up the cash for their conservation. Many commentators have suggested BBC’s Dynasties takes on the gripping, conflict-ridden format of storytelling that Game of Thrones perfected. If this is the case, humans would surely play the vicious and selfish King Joffrey. It is us, after all, who terrorise lions the most. But it is us, too, who have the power to guarantee their survival.",2020-12-19T15:47:47.354241Z,1

I pointed out that it was garbage then, as it is now. Here’s a portion of the original post I made:


There’s an article on UK’s The Independent website about a most unusual scientific theory: “Cell Phones kill bees.”

Well today in the LA Times,  it seems that UC San Francisco researchers have uncovered what they believe to be the real cause, and its not loony ideas like cell phones. Its fungus.
From the article:
A fungus that caused widespread loss of bee colonies in Europe and Asia may be playing a crucial role in the mysterious phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder that is wiping out bees across the United States, UC San Francisco researchers said Wednesday.
Researchers have been struggling for months to explain the disorder, and the new findings provide the first solid evidence pointing to a potential cause.
Other researchers said Wednesday that they too had found the fungus, a single-celled parasite called Nosema ceranae, in affected hives from around the country — as well as in some hives where bees had survived. Those researchers have also found two other fungi and half a dozen viruses in the dead bees. 
The researchers caution that the results are preliminary, and data sampling represents just a fraction of hives, but they are encouraged by the findings. Hopefully they’ll be able to come up with a solution.
Yet it appears that the “Cell Phones kill bees” lunacy has caught on, since there’s a comment today in the ER’s “Tell it to the ER” that furthers that nutball idea. What a public disservice that column is.

A year ago NoTricksZone (NTZ) announced Greenland Has Been Cooling In Recent Years – 26 Of Its 47 Largest Glaciers Now Stable Or Gaining Ice.
Six months ago NTZ cited several scientific papers indicating The Region From 50-70°S Has Cooled Since The 1980s As North Atlantic SSTs Have Cooled 1°C Since 2004.
Three months ago we reported A Massive Cooling Of 2°C In 8 Years (2008-2016) Has Jolted Large Regions Of The North Atlantic.
A few days ago we shared a New Study Finds The Larsen Ice Shelf (Antarctic Peninsula) Has Cooled More Than 2°C Since 1991.
Now we shine the light on 3 more studies that assess “Eurasia, North America, Africa, Australia, South America, and Greenland experienced notable cooling trends” from 2002 to 2013 (Xu et al., 2020), and both West and East Antarctica have been rapidly cooling since the mid-2000s (Hrbáček and Uxa, 2020 and Fatras et al., 2020).
At some point the question may need to be asked: Just how global is recent “global warming”?

Xu et al., 2020
“Concurrent with the slowdown of global warming during 2002–2013, the wintertime land surface air temperatures over Eurasia, North America, Africa, Australia, South America, and Greenland experienced notable cooling trends. … The slowdown concurs with a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), indicating that PDO plays an important role in modulating the global warming signal. Not all ensemble members capture the cooling trends over the continents, suggesting additional contribution from internal atmospheric variability.”

Hrbáček and Uxa, 2020
“A significant air temperature decrease started around 2000 along most of the Western AP. The cooling triggered by natural variability of cyclonic activity and increasing sea‐ice concentrations near coastlines caused MAAT trends of −0.16 to 0.05°C y−1 in the period 2006–2015. In contrast, the MAAT on JRI was increasing at a non‐significant rate of 0.10°C y−1, which corresponds to observations from other sites of the north‐eastern AP where positive, but non‐significant, trends between 0.02 and 0.08°C y−1 have been reported.10 Unlike MAAT , there was a non‐significant negative trend of −0.05°C y−1 for MAGT 5. Interestingly, the MSAT and MSGT 5 trends were positive only in autumn (MAM), at 0.30 and 0.13°C y−1, respectively, while they were negative in the other three seasons. Yet, the north‐eastern AP region exhibited a MAAT more than 1°C lower in the period 2006–2015 compared to 1996–2005, and autumn (MAM) air temperature was even about 1.5°C lower.”

It seems to me, that given the physical makeup of these facilities, they are one of the worst possible environments to measure air temperature. But like many historical stations, they weren’t chosen with the environment in mind, but rather if there was a human being present 7 days a week whom could take the high/low temps and rainfall and write it down on an NCDC B44 form.
This week I visited a few stations in southern California, and Santa Barbara is one of those USHCN stations that is also a sewage treatment plant. Conicidentally, a few other USHCN stations that are also WWTP’s were posted by www.surfacestations.org volunteers. So I thought I’d give you the grand tour.

There’s lots more, but you get the idea.
surfacestations.org volunteer Don Kostuch wrote this to me about WWTP’s recently:
“I spoke with the curator in New Hampton IA. He gave me these figures for his plant last January:
780,000 gal/day
Incoming temp 55F
Outgoing temp 43F
I calculate this heat loss is about 3 million btu/hr.
The population is about 3500 so each person releases about 1000 btu/hr at the plant on a cold day.
The effect on the sensor depends on the placement, temperature, wind, location of the tanks, etc. which I have not attempted to analyze, but it seems to be worth some careful attention.
The worst example I saw was in Winnebago, MN where the  sensor is above and in the middle of four large tanks all huddled together in about a 100
ft square. The population there is about 1500 so the heat released would be about 1.5 million btu/hr in an area of about 10000 sq.ft.”
And, as population grows in a city so would waste water volume. So it stands to reason the a temperature sensor at a WWTP would be directly sensing waste heat produced by population growth, and the amount of waste heat would grow proportionately with population.
Perhaps we should call the WWTP effect “P-UHI”

It is expected to generate as much political interest as it will religious concerns. On Thursday, he will address a joint session of Congress, and on Friday he will speak to the United Nations General Assembly. He is widely expected to focus on climate change, a topic on which he shares much political ground with President Obama.



This will not be the first time Pope Francis has ventured into the global warming debate. The June 2015 release of his encyclical “Laudato si” marked his initial foray into the discussion. Therein, Pope Francis echoed President Obama’s tune, claiming there exists “solid scientific consensus” that human activities are causing a “disturbing warming” of the climate, which left unchecked will result in a type of planetary Armageddon manifested by escalating temperatures, melting polar ice caps, rising seas, more frequent and more severe weather, ecosystem degradation, and plant and animal extinctions, all of which he claimed will severely affect humanity.



Given that this was the pope’s stated position on global warming a mere three months ago, look for a familiar refrain to accompany his remarks in Washington and New York next week. He will likely repeat a challenge first issued in his June encyclical, which called for humanity to “recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming,” which he believes is “aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels.”





Contrary to what Pope Francis says, fossil fuels are good for the poor and the Earth.



 **The Consensus Isn’t**



But are the pope’s concerns over potential global warming based upon the best available science? Or are they significantly overinflated? Is the biosphere rapidly spiraling downward toward planetary Armageddon? Or is it marching forward toward biospheric rejuvenation? Is limiting fossil fuel use a policy prescription panacea? Or is it a recipe for social and economic disorder and regress?



With respect to the science, those who promulgate a fear of planetary Armageddon often conveniently fail to disclose that literally _thousands_ of scientific studies have produced findings that run counter to their view of Earth’s climatic future. As just one example, and a damning one at that, _all_ of the computer models upon which this vision is based failed to predict the current plateau in global temperature that has continued for nearly two decades now. That the Earth has not warmed significantly during this period, despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, is a major indictment of the models’ credibility in predicting future climate, as well as the assertion that debate on this topic is “settled.”



Numerous other problems with the apocalyptic vision of our future climate have been filling the pages of peer‐​reviewed science journals for many years now, evidenced most forcefully by the work of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which has highlighted the results of thousands of scientific studies challenging the alarmist and model‐​based vision of the planet’s future. This large and well‐​substantiated alternative viewpoint contends that rising atmospheric CO2 emissions will have a much smaller, if not _negligible_ , impact on future climate, while generating several biospheric _benefits_.



 **Global Warming Could Be Good**



Concerning such benefits, it is a well‐​established _fact_ that atmospheric CO2 is the major building block of nearly all life, as it is used by plants in the process of photosynthesis to construct their tissues and grow. As numerous scientific studies have conclusively demonstrated, the more CO2 there is in the air, the better plants grow. They produce greater amounts of biomass, become more efficient in using water, and are better able to cope with environmental stresses such as pollution, drought, salinity, and high temperatures.



The implications of these benefits to society are enormous. One study, for example, calculated that over the 50‐​year period of 1961 to 2010, the direct monetary benefits atmospheric CO2 enrichment conferred on global crop production amounted to a staggering $3.2 trillion. Projecting this positive externality forward in time reveals it will likely bestow an additional $9.8 trillion in crop production benefits between now and 2050.



By ignoring these realities, policy prescriptions calling for a reduction in fossil fuel use are found—on this basis alone—to be ill‐​advised. Yet there are still other important reasons to reject them.



 **The World Needs More Energy, Not Less**



We live in a time when approximately half the global population experiences some sort of limitation in accessing the energy they need for the most basic of human needs, including the production of clean water, warmth, and light. One‐​third of those thus impacted are children. An even greater portion finds its ranks among the poor. How can a society turn its back on these individuals and deny them the right to increase their energy and fossil fuel use so that they can increase their living standards? It is reprehensible to even consider such an action and it is certainly morally wrong to do so. The world needs _more_ energy, not less.



Taxing or regulating CO2 emissions is an unnecessary and detrimental policy option that should be shunned. Why would any government or religious institution advocate to increase regulations and raise energy prices based on flawed computer projections of climate change that will never come to pass? Why would any government or religious institution advance policy that seeks to destroy jobs, rather than to promote them? Why would any government or religious institution want to deny increasing energy access to those in the world who are in most need of it? And why would national governments or religious institutions actually “bite the hand that feeds them”?



It is high time for our world leaders to recognize and embrace the truth. Contrary to misguided assertions, political correctness, and even government or religious edicts, carbon dioxide is _not_ a _pollutant_. Its increasing concentration only minimally affects our climate, while offering great benefits to the biosphere. Efforts to regulate and reduce CO2 emissions will economically burden society and yield little to no measurable impact on Earth’s climate.",2020-12-21T17:41:06.829693Z,1
,2020-12-19T17:06:05.054316Z,689,119,,"Three bushfire survivors have joined environment group Friends of the Earth in a claim against ANZ, accusing it of financing the climate crisis by funding fossil fuel projects. The case, lodged under international guidelines agreed by members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), demands the bank disclose its greenhouse gas emissions, including “scope three” emissions resulting from its business lending and investment portfolio, and set ambitious targets that align with the Paris climate agreement. The claim was inspired by a successful complaint against ING bank in the Netherlands by Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and Greenpeace. Mediation following that complaint led to ING committing to measure and publish its indirect emissions, reduce its thermal coal exposure to near zero by 2025 and make its portfolio consistent with the Paris goal of keeping global heating well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. The complainants in the ANZ claim include Jack Egan, who was approached by Friends of the Earth to join the action after his home near Batemans Bay, on the New South Wales coast, was destroyed on New Year’s Eve. Egan said there was a clear link between ANZ and other institution’s ongoing support of fossil fuels and the extreme hot and dry conditions that exacerbated the fire that left him homeless. “We are not seeking damages or compensation from ANZ, I just want them to stop fuelling dangerous climate change,” he said. Friends of the Earth announced the action at a protest outside ANZ headquarters in Melbourne’s Docklands. It lodged the claim with the federal government’s OECD national contact point, a section of the federal treasury responsible for hearing complaints of corporate wrongdoing under the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. The national contact point’s initial role is to attempt to broker a mediation between the parties. If agreement cannot be reached, it can make recommendations, but cannot force parties to take action. ANZ declined to comment on Thursday. The environment group alleges ANZ’s breaches of the OECD guidelines include misleading consumers by claiming to support the Paris agreement targets while continuing to invest in projects that undermine the meeting of those targets. Emila Nazari, a legal officer with Friends of the Earth, said the bank had increased investment in coal 34% over the past two years as it lent $8.8bn to the fossil fuel sector. She said the bank was Australia’s largest financier of fossil fuel industries, and continued to invest billions of dollars in “climate wrecking projects” while bushfires raged across Australia. “It is illegal for someone to light a bushfire, and we believe it is illegal for companies to finance the burning of our common home. This case is one of many to come against climate criminals,” Nazari said. The other names attached to the action are Joanna Dodds, a Bega Valley Shire councillor and member of the group Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action, and Patrick Simons, a Friends of the Earth renewable energy campaigner whose family lost their home in NSW.",2020-12-19T17:06:05.054351Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:25:16.236226Z,690,119,,"Often when the topic of glaciers and climate change is discussed, focus shifts to those in Greenland and Antarctica. But there are glaciers elsewhere too, such as in the Himalayas, which play a vital part in supplying water to people who live downstream. Now, our research has found that these glaciers may react more sensitively to predicted future climate change than previously thought, which could lead to them melting at a faster rate. In 2017 and 2018, our EverDrill research team travelled to Nepal, to measure ice temperatures (using a converted pressure washer) on the Khumbu Glacier. Khumbu, whose ice is sourced in the Western Cwm of Mount Everest, flows down the flanks of the mountain from around 7,000 to 4,900 metres above sea level. Along with many other glaciers in the Everest region and across High Mountain Asia, the meltwater from Khumbu contributes to the water resources of huge populations in the mountain foothills.  We spent two field seasons (six to eight weeks each) drilling boreholes using a jet of hot, pressurised water to incise into the ice. In total we drilled 27 boreholes, ranging between 1-192m deep, across five sites. These boreholes are the first, deepest, and most spatially extensive achieved to date in the Himalaya using hot-water drilling. Once the boreholes were drilled, we measured ice temperatures by installing strings of pre-built thermistor sensors linked to data-loggers located at the surface. We left them for six months and collected the data on a return trip in November 2017.  The main finding from this research was that the ice was warmer than we expected, with the coldest ice measuring –3.3°C. As the ice is formed on the flanks of Mount Everest, where the mean annual air temperature is –13°C at 7,000 metres elevation, we might have expected the ice to be at this temperature. Our borehole data reveal that this was not the case. Not only was the ice not this cold in our boreholes, but ice temperatures also increased towards the glacier terminus. Why does it matter that we found warmer ice temperatures than we expected? Glaciologists acknowledge two thermal types of ice: “Cold” ice and “warm” ice. Cold ice is below the melting-point temperature, so when additional heat is applied (from the sun or warmer air temperatures), the ice simply becomes less cold (going from –15°C to –14°C, for example). Warm ice, alternatively, is at the melting-point temperature, so any heat input melts the ice to become water. In short, this means that Khumbu will respond more sensitively to any future additional heat inputs, such as warming air temperatures. It has been shown that air temperature increases are amplified at high elevations. For example, a global temperature rise of +1.5°C has been predicted to result in a +2.1°C warming across High Mountain Asia and a significant loss of ice mass across the region. As these glaciers melt and recede, their contribution to water resources will initially increase. However, as the volume of ice mass remaining decreases, this contribution will steadily decline. While the timescale over which this might occur is unknown, predictions suggest that “peak water” may be reached as soon as the middle of this century. Our finding of warm ice within Khumbu supports the predicted sensitivity of such glaciers to warming air temperatures. But it’s not all bad news for the region’s glaciers. First, we don’t know if the temperatures we measured on Khumbu are representative of all glaciers in the area. More measurements are needed on other glaciers to determine this. Second, Khumbu and many other Himalayan glaciers are debris-covered glaciers, which contain a surface layer of rocks and boulders that typically increases in thickness towards the terminus, up to several metres depth. This debris layer complicates the amount of ice surface melt that is produced: where the layer is thick, it acts like a blanket and insulates the glacier from warmer air temperatures, reducing melt rates. However, this insulation of the lower glacier also results in the location of maximum melt shifting further up the glacier, to where the debris cover is thinner. In this area, the glacier melts by surface lowering, which in an extreme future scenario could lead to the detachment of the lower glacier, forming a new terminus at this higher elevation. While the lower, detached ice would become stagnant, it would still be protected from instant melting by its debris blanket. The new terminus above this would not, and melt rates could increase. Yet, our deepest borehole in this area of surface lowering was 192 metres, and did not reach the bed so the ice thicknesses remains unknown – but it could be that there is plenty of ice left in Khumbu to stop this happening. These ice temperatures will now be fed into an ice flow model to better predict how the Khumbu Glacier will respond to climate warming and contribute to river discharges in the future. Meanwhile, we are still collecting temperature data to analyse and better understand how the highest glaciers in the world will be affected by climate change.",2020-12-19T15:25:16.236259Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:40:33.401835Z,691,120,,"I’m sitting in a presentation by William R. Cotton, of Colorado State University where he’s talking about the effect of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) on precipitation. He’s making a convincing pitch showing how the UHI factors into downwind delayed convection initiated by the city UHI along with a significant contribution of aerosols and ice nuclei that seed the precipitation. He’s been able to demonstrate that in St. Louis, downwind from the city (typically NE to SE based on prevailing winds) there are increased precipitation from thunderstorms by as much as 160% during the life cycle of the storm.
Yesterday, I saw a very similar study done by Indiana State Climatologist, Dev Nyogi, where he studied Indianapolis, IN and came to similar conclusions. The midwestern cities make good case studies because they are singular islands of urbanization (as opposed to sprawling cities like Los Angeles and Chicago) that essentially become point heat sources at the mesoscale level.
The summary is this: Urban and-use has the biggest control on locations and amounts of precipitation and that condensation nuclei added by the city also have a significant effect. Heat and particles contributed by the city can make bigger, more precipitating thunderstorms.
Of course studies by Parker tells us there is no significant UHI effect, so this presents yet another challenge to what is looking ore and more like a flawed study by Parker.

 So it cannot be the evil diesel engine cars that are “choking” our cities.

Image: NASA here (public domain) 
“The Corona crisis is bringing it to light: car traffic has decreased significantly, but the air quality in city centers has hardly changed,” Tichy comments.
Environmental claim exposed as false
Recall that a major reduction of diesel engines was supposed to improve air quality. After all, experts at the Baden-Württemberg State Institute for the Environment (LUBW), for example, have attributed a large 80 percent share of air pollutants especially to diesel vehicles – so they have to be banned soon.
Yet Tichy notes: “If this is true, the ‘shutdown’ would have to have a drastic effect. But it does not.”
It turns out that the involuntary “corona experiment” with its widespread stop of car traffic has exposed bare the false claim made by environmental activists: Diesel cars are responsible for polluting the air of German cities.

Diesel car bans “pointless”
According to Tichy, the “Corona Experiment” exposes just how pointless driving bans issued by the green transport ministers can be. “They obviously have no effect on the NO2 concentrations in the air.”
“The measured values, for example, at the Am Neckartor station in the Stuttgart city center were already below the limit value of 40 µg/m3 in February and March, ” writes Tichy. “At that time, traffic was still flowing and ‘shutdown’ had not yet been announced.”
Other larger factors
Tichy adds that engineer and measurement expert Martin Schraag accuses proponents of car bans of data “manipulation” and reminds that today’s “newer vehicles and those retrofitted with software updates hardly emit any exhaust gases. This should also have been reflected in the results.”
Schraag notes that NO2 values fluctuate strongly and depend heavily on Stuttgart’s weather conditions and wintertime  heating can be the cause.
“The weather, if you look at the data, has a decisive influence,” Tichy comments. “The experts of the LUBW environment office obviously did not care about these influences and officially know nothing about them. They still assume that traffic accounts for 80 percent of air pollutants.”
At a loss for words
Now they are facing difficulties in explaining the situation. As Schraag suspects, the 80 percent figure cannot be correct if there are significantly fewer cars on the road and yet the values have not changed.
The Bavarian State Office for the Environment also confirmed that the air pollutants in the city of Würzburg – hometown of former NBA superstar Dirk Nowitzski – had hardly changed either although traffic has decreased significantly.

Its called the ViziFrame – now you can program your own local weather channel at home, or at the office, or at the marina, or the golf course, your school, a truck stop, gas station, or wherever there may be an interest in weather to make a go/no go decision. You can view it on your own terms, and unlike the Weather Channel, you don’t have to wait a half hour to get the info you need.
And the graphics, look at good as anything on TV. For those of you with a profit in mind, it can have advertising and other information too. Its way cool, inexpensive, and trouble free. It works with any TV, big screen, or computer monitor. It updates its information via WiFi or a regular Internet cabled connection to a home DSL/cable router or T1 router.
The Chico Chamber of Commerce is going to put a bunch of them (the premium model that also does video and audio clips with touch screen interactivity) around town at hotels, restaurants, city hall and other public places that cater to visitors. Local artist Gregg Payne worked out a cool design for the front fascia that looks like the Hooker Oak tree…a concept view is below along with the current weather page and forecast…which are live content links soon to be on the Chamber of Commerce web page. Kris Koenig and Anita Berkow of Interstellar Studios are doing the interactive kiosk presentation for it. Look for these around town soon!



Note the current conditions page – it has solar irradiance on it – I figured if we were going to become a solar powered city, getting a real-time indicator that people can use to calculate solar panel efficiency would be a good first step, so I invested in the equipment to do that. I’ll have an entire blog entry on this service later.
The graphics are made in my rendering system as weather data arrives at my office here in Chico, there’s actually about a hundred plus graphics that are available.
But you can get a weather channel for your home or business too. See www.viziframe.com I’ve sold several of these already and people at home just connect them up to a spare video port on their big screen TV, and when they want weather, just switch to it. No waiting, no pigs, no hassle.

CO2-induced planetary greening leads to an enormous expansion of Earth’s carbon sink. By 2100 this greening-sink effect will offset 17 years of equivalent human CO2 emissions. This easily supersedes the effect of Paris Agreement CO2 mitigation policies.
In a break from the deflating global news of viral infections and rising death rates, a groundbreaking new study (Haverd et al., 2020) affirms the “beneficial role of the land carbon sink in modulating future excess anthropogneic CO2 consistent with the target of the Paris Agreement” via the fertilization effect of rising CO2.
There has been a 30% rise in global greening since 1900. CO2 fertilization is the “dominant driver” of these greening trends, with an additional positive contribution from climate warming.
When CO2 levels double (to 560 ppm), this CO2-fertilization-greening effect is expected to increase to 47%.
Growth in the land’s carbon sink – absorbing excess CO2 emissions – will reach 174 PgC by the end of the century.
This is the equivalent of eliminating 17 full years of human CO2 emissions.

I like trees, and I recently planted four, but at the same time I’ve had to remove a couple of trees from my home and business property. In the latter case, the City did the work because they agreed with me that the tree was unsafe and posed a public hazard.
This tree ordinance thing is taking on overtones of the abortion battle, except that the roles seem to be reversed, with the “right to life” being on the left. Lately, it seems that meadowfoam, garter snake habitat (see Sundays letters to the editor) and beetle habitat Elderberry bushes are more important than the rights and lives of people.
Case in point – how many people have died at the Highways 70/149/99 interchanges in the 10+ years that environmentalists have placed roadblocks in front of that project? I remember one little boy, about two years ago, who died when the car he and his mom were riding in was broadsided by a car on 70 as she turned onto 149. If the road had been improved on schedule, that never would have happened.
Was that worth 10 years of delay to protect some Meadowfoam and beavers? I think not. Meadowfoam is being grown in quantities at reserves near Vina and commercially in Oregon, and the Limnanthes Flococcus Californica aka Butte County Meadowfoam can just as easily be grown with it. Beavers relocate with ease too. Anybody who tells you otherwise is just pushing an agenda.
Now we have the City saying there’s a delay in authorizing a bid to fix drainage problems for a man made stormwater retention basin near south Chico street Paseo Campaneros that becomes a West Nile hotspot. Two people have died on that street from West Nile in the past year…yet the “garter snake habitat” aka man-made retention basin gets hands-off priority according to what the city said recently.
It’s lunacy and its morally wrong. Public health, be it an accident prone intersection or a festering man-made mosquito pool should always trump protecting bugs, plants, snakes, and the occasional beaver. If you think these things are more important than the health of the community, then you have your social priorities reversed.
Environmentalists digging in their heels on this only hurts their cause, because it makes them look unreasonable, and maybe they are. But most people I know, on either side of the political spectrum actually want to protect the environment, me included, but they want to protect their children and grandparents more.
Making them choose through obstruction is a no-win polarizating situation. We CAN have it both ways.
In the case of trees, the folks pushing this strengthened law act as if the tree, once cut down, could never be replaced. We’re not talking giant Redwoods here…more like Dogwoods and Pines, available at Home Depot.
Compromise folks…compromise.

New studies suggest uncertainty in clouds’ surface radiative effects reach 17.4 W/m² per year (±8.7 W/m²/year). Total CO2 climate forcing is said to be just 0.02 W/m² per year. The difference in these magnitudes preclude detection of a CO2 signal in climate forcing.
According to Feldman et al. (2015), a 2 ppm increase in CO2 per year (22 ppm over the 11 years from 2000-2010) results in a surface radiative forcing influence of 0.02 W/m², or 0.2 W/m² per decade. This is said to be just “ten per cent of the trend in downwelling longwave radiation” when clouds and water vapor are considered.
In contrast, the influence of clouds in total longwave forcing is substantially larger, with radiative forcing trends reaching ±4 W/m² per decade.
From 1978 to 2010, the total longwave anomalies reached amplitudes of about ±2 W/m² per year (Loeb et al., 2012, below image). These anomalies dwarf the 0.02 W/m² per year radiative influence from CO2, and thus factors other than CO2 must be driving the variability.
Further, the overall trend in longwave or greenhouse effect forcing appears to have been flat during this 30-year period. CO2’s 0.2 W/m² per decade contribution may have had no net impact on the trend.

Image Source: Loeb et al., 2012
Even if a CO2 forcing signal was detectable in an overall trend over the last few decades, it would be lost amid the uncertainty and noise of the radiative effects of clouds.
According to L’Ecuyer et al., 2019, the global annual net cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the Earth’s surface is estimated to be -24.8 ±8.7 W/m². In other words, when cloud cover increases, surface temperatures cool because the net shortwave effects of cloud (-51 W/m²) exceed the net longwave effects of cloud (+26.3 W/m²). The uncertainty value associated with this overall surface forcing estimate, ±8.7 W/m², has a range of 17.4 W/m².
If CO2’s net radiative effect in surface forcing is 0.02 W/m² per year and the uncertainty the radiative effects of clouds is ±8.7 W/m² per year, this means that uncertainty is 870 larger than the CO2 influence.
A CO2 forcing signal is therefore not detectable in the Earth’s energy balance.

,2020-12-19T19:40:56.382851Z,703,120,,"Every year massive amounts of valuable resources are deemed “waste” and consigned to landfill. Take the UK – around 540 million tonnes of products and materials enter the country annually, but only 117 million tonnes are recycled.  However if we truly thought that waste equals value, and ensured that resources are kept in the economy for longer and thus reducing the use of raw materials, we could make serious steps towards diverting all this waste from landfill. This is what’s known as the circular economy. For the circular economy to thrive, we must be serious about reducing waste. And yet we’re still locked into an “iron cage of consumerism” – shifting to a future in which we’re more efficient with materials will require significant changes in the way we consume things and in the way businesses are organised.  To make this shift possible, we must recognise that a lot of customers simply don’t consider sustainability the main selling point of a product. We must be realistic, and businesses have to target what consumers really want. Recycling has thus far been the main focus of waste production, but this is far from ideal as it takes a great deal of energy to reprocess and remanufacture materials, as well as transport them. We need to focus on making new stuff last longer. In short, we need to do away with the “consumer culture”. To do this, businesses need to think differently about the ways in which products are provided to consumers. Providing better information to consumers about durability of products would be a good start. Giving accurate lifetime information on product labels could keep them in use for a longer time.  The average consumer expects a washing machine to last six years before it needs to be replaced, and Which? magazine cites quality and reliability as strong buying criteria.  So why don’t people actually keep their washing machines for that long? It’s because they’re confused by the labelling. Consumers tend to assess the expected lifetime of large household appliances through the manufacturer’s warranty. However most just give between one or two years warranty, making it difficult for the consumer to really assess how long it would last.  Rectifying this would mean businesses and their brands become more trusted, enabling them to build better and more prolonged relationships with consumers. When people aren’t switching brands all the time, products will be considered less disposable. Leasing isn’t a new concept, but it could pay dividends for the environment – it’s one of the business models which could reduce the use of materials in the longer term. Why can’t household appliances like washing machines be rented rather than bought? They could be rented from manufacturers. As manufacturers would be responsible for repair and replacement rather than consumers, this should help to remove any commercial benefit to be gained from making products short-lived. More leasing would thus significantly cut the use of materials. Appliances could be re-used from one consumer to another while all repairs would be undertaken by the manufacturer, rather than machines being scrapped when they break down. As well as providing added revenues for manufacturers that would spread over time, this would trigger a change in the design of washing machines which would enhance the focus on longevity. It is true that consumers already have well-established buying habits, and that firms would encounter significant costs when setting up new business models. But the benefits it seems could out-weigh the immediate barriers.  There would be major cost savings on manufacturing materials, something which may become very important in the future. The more scarce materials become, the more expensive they will be – a real pressure point for the industry of tomorrow. Re-use and repair services and leasing models will inevitably start to become more appealing to businesses which are looking at ways to turn a profit in the face of increasing costs. In the past few years, the sharing economy or collaborative consumption has demonstrated new ways of distributing goods and services to consumers. As goods are shared instead of owned, the sharing economy represents an alternative to our consumerist society. Take for example Bla Bla Car, where people can share a ride, or Airbnb where travellers can rent a spare room in someones home, as an alternative accommodation. This peer-to-peer business models had prove to be successful. However, there still some barriers as they depend on trust between people. Similar business models could be applied to other products such as large household appliances. A laundrette is the perfect example. In Scandinavian countries, famed for their sustainability, it is very common to find laundrettes in private apartment blocks. However, in the UK and many other countries laundrettes are often perceived as unhygenic and people can be snobby towards them. Such attitudes aren’t helpful. We should reinvent the laundrette as a key part of the shift towards a more sustainable, sharing economy.",2020-12-19T19:40:56.382884Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:12:40.049699Z,704,120,,"There has been a lot of debate recently on the extent of the global fishing footprint. A recent paper claimed that fishing affects 55% of the world’s oceans. Given that many people in the developing world rely on fish as their main source of protein, and the increasing preference for luxury fish products in countries such as China, such statistics might seem plausible. To calculate the 55% figure, the researchers relied on the automatic identification system (AIS). Primarily intended for safety purposes, AIS combines radio and satellite monitoring with other electronic data such as speed, heading and destination port, to track, monitor and even predict vessel activity. All vessels over a certain size must have an AIS transceiver, so this widespread monitoring produced the huge amounts of data that allowed the researchers to estimate the global fishing footprint. However, when determining what proportion of the ocean is being fished, the scale at which the fishing activity is mapped makes a significant difference to the accuracy of the overall result. Using higher resolution data, with grid squares of between one and 3km², rather than 1,000km² for example, produces a footprint which differs by a factor of more than ten. We need to manage the impact of human activity on ecosystems, but doing so demands a more accurate understanding of fishing. In a similar way to other food production systems, fisheries can have a wide range of effects on the ecosystems and species that they interact with. Wild capture fisheries are also vulnerable to over-fishing unless they are well managed and regulated. For this management to be effective, we need to know how much fishing is taking place, where it is happening, and the exact type of fishing that it is.   Such a high level of accuracy is especially important when looking at the impact of bottom trawling. Many forms of fishing have a wide impact on the ecosystem. But no fishing activity exemplifies this better than bottom trawling, which sees large, heavy nets being towed across the seabed. It is associated with the removal of species from the seafloor and temporary or longer-lasting modification of habitats. This has become a particularly emotive issue with campaigns seeking to outlaw its use.   However, bottom trawl fishing is a key source of food, accounting for 25% of global landings. With such high demands, we can’t simply stop the practice dead in its tracks. The impacts can be managed, but first we need to understand where bottom trawling occurs and how often, so it can be done in a sustainable way.  For our newly published research, we looked into the true extent of bottom trawling around the world. We used high resolution vessel monitoring data to reconstruct fishing footprints for 24 regions of the sea of less than 9km² each. We found that, on average, only 14% of this area was affected by bottom trawling. There were, however, major regional differences. For example, trawling affects less than 10% of the Australian and New Zealand seabed, compared to over 50% in some European seas.  Funded in part by the Marine Stewardship Council, this research will facilitate the implementation of sustainable fishing practices around the world. It also demonstrates that when fisheries are well-managed and sustainably fished, the associated impacts on the seabed are reduced, compared to other less well managed fisheries. In other words, if you manage the fishing of the target species appropriately you’ll probably also succeed in reducing other effects of fishing activity.  Some habitats are also highly resilient to the effects of trawling, whereas others are more vulnerable and take decades to recover. Recent advances in our understanding of the effects of bottom trawls mean that it is now possible to predict their impact and to suggest pragmatic ways to reduce those impacts through different management options, such as by directing fishing activity away from sensitive areas of the seabed to more resilient areas. These new advances in understanding pave the way for a truly ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, in which we can manage target species and the wider effects of fishing on the seabed. This is the approach taken by the Marine Stewardship Council fisheries standard, which integrates the full range of ecosystem effects of fishing.  So, what challenges remain? While AIS data is publicly available, it covers only a proportion of the world’s fishing fleet. Vessel monitoring systems (VMS) are used for a larger selection of the world’s fishing fleets, but can be shrouded in confidentiality issues (the data is usually considered the property of fishermen). In addition, small-scale vessels, which in many places account for the largest proportion of fishing boats, are not monitored at present.  However, much data does still exist that can guide improvements in the management of fishing impact. It is critical that we interpret this data properly, using appropriate resolution mapping, to avoid inaccurate representations of the size and extent of fishing’s footprint on the oceans.",2020-12-21T17:12:40.049733Z,1

After completion of weather station surveys for USHCN and other

On June 3, 2020, npj Climate and Atmospheric Science published a study by Athanasiadis et al. 2020, in which the authors investigated the question of whether changes in the frequency of blocked weather situations in the North Atlantic and Central European region are predictable.
“Quite some nonsense”
Previously, scientists inclined towards climate alarmism had told us that CO2 would lead to more and more blocked weather situations. Quite some nonsense as it now turns out, because the blockings are more likely to be due to the 60-year AMO ocean cycle, which in turn affects the NAO. These are exciting results.
Here’s the abstract:
Decadal predictability of North Atlantic blocking and the NAO
Can multi-annual variations in the frequency of North Atlantic atmospheric blocking and mid-latitude circulation regimes be skilfully predicted? Recent advances in seasonal forecasting have shown that mid-latitude climate variability does exhibit significant predictability. However, atmospheric predictability has generally been found to be quite limited on multi-annual timescales. New decadal prediction experiments from NCAR are found to exhibit remarkable skill in reproducing the observed multi-annual variations of wintertime blocking frequency over the North Atlantic and of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) itself. This is partly due to the large ensemble size that allows the predictable component of the atmospheric variability to emerge from the background chaotic component. The predictable atmospheric anomalies represent a forced response to oceanic low-frequency variability that strongly resembles the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), correctly reproduced in the decadal hindcasts thanks to realistic ocean initialization and ocean dynamics. The occurrence of blocking in certain areas of the Euro-Atlantic domain determines the concurrent circulation regime and the phase of known teleconnections, such as the NAO, consequently affecting the stormtrack and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Therefore, skilfully predicting the decadal fluctuations of blocking frequency and the NAO may be used in statistical predictions of near-term climate anomalies, and it provides a strong indication that impactful climate anomalies may also be predictable with improved dynamical models.”

,2020-12-19T16:06:59.393266Z,710,120,,"In the third of a century since its founding, the Cato Institute’s scholars have issued a wealth of predictions about the likely effects of government policies and programs. While sometimes ignored or belittled, these predictions have often proved prescient.



Most famous was Joe Stilwell’s Policy Analysis published in 1982. In “The Savings & Loan Industry: Averting Collapse,” Stilwell warned that, “regardless of changes in the economic climate, numerous S&Ls will be unable to meet their financial obligations.” Few in government listened then. Through the remainder of the decade, Americans would have been better off if they had, before the taxpayers had to come up with a $500 billion rescue plan.



In 1982, Cato founder and president Edward H. Crane wrote about his recent visit to the Soviet Union. “It is a society that appears to be crumbling from within,” Crane wrote. He added, “If we can avoid confrontation with the Soviets over the next 20 years, their system should collapse of its own bureaucratic weight.” Such a prediction sounded crazy at the time. And indeed Crane’s estimate was off target.



The Soviet Union vanished, in not 20 years, but 9.



Stanley Kober, a research fellow in foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, warned in a 1996 paper that “the terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other countries suggest that the trend in the Middle East is not nearly as hopeful as it appeared just a few years ago,” and he identified Osama bin Laden as a particular terrorist threat to the United States.



In a study he published in February 2001, Daniel Griswold wrote, “A domestic recession would reduce the trade deficit, as it has in the past, but at great cost to U.S. workers and their families.” A month later, the U.S. economy slipped into recession and the trade deficit declined in 2001 compared to 2000, after having risen in each of the previous five years. Then came the Great Recession, beginning in 2008. The trade deficit in 2009 was $300 billion smaller than in the pre‐​recession year of 2007.



In few areas have Cato scholars been more consistently correct and more consistently outside the mainstream consensus than the Iraq war. In 1999, Ted Galen Carpenter argued that “removing a thug like Saddam … is extremely ill‐​advised. It will make Washington responsible for Iraq’s political future and entangle the United States in an endless nation‐​building mission beset by intractable problems.” William Niskanen wrote in the _Chicago Sun‐​Times_ in December 2001, “Another war in Iraq may serve bin Laden’s objective of unifying radical Muslims around the world in a jihad against the United States.” In 2002, Doug Bandow warned that, “If Iraq’s forces don’t quickly crumble, the U.S. might find itself involved in urban conflict that will be costly in human and political terms.” And in March 2003, Christopher Preble argued America’s experiences with nation‐​building in Germany and Japan advise against attempting the same with Iraq. “If these ‘success’ stories reflect the model for post‐​war Iraq,” Preble wrote, “we should expect the U.S. to remain in this troubled region for many years.” Returning to domestic affairs, in March 2007, Jim Harper said in congressional testimony: “Mr. Chairman, the REAL ID Act is a dead letter. All that remains is for Congress to declare it so.” More than three years later, REAL ID, an attempt by the federal government to establish a national personal identification system, has gone nowhere, and two major implementation deadlines have passed.



In February 2009, when President Obama’s approval rating was in the mid‐​60s and most political opinion makers thought he was on the cusp of radically remaking America, Gene Healy published his first weekly column in the _D.C. Examiner_. Healy wrote, “When he fails to fully heal our financial troubles, fix health care, teach our children well, provide balm for our itchy souls, and so forth, his hopeaddled rhetoric will seem all the more grating, and the public will increasingly come to see him as the source of all American woes.” By July 2010, according to Gallup, President Obama’s approval rating had fallen to 44 percent, the lowest of his presidency, and his party was fearing considerable losses in the upcoming congressional elections.



As Healy predicted, President Obama did fail to fix health care. Instead, he ushered through Congress the ill‐​considered legislation known as ObamaCare.



Michael Cannon predicted in September 2009, six months before the bill’s passage, that ObamaCare’s individual mandate would force as many as half of all Americans with private insurance to switch to a more expensive plan. At the time, the administration insisted this was fantasy. In June, it all but admitted Cannon was right, prompting the _New York Times_ to write that “the rules appear to fall short of the sweeping commitments President Obama made while trying to reassure the public in the fight over health legislation.” Even earlier was Michael Tanner’s 2006 paper, “Individual Mandates for Health Insurance: Slippery Slope to National Health Care.” Later that same year, Massachusetts enacted health care legislation that included an individual mandate. The results have followed Tanner’s script exactly. RomneyCare’s individual mandate took effect in 2006, along with health insurance exchanges. Subsequently, 16 mandates have been added to the original list of benefits that health insurers must provide in the Bay State. Massachusetts now has the most rapidly increasing premiums in the nation. The most recent attempt to control costs, as Tanner predicted, was to simply prohibit insurers from increasing premium rates, leading insurance companies to predict that they will suffer from hundreds of millions of dollars in losses this year. In addition, wait times have increased to see both primary‐​care physicians and specialists, just as Tanner’s paper said they would.



The fact that policymakers failed to take Cato scholars’ warnings of the last 30 years to heart, makes it only more crucial that they do so in the next 30.",2020-12-19T16:06:59.393317Z,1

In addition to the air conditioner, this USHCN climate monitoring station sports several other features:
– A building just 14.3 feet away
– Convenient close-by radiator forward parking for your vehicle within feet of the MMTS sensor
– An asphalt road within 10-15 feet of the sensor
– A mature shade tree that changes shade patterns with the season
– A station move of about 150 feet closer to the building to accommodate the new MMTS sensor cable length
The station is operated by the International Paper Company. The plot of temperature below illustrates some data gaps and jumps that may be related to station moves.

Finally a scientific study showing that global warming is killing us after all! See all you climate change optimists have been wrong all along, human-caused global warming is a threat to our health and welfare.   
  
Not so fast.   
  
Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the authors of that study—which examined heat-related mortality in Stockholm, Sweden—failed to include the impacts of adaptation in their analysis as well as the possibility that some of the temperature rise which has taken place in Stockholm is not from “global” climate change but rather local and regional processes not at all related to human greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
What the researchers Daniel Oustin Åström and his colleagues left out of their original analysis, we (Chip Knappenberger, Pat Michaels, and Anthony Watts) factored in. And when we did so, we arrived at the distinct possibility that global warming actually led to a reduction in the rate of heat-related mortality in Stockholm.   
  
Our findings have just been published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change as a Comment on the original Oustin Åström paper (which was published in the same journal).   
  
We were immediately skeptical because the original Oustin Åström results run contrary to a solid body of scientific evidence (including our own) that shows that heat-related mortality and the population’s sensitivity to heat waves was been declining in major cities across America and Europe as people take adaptive measures to protect themselves from the rising heat.



Contrarily, Oudin Åström reported that as a result of an increase in the number of heat waves occurring in Stockholm, more people died from extreme heat during the latter portion of the 20th century than would have had the climate of Stockholm been similar to what it was in the early part of the 20th century—a time during which fewer heat waves were recorded. The implication was that global warming from increasing human greenhouse gas emissions was killing people from increased heat.   
  
But the variability in the climate of Stockholm is a product of much more than human greenhouse gas emissions. Variations in the natural patterns of regional-scale atmospheric circulation, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as well as local impacts associated with urbanization and environmental changes in the direct vicinity of the thermometer are reflected in the city’s temperature history, and the original Oudin Åström et al. publication did not take this into account. This effect is potentially significant as Stockholm is one of Europe’s fastest growing cities.   
  
But regardless of the cause, rising temperatures spur adaptation. Expanded use of air conditioning, biophysical changes, behavior modification, and community awareness programs are all examples of actions which take place to make us better protected from the dangers associated with heat waves. Additionally, better medical practices, building practices, etc. have further reduced heat-related stress and mortality over the years.   
  
The net result is that as result of the combination of all the adaptive measures that have taken place over the course of the 20th century in Stockholm, on average people currently die in heat waves at a rate four times less than they did during the beginning of the 20th century. The effect of adaptation overwhelms the effect of an increase in the number of heat waves.   
  
In fact, it is not a stretch to say that much of the adaptation has likely occurred because of an increased frequency of heat waves. As heat waves become more common, the better adapted to them the population becomes.

Contrarily, Oudin Åström reported that as a result of an increase in the number of heat waves occurring in Stockholm, more people died from extreme heat during the latter portion of the 20th century than would have had the climate of Stockholm been similar to what it was in the early part of the 20th century—a time during which fewer heat waves were recorded. The implication was that global warming from increasing human greenhouse gas emissions was killing people from increased heat.   
  
But the variability in the climate of Stockholm is a product of much more than human greenhouse gas emissions. Variations in the natural patterns of regional-scale atmospheric circulation, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as well as local impacts associated with urbanization and environmental changes in the direct vicinity of the thermometer are reflected in the city’s temperature history, and the original Oudin Åström et al. publication did not take this into account. This effect is potentially significant as Stockholm is one of Europe’s fastest growing cities.   
  
But regardless of the cause, rising temperatures spur adaptation. Expanded use of air conditioning, biophysical changes, behavior modification, and community awareness programs are all examples of actions which take place to make us better protected from the dangers associated with heat waves. Additionally, better medical practices, building practices, etc. have further reduced heat-related stress and mortality over the years.   
  
The net result is that as result of the combination of all the adaptive measures that have taken place over the course of the 20th century in Stockholm, on average people currently die in heat waves at a rate four times less than they did during the beginning of the 20th century. The effect of adaptation overwhelms the effect of an increase in the number of heat waves.   
  
In fact, it is not a stretch to say that much of the adaptation has likely occurred because of an increased frequency of heat waves. As heat waves become more common, the better adapted to them the population becomes.   
  
Our analysis highlights one of the often overlooked intricacies of the human response to climate change—the fact that the response to climate change can actually improve public health and welfare.   
  
Which, by the way, is a completely different view than the one taken by the current Administration.

The DOE’s determination of the SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide — two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions. It is also at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses. It is based upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which have little utility because of their great uncertainties. They provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) (whose results were incorporated by the DOE in this action), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnection between climate changes and the SCC value.

Vahrenholt called the Energiewende: “An impending disaster.”
According to the Westfälische Nachricten here, “Scientists for Future activists handed out leaflets to emphasize that in their opinion the climate models of the IPCC (‘Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’) accurately depicted climate warming and that only trace gas CO2 was responsible for it.”

But Vahrenholt, former environment senator of Hamburg, refuted the claims and showed why he thought CO2 is only half responsible for climate change today and that the rest was due to natural factors like sun and clouds.
In his 45-minute presentation, Vahrenholt showed those in attendance how Germany’s foray into green energies was doomed to fail. As leaders in Germany continue to insist wind energy is able to supply the country’s energy needs, Vahrenholt – an environmentalist and one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement – pointed out the major technical obstacle: the inability to store wind energy for periods of low wind.
“Not even in the grid, like one well-known Green politician claimed,” said Vahrenholt, taking a shot at Green party leader Annalena Baerbock, who once famously claimed the power grid could store energy.
German electricity prices among world’s highest
Vahrenholt also reminded that the Energiewende has made Germany’s electricity prices among the highest in the world and that it would hit the poor especially hard. “I never understood the SPD here,” said Vahrenholt, criticizing his own party. The retired professor said it would take 90,000 wind turbines to supply Germany with electricity, a number that would lead to the country having a turbine every 2 kilometers.
The Westfälische Nachrichten sums up on whether the Energiewende is going to work:
At the end of the complex, 45-minute presentation, the majority in the hall were probably convinced: it can’t. The facts and figures presented by the environmentalist were too overwhelming.”

,2020-12-19T12:50:48.907037Z,720,118,,"In his May encyclical, Pope Francis captured reader interest with an appeal to the deep sense of awe stemming from our attempts to comprehend complex natural processes of geology, biology, climatology, and others that comprise our ecosystem.



Unfortunately, interwoven with the science are familiar Malthusian ideological themes: excessive consumption by wealthy nations is responsible for climate change and the world’s poor are negatively and disproportionately affected’.





It is now within our power to export energy to poor, friendly nations and trading partners to help them keep their lights on, warm their homes, refrigerate their food and power their industry.



Not to worry though, because the encyclical follows up with matching ideological solutions. It implies that wealthy Western nations need to: quickly restrict and eventually eliminate all fossil fuel consumption, rush to develop renewable energy resources to power the Earth and clean up the environment, enable third world nations to eventually begin using renewables in their own grid, and, of course, foot the bill for all of it.



Part of the encyclical’s theme actually mirrors EPA’s recently published Clean Power Plan (CPP). Both documents attempt to foist expensive, unreliable, and unworkable “renewable” solar and wind power upon situations where it will not deliver for either wealthy nations or third world countries.



Pope Francis should realize we are truly blessed with our abundant energy resources. Just this year, the United States became the world’s top producer of oil and gas, and there is no end in sight to the vast energy supplies contained within our country and in other nations. Oil and natural gas production, particularly from the enormous U.S. shale‐​bearing basins, are at record‐​breaking levels and prices are continuing to drop — an enormous help to the poor, who spend an inordinate amount of their earnings on energy.



Now, for the first time in many years, we are taking more control of our energy and environmental future, and that of our allies. Supplies of oil and gas appear to be abundant worldwide. Thankfully, using cleaner natural gas in place of coal for power generation has cut carbon emissions by over 50 per cent, and that number is continuing to fall.



It follows that other countries are slowly gaining the extensive knowledge required to produce from shale, and some undeveloped countries can now see themselves participating in the “shale revolution” and producing sufficient energy to build their economies and address their national dreams and desires, just as we have done in the U.S. and in other Western nations.



As the Pope surely knows, the scriptures (Psalm 104:24 for example) teach that mankind is endowed with the wealth from the earth — from the rocks, surface waters, lifeforms, oceans, and atmosphere — and that we derive various forms and quantities of energy from each of these environments to sustain our lives and our progeny. It would appear that the papal encyclical’s discussion on man’s use of energy resources contains a major contradiction that must be addressed.",2020-12-19T12:50:48.907072Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:29:28.420827Z,724,120,,"China’s born‐​again planners, led by President Jiang Zemin, are addicted to the idea that social and economic order areimpossible without the firm hand of the state. The Ninth Five‐​Year Plan (1996–2000) reconfirms the Chinese CommunistParty’s (CCP’s) faith in socialism and distrust of capitalism. The plan embraces the illusion that it is possible to revitalizestate‐​owned enterprises by a change in management rather than ownership. 



To think that China’s ruling elite can control an economy of 1.2 billion people is a fatal conceit. The failure of central planningand of communism throughout the world is testimony to the ill‐​fated desire to engage in social engineering. Indeed, recentstudies have shown that those countries that have fostered economic freedom have experienced greater wealth creation thanhave those that have failed to protect economic liberties. And as people have acquired greater economic freedom, they havedemanded other significant rights, including the right to participate in political life. That demand is exactly what worries China’shard-liners. 



Institutional innovation in China since 1978 has produced the fastest economic growth in the world and enlarged opportunitiesfor many people, but it has not eliminated the main obstacle to China’s future prosperity — the CCP. The party’s monopoly ofpower has been eroded by the market‐​based reforms of China’s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, but with the Deng eraending, China is at a crossroads. The nation must decide whether to deepen reform and risk pressures for political change orslow reform and risk alienating China’s newly emerging middle class and fomenting social unrest. The dilemma is complicatedby the advent of democracy in Taiwan and the return of Hong Kong in 1997. 



**China at a Crossroads**



In less than two decades China has become one of the top 10 trading nations in the world. Over the past decade nearly $90billion in direct foreign investment has flowed into China’s emerging markets. If the Chinese economy continues to grow at anaverage annual rate of 9 percent, it could soon become the world’s largest. 



The challenge for China is to develop the hard institutional infrastructure of a market economy. The centerpiece of thatinfrastructure is a rule of law that protects property rights and limits the power of government. Therein lies the difficulty, for theCCP is unlikely to give up its power and let freedom reign. Nevertheless, there are internal and external forces at work thatmay push China in the direction of greater liberalization and democratization. Internally, China’s reformers have created aneconomic space that allows individuals the freedom to improve their living standards outside the state sector. Externally,China’s “open‐​door” policy has allowed foreign competition and know‐​how to help the nonstate sector grow. In the process,new business practices have evolved along with legal norms associated with a market‐​liberal order. 



The Ninth Five‐​Year Plan may slow China’s march toward the market, but it won’t stop it. The forces for change are toostrong. And the further the market advances, the more costly it will become for the CCP to try to reverse it. Yet it is clear fromChina’s saber rattling on the eve of Taiwan’s ascension to democratic rule that China’s authoritarian rulers are willing to incurconsiderable economic losses to protect their positions of power and privilege. That willingness is further evidenced by China’svow to crush any democratic movement in Hong Kong after 1997. 



The dilemma facing Western leaders is whether to contain China and risk military confrontation or to peacefully engage Chinawith the knowledge that the best way to foster human rights is by opening markets and cultivating exchanges — not by using theblunt instrument of economic sanctions or the rhetoric of China bashing. 



In evaluating their options, Western leaders should heed the lesson of Taiwan — a police state that turned into a free‐​marketdemocracy because economic liberalization led to political liberalization. Taiwan’s leaders were willing to experiment withinstitutional change and had the courage to let the people speak — in the market and in the polity. 



China, too, has created a new economic space but has resisted political change. Even so, there is reason to believe China mayfollow Taiwan’s “quiet revolution.” According to Lee Teng‐​hui, Taiwan’s first democratically elected president, “Vigorouseconomic development leads to independent thinking. People hope to be able to fully satisfy their free will and see their rightsfully protected. And then demand ensues for political reform.” Thus, he predicts, “The model of our quiet revolution willeventually take hold on the Chinese mainland.” 



**Deng’s Experiment**



The key to China’s progress has been its willingness to allow institutional change on a trial‐​and‐​error basis and to promotesuccess. Like Taiwan, China has reduced the relative size of the state sector by cultivating the nonstate sector, not byprivatizing large state enterprises. State‐​owned firms now account for only 25 percent of China’s total output (includingagriculture and services), and their share of industrial output has fallen from 80 percent in 1978 to 40 percent today. 



On the heels of the failure of central planning, Deng had no grand vision for institutional change, but he was willing toexperiment. His guiding principle was, “Once we are sure that something should be done, we should dare to experiment andbreak a new path.” 



Deng began to break a new path in 1978, when he launched his agricultural reform. Communal ownership of land wasabolished and a system of contractual relations was introduced through the “household responsibility system.” Rural familieswere allowed to hold long‐​term leases and acquired the right to use the land at their disposal. They could sell their crops in theopen market, provided they first satisfied the state quota. Under the new incentive structure, farmers increased production andbegan to invest their profits in town and village enterprises (TVEs), which are beyond the reach of state ministries. 



Although TVEs are legally owned by local governments, individual households are allowed to share profits, hold(nontransferable) shares, and receive dividends. Wages are tied to profits, and the managers of TVEs face hard budgetconstraints, unlike the politically motivated managers of state‐​owned enterprises (SOEs). As a result, TVEs have mushroomedwhile SOEs continue to whither on the vine of state subsidies. 



In addition to creating new ownership arrangements, Deng’s reforms decontrolled prices, opened China to the outside worldthrough trade liberalization and the establishment of Special Economic Zones, devolved power from the central government tolocal governments, and instituted a system of fiscal contracts that limited Beijing’s share of tax revenue and provided localofficials with an incentive to promote markets — a system Yingyi Qian and Barry Weingast have called “market‐​preservingfederalism.” Those institutional changes resulted in a parallel economic structure to compete with the SOEs, reduced thecentral government’s share of tax revenue from 60 percent in 1978 to 40 percent in 1993, and helped weaken the centralgovernment’s grip on everyday life. 



Those reforms, however, have failed to create a genuine market system founded on the principles of private ownership andfreedom of contract. The goal of China’s born‐​again planners is not market liberalism but market socialism. The resultant lackof clear rules at the enterprise level and attempts to plan the market are, in the absence of a constitution that protects propertyand contracts, reflections of what F. A. Hayek aptly called the “fatal conceit” of socialism. 



**Revitalizing Civil Society**



The quiet revolution that has been taking place in China’s economy since 1978 is combining with the information revolution tostrengthen the fabric of civil society and weaken the CCP. As China has expanded the freedom to earn a living outside thestate sector, individuals have gained greater control over their lives. In its 1994 report on human rights, the U.S. Department ofState noted the connection between economic rights and human rights: “A decade of rapid economic growth, spurred bymarket incentives and foreign investment, has reduced party and government control over the economy and permitted everlarger numbers of Chinese to have more control of their lives and livelihood.” 



People are learning how markets work by participating in the growing nonstate sector and by engaging in foreign trade. As themarket has replaced Marx, newly acquired ideas and wealth have given rise to a spirit of independence and to a rebirth of civilsociety, especially in China’s southern coastal provinces. Commenting on China’s cultural transformation, Jianying Zha writes inher book _China Pop_ , 



The economic reforms have created new opportunities, new dreams, and to some extent, a new atmosphereand new mindsets. The old control system has weakened in many areas, especially in the spheres of economyand lifestyle. There is a growing sense of increased space for personal freedom [so long as people stay out ofpolitics].



Anyone who has visited China and seen the vibrancy of the market, the dynamism of the people, and the rapid growth ofurban areas will concur with Zha’s cautious optimism. 



New towns and cities are evolving naturally as people flee the countryside for improved living conditions and the chance tostrike it rich in the nonstate sector. Villages that were once small fishing centers along the southern coast are now booming withthe flow of trade and people. The new urban centers, such as Shishi in the province of Fujian, are characterized by the market,not the plan. Their model of development, writes Kathy Chen of the _Wall Street Journal_ , is “small government, big society[ _xiao zhenfu, da shehui_ ] — which advocates less involvement by cash‐​strapped governments and more by society.” 



Ambitious young people want to become capitalists, not communists. A recent survey found that young people ranked beingan entrepreneur first among 16 job choices and employment with the national government eighth. Freer labor markets have ledto a growing demand among college students for business courses, and universities are responding. The CCP has lost much ofits credibility and is no longer the major route to success. 



The freedom to trade is an important human right in China. As trade expands, there will be a growing middle class with a largestake in China’s future. Moreover, China’s high savings rate gives all those who sacrifice current consumption and invest theirearnings in the nonstate sector a strong incentive to further depoliticize economic life. The formation of economic and civilsociety will lead to a natural call for greater participation in political life. Yet as long as the CCP stands in the way of thespontaneous market order, controls the flow of information, and prevents free association, the future of China’s civil societywill be in jeopardy. 



**Institutional Change and Democratization**



If democratization is to proceed in China, the government must continue to allow experimentation and new forms ofownership. Yuan Mu recently articulated the key role of ownership reform in the Beijing press: “We should discover the bestmodel for ownership by the whole people [notice the bias against privatization], so that they will genuinely become the mainbody of market competition and operate with vigor and vitality in accordance with the rules of the market economy.” 



Those rules will evolve as individuals grope for ways to lower the costs of exchange and expand markets. In _China Pop_ , Zhaquotes Liu Ge, a lawyer trained in both China and the United States, as saying, 



Gradually, there will be more laws and rules; the market will be more mature, more compatible withinternational standards, the competition more fair and open. Then, China will have been structurallytransformed! Political change will come after that.



According to Zha, “A lot of the educated urban Chinese … echo this way of thinking.” There is reason to believe, therefore,that institutional change in China will bring about what Princeton University professor Pei Minxin has called “creepingdemocratization.” 



Pei points to the upward mobility of ordinary people, occasioned by the deepening of market reform, and to the positiveimpact of China’s “open‐​door” policy on political norms. In his view, public opinion and knowledge of Western liberaltraditions, such as the rule of law, “have set implicit limits on the state’s use of power” and have promoted the democratizationof the legal system. People are starting to use the court system to contest government actions that affect their lives, liberty, andproperty. There has been a sharp rise in the number of civil lawsuits against the state, and individuals are beginning towin — perhaps as many as 20 percent of — their cases, according to official sources. 



The opening of the legal system is important because it paves the way for the transition from “rule by law” to “rule of law.“Marcus Brauchli of the _Wall Street Journal_ writes, 



The state’s steel‐​clad monopoly on the legal process, which makes the courts just another arm of government,is corroding. China’s economic liberalization … has spawned a parallel legal reform that raises the prospect ofrule of, not merely by, law.



Nevertheless, Brauchli recognizes that “legal ambiguity” remains “a ruthless weapon” for harassing the population. Until thatfacet of China’s institutional structure changes, no one’s rights will be secure. 



**China’s Future**



The challenge for China is to get out of the way of the market and let it grow naturally along with civil society. Doing so,however, requires an understanding of the institutional infrastructure that makes the market system tick and an appreciation ofthe spontaneous order that emerges when private property and freedom of contract are protected by a rule of law.Democracy is neither necessary nor sufficient for a market system — as the experience of Hong Kong has illustrated. What isnecessary is a stable legal framework that protects life, liberty, and property. If China is to prosper in the global economy, thenation will have to adopt common‐​law practices and abide by international commercial codes and customs. Old habits arehard to break, but the forces for change are strong, and there is reason to believe that China will “creep along in the rightdirection.” 



China has been willing to experiment, but it has not yet provided the climate of freedom necessary for growing market‐​liberalinstitutions. In fact, there is an effort to give the central government greater power by ending the system of fiscal federalism.Putting more money into the pockets of Beijing bureaucrats by recentralizing the tax system, however, is not the answer toChina’s problems. Nor will improving the management of SOEs do anything to solve the problems of loss‐​ridden enterprisesthat have no real owners. 



Real stability will come to China only when its leaders abandon their fatal conceit and realize that it is impossible to plan themarket or society. Although the leadership is willing to tolerate gradual reform to keep the economy strong, there is noindication that they will tolerate political reform. The crackdown on dissidents, especially the arrest of Henry Wu and WeiJingsheng, is a clear signal to Hong Kong and the rest of the world that democratic rule is unacceptable. The West should notconfuse economic liberalization with a desire for democratization. 



Foreign pressure is unlikely to foster positive political change in China. Indeed, such pressure is likely to be counterproductive.Beijing’s frosty attitude toward the United States and our confrontational approach to China will do little to promote stability inEast Asia or to advance human rights in China. Economic sanctions and partial removal of most‐​favored‐​nation trade status forChina would surely damage China, but they might damage the wrong people. Sanctions or higher tariffs could inflict harm onthose who are fleeing the state sector for greater opportunities and freedom in the market sector, and protectionist measuresclearly would harm U.S. consumers and Americans who do business in China. 



To depoliticize economic life, China needs constitutional change and new thinking. As Chinese scholar Jixuan Hu writes, “Bysetting up a minimum group of constraints and letting human creativity work freely, we can create a better society withouthaving to design it in detail. That is not a new idea, it is the idea of law, the idea of a constitution.” Ultimately it is up to theChinese people to shape their own institutions and to secure their fundamental rights, including the right to self‐​government. 



The United States, as the world’s leading constitutional democracy, should spread its ethos of liberty by keeping its marketsopen and extolling the principles that made it great. It should not play the dangerous game of pitting human rights activistsagainst free traders. China should be admitted to the World Trade Organization as soon as possible and be givenmost‐​favored‐​nation status unconditionally. 



It may take another generation for China’s quiet revolution to succeed, but with patience and foresight China may yet joinTaiwan in a mutually beneficial alliance based on free markets and free people.

While not great for stress levels in general, there are other ways that the daily churn through traffic can negatively affect health. Research by my team at the University of Surrey has shown how drivers and pedestrians are being exposed to very high levels of air pollutants at traffic lights. The World Health Organisation links air pollution to seven million premature deaths every year. It’s well known that road vehicles in particular emit polluting nanoparticles which contribute to respiratory and heart diseases. Despite efforts to encourage a reduction, car usage has remained fairly constant in recent decades. Our team monitored drivers’ exposure to air pollutants at various points of a journey and found traffic intersections were high pollution hot-spots due to the frequent changes in driving conditions. With drivers decelerating and stopping at lights, then revving up to move quickly when lights go green, peak particle concentration was found to be 29 times higher than that during free-flowing traffic conditions. Also of course, while travelling by road we are generally pretty close to the air pollution source, which is the tailpipe of preceding road vehicle.  Though drivers spend just 2% of their journey time passing through intersections managed by traffic lights, this short duration contributes to about 25% of total exposure to these harmful particles. It’s not always possible to change your route to avoid these intersections, but drivers should be aware of the increased risks at busy lights and at least try to avoid regularly taking routes that force them to sit in traffic inhaling potentially harmful fumes. Where this is unavoidable the best way to limit exposure is to keep vehicle windows shut, fans off and try to increase the distance between the cars in front where possible. Pedestrians regularly crossing such routes should consider whether there might be other paths less dependent on traffic light crossings. But there is more to it than asking drivers to take circuitous routes. Local transport agencies could also help by synchronising traffic signals to reduce waiting time and consider alternative traffic management systems such as flyovers. They could also consider the appropriate placement of traffic lights. The use of these systems in built up residential areas, near schools or hospitals may serve to manage traffic flow but at the cost of trapping higher concentrations of harmful pollutants in exactly the areas where residents, and vulnerable members of society will most regularly commute or walk. I have written before about the use of low-cost sensing to capture air pollution hotspots in urban areas. The kind of data such projects could deliver feed directly into research such as this. The more we understand about where pollution hot spots are, the more direct action we can take in our own lives and the more we can push for greener, cleaner planning. The UK’s Environmental Audit Committee recently described air pollution as a “public health crisis”. These considerations are not just a “nice to have”, they have a direct effect on our health and wellbeing.",2020-12-19T12:51:04.124179Z,1

So far Kachelmann has yet to receive an explanation from the WMO.
Like the ECMWF model for the next 45 days shows, the northern hemisphere has extensive cool patches, and so no signs of a “record breaking northern hemisphere summer this year.
Whether it’s the World Health organization (WHO or the WMO, global institutions set up to guide policy are doing a lousy job and are in need of extensive reform, as some leaders have already called for.

By Michael Limburg, EIKE
(Translated, edited by P. Gosselin)

Dr. Siegfried Frederick Singer

Yesterday, our mentor and good friend, the outstanding scientist S. Fred Singer passed away – peacefully and quietly at the age of 95. Without the constant encouragement we received from this outstanding scientist from the very beginning, the founding of EIKE and our commitment to the dissemination of the scientific facts on climate change would not have been possible here in Germany.


Dr. Fred Singer as the keynote speaker at the first European Climate and Energy conference on May 30, 2007.
Distinguished career spanning 7 decades
Dr. Singer was the keynote speaker at our very first Climate Change Conference in Berlin in 2007 at the premises of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Freedom (IUF) on May 30, 2007, immediately after our founding. And he remained loyal to us in all subsequent years, even though in recent years his physical condition made the long journeys from his home in Virginia increasingly difficult.
But his unrestrained desire not to let science degenerate into a water-boy for politics, which was particularly evident in the increasing appropriation of environmental science by politics, allowed him to marshal all the strength his body could muster.
Fortunately for us all, he was able to do so for almost one and half decades. No one would have been more predestined than him to see exactly this monopolization, because he came directly from science and always worked there in outstanding positions. A short and partial look at his extraordinary curriculum vitae shows.
Father of U.S. weather satellites
His scientific work has also been published over 200 times in leading scientific journals. In 1954, President Eisenhower even awarded him a special prize from the White House for his work.
Without any exaggeration it can be said that S.Fred Singer can be called the father of the US weather satellites. Atmospheric physics was his domain.

(Translated, edited by P. Gosselin)

Dr. Siegfried Frederick Singer

Yesterday, our mentor and good friend, the outstanding scientist S. Fred Singer passed away – peacefully and quietly at the age of 95. Without the constant encouragement we received from this outstanding scientist from the very beginning, the founding of EIKE and our commitment to the dissemination of the scientific facts on climate change would not have been possible here in Germany.


Dr. Fred Singer as the keynote speaker at the first European Climate and Energy conference on May 30, 2007.
Distinguished career spanning 7 decades
Dr. Singer was the keynote speaker at our very first Climate Change Conference in Berlin in 2007 at the premises of the Institute for Entrepreneurial Freedom (IUF) on May 30, 2007, immediately after our founding. And he remained loyal to us in all subsequent years, even though in recent years his physical condition made the long journeys from his home in Virginia increasingly difficult.
But his unrestrained desire not to let science degenerate into a water-boy for politics, which was particularly evident in the increasing appropriation of environmental science by politics, allowed him to marshal all the strength his body could muster.
Fortunately for us all, he was able to do so for almost one and half decades. No one would have been more predestined than him to see exactly this monopolization, because he came directly from science and always worked there in outstanding positions. A short and partial look at his extraordinary curriculum vitae shows.
Father of U.S. weather satellites
His scientific work has also been published over 200 times in leading scientific journals. In 1954, President Eisenhower even awarded him a special prize from the White House for his work.
Without any exaggeration it can be said that S.Fred Singer can be called the father of the US weather satellites. Atmospheric physics was his domain.

So is Al Gore, who chose to give a completely paranoid speech about global warming in New York two weeks ago, on a day when the temperature was 22 below normal. In a remarkably Dean‐​like rant to the Democratic organization MoveOn, he said that the reason Americans reject his vision of climate‐​Armageddon has more to do with what he called “a massive and well‐​organized campaign of disinformation” on the part of me and my few friends, than it does with the thermometer. 



When it comes to disinformation about climate change, Al’s got competition in the principal beneficiary of Howard Dean’s rhetorical largesse, John Kerry, who looks to me like a cinch for the Democratic nomination. On May 17, 2000, Kerry said:





I’m offering a night of free beer to the first journalist who can come up with a picture of John Kerry wearing a coat in November (and expect to have to pay off within one minute of this column’s publication). But what about that whopper about northern New Hampshire’s ponds?



One lesson in climate hype that Gore never learned (and which may have cost him the presidency) is that people can look up facts pretty quickly now. Gore lost normally Democratic West Virginia because of his hype on global warming and his resultant vitriol against the coal industry. Miners, who he would have put on unemployment, stayed home or voted for Bush. Now Gore’s venting about planetary heating in howling blizzards.



So should Kerry beware. There’s lots of data on the Internet, including a study by the U.S. Geological Survey of “ice‐​out” dates on lakes in northern New Hampshire. That’s the day of the year when you can no longer play hockey.



John Kerry is 60 years old, so it’s safe to say he was playing hockey in northern New Hampshire, his home, from the ages of 7 to 17, or 1950 through 1959, near First Connecticut Lake. The average date of ice‐​out for that period was May 1. From 1991–2000, when, according to Kerry, “you are lucky if the ponds freeze,” the average ice‐​out date is later, on May 5. 



A year later, on May 1, 2001, Kerry said, “This summer the North Pole was water for the first time in recorded history,” a story that was originally carried by the _New York Times_ in September 2000. It was retracted three weeks later as a barrage of scientists protested that open water is common at or near the pole at the end of summer. Further, it’s common knowledge in the scientific community that there has been no net change in Arctic temperatures in the last 70 years.



He went on: “In 1995, after a period of unusual warming, a 48 by 22 mile chunk of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica collapsed.” Disregarding that ice shelves don’t “collapse,” the fact, as accessible as the nearest _Nature_ magazine, is that Antarctica shows a slight cooling trend in recent decades.



Voters need to stay tuned to Kerry on global warming for the Arizona primary on Feb. 3. John McCain, who will do anything to defeat George Bush, has been on a merciless campaign of badgering the president about climate change, including shepherding the first Senate vote to restrict energy use because of global warming, which only failed by eight votes last fall. You can bet Kerry is going to feed off of McCain’s Arizona popularity. He may even entreat him into the Veep slot, claiming to be the ultra‐​centrist and spelling sure defeat for President Bush. 



Anyway, now that he’s the front‐​runner, he’s going to have to watch what he says. Or what he wears. Again, free beer for that picture of him wearing a coat in November.



If Kerry doesn’t check his facts better, he’ll soon be sharing the platform with Al and Howard, trapped in the living hell of the formerly relevant.",2020-12-19T15:27:12.338784Z,1

Berkeley, a contributor for the NYT’s excellent “Economic Perspectives” column, weighs in today with a nice summary of the problematic assumptions made by Sir Nicholas Stern in the oft‐​quoted Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. For those who don’t recall, Stern argued that it makes sense to spend 1 percent of the world’s GDP to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because the costs associated with those emissions might total anywhere between 5–20% of global GDP some time down the road.

The day started off bright and early with the shuttle to the NCAR headquarters, shown above. It’s a unique place, at over 6000 feet up right next to the “flatirons“. Once there, we learned that the conference had been moved to downtown Boulder (somebody forgot to tell the shuttle driver). So we had to wait for the shuttle to return. A new one arrived, and we piled in. Then we sat there and waited because others were coming. As we waited in the sun, someone remarked, “It’s getting hot in the van, open your window” to which I remarked “well, with all these windows, it’s a simple greenhouse experiment”. That brought a chuckle, then “no, really, open he window”. So 10 minutes later, we were on our way in a van that holds 12, we had 7.
The driver informed us he had two stops to make to pickup additional people. We added three at the first stop, and at the second stop, at the invitation of the driver (I don’t mind if you don’t ) we added 6 more people, for a total of 16, all crammed into a van that holds 12.  After that exercise I quipped: “well in addition to our earlier greenhouse experiment, now we are adding population growth in an urban setting” which drew a big laugh – inside joke for climate science, you had to be there.
At the conference we had a busy day, lots of papers on land use changes, urbanization studies, rainfall studies, and one statistical study which really caught my eye because I had lunch with the presenter and he gave me the real inside scoop on the “adjustments” process used to turn raw temperature data into “usable” data. More on that later.
I felt a bit out of place at first, because I’d been away from the scientific community for awhile, and this was the first presentation of this type (mine comes tomorrow) in about 25 years. So I was a bit nervous. That soon faded, as people whom I’ve never met saw my name tag, came up and introduced themselves, and said things like “I’ve been following your work, I’m really looking forward to seeing what you’ve found” “after what I’ve seen on your website, I’m beginning to think the surface temperature record is hopeless, and we should focus elsewhere”. So I started feeling a bit more confident. I didn’t see anybody packing rotten tomatoes, and everyone was very nice today, so I’m hoping for the best tomorrow.
Of course Roger Pelke Sr. was a most gracious host, as was his assistant, Dallas, and it was a comfortable and easy day thanks to their efforts.
Later I’ll have a short summary of some of the papers presented today.

By Die kalte Sonne
(Translated by P. Gosselin)
DER SPIEGEL provides a regular platform for the controversial climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf. On 12 May 2020 he was allowed to:
Stronger temperature rise: Why the climate models are running hot
A guest article by Stefan Rahmstorf
New calculations have alarmed the scientific community – they suggest the earth could be more sensitive to greenhouse gases. Will global warming be stronger than previously thought?
Here the quick reader will suspect one of the usual Rahmstorf climate alarm pieces. And this is exactly how the beginning of the article reads. However, it deals with a tricky topic that will certainly hit the Potsdam scientists quite hard to the stomach.
Huge mishap
In the course of the preparation of the 6th Climate Status Report, the IPCC has again run a large number of climate models. This time, however, a huge mishap has occurred. Several of the models have delivered far too much warming, which is not compatible with the measured data of the last decades. This fundamentally casts the models into question. They suggest that the warming effect of CO2 is far too high. A scandal that should actually cast everything into question.

Rahmstorf plays it dumb at the beginning of the article, luring his readers into the alarm trap. Will everything get much worse than expected? This is the typical Rahmstorf narrative.
“Models are crap”
But if you can make it to the end of the article, you will be surprised. Rahmstorf actually admits quietly that the models are crap, running way too hot.
In reality it’s all not so bad. Rahmstorf writes literally in his article:
The comparative study by researchers from the University of Exeter now shows that in particular the warming since 1975 – i.e. most of the modern global warming – is clearly too strong in the sensitive models. More recent analyses by ETH Zurich, for which more models have already been evaluated, confirm this conclusion. This is a reason to breathe a sigh of relief: there is currently some evidence that these models are not better than the old ones, but are simply too sensitive.“
Did SPIEGEL force its guest author to write this article? Was this a prerequisite for him to continue writing there? A balanced presentation with a fair evaluation of all opinions represented in science has never really been Rahmstorf’s strength.
Obvious failure
Or was it a flight to the front because the modelling failure was all too obvious and Rahmstorf feared complete professional isolation? It’s hard to say.

Stefan Rahmstorf must have struggled for several months before deigning to admit this mishap. This certainly could not have been easy for him.
By the way, here in the blog we have already reported on the topic several times: “The sun in February 2020, science against doom and gloom” and “The sun in November 2019 , when models exaggerate” and “The sun in December 2019, advances in climate science“.

,2020-12-19T16:12:22.676172Z,741,119,,"The amount of renewable, low-carbon, energy the UK produces is increasing, but it is very different to traditional types of power. It can’t just be turned on when wanted. As a result, the capacity market scheme – essentially a programme of subsidies – was set up to help provide backup power when the supply of renewable energy the UK produces is outpaced by demand.  Until recently this was the flagship mechanism for helping the UK meet its climate change reduction targets while maintaining a secure electricity supply. However, on November 15 the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission had failed to properly investigate the scheme, rendering it unlawful. Despite its huge implications, this news was buried beneath blanket coverage of prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which came out at the same time.  Participants in the capacity market scheme – predominately fossil fuel-based power suppliers – were paid per megawatt (MW) for the capacity they offered. In order to offset the risk of investing in less predictable supply, fixed monthly payments were made to these suppliers. The first contracts were agreed at the end of 2014 and their requirement to start providing capacity started last winter.  Funding of up to £2.6 billion a year was set aside in 2012 by the UK government, as it was deemed the most appropriate mechanism for helping meet demand in an increasingly supply-led system.  However, in 2014 Tempus Energy raised objections about the scheme to the European Court of Justice. Its stance was that it favoured the use of fossil fuels rather than considering other mechanisms, such as flexible price incentives for industry and domestic users, which involve reducing costs when there is an abundance of wind and solar, and increasing the cost when there is not. Smart metering is one way in which this can be done on a domestic scale. This can also happen on an industrial level with incentives to increase or reduce demand based on supply levels, for example, Demand Turn Up or Firm Frequency Response. In essence Tempus argued that the scheme made it harder for it and other demand management companies to compete with the well established fossil fuel-based power generators. Under EU state aid rules, member states are obliged to consider alternative ways of meeting market demand for power before subsidising polluting generators. They also require any capacity boosting measures to be designed in a way that provides “adequate incentives” for operators of new, cleaner technologies.  Tempus data shows that the capacity market had predominantly supported fossil fuel providers. Therefore, the UK had effectively been state funding fossil fuel power generators to be on standby to produce power when, and if, there was a shortfall in the electricity being produced. The concern is that by using the scheme to predominantly fund fossil fuel provision, Britain will continue to rely on such technologies into the future, reducing the ability to cut climate change targets and uphold agreements.  So on November 15, the ECJ ruled in favour of Tempus and stated that the European Commission was wrong to clear the scheme for state aid approval in 2014 without looking into it in more detail. As a result the market has been suspended indefinitely.  The decision means the UK government cannot now issue capacity market payments to energy firms. In addition, it cannot hold any further auctions, including the upcoming auctions scheduled to run in January and February 2019 to secure additional power capacity for upcoming winters.    Britain will, most probably, be able to keep the lights on, but it might come at a higher financial cost in the short term. Energy policy in the UK is incredibly complex. There are numerous incentives, taxes and subsidies all with the aim of reducing cost, reducing carbon and meeting green house reduction targets and producing a sustainable supply.  A review of the cost of energy in 2017, by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, outlined the UK’s energy policy to be lacking in terms of consistency and ability to meet the needs of the country. It stated that, “energy policy, regulation and market design are not fit for the purposes of the emerging low carbon energy market”.  It’s hard to move from a dispatchable system to a more supply-led system. All of the UK’s costing models and energy policies are essentially based on the ability to burn something to provide power, and the economics have developed from the traditional supply-and-demand approach. What Britain now needs to do is move from traditional demand based policies to those which include the whole energy system. The capacity market attempted to do part of this by favouring fossil fuels as a mechanism to cope with short term shortfalls in supply. The UK needs to be doing better than this. It must adopt a truly systems-based approach to dealing with its increasing renewable supply.  This ruling, while problematic in the short term, is a long term opportunity to develop a more dynamic and flexible energy system. The UK must invest in demand management programmes rather than only investing in generating assets. Britain needs to embrace a truly low carbon system with active demand management systems alongside renewable technology – enabling it to phase out its reliance on fossil fuels.",2020-12-19T16:12:22.676205Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:32:38.259826Z,742,120,,"Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages, where The Conversation asks experts to answer questions from kids. All questions are welcome: find out how to enter at the bottom of this article.  Why do leaves change colour in autumn? – Isaac, age eight, Guildford, UK Hi Isaac, this is a really interesting question and something that lots of people wonder about when the seasons change. In the autumn, lots of plants (especially trees) throw away their leaves.  These are great for jumping in, but why do some plants do this? It seems like a waste. But actually, by dropping their leaves they are saving their nutrients for the next summer.  For plants to grow, they need sunlight, nutrients and water. The nutrients and water come from the soil. The sunlight is captured by the leaves.  To capture the sunlight, the leaves use a chemical called chlorophyll, which is what makes leaves green. Chlorophyll turns sunlight into food, which the trees need to grow, through a process called photosynthesis.  In summer, plants do lots of photosynthesis, because they get lots of light and because it is warm. The food they make is sugar, which they use to grow new leaves, flowers and seeds. In winter, things are less comfortable. The days get shorter, it gets colder and there is less sunshine. For you, this is not a problem – if you are cold, you can put a coat on. But plants can’t do this. And when it gets really cold, and freezes, their leaves can be damaged. If you want to see what freezing does to different leaves, there is an experiment you can try at home. Take some different leaves and put them in your freezer, or the ice box in your fridge. Leave them for a day to get really cold, then take them out again. Put them on a plate so you don’t make a mess, then just wait for them to warm up (this will take a while).   Some leaves are really tough and don’t mind being frozen. If you take a holly leaf, it will look just the same after you freeze it as it did before. But if you try this with a soft leaf, such as lettuce, you will see something different.  For plants with leaves that don’t like to be frozen, winter is a bad time. Their leaves are all going to be destroyed in the cold weather. If this happens, they will also lose a lot of good things which are in the leaf, especially the nutrients they get from the soil.  They use the nutrients to make chlorophyll and they don’t want to lose them when the leaves freeze. So instead, they break down the chlorophyll to get the nutrients out and store them in their roots, which are protected from the cold. As the plants break down the chlorophyll, the green colour disappears from their leaves. What is left behind is other chemicals which you normally cannot see. The most important of these are called carotenoids, which are what makes carrots orange.  Depending on which chemicals are found in the leaf, they can turn different shades of yellow or orange or even red. These chemicals do not have any nutrients in them, so the plant does not bother to break them down, it leaves them in the leaves.   Once all the chlorophyll is taken out, the leaf dies. As it dries out, the leaf starts to look brown and becomes crispy. At this stage, it falls off the tree. In the spring, as the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, the tree uses the nutrients and food that it has stored in its roots to make new leaves, ready for the summer when it can do lots of photosynthesis again.

20,7°C on Seymour Island off Antarctica… https://t.co/OiIdlQIl6A
— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) February 13, 2020

Two new warm records
According to the Guardian, “The 20.75C logged by Brazilian scientists at Seymour Island on 9 February was almost a full degree higher than the previous record of 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982.”
That reading, the Guardian reports, follows the February 6 record of 18.3C recorded at the Argentinian research station, Esperanza measured.
As is the case with most alarmists, every warm single datapoint anomaly gets uncritically accepted with open arms as solid evidence of man-made global warming while cold trends get dismissed or downgraded as “natural variability”.
Seymour Island has been cooling for over a quarter century
So we have two recent warm records set at and near the Antarctic peninsula over the past week or so and that means the region there is heating up, alarmists like Greta and the Guardian want us to believe. But what are the real TRENDS there? Do the 2 recent warm records mean the region is heating up.
Looking at official data from NASA, it turns out that warming isn’t true. And because climate is always changing, the temperature in the region in question has also not remained completely steady. The only possibility left? COOLING.
Seymour Island, also known as Marambio Island is an island in the chain of 16 major islands around the tip of the Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula. What follows is a plot of the mean annual temperature measured at Seymour Island – based on NASA data – going back to the time all the global warming predictions began in earnest:

Contrary to that implied by The Guardian and Greta, the island has in fact cooled a bit during the period, despite the warm spike of 2016.
13 of 13 Antarctic Peninsula/island stations cooling
Next we look at the Antarctic Peninsula, which global warming alarmists also like to have us believe is teetering on the brink of meltdown. Not long ago Japanese climate blogger Kirye posted a chart showing the mean annual temperatures of 13 stations located there – going back two decades.
For alarmists, the results turn out to be terribly inconvenient. The following map shows the location of the stations:

The following chart shows the plots of the mean annual temperature of the 13 stations, using NASA Version 4 unadjusted data:

13 of 13 Antarctic Peninsula and nearby island stations show cooling over the past 21 years. There hasn’t been any warming there so far this century. Data source: NASA GISS, Version 4 unadjusted. 
Natural ocean cycles
Buried near the end of the Guardian article is mention of the real reason behind Antarctic temperature trends:
Scientists on the Brazilian Antarctic programme say this appears to be influenced by shifts in ocean currents and El Niño events: “We have climatic changes in the atmosphere, which is closely related to changes in permafrost and the ocean. The whole thing is very interrelated.”
Indeed it is. Very likely in ways the climate alarmists prefer not to mention.

,2020-12-19T12:52:38.433356Z,750,120,,"The good news is that the coming years hold out real promise for a new wave of market‐​oriented regulatory reforms here in the United States. Momentum on this front crested in the late 1970s and early ’80s and has been all but defunct for the past couple of decades, but that may well be about to change. The bad news is why: the reason we should be getting our political hopes up is that our economic hopes over the near to medium term are so likely to be dashed.



Let me spell out that bad news a bit. U.S. economic performance in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008-09 has been nothing short of dismal. More than three years passed before real output even returned to its prerecession level, and a return to the prerecession growth trend remains nowhere in sight. The story with employment is even worse: yes, the unemployment rate has gradually subsided, but only because the percentage of Americans actually in the work force has sunk to its lowest level since the late 1970s.



Debate still rages over how much of the economy’s continuing sluggishness reflects short‐​term, cyclical factors — in particular, a shortfall in aggregate demand or deleveraging in response to the financial crisis of 2008. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that slower growth in output and a weak labor market are now the “new normal.” In other words, the ongoing economic slump is not just a matter of a temporary gap between current and “potential” output. Rather, the economy has suffered a decline in its potential or full‐​employment growth rate.



Consider the long‐​term trends for each of the four major components of economic growth: growth in labor participation, growth in labor skills, growth in investment, and growth in output‐​enhancing innovation. As I explained in my 2013 Cato paper “Why Growth Is Getting Harder,” those trends are now uniformly unfavorable. Average hours worked per capita have fallen since 2000. Growth in so‐​called labor quality (as measured by years of school completed) has slowed considerably. The net domestic investment rate has been trending downward for decades. And total factor productivity (TFP) growth, our best measure of innovation, has slumped again in recent years after an Internet‐​fueled surge between 1996 and 2004.



Consequently, there are strong reasons for believing that growth in the years ahead will fall well short of the long‐​term historical average. Between 1870 and 2010, growth in real (i.e., inflation‐​adjusted) GDP per capita averaged just under 2 percent a year. By contrast, recent long‐​term growth projections by top academic and government economists point to an average annual per capita growth rate in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 percent — a fairly dramatic decline from the historical trend line.



In a welcome bit of irony, such economic pessimism offers solid grounds for political optimism. Here’s the basic logic: there is an inverse relationship between the external conditions for growth, on the one hand, and the incentives for good economic policymaking on the other. When conditions for robust growth are favorable, politicians can indulge in the characteristic vices of their profession — a time horizon bounded by the next election cycle and an overriding focus on dividing the pie rather than making it bigger — and still preside over a thriving economy. When, however, times get tougher, politicians must up their game or else economic performance will suffer. In the latter event, the poll numbers of incumbents start to drop, those of their challengers start to rise, and thus opportunities for policy change improve.



Now, policy change could well proceed in the wrong direction and produce worse results than the status quo. But over the past several decades at least, the general pattern around the world — as documented in the annual _Economic Freedom of the World_ reports and similar sources — has been for economic policies to move toward less government control and greater reliance on market competition. And usually, progress in liberalization has been spurred by disappointing economic performance.



If this general pattern holds in the present case, then a protracted period of sluggish growth should open a window of opportunity for pro‐​market, pro‐​growth reforms here in the United States. In sunnier times, many bad policies widely understood to create obstacles for growth are left undisturbed because the political price to be paid for changing them doesn’t seem worth it: why borrow trouble by attacking policies with powerful defenders if things are going OK anyway? But when the economic climate worsens, politicians come under increasing pressure to do something.



 **OPPORTUNITY FOR REFORM**  
Here then is the challenge for supporters of free markets: how can we best take advantage of this window of opportunity? During good times, we are forced to argue that, even if the overall economy seems to be performing well, it could be doing even better with appropriate policy reforms. Now, by contrast, we can reframe our case with a much more compelling sense of urgency: if we do not make difficult but necessary reforms, the economy will perform much worse than in the past. Since people are typically loss averse (they are more concerned about losing what they have than not getting what they want), the growth slowdown makes our case much stronger and more persuasive. But once we reframe our argument, what policy agenda best fits the new frame?



There is no shortage of possible reforms to include. For evidence I refer you to _Reviving Economic Growth_, a new Cato ebook that I edited. The book is a collection of essays by 51 prominent economists and policy experts, all of whom were asked to offer suggestions for improving the U.S. economy’s long‐​term growth outlook. Although a number of reform ideas come up repeatedly, what is striking about the collection is just how wide‐​ranging and varied the proposals are. Which should not be at all surprising: fiscal and regulatory policies affect the allocation of resources and the climate for innovation along countless different margins, and thus the potential levers for improving overall economic performance are similarly numerous and diverse.



In particular, the major economic policy debates that have dominated Washington and the nation’s attention in recent years — the trajectory and composition of federal spending, the level and structure of taxation, health care policy, regulation of the financial sector, what to do about illegal immigration, and climate change and environmental regulation more generally — have important implications for growth. Yet precisely because these debates have already found the spotlight, they are unlikely to supply policy ideas that can take advantage of the political opportunity that the current growth slowdown affords. On all of these hard‐​fought fronts, battle lines are already clearly drawn and often reflect differences over goals and priorities other than growth. Moreover, opinions are highly polarized along partisan and ideological lines, which in the current political environment is often a recipe for stalemate and gridlock.



What we should be looking for, then, are policy ideas that are not already the subject of high‐​profile, politically polarized debate. America’s growth slowdown is a new problem, and policy responses that address that problem are more likely to gain traction if they are not recycled ideas originally put forward to address other problems. And if a policy idea is already clearly associated with either the left or the right, in today’s highly contentious environment it is all but guaranteed that the other side will fight tooth and nail against it — which makes progress of any kind difficult in the absence of large congressional majorities and unified partisan control of the White House and Congress.



Meanwhile, of course, the items on this new policy agenda need to be effective remedies for slow growth. Since innovation is the ultimate source of long‐​term growth in advanced countries at the technological frontier, we should focus especially on policy reforms that can facilitate the introduction and spread of new ideas. In other words, we should target policy barriers that inhibit entrepreneurship and the reallocation of resources through competition and “creative destruction.”



 **REFORMING REGRESSIVE REGULATION**  
In a new Cato White Paper with the curious title of “Low‐​Hanging Fruit Guarded by Dragons,” I take all these factors into account and propose a pro‐​growth reform agenda that focuses on regulatory policies whose primary effect is to inflate the incomes and wealth of the rich, the powerful, and the well established by shielding them from market competition. To apply a convenient label, let’s call these policies “regressive regulation” — regulatory barriers to entry and competition that work to redistribute income and wealth up the socioeconomic scale.



In the paper I identify four main areas of regressive regulation: excessive monopoly privileges granted under copyright and patent law, restrictions on high‐​skilled immigration, protection of incumbent service providers under occupational licensing, and artificial scarcity created by land‐​use regulation. Space constraints prohibit an in‐​depth discussion of those policies here; for details I refer you to the paper. Here I will simply offer some general observations about why targeting these policies seems to me to be the most promising strategy for reversing the growth slowdown — and for taking advantage of the growth slowdown to revive political momentum for economic freedom.



At first blush, these four policy areas seem completely unrelated. They cover highly disparate subject matters, they are administered at different levels of government, and they feature widely varying forms of regulatory apparatus. Notwithstanding all these obvious differences, there are also deep and important similarities. All the policy areas feature regulations that erect explicit barriers to entry — whether in the economist’s sense of barriers to market entry, or in the literal sense of barriers to geographic entry. Copyright and patent laws and occupational licensing limit who can engage in particular kinds of commercial activity; immigration laws and zoning regulations limit who can enter or do business within a designated geographic area.



All of these entry barriers undermine economic growth by restricting vital inputs to innovation. Excessive copyright and patent protections restrict the recombination of ideas that is the essence of innovation by making some ideas artificially inaccessible. Immigration laws restrict the inflow of highly skilled individuals who are disproportionately entrepreneurial and innovative. Occupational licensing restricts the formation of new businesses, which are frequently the vessels for new products or new production methods. And zoning restricts urban density, a vital catalyst for the innovative recombination of ideas.



Finally, all these policy domains have similar distributional consequences: all of them redistribute income and wealth to the well‐​off and privileged. Copyright and patent laws pinch consumers for the benefit of huge corporations. Immigration laws expose America’s lowest‐​skilled workers to intensifying competition from foreign‐​born workers while shielding high‐​skilled workers from equivalent competitive pressures. Occupational licensing boosts the earnings of protected incumbents by restricting supply, especially in higher‐​income professions. And zoning gives windfall gains to wealthy landowners.



 **LEFT-LIBERTARIAN SYNTHESIS**  
In all likelihood because of these underlying similarities, none of these policy areas have become zones of ideological or partisan conflict. To be sure, proper policy is vigorously debated in all these areas, but the contending sides are not divided along left‐​right or Republican‐ Democratic lines. In striking contrast to the polarization and gridlock that now dominate most national policy debates, opposition to regressive regulatory controls has brought together politicians and policy experts from across the political spectrum. Thus, in the field of intellectual property, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) joined forces with Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Ron Paul (R-TX) to oppose the Stop Online Piracy Act, a failed legislative effort to toughen criminal penalties for copyright violations. Among policy experts, leading critics of copyright and patent law excesses include progressives Lawrence Lessig and Dean Baker and libertarians Tom Bell and Jerry Brito.



With regard to high‐​skilled immigration, a number of bipartisan reform bills have been introduced in recent years. To take a recent example, in January 2015 a group of six senators, including Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Mark Warner (D-VA), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), introduced the Immigration Innovation Act to boost the numbers of both temporary and permanent visas for highly skilled workers. And among policy experts, scholars from the libertarian Cato Institute and the progressive Center for American Progress supported the most recent comprehensive immigration legislation passed by the Senate in 2013. As to occupational licensing, the Obama administration’s latest budget contains a provision to nudge states toward reform; furthermore, this past summer the administration released an excellent report that makes the case for deregulation in this area.



Meanwhile, in July 2014, Rep. Paul Ryan (RWI) released a widely discussed plan for combating poverty. And in the section on regulatory reform, Ryan singled out occupational licensing laws as prime examples of the “regressive regulations” that too often constrict economic opportunity for the least advantaged. Among policy experts, Alan Krueger of Princeton University, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, is a leading critic of these regulatory restrictions, while the libertarian Institute for Justice has a long track record of challenging and overturning licensing rules in court.



Zoning is a local issue that has long been thought to have only local consequences, so to date it has not attracted much attention from Washington policymakers. Among policy experts, though, the pattern of support for reform across ideological dividing lines holds here as well. Edward Glaeser, who in addition to teaching at Harvard is affiliated with the libertarian‐​leaning Manhattan Institute, is among the nation’s leading critics of current land‐​use regulation. Another prominent critic is Matthew Yglesias of Vox, who wrote his book, _The Rent Is Too Damn High_ , while he was working for the Center for American Progress.



 **PUBLIC INTEREST VERSUS VESTED INTERESTS**  
It’s not simply the case that one can find policy experts on both sides of the ideological spectrum who support reform of these regressive regulatory policies. More than that, it’s very difficult to find disinterested policy experts anywhere on the spectrum who support the status quo. Certainly, there are strong defenders of both intellectual property protection and zoning, but even in their ranks you will find recognition that current policies are seriously flawed. Thus, the economist Carl Shapiro, a prominent supporter of patents generally, has written, “[While] there is no doubt that the patent system taken as a whole plays an important role in spurring innovation, the general consensus is that the U.S. patent system is out of balance and can be substantially improved.” In similar fashion, the economist William Fischel, who has written sophisticated defenses of zoning, acknowledges that its exclusionary impact has increased since 1970 and that the “social and economic costs” of contemporary land use regulation are “not trivial.” As far as high‐​skilled immigration restrictions and occupational licensing are concerned, it is difficult to find any scholar who has anything nice to say about the current state of either.



This combination of qualities — negative impact on entrepreneurship and innovation, absence of political polarization, and an intellectual consensus in favor of reform — makes regressive regulation an especially inviting target for any campaign to enact pro‐​growth policy reforms. For all who are interested in better long‐​term U.S. economic performance, this is the “low‐​hanging fruit.” Reforming these policies is something that we know will make a positive difference, and by “we” I mean the vast bulk of disinterested experts. Yes, it is true that plucking this fruit won’t be easy, because the interest groups that benefit from the status quo are politically powerful, well organized, and highly motivated. This is the “guarded by dragons” part of the story. But knowing clearly what needs to be done, however difficult it might be, is an advantage that should not be underestimated.



Pursuing an agenda of curbing regressive regulation would allow us to open a new front in the economic policy debate. Unlike the all too‐ familiar policy disputes now ongoing, a campaign against regressive regulation would feature issues new to the national policy spotlight — especially in the case of occupational licensing and zoning, because they occur at the state and local levels and thus are typically ignored by Washington. Meanwhile, the organizing rubric of regressive regulation packages together disparate issues in a novel way and can thereby impart new energy to reform efforts in each of its constituent policy domains. This new front would look very different from the other, ongoing policy debates. Instead of the opposing forces being arrayed along the left‐​right axis, here the contest pits an expert consensus across the political spectrum against the interest groups who profit from existing policy. Instead of yet another left‐​right fight, this time the contest could be framed as a choice between the public interest and vested interests.



The idea of a left‐​right coalition to push deregulation may sound far‐​fetched, but it is not without precedent. Consider the country’s last major episode of pro‐​market regulatory reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During that brief period, price‐​and‐​entry regulation of airlines, trucking, and railroads was systematically dismantled; price controls on oil and natural gas were lifted; interest‐​rate caps for checking and savings accounts were removed; and the AT&T monopoly was ended, paving the way for competition in long‐​distance telephony. Those too young to remember can be forgiven for associating all of this with Ronald Reagan, but in fact Democrats and progressives played a major role. Jimmy Carter signed the legislation that deregulated airlines, trucking, railroads, and natural gas. On Capitol Hill, Edward Kennedy led the fight for airline deregulation, ably assisted by his aide Stephen Breyer. Yes, the rise of Chicago‐​school economics and especially the law‐​and‐​economics movement supplied momentum for these sweeping policy changes, but so did the activism of Ralph Nader.



History never repeats itself, but sometimes it rhymes. As in the 1970s, the U.S. economy today is delivering disappointing results. Back then the problem was “stagflation”; today we worry about a “great stagnation.” And once again, the shifting currents of political debate are bringing together unlikely allies with a common interest in reviving prosperity and a common hostility to the entrenched interests that stand in the way. With luck, contemporary reformers can follow their predecessors’ good example.",2020-12-19T12:52:38.433389Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:39:24.611543Z,751,119,,"Evan Flint has his feet up, at last. It is day four of the final Test between England and South Africa and, as chief groundsman, all he can do is watch as Rassie van der Dussen and Dean Elgar grind out the beginnings of a doomed rearguard action. Flint has been at the Wanderers since last spring, lured north after 10 and a half years at Newlands, where he won groundsman of the year during his last two seasons. He had had a lot to cope with. In January 2018 Cape Town officials announced that, after three years of insufficient rain, the city was three months away from Day Zero (running out of water). The visiting India team were told not to shower for more than 90 seconds, the India and South Africa sides gave a combined donation of 100,000 rand to the Gift of the Givers Foundation (disaster relief in Africa), fights broke out over water from the nearby Newlands borehole and club and schools cricket was cancelled halfway through the season. Three weeks before Day Zero, Australia and South Africa played a Test in Cape Town – subsequently overshadowed somewhat by the discovery of sandpaper down Cameron Bancroft’s trousers. Newlands is well served by boreholes but Flint remembers it as a difficult time: “We were in the thick of it but it was an opportunity to show the rest of the world that we were doing our bit, almost like a badge of honour.” He had to water the pitch; it has a very high clay content so otherwise would have cracked, but the outfield was something else. “At one point we were watering it maybe twice a week at most and it was very brown. It looked terrible but the last thing we wanted as Day Zero approached was for people to put on the telly and look at a lush cricket field.” “You know what people are like, they announce water restrictions and nobody believes it, so it was a personal decision to adhere to what the authorities said. We used borehole water but we acknowledged there was a drought on and we were playing our part.” “It made me realise that the grass doesn’t need as much water as we think. It taught me that you are doing the turf a bit of a disservice to spoon-feed it every day. I learned that it is when you water that’s important, rather than how much.” Day Zero was eventually averted but sport in South Africa is under strain in a volatile changing climate. Temperatures in the interior of the country are rising at twice the global level according to the International Panel on Climate Change and southern Africa as a whole is facing unprecedented strain. The UN World Food Programme has warned of a hunger crisis on “a scale we’ve not seen before”, blaming, largely: “The cumulative effects of climate-related natural disasters in the form of recurrent widespread droughts. The region has had only one normal rainy season in the past five years amid cyclones and persistent flooding.” Malawi has also had to contend with an influx of fall armyworms, while further north plagues of locusts currently swarm over Kenya. In South Africa the Eastern Cape is still under severe strain, with many of the new boreholes not producing the desired results because ground water levels are so low, a situation the government has called critical. Level 2 water restrictions were announced in October, even in Johannesburg, but the big difference for Flint as a groundsman is the summer rainfall in Jo’burg – in Cape Town the rain falls, or should fall, in the winter. Nor does he miss the south-easterly wind that hits Cape Town from the spring: “They don’t put that in the brochures.” The Wanderers also has the benefit of wonderful ground irrigation, every drop of rain that falls on the stadium roof or gutters runs into a reservoir at the back of the ground to be stored away. The changing climate – declining rainfall and temperature changes – has made Flint question some of groundskeeping’s most cherished ideals. “Cape Town was an eye-opener,” he says. “We have great water harvesting at the Wanderers because we are an international ground but certainly a lot more could be done in council and club facilities and there should be more research into artificial surfaces because they don’t require the maintenance, the cutting and the fuel, etc. “Of course many municipalities have got greater things to worry about but more education would help. I say this with this beautiful turf in front of me, and professional sportsmen want to play on grass, but artificial surfaces do make sense. I’m being really sacrilegious now but think about golf courses. The enormous amounts of water those things guzzle is extraordinary.” Despite all this, the climate crisis is not something that Flint finds crops up in conversation much, either in cricket or groundskeeping circles. “It’s been a bit disappointing. We meet up once a year as groundsmen and we discussed the Cape Town drought but, apart from that, not really. Once it starts raining, people go back to their own ways. But if you don’t have any water, my goodness, you can’t live.” • This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email. The Spin.

,2020-12-19T16:39:47.334047Z,752,118,,"Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a new paper, atmospheric physicist Dr. Richard Lindzen summarizes the “implausible” claims today’s proponents of dangerous anthropogenic global warming espouse.
Dr. Richard Lindzen retired several years ago, and yet his immense contribution to the atmospheric sciences lives on. His research is still cited about 600 times per year.
Lindzen recently published another scientific paper (Lindzen, 2020) in The European Physical Journal criticizing the current alarmism in climate science.  Here are a few of the highlights.
1. Doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration from 280 ppm to 560 ppm results in just a 1-2% perturbation to the Earth’s 240 W/m² energy budget. This doubled-CO2 effect has less than 1/5th of the impact that the net cloud effect has. And yet we are asked to accept the “implausible” claim that change in one variable, CO2, is predominatly responsible for altering global temperatures.
2. A causal role for CO2 “cannot be claimed” for the glacial-to-interglacial warming events because CO2 variations follow rather than lead the temperature changes in paleoclimate records and the 100 ppm total increase over thousands of years produce “about 1 W/m²” of total radiative impact.
3. Climate science didn’t used to be alarmist prior to the late 1980s. Scientists were instead sufficiently skeptical about claims of climatically-induced planetary doom. That changed during the years 1988-1994, when climate research centered on CO2 and global warming received a 15-fold increase in funding in the US alone. Suddenly there was a great financial incentive to propel alarming global warming scenarios.
4. Concepts like “polar amplification” are “imaginary”.
“The change in equator-to-pole temperature difference was attributed to some imaginary ‘polar amplification,’ whereby the equator-pole temperature automatically followed the mean temperature. Although the analogy is hardly exact, this is not so different from assuming that flow in a pipe depends on the mean pressure rather than the pressure gradient.”

Iran bloggers test regime’s tolerance
Push boundaries of political dissent
By James F. Smith and Anne Barnard, Globe Staff  |  December 18, 2006
TEHRAN — By day, Alireza Samiei covers banking and insurance for an industry newspaper. By night, he writes a daring online blog about Iran’s social and political ills.
In a recent blog entry, he described a scene he saw while talking to a greengrocer about soaring prices: A young child was pleading, ” ‘Mommy, I want watermelon.’ The woman, shy and sorrowful, singled out one broken, small watermelon from the spoiled fruit bin and told the grocer, ‘Just this one, please.’ She put 20 cents on the counter and hurried away.”
Samiei, 27, is among the growing ranks of Iranian bloggers who are relentlessly pushing the boundaries of free expression, making Farsi one of the 10 most popular languages for blogs. The bloggers are testing just how much political and social dissent the nation’s rulers will tolerate on the Internet.
The authorities are pushing back. They have blocked access to thousands of websites in recent years that are deemed to threaten Iran’s Islamic revolution, including the BBC’s Farsi-language site. A trial began this month against four bloggers on charges including propaganda against the state. And in October, the government barred high-speed Internet service in private homes.
Especially threatening, it appears, are sites that create online communities that might allow Iranians to assemble virtually. The government banned the hugely popular Orkut site, an online Iranian social club. The latest casualty this month: YouTube.com, the American site for sharing videos online. Click on it in Iran and the screen reports, “Access denied.”
The Paris-based rights group Reporters Without Borders includes Iran on its list of 13 countries designated “enemies of the Internet.” That organization’s website is also blocked in Iran.
The organization said repression of bloggers has eased somewhat in 2006. But in a report in November, the group said Internet filtering has accelerated, with two political sites, tik.ir and meydaan.com, closed down in recent weeks. Both had criticized the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Bloggers agree that they have found some latitude in recent months. Many have developed a feel for the boundaries, and some are trying to stretch them rather than break them.
Farzana Sayid Saidi, a 29-year-old reporter and colleague of Samiei, has two blogs, one political and the other showcasing her poetry. She has been blogging in her spare time for two years. Her first blog was shut down within three days, she said, after she wrote that school officials were providing access to abortions in clinics for young students.
Now she’s back at it. She blogged a few days ago that while Ahmadinejad wants people to have more children, his economic policies make it difficult for many families to do so. She said she received some obscene and abusive replies. In a poem on her other blog, she compared Iran’s leaders to the pharaohs of Egypt.
She estimates her readers at only in the hundreds, but adds: “We just want to express ourselves. We don’t know how many people are reading.”
Farzana’s colleague Samiei admires her courage.
“Of the things she writes in her blog, only 1 percent would be acceptable in print,” Samiei said.
She and hordes of other Iranian bloggers are pushing the envelope of the permissible. Technorati, a Silicon Valley search engine for blogs, said in October that Farsi has moved into the top 10 languages worldwide for bloggers. Most estimates put the number of active blogs in Iran at 70,000 to 100,000, and growing fast.
Iran has a long tradition of controlling the airwaves and the print media, banning papers and jailing journalists who criticize official policies.
But Iran’s online activists have proved harder to quash. They have used fast-changing Web addresses, proxy sites, and other technological tricks to get around the restrictions.
“They block us and we evade the blocks,” Samiei said. “It goes on every day. They code, we decode.”
The Ministry of Information periodically sends lists to Internet service providers saying which keywords to filter out so that users can’t get access to websites or blogs that contain them. The government contends that the principal target is pornography and other morally offensive material. The word “sex” is among those blocked.
That has some odd consequences. At one point, an Internet café owner said, the word “hot” was blocked. And that briefly prevented access to Hotmail, the popular e-mail program.
Amirhussein Jaharuti, the manager of a major Internet service provider in Tehran, said the government’s restrictions focus on pornography, and he feels that filtering is appropriate.
“This is the demand of Iranian families, that they don’t want their children to use these kinds of sites,” he said. Asked about the political restrictions, he said: “All governments have ways to control their societies. . . . It’s natural that when we see that someone wants to destroy us, we limit them.”
Jaharuti said his client base has doubled in the past two years, to nearly 70,000. He provides dial-up and digital-subscriber line service to home and business customers at a cost of 20 to 40 cents an hour, or about $20 per month.
Internet use in Iran has exploded in recent years, with about 7.5 million users in 2005 in a country of nearly 70 million people.
Some journalists say the Internet has become even more vital in Iran as the government has suppressed other, more easily controllable forms of expression. Several opposition newspapers have been shut down since September, including the prominent paper Shargh.
The editor, Mohamed Atrianfar, said in an interview that the closure of Shargh and other publications and renewed pressure on critical websites reflects the government’s concern that “the more challenges we have, the more agile and fresh the society becomes.”
“All the hard-liners have mustered all their strength to fight this war. I am proud that we have invoked this reaction in them,” he added.
Despite its closure, Shargh has maintained a website to continue coverage of elections last week.
Atrianfar estimated that about 70 to 80 Iranian journalists have their own blogs.
“Websites and blogs have real impact,” he said. “They have been very powerful in forming a word-of-mouth culture, especially for those between 17 and 35.”
An Internet café owner in central Tehran who gave only his first name, Shariar, said the filtering of keywords rather than individual sites often blocks legitimate websites that people need for academic research. He also said limits on credit cards resulting from US financial sanctions against Iran have all but eliminated e-commerce on Iran’s Internet, a major obstacle to economic growth.
Shariar said that while the government contends it is aiming its restrictions at pornography, “I think they are worried about politics. . . . I think they fear everything. They don’t want people to make connections overseas. They are worried about information.”
The authorities also close Western media sites temporarily. Both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times sites were blocked briefly this month.
A 22-year-old university student, Morteza Yeganeh, said the state-owned broadcasters and newspapers “brainwash people, so we need to find ways to educate ourselves.”
But he said the filtering of sites is effective because “even though people can get around the filters, it is difficult and time-consuming and people give up.”
Most Iranian blogs are apolitical, and government members — including Ahmadinejad himself — have their own blogs to convey their views. But those with blogs that challenge the government know they are taking a risk.
Niloufar Taslim, 24, said that three years ago, she was one of Iran’s first bloggers, writing about social and political problems. But she started receiving e-mails signed by a group calling itself the Army of God, listing her name, telephone number, and address and threatening to kill her.
She shut down that site, but now has two new blogs. One talks about social problems without crossing what she also considers political red lines: transportation and environmental problems.
Another blog features her poems. One laments that she has lost her voice, that in “a situation without possibilities” her hands are “in pain because they cannot write.”

German activist scientists silently demonstrated before the Chancellor Merkel’s office to protest inaction over warming. Cropped image: ScientistsForFuture.
One prominent attendee was FridaysForFuture activist Prof. Volker Quaschning, who proudly took the day off from lecturing on taxpayer expense. Here’s what he tweeted just before attending the modest demonstration:

Quaschning, a HTW Berlin professor, is seen above at a bus stop on his way to the demonstration, holding the propaganda temperature stripe chart to protest the German government’s inaction on fighting global warming. Unfortunately the professor looks rather silly all dressed up for winter cold in gloves, knit hat, scarf and coat – to protest warming!
200 scientists shiver to protest warming
The activist Berlin professor wasn’t the only scientist trying to stay warm today while protesting climate warming. Two hundred other scientists also showed up in front of Chancellor Merkel’s office, all bundled up in winter clothes, demanding a stop to the warming and that they be listened to – instead of the working class taxpayers.

Low IQ scientists in Berlin outside freezing, dressed in winter clothing, protesting warming! https://t.co/dOwWfFHoEy
— Pierre L. Gosselin (@NoTricksZone) November 15, 2019

The science-is-settled scientists held up signs declaring, “Everything has been said! Act now!” or: “Decades of climate research: Ignored!”
The question is whether they will be taken seriously by the hundreds of millions of Northern Hemisphere inhabitants who are getting socked by a premature frigid winter this year.
Silent protest
The scientists4future all appeared with their mouths taped shut in order to symbolize a “silent protest”. Or perhaps the tape was to keep their teeth from chattering as they shivered in the bitter November cold.
Of course, the scientists didn’t stick around too long. Reportedly they left for an early start to the weekend – in the warm comfort of their homes.
Today the German government voted to pass measures that among other things will make heating and fuel more expensive for ordinary citizens starting next year.

,2020-12-19T16:51:25.105894Z,761,119,,"The UK’s onshore wind power industry may have been dealt a huge blow by new government policies announced last week, but this apparent setback should instead be seen as an opportunity. Elsewhere in Europe local, cooperative wind power is flourishing – could your town be next? This wind turmoil comes at a point when politicians are widely struggling with the “energy trilemma” of balancing affordability and sustainability while also securing national supplies. The Queen’s Speech on behalf of the new Conservative government explicitly included a new Energy Bill designed to increase energy security – a clear prioritisation of one side of the “energy trilemma” in the next parliamentary period. Changes affecting the UK’s onshore wind power sector include devolving consent powers for any large onshore wind farms away from the secretary of state to local planning authorities. The government also plans to end its commitment for new subsidies for onshore wind farms. Taken together these measures appear to send out a strong signal that government support for onshore wind power in the UK is ending. Unsurprisingly, reactions to the announcements have been largely negative with companies fearing job losses and the terminal decline of this sector. Industry representatives are concerned about the capacity of local authorities to deal with these new powers in a competent and timely manner. Yet at the same time, these proposals may provide the sector with a much-needed incentive and an opportunity to develop new business models that increasingly rely on and reward local ownership and support given that communities are now in charge. The question is whether the onshore wind sector is able to turn this situation to its advantage, perhaps similar to the way the sector has flourished in countries such as Denmark and Germany. There, onshore wind projects are predominantly in the hands of mid-size firms and owned largely by communities and small investors. In Denmark, too, local municipalities determine whether and where wind turbines can be placed. This suggests that empowering local decision makers and drawing on citizen investment schemes can actually have positive effects on the industry. This is a model that could be adopted in the UK but there are caveats. First, the success and growth of small-scale wind in the past has relied on financial support in the form of feed-in tariffs – a scheme that is now under review and likely to be limited. the industry must now demonstrate the ability to stand on its own feet to support itself financially. In fact, onshore wind is already competitive and one of the cheapest forms of energy production. But it still has to compete with solar, offshore wind and other renewables for financial and governmental support, which leads to media complaints about how much these subsidies are adding to consumer energy bills. Much then depends on project size. Typically, big wind farms tend to be developed by large companies backed by institutional investors. A modern 2.5MW (commercial scale) turbine, on a reasonable site, will generate 6.5m units of electricity each year – enough to make 230m cups of tea. So the large wind farms above 50MW affected by the changes would typically consist of more than 25 turbines. For them, the challenge will be to cooperate with and convince local authorities of the wider benefits of these projects in order to gain planning consent. By contrast, many of the smaller projects have an inherent advantage. Increasingly they are crowd-funded such as one proposal by Yorkshire-based Edgehill, which seeks to raise £2.5m from investors chipping in as little as £50 to build ten turbines in ten different rural locations. With their risks and benefits shared between large numbers of individual investors, these projects are used to keeping locals happy, dealing with NIMBYs, and bringing them on as investors.  The question is which of the two project types and business models will become more successful in garnering local support over the coming years. It is possible that developers with closer links to local government authorities and community organisations are likely to emerge stronger from this political shift. In short, we might see more, but smaller wind farm projects. There is also a regional dimension to this, as the proposed Energy Bill will definitely not apply to Scotland, and perhaps also exclude Wales. The UK currently has 538 projects worth 7,240 MW in the pipeline which will be affected differently depending on where they are located. For onshore wind, devolved powers for Scotland are a good thing. For example, 37 out of 45 proposed sites for large-scale projects awaiting planning consent are based in Scotland and so would remain unaffected by the latest proposals. The future viability of the UK’s onshore wind energy sector will be determined by developers’ skills in attracting capital funding, managing local authorities and obtaining a “social licence to practice” from affected communities. Less clear, however, is how the government intends to square its declining support for the cheapest form of renewable energy and increased efforts to shore up the nation’s remaining oil and gas reserves with its other aim of “seeking to address climate change through ambitious action at home”. It seems that despite prioritisation ultimately the government cannot escape the energy trilemma.",2020-12-19T16:51:25.105928Z,1

Global warming alarmists like claiming that a certain place is seeing more warming and climate change than everywhere else. Remarkably, they say that about almost everywhere, which of course makes no sense.
Today we look at Canadian temperature trends using the data from the Japan Meteorological Institute (JMA) for stations where they have data available going back to at least the mid 1990s.
First we look at December mean temperatures. What follows is a chart depicting the results of 9 stations across Canada:

Of the 9 examined stations, seven show no warming taking place at all in Canada over the past quarter century for the month of December. Data: JMA.

The data hardly show the trends you’d expect from a place that is supposed to be “warming faster than anywhere else”.
Canada mean annual temperatures show no warming 
Okay, those are only data for December. How about the annual mean temperatures?
What follows are plots for the mean annual temperatures for the 9 stations: 
Data source: JMA
The plots speak clearly enough: we have been seeing more cooling than warming.
Though the surface of the globe may be have warmed modestly as a whole, nothing unusual is going on. What we are likely seeing are mainly natural oceanic cycles at work, which we still know very little about.

In his first year, the WBG president, David Malpass, has met more than 100 leaders around the developing world, in countries from Pakistan and Egypt to Ethiopia and Mozambique. Our strong focus on country results is one reason why the World Bank has repeatedly been given the highest rating among international agencies in the UK Department for International Development’s reviews of multilateral development partners.

,2020-12-19T16:17:44.988259Z,766,119,,"More than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at this week’s UK-Africa investment summit were for fossil fuels, despite a government commitment to “support African countries in their transition to cleaner energy”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit on Monday, citing the climate emergency: “We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, and we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms.”  But the commercial energy deals revealed later were dominated by oil and gas production. The official UK government statement on the summit and a press release failed to mention these, citing only the far smaller support for clean energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the “hypocrisy of the government’s position is breath-taking”. Johnson also announced that UK taxpayers’ money would no longer support overseas coal-fired power plants and coal mining. Yet MPs on the environmental select committee reported in 2019 that “UK Export Finance (UKEF) has not supported a coal project since 2002”.  A report by Greenpeace and Newsnight also found that UKEF spent billions of pounds abroad supporting fossil fuel projects that will emit an estimated 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. The UK will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, at which nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3o-4oC rise in global temperatures. The five oil and gas deals announced after the summit are worth £2.1bn, led by oil company Tullow investing £1.2bn in continued oil production in Kenya. The other fossil fuel contracts span the continent from Nigeria to Mozambique and Tunisia to Cote D’Ivoire. In contrast, just £161m in deals – 8% of the total – were related to clean energy, the biggest being for £80m of solar-powered irrigation pumps for Uganda and £50m to help build a solar farm in Kenya. Before the summit, Lucas asked ministers which companies would attend, but the Department of Trade refused to reveal the names, citing “commercial interests”. “Now we know why the government was so secretive,” said Lucas. “The hypocrisy of the government’s position is breathtaking. It boasts of its green credentials one minute, and then hosts an investment summit which sees billions being invested in carbon-intensive industries in Africa. This government’s promises on climate action are completely hollow. “As hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, the UK needs to show international leadership and bring other countries with us. We can’t do that while UK money and business is supporting dirty energy around the world.” A spokesman for the Department for International Trade (DIT) said: “The UK is committed to tackling climate change and supporting African countries in their transition to cleaner energy. Less than one-third [of the total £6.5bn in deals] were in oil and gas.” At the summit, Johnson said the UK would help African nations “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”, while also delivering “an electro-convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry”. Other deals struck at the summit included a total of £170m for aircraft and airports and £224m for a new Kenyan gold mine. The biggest deal was £3.2bn for Bombardier to construct and operate two monorail lines in Cairo, Egypt. The UK taxpayer is directly funding £50m of clean energy projects, including energy storage batteries and energy-efficient housing. “The government is stepping up our offer to work with African countries to unlock their massive renewable energy potential,” said the DIT spokesman. Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “The supposedly transformative £6.5bn UK investment in Africa includes oil, gas, gold mining and airlines. So much for fostering ‘climate-friendly’ development. “In the 19th century, the ‘scramble for Africa’ was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. Now, 150 years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as ‘development’.”",2020-12-19T16:17:44.988293Z,1
,2020-12-19T12:53:58.719912Z,768,119,,"Air pollution pumped out by factories and power plants in Europe and North America has led to drier spells in the tropics, thousands of miles to the south. Scientists had long suspected this was the case and even had modelled the change in computer simulations, but now for the first time we have direct evidence – straight from a cave in Belize. Most of us, when asked to think about climate change, think of global warming and the unequivocal rise in greenhouse gases. But greenhouse gases aren’t the only pollutants we produce which have the potential to disrupt the climate. Atmospheric sulfate and nitrate aerosols, produced from burning fossil fuels, alter the climate both directly by reflecting solar radiation and indirectly by altering clouds. The impact of these aerosols is to offset the warming caused by greenhouse gases – where GHGs cause the Earth to retain heat, aerosols keep heat out in the first place.  However, as aerosols don’t stick around in the atmosphere for long, their effects are much stronger close to their source. It’s one reason why we see big regional differences in climate change. Indeed, observational and modelling studies provide considerable evidence that aerosols have lowered surface air temperatures in the northern hemisphere, offsetting greenhouse warming. Characterising our influence on the climate is challenging for many reasons. Climate is a complex web of intricately bound variables, difficult to understand and even more difficult to predict. But there is one issue with climate science that complicates things more than any other: the lack of instrumental data. Beyond the past 130 years, instrumental and observational data is sparse and uneven. It’s not very useful when looking to give context to our current climate debate. The study of climate history therefore relies on proxies to reconstruct the conditions at a given point.  These proxies are natural archives such as sediment cores, ice cores, tree rings and rocks – these record certain aspects of the climate in their physical characteristics. The width of tree rings, for instance, or the amount of carbon found inside air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice for thousands of years. By analysing these archives we can create climate records that extend far beyond the short era of thermometers and rain gauges. In our research, published in Nature Geoscience, we present one such climate reconstruction produced from a stalagmite collected from a cave in Belize in Central America. Stalagmites (the ones that grow upwards from the ground) grow incrementally as saturated water, filtered through the rock above, drips into the cave and leaves behind what becomes new rock.  Every drop of water has a unique chemical signature that is largely controlled by prevailing climate conditions above the cave, meaning that stalagmites record climate changes as they grow. By analysing the geochemistry of these incremental growth layers in a 450 year-old stalagmite, we were able to construct a historical rainfall record for the region. Recently it has become increasingly clear that climate changes in one region can have an impact in a totally different latitude. The IPCC’s 2013 summary for policymakers IPCC 2013 concludes with confidence that man-made changes in the North Atlantic climate are linked to rainfall at lower-latitudes. Precipitation in the tropics, including Belize, is governed by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) – a belt of monsoon rainfall encircling the Earth near the equator that migrates seasonally between the hemispheres. The relative temperature difference between the hemispheres plays a crucial role in controlling the position of the ITCZ and hence, rainfall distribution in the tropics. What we found was a distinct drying trend in Belize since 1850 that coincides with a steady rise in industrial aerosol emissions in North America and Europe. This presents strong evidence that industrial sulfate emissions have shifted the position of the ITCZ through reflecting the Sun’s incoming radiation and therefore moderating warming in the northern hemisphere. In other words, aerosol pollutants have changed the relative thermal contrast between the two hemispheres and subsequently led to the ITCZ moving southward. This means less rainfall for the northern tropics. The role of sulphate aerosols in repositioning the ITCZ was previously identified through computer modelling techniques, but until now no suitable climate record existed to support those ideas. Our claims are backed up by the volcano record. Emissions from volcanoes are similar to those produced by burning fossils fuels – basically lots of sulphur – and we identified short-lived drier spells in the northern tropics following very large volcanic eruptions in the northern hemisphere, such as the Icelandic Laki eruption in 1783.  This provided evidence that any injection of sulphate aerosols into the upper atmosphere, both natural and man-made, can disrupt temperatures and rainfall. These volcanically forced dry periods essentially rule out the possibility that the climate shifts were caused by a previously unknown natural climate cycle or increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  Although warming due to man-made carbon dioxide emissions has long been at the centre of discussions regarding climate change, the shifting of rain belts has significant regional-scale effects. The tropics are heavily populated and extremely reliant on regular rainfall. Linking human-induced changes and natural changes from the past to understand where the climate currently stands, and where it might go in the future, will be as socially important as it is scientifically challenging.",2020-12-19T12:53:58.719945Z,1

WASHINGTON (AP) — The brightening and dimming of the sun may account for a 1,500-year cycle of cooling and warming on parts of the Earth, a study of ice in the North Atlantic suggests.
Researchers found that a very slight difference in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth can have a powerful chilling effect on the climate: ice builds up in lands bordering the North Atlantic, the average temperature drops in Europe and North America.

This goes hand in hand with another study by the University of Main Climate Change Center as reported by SPACEREF
And just in case that’s not enough light reading for you, here is a study from Harvard that talks about “Chaos” and the sunspot cycle.
Part of the abstract is quite telling: “…by examining 1500 years of sunspot, geomagnetic, and auroral activity cycles. Sub-harmonics were found of the fundamental solar cycle period during the years preceding the Maunder minimum and loss of phase of the subharmonic on emergence from it. These phenomena are indicative of chaos. They indicate that the solar dynamo is chaotic and is operating in a region close to the transition between period doubling and chaos.”
Translation: The sun can easily tip from one state to another, with resultant changes in solar output.

Restaurants come and go in Chico, some don’t ever rise above the level of having an “open” sign. Finding new ones with ambiance and class is a treat. Finding one that gives every customer a free appetizing plate after 5 is even better.
This restaurant used to be “The Bean Scene” which was started by a couple of people I used to call “The Evil Blonde Ladies” because they’d come into Bidwell Perk and take notes on that business just before opening up their own gig. They didn’t make it, partly because it took them 20 minutes to toast a bagel.
So seeing a new restaurant in Chico is always a good thing, as on Friday and Saturday nights it’s often impossible to find a classy place to eat that isn’t fully booked. So while I’m never mentioned any Chico business before, I thought this one was worth a mention not only because they are new, but because its run by locals, Bob and Patricia Johansen.
I’m partial to wine blends, as they tend to take the edge off of the aftertaste. Tonight I sampled one of the best blends I’ve had in a very very long time. Its called Falling Star Merlot-Malbec (shown above), and I gotta tell you it beats my former favorite “Clous du Bois Marlstone” by a long shot, and costs about 66% less. ($19/bottle -vs- $60)
It’s worth checking out, if nothing else for the free appetizer and WiFi.

I was so impressed with this idea that I did lots of work in nuclear physics even at my own high school, building a 1 MEV cyclotron (a form of atom smasher) which I powered with my dad’s arc welder.
After winning my state science fair, I went to the national science fair with it, but didn’t win there, partly because I think I terrified some of the judges when I fired it up.

Nuclear fission, which is what we use now, creates all sorts of radioactive isotopes as byproducts of the fission, and they remain radioactive for thousands of years, making disposal/storage a problem.
Nuclear FUSION on the other hand, doesn’t have such byproduct problems, and its been the holy grail of clean nuclear power for 50+ years, but it’s been elusive because its so difficult to do and still produce a net power gain.
That’s why I found this story from the Detroit Free Press interesting, it hit close to home, building a nuclear fusion reactor in your basement brings back memories of my own tinkering. Maybe someday, we’ll see a safe and clean fusion reactor in your home. If I’m still of this earth, I’ll be the first to buy one.
The work this young man did in his basement was a continuance of work done by eccentric inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, who is credited with inventing television, though RCA clearly stole the idea from him and commercialized it.
Farnsworth’s approach to fusion has been dubbed “Inertial Electrostatic Confinement” or “IEC” for short. (VERY) simply put, the process uses forces within the atomic particles themselves to bring them close enough to fuse. The more common approach uses tremendous external forces to achieve the same effect. These enormous machines employ powerful magnetic fields and the method is called “magnetic confinement” Literally billions of dollars have been spent in the last thirty years with little to show in the way of meaningful results. After thirty years, the “experts” still say that a practical fusion power plant is still – would you believe? – at least another thirty years away.
This article underscores why we need to encourage more science and technology
for our youth. The US keeps slipping behind.


TEEN GOES NUCLEAR: He creates fusion in his Oakland Township home
November 19, 2006
BY GINA DAMRON
On the surface, Thiago Olson is like any typical teenager.
But to his friends, Thiago is known as ""the mad scientist.""

Thiago Olson, 17,
stands near his nuclear fusion reactor, which he calls ""the Fusor,"" at
home in Oakland Township on Friday. After more than two years and 1,000 hours of
research, the Stoney Creek High School senior, with a little help from his dad,
built the machine. (PATRICIA BECK/Detroit Free Press)
In the basement of his parents’ Oakland Township home, tucked away in an area
most aren’t privy to see, Thiago is exhausting his love of physics on a project
that has taken him more than two years and 1,000 hours to research and build —
a large, intricate machine that , on a small scale, creates nuclear fusion.
Nuclear fusion — when atoms are combined to create energy — is ""kind
of like the holy grail of physics,"" he said.
In fact, on www.fusor.net,
the Stoney Creek senior is ranked as the 18th amateur in the world to create
nuclear fusion. So, how does he do it?
Pointing to the steel chamber where all the magic happens, Thiago said on
Friday that this piece of the puzzle serves as a vacuum. The air is sucked out
and into a filter.
Then, deuterium gas — a form of hydrogen — is injected into the vacuum.
About 40,000 volts of electricity are charged into the chamber from a piece of
equipment taken from an old mammogram machine. As the machine runs, the atoms in
the chamber are attracted to the center and soon — ta da — nuclear fusion.
Thiago said when that happens, a small intense ball of energy forms.
He first achieved fusion in September and has been perfecting the machine he
built in his parents’ garage ever since.
This year, Thiago was a semifinalist for the Siemens Foundation’s National
Research Competition. He plans to enter the Science and Engineering Fair of
Metropolitan Detroit, which is in March, in hopes of qualifying to be in the
Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in New Mexico in May.
To his mom and dad, he’s still reminiscent of the 5-year-old who toiled over
a kid-friendly chemistry set and, then at age 9, was able to change the battery
in his older brother’s car.
Now, in a small room in the basement, Thiago has set up a science lab —
where bottles marked ""potassium hydroxide"" and ""methanol""
sit on shelves and a worn, old book, titled ""The Atomic Fingerprint:
Neutron Activation Analysis"" piled among others in the empty sink.
Thiago’s mom, Natalice Olson, initially was leery of the project, even though
the only real danger from the fusion machine is the high voltage and small
amount of X-rays emitted through a glass window in the vacuum chamber — through
which Olson videotapes the fusion in action..
But, she wasn’t really surprised, since he was always coming up with lofty
ideas.
""Originally, he wanted to build a hyperbaric chamber,"" she said,
adding that she promptly said no. But, when he came asking about the nuclear
fusion machine, she relented.
""I think it was pretty brave that he could think that he was capable to
do something so amazing,"" she said.
Thiago’s dad, Mark Olson, helped with some of the construction and electrical
work. To get all of the necessary parts, Thiago scoured the Internet, buying
items on eBay and using his age to persuade manufacturers to give him discounts.
The design of the model came from his own ideas and some suggestions from other
science-lovers he met online.
Someday, he hopes to work for the federal government — just like his
grandfather, Clarence Olson, who designed tanks for the Department of Defense
after World War II. Thiago, who is modest and humble about his accomplishment,
said he knew from an early age what he would do for a living.
""I was always interested in science,"" he said. ""It’s always
been my best subject in school.""
But, his mom had other ideas.
""I thought he was going to be a cook,"" Natalice Olson said,
""because he liked to mix things.""

,2020-12-19T19:42:46.788967Z,775,118,,"Image: Average temperatures warmed in nearly all parts of California between 1950 to 2000. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cal State L.A Click for Larger Image
Average temperatures in California rose almost one degree Celsius (nearly two degrees Fahrenheit) during the second half of the 20th century, with urban areas leading the trend to warmer conditions, according to a new study by scientists at NASA and California State University, Los Angeles. Results of the study appeared in the journal Climate Research.
But 50 years of temperature trends hardly proves anything relevant about climate change, other than its gotten warmer in the past fifty years. 50 years in terms of our planet and the suns processes is a blink. I have to think that because NASA chose to co-author this paper with researchers at California State University, that some of the statewide “global warming as man-made problem bias” crept into the thinking for the purpose of this paper, i.e. “we need another study to show that its getting hotter so action is justified”.
What is troubling about this study is that many of California’s historical climatological stations, when done on a 100 year trend, rather than a 50 year trend, show a net cooling over the period, or a reversal of trend. The northern Sacramento Valley has very few reporting stations that go back 100 years, so I only have 4 data points, but it makes me wonder just what data the NASA/CSU study used to come to the conclusion that our area has warmed 1.1 degrees F over the last 50 years.
I’ve prepared some side-by-side graphs below of Sacramento Valley stations to illustrate that point:

My data source: U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) Data Set
Yet the NASA/CSU paper claims “The only area to cool was a narrow band of the state’s mainly rural northeast interior“. None of the stations above are in that area, but are in the North Sacramento Valley.
Even odder than that, cold and snowy Mt. Shasta, where you’d expect to hear about depleted snowpack, it’s melting glacier on the side of the mountain, and other “signatures” of “global warming” shows a significant drop in temperatures over the last 50 years. yet the NASA/CSU study for that area concludes that a 2.1 degree F rise in temperature occurred.

Granted a few data points don’t equal a complete study, but the fact that I’ve been able to find and plot in a couple of hours, several places that don’t match the trends in the NASA/CSU study calls their methodology into question. Note the cities I used are all small rural cities, but the NASA/CSU study plotted major, medium, and minor cities in California to draw their conclusions. From their own paper they admit that the areas that have grown the most have shown the greatest temperature increases:
Southern California had the highest rates of warming, while the NE Interior Basins division experienced cooling. Large urban sites showed rates over twice those for the state, for the mean maximum temperatures, and over 5 times the state’s mean rate for the minimum temperatures. Average temperatures increased significantly in nearly 54 percent of the stations studied, with human-produced changes in land use seen as the most likely cause. The largest temperature increases were seen in the state’s urban areas, led by Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, particularly for minimum temperatures.
For example, look at Pasadena, CA once a small city itself,  but in the last 100 years it became a dot in the sea of the second largest American City, Los Angeles. It’s temperature trend, unsurprisingly, is sharply upward, for both the 50 and 100 year trends. Its drowning in a sea of asphalt and concrete, is it any wonder it shows a temperature increase?

The inescapable conclusion is that the NASA/CSU study is plotting the effects of urban heat islands, and applying that trend to the entire landmass of California to reach the conclusions they have mapped onto the state map of temperature trend they present.
A simple filtering based on urban growth factors would yield a temperature map with a far different result.
To their credit though, they recognize this fact:  “If we assume global warming affects all regions of the state, then the small increases our study found in rural stations can be an estimate of this general warming over land. Larger increases would therefore be due to local or regional changes in land surface use due to human activities.” 
For the most part, “urban warming” has dwarfed “global warming” in its magnitude, a fact that is lost on some who look at temperature data from weather stations worldwide and treat them all equally in the quest to prove a theory.

,2020-12-21T17:16:23.140000Z,776,119,,"Greta Thunberg has criticised world and business leaders for ignoring calls to break away from fossil fuels, as young people protested in Davos over the climate emergency. Speaking on the final day of the World Economic Forum, the 17-year old climate campaigner said leaders were not reacting to the crisis, and were not being held accountable for their inaction. “Before we came here we had a few demands for this WEF and of course those demands have been completely ignored, but we expected nothing less,” said Thunberg, speaking before marching through Davos with fellow climate activists. “As long as the science is ignored, and the facts aren’t taken into account, and the situation is not treated as a crisis, then world and business leaders can of course continue to ignore the situation,” she said. Thunberg, who appeared on two panels at the forum, has called for an immediate end to investments in fossil fuel exploration, fossil fuel subsidies and for investors to ditch fossil fuel assets. But while many delegates spoke about the importance of climate issues, actual action was harder to find. Luisa Neubauer, a 23-year-old German climate activist, said she had met the chief executive of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, at Davos this week to press him to abandon a contract to supply rail signalling to a mine in Australia. The Adani project would be one of the world’s largest coalmines, and Neubauer said such fossil fuel activity needed to be curbed by companies and investors. Otherwise the Paris agreement’s goal of keeping global heating to 2C this year could not be met, she said. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “If you add up all the contracts that have been signed by today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond 2C,” said Neubauer. “Some of those contracts, if not all of them, will have to be cancelled if we want to actually do something about Paris. “This is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand,” she added. On Thursday, the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said climate activists should recognise the impact of fossil fuel divestment on jobs, and said Thunberg should go study economics before offering advice. Thunberg said such barbs, like Donald Trump’s criticism, had no effect on her. “We are being criticised like that all the time. If we cared about that, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do,” she said, before leading a Fridays for Future protest in the ski resort. Some climate actions were announced at Davos, including a push to plant 1tn trees, which Donald Trump backed. Thunberg warned earlier this week that planting trees was not enough to tackle the climate crisis. But Micah White, the co-founder of the Occupy Wall Street movement, said the trillion tree campaign would work as a Trojan horse to help mobilise people to fight the climate emergency. “I love the trillion tree campaign, because hundreds of millions of people will need to be mobilised at the grass roots,” he said on the sidelines of WEF. “To actually mobilise that number of people, and plant that number of trees, will be such a systemic disruption of our day-to-day lives that it will be revolutionary.” White said corporations would have to tell staff, “You don’t have to come into work this week, we’re all planting trees”, and governments will have to deposit trees in all the schools, to actually carry out the plan. White attended Davos with a manifesto titled “An Alliance Of Opposites”. It proposed that protest movements, governments, activists, industry, and civil society could work together on the climate emergency. THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO ELITES AT DAVOSIt was a surreal experience to hand this candidly written activist manifesto to a few of the world’s most powerful people at the World Economic Forum in @Davos. https://t.co/dmuwyU0NJP#WEF2020",2020-12-21T17:16:23.140032Z,1

Today I’m writing about a public relations disaster here in Germany by the Heartland Institute where its president, James Taylor, allowed himself to be fully duped by leftist journalists posing as industry lobbyists offering half a million dollars to his Chicago-based think tank.

Image: Correctiv
Just days ago, flagship ZDF German public television broadcast a segment here — created by “investigative” site Correctiv here — at its popular weekly Frontal 21 magazine. Frontal 21 describes how the two “investigative” journalists from the leftist Correctiv infiltrated Heartland Institute and exposed its “lobbying and climate disinformation campaign”.
The ZDF’s Frontal 21 magazine shows how Correctiv set up a phony PR agency, fake website and printed phony business cards so that two of its reporters could pose as lobbyists representing the German automotive and coal industry. Their Project Veritas-like mission: to infiltrate Heartland and uncover “what goes on in the climate denier scene, how it works, which strategies it’s pursuing in Europe and how influential it is.”
“That’s how we want to find out whether and how to question climate change in exchange for money and to buy influence,” reported Frontal 21.
Unfortunately, James Taylor fell for the entire ploy. The ZDF’s Frontal 21 (and Corectiv) took the material and later pieced together a major hit piece seen nationally on February 4th. A blow to the skeptic scene in Germany.
First meeting in Munich
The two undercover German journalists started by making their way from their base in Berlin to the Munich Climate Conference last November, where they had an easy time fooling James Taylor.
Equipped with hidden cameras, they sat down with Taylor for dinner and asked how he went about convincing people of his mission. ZDF’s Frontal 21 quotes Taylor: “The people cannot be motivated by logical things; you have to argue emotionally.”
$500,000 offer in Madrid

//-->




According to Frontal 21, after dinner Taylor then personally invited the two “German lobbyists” to Madrid for a later conference, where they met again with Taylor in the Marriott Hotel lobby.
ZDF Frontal 21 reported: “Taylor boasted about his good contacts to the Trump administration. ‘The Trump administration often asked for advice and about what we could do. We worked closely together.'” Taylor even told the undercover journalists that Heartland’s budget was $6 million.”
When asked how a $500,000 donation could be made, Frontal 21 says Taylor told them to donate it directly to Heartland. “And if you want to remain anonymous, then give it to an organization. One of them is Donors Trust.”
“To keep it hidden?” one undercover Correctiv journalist asked.”
“Yeah right, exactly,” replied Taylor, alleges Frontal 21.
Untypical for interviews, Taylor’s voice is completely filtered out by Correctiv editors, so it’s impossible to ascertain whether Frontal 21 translated Taylor’s words accurately.
In the Marriott lobby meeting, Taylor discloses Heartland’s future plans for Germany, where he also brings up young German influencer Naomi Seibt – the “anti-Greta”.
Duped by the mean and nasty media
Weeks later, Taylor sends the two undercover journalists his proposal dubbed “Funding Proposal: Germany Environmental Issues”, outlining Heartland’s strategy for Germany and that Heartland was interested in the funding in order to inform the public about the minimal effects of diesel exhaust and to produce videos on the negative impacts of excessive environmental regulation.
The set-up succeeded, and Correctiv got all the footage they needed, and much more, to allow German ZDF public television to weave a highly distorted, one-sided, yet believable hit piece. All in all, a major PR blow for climate skeptics in Germany.
A little research and precaution on Heartland’s part could have avoided being duped to the extent they were. They were sloppy. And we also have to feel bad that a young, promising German influencer got caught up in it and was so inaccurately portrayed on national television.
In her latest video, a visibly distraught Naomi tells of her experience of being observed by impostors under the table by hidden cameras, yet bravely pledges to keep up the fight for what she believes to be the truth. Now she understands just how mean and nasty the German media really are.

,2020-12-21T17:16:29.789275Z,782,120,,"Cities may only occupy about 2% of the world’s habitable land, but they are big drivers of global climate change. Cities are usually hotter than rural areas, and get referred to in the jargon as “urban heat islands.”  Cities are hotter for a number of reasons. Traffic pollution creates a greenhouse effect that keeps heat in at night. Cutting down trees means you lose their ability to absorb heat and convert it into nutrients. Paving and tarmac quickly release the heat they retain back into the air, and rainwater has to be drained away in sewer systems, which deprives the area of the cooling effect of rain-soaked soil. Then there are people. They both generate body heat and heat buildings to keep themselves warm – or use air-conditioning to cool them down. Aircon means they are transferring warmer air into the streets outside, so it adds to the city’s warmth just as much as heating systems.  As cities expand in size and more people live in them, these warming factors have gradually been exacerbated. In the south of England, the difference between rural areas and London is as much as 6°C. In Glasgow, even though the population has subsided until recently, the difference can still be as much as 8°C.  In hotter parts of the world, this is reaching breaking point in some cases. Colombo in Sri Lanka has seen people migrating away in substantial numbers to live in cooler areas, for example. The searing heat in Phoenix, Arizona, may prevent the city from continued expansion. Even in more temperate cities like London or Paris, unexpected heatwaves can kill hundreds and even thousands of people.  Discussions about global warming tend to overlook the contribution of urban growth to the problem, and instead concentrate on what is happening to the temperature across the world.  And policy developers aiming to fight global warming overlook the fact that by focusing on ways to make cities cooler, they might contribute in a big way to the solution – perhaps much more than focusing on global carbon-reduction agreements that either fail or end up badly watered down. Given the forecasts for climate change out to 2050, this looks like a vital trick that is being missed.  The good news is that cities have been living with the effects of local warming for decades. By observing different cities around the world, we can see what needs to happen – the problem is getting those cities that do less to focus on doing more.  The solutions in hotter and cooler climates are different. [Research](http://researchonline.gcu.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rohinton-emmanuel(c687e6ca-47ef-47f5-810c-b662ff2eda72/publications.html) in warm, humid Colombo shows excessive amounts of solar radiation. But because of the availability of abundant water from year-round rainfall and a large amount of urban vegetation, there is much less temperature difference between the city centre and rural surroundings. This suggests that were this not in place, the migration problem could be even worse.  The research found that you a big difference can be made to the climate in tropical cities, whether humid or arid, through shade. This requires an ethos of urban design that turns on its head the old idea of “thou shall not cast shadow on thy neighbour’s property” and instead says, “thou shall cast shadow on public spaces.” This is not about shading buildings per se (nor is this desirable) but to encourage an urban geometry that makes the spaces between buildings naturally shaded without compromising buildings’ ability to draw in the sunlight as and when required.  Achieving this when the tropical sun is so high in the sky means that you have to use an intelligent combination of building heights and geometry together with elements such as canopies, awnings and urban vegetation.  With care and attention to detail, built-up areas can combine good shading with generous urban vegetation to cool neighbourhoods to temperatures that are even below those of rural areas. This is good news given the continued acceleration of urban growth in many tropical cities and rising concentrations of people. And even a couple of degrees’ difference can make a city unbearable in an area that is already hot.  London and New York are a good examples of what cities in cooler areas can do to make a difference. Their heat island policies include things like planning requirements to plant trees, reduce paved areas in parking lots and reduce traffic. But these sorts of policies are still quite rare across the board, and neither do you see much similar action in hotter climes. Singapore is one of very few tropical cities that prioritise traffic control for example.   Finally a word on colder cities such as Glasgow, where I am based and have been involved [in work](http://researchonline.gcu.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rohinton-emmanuel(c687e6ca-47ef-47f5-810c-b662ff2eda72/publications.html) to look at ways to make it cooler. This may not seem very necessary when the temperature is not particularly high but we need to bear in mind that it is likely to get hotter in the coming decades, so it will still contribute to global warming. For example our simulations suggest that if you increase tree cover by 20%, you could eliminate a third to half of the expected urban heat increase by 2050. This sort of intervention looks well worth considering.",2020-12-21T17:16:29.789330Z,1
,2020-12-22T12:33:53.322995Z,783,118,,"What do the numbers 923, 930, 935, 941 and 944 have in common? Answer: They’re different names for the same sunspot, this one shown above.
Greg Piepol of Rockville, Maryland, took the picture yesterday using a Solar Max Solar telescope/camera. It shows sunspot 944 coming around the sun’s eastern limb–for the fifth time! Usually sunspots form and dissolve in a matter of weeks, but this spot has endured for more than five 27-day solar rotations. By long and idiosyncratic tradition, a sunspot receives a new number each time it reappears and is visible to earth.
Sunspot 944 may not seem impressive now, but one month ago as “941” it was a lovely spiral. Three months ago as “930” it produced one of the strongest solar flares of the past 25 years and Northern Lights as far south as Arizona. What will it do this time?
Even though we are in between peaks in our 11 year sunspot cycle, we still seem to have quite an active sun. The trend over the last century has been that our solar cycle has had more activity than centuries before.

Of course, that couldn’t possibly have anything to do with global warming.

In Germany, the skeptics are outnumbered by like 20 to 1; it’s not a 50-50 deal like in USA. German MSM journalists like those at ZDF are very nasty, unfair and dishonest to legitimate climate science critics.

Pierre,
You are being VERY unfair to James Taylor and Heartland, and Naomi Seibt — who is not “distraught,” but angry (as is Heartland) at how this has been able “to weave a highly distorted, one-sided, yet believable hit piece.” You had it right on “distorted,” and not so right with the rest.
First: James is surely flattered by your battlefield promotion, but he is not the president of The Heartland Institute. He is the Director of Heartland’s Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy.
Second: They “worked” James spottily over several days in two cities over two weeks before he sat down for a brief talk. That’s a lot of squeeze for no juice. Their big “get” was a big nothing. They tried to bait James into agreeing for a “pay to play” arrangement, and the reporters say … “he didn’t say no.” Really? After two weeks of work, they finally get around to asking their “money question” and that’s it?
There’s a reason James didn’t say “yes”: Because “pay to play” is not what Heartland does, unlike many think tanks on the left. You’re seriously faulting James for steering a (fake) potential donor away from that “gotcha” dishonorable idea into discussing honorable like-minded work with a donor? By that standard, no one in the climate realist movement would ever be able to raise any funds to support our work.
Ask yourself: If these “journalists” had a genuine “smoking gun,” wouldn’t they have presented that instead of that lame “gotcha”?
Third: To compare this lame, days-long caper to the work of Project Veritas is a massive insult to the latter’s fantastic work.
I hope, Pierre, that you will consider giving Heartland some space on your site to more fully rebut for your readers your unfair and uncharitable take on this. Considering all Heartland has done to promote climate realism over many years, I hope you don’t consider that an unreasonable request.

So typical of climate science. Everything in and around it gets wildly exaggerated in order to feed media consumption and deceive the public. Reports are emerging that the “500,000 people” crowd awaiting Greta in Madrid was in fact as low as 15,000, according to Spanish federal police.
That would make the 500,000 claimed figure a 3000% exaggeration!

Greta demonstration in Madrid: Crowd number – 97% is exaggeration?

After Greta Thunberg’s arrival in Madrid, there was an “unprecedented demonstration” for climate protection in the Spanish capital, supposedly involving 500,000 participants.
But the federal police say there were about 15,000 (!) demonstrators.
At German news outlets, people could read that Greta Thunberg at first had to interrupt participating at the demonstration in Madrid – because of so many people and security could not be guaranteed. Later she stood on a stage with famous Hollywood actor Javier Bardem and gave a speech.
There were, as usual, no scientific facts to be found, but a lot of feeling, self-righteousness and general demands to an ominous elite, who officially stand behind Thunberg’s FFF.

The leaders are betraying us. Enough is enough. Change comes whether you like it or not. We want to see action.” [translated from the German]

Bardem seconded: “We only have ten years to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.” He also hit the Mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martinez-Almeida, and President Donald Trump for their “stupid” measures against climate change.

Sources revealing much smaller numbers
The Spanish media, but also the Austrian ORF, are now discussing falsified numbers of participants. The mass media had spoken of 500,000 demonstrators. That would mean that Greta caused one of the largest climate protection demonstrations on the planet in Spain.
Largely empty seats in Katowice in 2018
Those who remember the coverage of the world climate conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, know that Thunberg’s “breakthrough”, an emotional and panic-stricken speech in front of a “large” audience, had already been manipulated. In fact, the 15-year-old Swede spoke in front of largely empty rows of chairs, which was not visible in the media due to the skillful selection of photographic and film perspectives.
Police figure: only 15,000
Therefore the brash falsification of the numbers is not surprising. The organizers of the demonstration spoke of half a million participants, but the large newspaper El País spoke of 25,000 to 35,000, and the Spanish federal police of only about 15,000 people with the help of helicopter images.

Excerpt screen shot from El Pais.
Experience has shown that the police always give quite low numbers of demonstrators, but the unusual use of aerial photographs makes this figure seem convincing.
If one calculates the real number percentage of the FFF fantasy figure, then you come up with three percent. 97% of the claimed figure is presumably a lie. Demonstration organizers like to give slightly higher figures, but 30 times above reality is already extraordinary, especially in a globally important political PR campaign filmed by numerous cameras.
The knowledgeable climate sceptic is also quite familiar with the 97% figure – with respect to ex-President Barack Obama and climate psychologist John Cook. One sees how huge and audacious exaggerations / counterfeits are part of the climatic profiteering business. Isn’t that risky? Wouldn’t it be better to manipulate more cautiously so that there’s less to be accused of?
Obviously, those who don’t panic enough achieve less. Moreover, even critical citizens often would not imagine that someone would publicly falsify in such a brazen manner.

,2020-12-19T16:41:09.599408Z,788,120,,"When released in 1975, Jaws not only transformed the face of cinema, it would also change the way many of us perceived the ocean. We were exposed to a vengeful, human-eating, boat-destroying great white that although fictional, would end up haunting our relationship with sharks for decades to come. It would appear that the 40-year-old shark is still stalking many of us. The iconic tones of the theme song is still heard by many as they enter the ocean: “Da-dum, Da-dum …” A dorsal fin breaking the surface still encourages imagery reminiscent of a puppy wrestling a chew toy, only with added clouds of crimson and shrills of terror. Jaws resonated so strongly with audiences because Peter Benchley, author of the original novel, took inspiration from real-life events. Shark incidents did happen and with expanding populations, more and more people were encountering them while enjoying the ocean. Stories of “rogue” sharks caused headlines that added kindle to the embers of fear that Jaws had started. The shark had quickly become the villain that we loved to hate. Much like the chiming bell of a buoy, the film’s tagline – “Don’t go in the water” – rang loud for many people. The reality was that even with increased shark accidents the number of annual incidents was low. In 2014, only three people died from shark bites. Dogs, cows, driving and even vending machines would kill more people in 2014 than sharks did. Yet, without fully understanding the shark, many beaches would employ destructive measures in an attempt to reduce the risks. Gill nets, hunts and shark culls were adopted in an attempt to reduce the risk to ocean users, all of which would end with the death of our new “villain”. As exposure of shark incidents increased, so did our fascination with this “monster”. While no doubt responsible for the fear felt by most, the film was also a catalyst for progressing scientific research within the field of shark biology. Primarily set on mitigating the occurrences of shark attacks, we slowly began to unravel the enigmatic world of these “big fish”. Portrayed in the film as an indiscriminate killing machine capable of seeking revenge and sinking our boats, we slowly began to see there was much more behind the shark’s dark, “doll eyes” than first appeared. Research groups around the world began dedicating their work to uncovering the cryptic behaviour of these animals. We learnt of their incredible feats of transoceanic migrations, complex 3-dimensional movements and intricate population structuring. They weren’t too dissimilar to us with social interactions, learned behaviours, and even feeding preferences. These revelations were made across the shark species, from freshwater to the deep-sea.  Turns out, not all sharks were formidable apex predators and we very quickly realised that few species actually posed any threat to us whatsoever. The most alarming of all scientific discoveries however, would capsize everything we thought we knew about our relationship with sharks. Sharks are key predators within ocean habitats and are, in turn, vital components within these environments. Removal of sharks from the oceans can have disastrous effects that reverberate throughout an ecosystem. Unfortunately, sharks were under decline. With post-film popularity in trophy hunting and an on-going global expansion of fisheries, sharks were being removed from the ocean at an unprecedented rate. The fate of many would be in the soup bowls on Asian tables, where a dish called shark fin soup was being consumed on a growing scale. With estimates of 63 to 273 million sharks being killed every year, the once feared villain was now the imperilled victim. Despite scientists unanimously warning of the importance and vulnerability of shark populations, many countries are still failing to provide adequate fisheries management and regulatory enforcement to inhibit further declines. In the 40 years following the release of Jaws, it is quite remarkable the advancements we have made in understanding the ocean and its sharks. Yet, despite these advancements, countries continue to retaliate to shark incidents in much the same way that the residents of Amity Island did in Jaws: with shark hunts and culls. A recent study that evaluated the kill-based strategies adopted by Western Australia (and other countries), exposed the ineffectiveness of these destructive methods. Instead, hazard mitigation policies should focus on expanding scientific research, developing non-lethal mitigations and further improving education, outreach and public awareness/opinion. Our relationship with the shark is one riddled with complexities. After four decades of research by people inspired by these animals, education, ecotourism and fisheries regulations are improving. However, fantastical media inaccuracies and economic greed are preventing us from truly escaping the misconceived clutches of one of the ocean’s most misunderstood monsters.",2020-12-19T16:41:09.599441Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:12:53.024774Z,789,119,,"This week, among the private chalets and deep snow of Davos, the world’s leading politicians and businesspeople have been spending their time at the World Economic Forum (WEF), and they’ve been talking about the climate crisis. Greta Thunberg and Prince Charles have given stark speeches warning of the dangers of a warming world, and CEOs and presidents have promised long overdue action.  For those of us in the climate movement, this shift of focus is no surprise. Last year changed everything. From the wave of schoolchildren going on climate strike, to large scale non-violent uprisings like Extinction Rebellion, 2019 proved to be the year that people in power couldn’t hide any more from the need to act. And then Australia caught fire: no amount of money could put those fires out. With this sudden focus on climate it’s no wonder that attendees of the WEF have come under fire for their choice of transport in getting there. Prince Charles flew to the summit in a private jet, before demanding new green taxes. And he wasn’t the only one. Figures from last year suggest over 300 private jets landed for the talks – somewhat overshadowing the summit’s eco-credentials, including the carpets made from “end-of-life fishing nets” and the rooms painted with renewable resources “like seaweed”. But though the egregious use of private jets is both deeply hypocritical and climate-wrecking, it shouldn’t be the main focus of our ire. Instead, let’s look at what those sitting around this year’s mountaintop tables have on their climate record. And let’s be real about how much big corporates can plan for a carbon-free future, in light of the fact that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. Just 20 companies have contributed to 480bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965 – that’s a third of all emissions. Many of them – including the two largest emitters on Earth – are listed as “affiliates” on the WEF website. And it’s not just big oil – the financial institutions participating in the WEF are responsible for pumping at least $1.4tn into fossil fuel investments since the Paris climate agreement was signed. And then there’s the governments. Prince Charles’ speech was a powerful challenge to those in power, asking if “we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink?” But the UK government was this week revealed to be supporting fossil fuel mega projects around the world with the combined emissions of a country the size of Portugal. Such climate failure is not a byproduct of the economic system advocated by the WEF, it is baked into their model. An ideological commitment to free markets – advocated by those at Davos every year for the summit’s 50-year history – has been a consistent block to progress on the climate crisis. Just look at the world emissions data – an endless pursuit of economic expansion, of marketising every aspect of our lives, of extracting oil and gas to the point of no return, has put us on course for climate catastrophe. Climate data isn’t, as Thunberg says, “anyone’s political opinions or views”: it’s just a statement of fact. And that’s why over the last week I trekked across the mountains to Davos. Alongside 1500 people I spent three days walking from Landquart to Davos in possibly the coldest and most high-altitude climate justice march of all time. On the final day, we even managed to block the road to Davos, which has been blocking progress for a fairer and more just world the past 50 years. While Australia is burning and frontline communities all over the world are threatened by the very real consequences of the climate crisis, Davos-style meetings will never give us the answers we need. In truth, it would be foolish for anyone to expect a private club whose 1000 member companies have paid between 60,000 to 600,000 swiss francs to be a member (the more you pay the more access you have) should be trusted to solve an issue they created. A crisis of this scale needs scalable and just solutions – whether that’s a Green New Deal, divestment from fossil fuels, or decarbonisation targets in richer countries being rapidly brought forward. If the rich and famous at Davos really want to tackle the climate crisis, they should make this the last World Economic Forum. • Payal Parekh is an international climate activist and media spokesperson for the Swiss based Strike WEF Collective",2020-12-19T16:12:53.024807Z,1

Subsidies cut
Once lavished with huge incentives, the German wind industry is being hit hard after the government recently ended the huge subsidies that were once aimed at expanding the installation of wind energy capacity. Power grid operators had been struggling to keep the grid stable due to erratic feed-in and the subsidized feed-in of wind energy caused German electricity prices to become among the most expensive worldwide.
Fierce opposition from hundreds of protest groups
Moreover, hundreds of citizen protest groups have sprouted and since become a formidable force pushing for the stop of proposed wind projects. Not only have wind parks scarred the German landscape and destroyed biotopes nationwide, they have also been shown to be a real health hazard to humans living in their proximity through the low frequency infrasound they emit. Enough is enough, citizens say.
3000 job cuts in the works

FOCUS reports: “The crisis in the German wind energy industry is worsening. According to the ‘Süddeutsche Zeitung’, hard cuts at the largest German manufacturer Enercon will cost 3000 jobs.”
Next year Enercon will also cut contracts with suppliers, sending a wave of job losses across the industry. “If supply contracts are terminated as planned, many of these companies are threatened with extinction,” FOCUS reports.
FOCUS notes that the layoffs will hit regions that are already economically weak. “At the Aurich and Magdeburg locations, 1500 jobs will be cut, according to the company. At the company headquarters in Aurich, 250 to 300 jobs are affected.”
Stricter regulations for wind parks, greater setback distances
Not only have the subsidies for German wind parks been cut back, but also setback rules will become more strict in order to protect homes and residents from landscape blight and infrasound. In the future, wind parks will need to keep a greater distance away from residential areas. The current  CDU/CSU/SPD government wants to keep at least one kilometer between wind power installations and residential areas in the future. This will make many proposed projects impossible.
German Greens demand the industrialization of scenic landscape
The stricter setback rules have been sharply criticized by the wind industry, and particularly by German Green party leader, Annalena Baerbock: “The planned distance rules for wind turbines are devastating,” she told network Germany RND.
“Contrary to all public announcements, the federal government is thus making further expansion of wind power impossible. This is tantamount to a boycott of the Paris Climate Treaty and its own climate targets.” Baerbock also told RND: “The federal government claims to want to get out of coal but at the same time is stopping the expansion of wind power.”

For those of you interested in sustainability or renewable energy, your first and best defense against power waste is to look for energy that is being wasted in normal everyday use. You’d be surprised at how many of our modern electronic devices that appear to be “off” are actually wasting power and you don’t even know it. TV’s, radios, game consoles, some computers, and many rechargeable devices waste a huge amount of power.
There’s two places this happens:
1. Instant on devices: TV’s and stereos are especially bad. The convenience of having the device turn on immediately causes it to operate in standby mode, drawing a small amount of power 24/7 Some PC’s also operate this way.
2. Devices with AC plug transformers. Often called “wall-warts” these small transformers convert the 120 volts AC to a safer 6-15 volts DC to power the electronic device. Even if the device is unplugged from the transformer, the transformer continues to waste power!
The Watts Up meter can help you identify and quantify where power is being wasted and how much it is costing you. You’d be surprised.

A simple solution to the problem of home energy waste is a $5 power strip. For example I have a TV set and satellite receiver on my workshop which I use to keep abreast of news while tinkering. If I left these two devices plugged in 24/7, they’d waste about $12/year in electricity. I plugged both of them into an inexpensive power strip, enabling me to separate them from the AC power source. Since I don’t use my workshop every day, the small inconvenience of waiting for the satellite reciever to initialize (about 1 minute) is well worth the money I’ll save over the years.
Chargers are another place this could work. Cell phone chargers, MP3 player chargers, etc can all be placed on a single power strip. When the devices are fully charged or disconnected, simply turn of the power strip to end power draw.

,2020-12-21T17:16:46.965071Z,794,120,,"From the “us” against “phlegm” department:
There’s a DailyMail article about the possibility of a revolutionary flu vaccine that could work against all strains of the Influenza A disease. This ‘holy grail’ of vaccines would work on everything from the annual ‘winter flu’ to the ‘bird flu’. The best part is that just a few vaccinations may provide complete immunity, unlike the annual boosters are current defenses require.

From the article:
“The new jabs would be grown in huge vats of bacterial ‘soup’, with just two pints of liquid providing 10,000 doses of vaccine. Current flu vaccines focus on two proteins on the surface of the virus. However, these constantly mutate in a bid to fool the immune system, making it impossible for vaccine manufacturers to keep up with the creation of each new strain. The universal vaccines focus on a different protein called M2, which has barely changed during the last 100 years.”
The brainchild of scientists at Cambridge biotech firm Acambis, working with Belgian researchers, the vaccine will be tested on humans for the first time in the next few months.
A similar universal flu vaccine, being developed by Swiss vaccine firm Cytos Biotechnology, could also be tested on people in 2007 – and the vaccines on the market in around five years.

,2020-12-22T12:34:11.380142Z,795,120,,"A stunning little fish that eats salmon parasites could revolutionise aquaculture by providing an eco-friendly alternative to fish medicines.  The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the world’s favourite fish, and there’s big money to be made farming it – Scotland alone exports £400m worth per year. As in most agrifood sectors, the big rewards on offer have caused the industry to consolidate into fewer, larger players. It’s also lead to major technological breakthroughs and most of the big salmon farming challenges have now been addressed, except one: sea lice. Sea lice are small crustacean parasites that live on salmon, damaging their scales, reducing growth and helping diseases spread. The industry in Scotland is spending more than £30m per year on mitigation with approved veterinary medicines being a core element of parasite control.     There is a better way. My research group, in collaboration with leading salmon farming companies, has focused on an alternative “greener” approach – the use of cleaner fish, especially ballan wrasse. Controlling parasites with a biological agent – the cleaner fish – would be unique among livestock farmed for human food, but there are good reasons to think these wrasse are up to the task as we’ve known about their cleaning powers since the 1970s. Previously evidence was mainly anecdotal however, based on observing what happened when wild cleaner fish broke into salmon cages.  If we want scale things up, to harness these powers to make fishing more sustainable then the challenge now is to farm the cleaner fish themselves. This should protect numbers in the wild as well as being a safer option for salmon farmers – farmed wrasse would be disease-free, with a standardised size and robustness.  However, we first had to determine farming (domestication) would not mean these fish stopped going after the sea lice. Would a farmed wrasse still be interested in foraging on sea lice if it had never seen one during the two years spent in fish tanks and fed on pellets? Two Stirling colleagues and I recently published a study confirming the strong innate delousing behaviour of farmed ballan wrasse. Surprisingly, even though the wrasse were each able to eat up to 175 lice per day we didn’t find their hunger levelled off. The fish enjoy eating parasites, but they still don’t feel full. Supplementary feed is still needed. We also found size did not really matter, larger fish not being more effective than smaller ones. This means we can figure out the optimum wrasse deployment – numbers and size relative to salmon and sea pens and so on – and it also means the wrasse can be fed while cohabiting with salmon. Ballan wrasse aren’t the tastiest fish, though they are often used in the French “bouillabaisse” soup. However the species does have a number of striking features – and not just its looks. Their reproduction strategy is unusual. All ballan wrasse are born females and then undergo a sex inversion into males at a later stage of their life cycle (a phenomenon known as hermaphroditism protogynous). Their behaviour can be odd: they truly sleep at night which is not common in fish, the younger fish have a habit of grouping together in a ball, and of course they enjoy delousing. The fish also have no stomach, and a bile pigment causes their plasma to be blue. All this means scientists find ballan wrasse fascinating but it doesn’t make farming them any easier. In marine aquaculture, the first stages of life are generally the toughest to get right as the supply of eggs can be unreliable and lots of fish die off before they are fully developed. But things are improving. We can now better manage breeders and optimise egg production and fish survival, thanks to a range of tools developed to identify gender and manipulate sex on demand if required, assess reproductive conditions, remove the stickiness from the newly spawned eggs which simplifies the disinfection from potential pathogens, synchronise hatching and successfully produce robust fish in the hatchery. All of these resulted in the first commercial batches of farmed ballan wrasse in the hatchery and significant numbers of fish deployed to salmon farms.  Over the past few years we’ve made significant progress and the industry has even completed full 16-18 month salmon production cycles at sea without using any medicine to control sea lice. We’ve just been given a grant to continue our research so look out for further developments. It’s clear that cleaner fish really can be an effective way to keep salmon clean and healthy.",2020-12-22T12:34:11.380176Z,1
,2020-12-19T13:42:03.907856Z,798,118,,"Image above: Dubbed the “Swan” this X-ray image shows massive energy releases from the sun’s magnetic field, even while we are at the solar minimum in between sunspots cycles.
Last week, on the same day Al Gore was giving testimony to congress on made-made CO2 being the sole cause of Global Warming, NASA called a press conference in Washington DC to announce some spectacular new findings about the sun. Of course everybody in the press was so busy covering Gore’s big day, there was hadly any mention of what NASA announced.
What they announced was that a new X-ray imaging satellite called HINODE, launched in September 2006, has seen the first images that  explain one of the biggest mysteries of the sun: why the corona is hotter than the suns surface. Magnetic reconnection seems to be the key, and these images go a long ways towards proving the theory.
But even more importantly, scientists expected to see a very quiet sun with the new x-ray imager, since we are at solar minimum right now. NASA announced we’d reached solar min on March 6th. The fact that the HINODE scientists saw huge explosive energy bursts even while the surface of the sun is nearly devoid of sunspots tells them that the suns magnetic field is still tremendously active. The suns magnetic field has been getting more active for the past hundred years, coincidentally at the same time CO2 on earth has been increasing along with the global mean temperature.

But it seems that coincidence makes CO2 a Red Herring.
The linkage between changes in the suns magnetic field and earths climate has been well documented. Global temps closely track solar cycles as measured by sunspot intensity. Sunpots are proxy indicators of changes in the suns magnetic field. The Danish Meteorological Institute first reported the correlation in a study going back centuries. Historic data reveal that whenever the sun got more active, the earth heated up, and vice versa. The best correlation was the Maunder Minimum.

But until now, we could not see energy being transported away from the sun via its magentic field, which is why many in the environmental community doubt the role of the sun in climate change. We couldn’t visualize the sun’s magnetic output. This new tool is going to open a whole new era of understanding how the sun works, and more importantly how changes on the sun link to climate changes on earth.
Of course I’m sure Mr. Gore will find a way to explain this away, since we can’t have any new science getting in the way of a “consensus” and a “debate thats over”.
Inconveniently, NASA also announced last week a new study that shows a clear sun-earth linkage in records kept by Eqyptians of the Nile river, rainfall, and auroral activity which is a direct indicator of solar activity. It seems the sun-earth climate linkage has been around way before SUV’s.
So what’s easier to believe as the cause of climate change? That a trace gas called CO2 that has increased on earth from about 280 PPM to 380 PPM in the last 100 years is the cause, or that the giant nuclear fireball a thousand times bigger than earth a mere 8 light-minutes away has been getting more active during the same period is the reason?

Making up facts
For example, in his COP25 opening speech, many of the claims made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres outright flunked the reality test, were exposed to be outlandish and seemed to be completely made up.
At Twitterm, Timjbo tweeted some Sky News footage of a statement made by the UN Secretary General, followed by a fact-check:
 Climate related disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive with growing human and financial cost.”

“Incredible 98% reduction” in climate deaths since 1930
The footage of Guterres is then followed by a Sky News panel analysis at Sky News, which featured MP Craig Kelly, who said that Guterres told three untruths in a single sentence.

Guterres is saying the exact opposite of what is true
Kelly shows that climate-related deaths are “at the lowest level in history”.
“There’s been a 98% decline, an incredible 98% decline since the 1930s,” said Kelly. “And this year we’ll get the lowest number of deaths from climate-related  disasters, ever!”
Kelly slams the UN Secretary General for saying the “exact opposite of what is true.”
Lie number 2: increasing number of climate related disasters
Also shown by Sky News is a chart depicting the number of reported natural disasters since 2000.

It’s a lie that climate-related disasters have increased.
Lies for cash = fraud
Here as well climate-related disasters have fallen steadily since 2000.
Kelly believes that money is behind all the falsehoods. “The UN is after cash,” Kelly says. He adds: “Now when someone makes false and misleading statements asking for cash, that is called fraud.”
Lie no. 3: “The costs of disasters is increasing.”
The third lie in the Secretary General’s whopper statement was saying the costs of disasters was rising. But here as well the data tell the opposite story:

Gore told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the scale of the climate emergency was much worse than people recognise, and getting worse much faster than people recognise.  “The burden to act on the shoulders of the generation of the people alive today is a challenge to our moral imagination,” said Gore, during a session on protecting the Amazon and developing sustainable markets. “This is Thermopylae.

This is 9/11,” declared Gore. “We have to rise to this occasion.” Gore, who has campaigned on environmental issues since losing the 2000 presidential race, added that the world currently lacks the requisite political will to tackle the emergency. “But remember, political will is itself a renewable resource,” he added, to applause from the audience. Jane Goodall, the English primatologist and anthropologist, called for more education and funding to help young people tackle the crisis. “My hope is that we can increase the level of education and understanding, not only but especially among our youth, and increase the level of funding so they can do more,” she said. “The young people know what needs to be done, but very often there aren’t the resources for them to actually do it,” Goodall added.",2020-12-21T17:17:14.719327Z,1
,2020-12-22T12:34:26.183057Z,801,119,,"The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said he “can’t explain” Scott Morrison’s behaviour during Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis and that his successor had “downplayed” the catastrophe and had not behaved the way a prime minister should. Turnbull made the extraordinary criticism of Morrison during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, in which he also blamed News Corp and rightwing thinktanks in Australia for promoting climate change denialism.  He “could not explain” why Morrison had refused to meet former fire chiefs – who early last year attempted to warn him of the risks posed by the coming fire season – and then decided to holiday in Hawaii in the midst of the crisis in December. “Everybody knew we were in a very dry time and as a consequence the fire season was likely to be very bad,” Turnbull said. “So rather than doing what a leader should do and preparing people for that, he downplayed it – and then of course chose to go away on holiday in Hawaii at the peak of the crisis. “I can’t explain any of that. It’s not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would and should act.” Morrison cut short his family holiday to Hawaii after two volunteer firefighters in New South Wales died. He came home two days early and apologised, saying he “deeply regretted” any offence caused. But he was then heckled on a visit to the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo in NSW, where three people died, and mistakenly said that nobody had died on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island, where two people had died. “I do not know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has,” Turnbull said. “I’ve known him for 20 years, at least. I can’t explain his conduct.” Morrison’s personal approval rating and rating as preferred prime minister fell in the first polls after the bushfire season began. “I can’t explain why he didn’t meet the former fire commissioners who wanted to see him in March last year to talk about the gravity of the threat,” Turnbull said. In November the former fire chiefs said Morrison had turned down a meeting with them because his government “fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change”. Turnbull also criticised the role of rightwing politics in Australia and the Murdoch press in promoting climate denialism. “If you go to any of the rightwing thinktanks or read the Murdoch press it is just full of climate denialism,” he said. “And it is designed to deflect from the real objective which has to be to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. “To be a climate change denier is a badge of honour on the right wing of politics here and in the US, and it is mad.” Turnbull said Australia was “in the frontline of the consequences” and needed to act on the climate crisis to show the world that it was important. “How many more coral reefs have to be bleached, how many more million hectares of forest have to be burned?” he asked. “How many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong? “If a country like Australia is not prepared to grapple with this issue seriously, itself being in the frontline of the consequences and being an advanced, prosperous, technologically sophisticated country, with the means to do so, then why would other countries take the issue as seriously as they should?” On Tuesday Morrison said reducing fuel loads with hazard reduction burns was at least as important as reducing carbon emissions to prevent future bushfire disasters. “Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,” he told the Australian. In November former heads of the NSW, Queensland, Victorian and Tasmanian fire services said they were not allowed “to utter the words ‘climate change’” even though it contributed to longer, more intense bushfires. “Bushfires are a symptom of climate change,” said Neil Bibby, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority. “Firefighters are the immune system that gets rid of that symptom. But [the problem is] still there.”",2020-12-22T12:34:26.183089Z,1

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P. Gosselin)
German Spiegel Online on 7 December 2019:
Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and Zambia: “It’s the longest dry period that we have ever had.”
The Victoria Falls are considered to be the widest waterfall in the world. But instead of the usual quantities that plunge into its depths, there is a drought – tourists have also gone absent. The mood there is gloomy.”
And, of course, it is being immediately attempted to explain the water flow with man-made climate change. The Guardian wrote on the same day:
Data from the Zambezi River Authority shows water flow at its lowest since 1995, and well under the long-term average. Zambian president, Edgar Lungu, has called it ‘a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment’.”
Spiegel calls it the worst drought ever. The Guardian calls it the worst drought since 1995. That’s a small difference.
As always, it’s best to look at the hard data. Here we look into a report by Richard Beilfuss from 2012 (pdf here), which has the following exciting title:
A Risky Climate for Southern African Hydro: assessing hydrological risks and consequences for Zambezi River Basin Dams “
The report checks whether dams along the Zambezi River are always supplied with sufficient water. In the event of water shortages, the turbines would quickly stop and the production of electricity would fail. Therefore, Beilfuss looks back into the hydrological past of the Zambezi region to better understand the variability of rainfall. He embeds his research in the usual climate change narrative, which we can overlook.
We are particularly interested in the facts presented by Beilfuss. From his summary:

The Zambezi River Basin has one of the most variable climates of any major river basin in the world, with an extreme range of conditions across the catchment and through time. Average annual rainfall varies from more than 1,600 mm per year in some far northern highland areas to less than 550 mm per year in the water-stressed southern portion of the basin.
Runoff is highly variable across the basin, and from year to year. The entire Zambezi River Basin is highly susceptible to extreme droughts (often multi-year droughts) and floods that occur nearly every decade. Droughts have considerable impact on river flows and hydropower production in the basin. For example, during the severe 1991/92 drought, reduced hydropower generation resulted in an estimated US$102 million reduction in GDP, $36 million reduction in export earnings, and the loss of 3,000 jobs.”
Oh, man. The Zambezi area is already well known as a highly variable rain area. Can a drought be surprising at all? Why is this drought man-made in 2019, when there have apparently always been droughts in the past?
Not CO2 related
A little later in the report we also find a flow diagram for the Victoria Falls:

Figure: Water flow rate-volume at the Victoria Falls an den 1907-2006. Source: Beilfuss 2012 (immediately pdf)
We see a strong variability from year to year. On a scale of several decades, the period 1940-1980 is characterized by particularly high flow rates. The early 20th century was rather dry. A coupling to the 60-year-old ocean cycle offers itself. The Pacific is far away, but the wet Zambezi phase fits quite well into the negative PDO:

Figure: The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Source: By Giorgiogp2 – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=13297650
Working hypothesis: Whenever the PDO is positive, the flow at the Victoria Falls decreases. And what is PDO doing right now? It is positive. It fits!

It’s a pity that so few take the trouble to first check the natural precipitation dynamics and possible correlations.
It’s so much easier to simply hold the universal rogue CO2 reflexively responsible for every observed rain anomaly. Naturally, this quick fix is not sustainable. In this specific case, it was probably just a matter of dark climate alarmist background music for the climate conference in Madrid.

,2020-12-19T13:43:03.648190Z,804,120,,"Smartphones may have been around for a while but demand for digital traffic is still growing fast. During the new year celebrations, mobile providers in the UK and Australia reported a 50% increase in traffic compared to last year, while in Taiwan mobile data more than doubled.  This is because mobile device availability, functionality and connectivity are increasingly creating the possibility of sending greetings to many others in different ways.   It isn’t just “special events” like New Year’s Eve or the record-breaking traffic generated by Apple’s iOS upgrade that we should worry about. Underlying such sudden demand peaks is an ongoing, steady increase of total demand. In Europe, recent years have shown typical increases of 30% every six months for home broadband and 15% for mobile (cellular) data. But given the resources marshalled to support continued rises in data volume and ever-faster speeds, we should also be debating what kinds of digital services have real social importance. It’s great that it’s so easy to keep in contact with close friends and family, almost anywhere in the world. Yet a time when we are battling to keep carbon emissions under control, can we really justify the energy consumption involved in streaming cat videos in ever-higher definition? Much of the energy and carbon burden of more data and more speed is buried in network infrastructure and hidden away in data centres, easily ignored by people in bedrooms and offices, but not by the global climate.   But what is all this movement of data for?  Ostensibly, about half of it is for staying in touch with others, and watching and listening to media. The rise of Facebook, YouTube and Skype is supported by larger data allowances, faster speeds, and more reliable and affordable home and mobile connections. This goes hand-in-hand with increasing numbers of smartphones, tablets, and internet-connected televisions. More data to more devices all day and night pushes us to faster infrastructure that is active a greater proportion of the time.  This in turn means more energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.  Figuring out exactly how much more demand and emissions is difficult as it involves many unknowns, from the originating data centre right through to the computer or phone at the other end.  But we do know the following: sharing photos or videos is more energy-intensive than sending a text message or making a phone call; that video streaming tends to require more energy than broadcast television; and that listening and watching on smartphones and tablets adds to, rather than wholly supplants, the hours that TVs are watched.  Demand for consumption and the means to consume are joined at the hip – they constitute each other.  This has resulted in escalation: higher-speed and more widespread infrastructure has made feasible new data-hungry services such as Netflix. This in turn has spurred higher speeds and more pervasive infrastructure allowing higher demand.   Indeed, fast connections mean people have made more intensive use of on-demand streaming services. No one binge-watched a whole TV series through a dial-up connection. But enterprising companies are also making use of faster connections. Unsatisfied with regular high-definition video, Netflix developed “super HD” which increases data demand by 11-50% and led to significant increases in traffic for some internet service providers. More recently, the introduction of Facebook’s “autoplay”, which streams shared videos and adverts automatically, caused massive traffic surges.   Innovations such as these mean that even if the time we spend digitally sharing, chatting, or watching doesn’t rise, the amount of data demanded does. Real and anticipated rises in demand tend to be framed as needs which must be met, despite the fact that there was no such need before. Connecting those without broadband is important, but most of the focus remains on speeding up everyone else. Look, for instance, at the talk about the need for “ultrafast” broadband of up to one gigabit per second, when industry regulator Ofcom’s own report shows that just 10 Mbit per second is what we might expect for a home. Thus far the debate over this ever-increasing connectivity has primarily been about who should pay for, or profit from, the traffic, and equality of (speedy) access. But the increasing emissions this generates are a global problem which demands a solution far beyond the ins and outs of broadband policy. We need more purposeful planning of capacity and speed, and their justifiable limits – which in the end, there surely must be. By contrast, the current strategy – predict-and-provide, followed by more predict-and-provide – can only make January 1, 2016 a chance to set another new record.",2020-12-19T13:43:03.648223Z,1

Venice, the treasure of Italy, is a city built on a mud swamp. Consequently, in the last 100 years it has sunk about 25 cm, or 2.5 millimeters per year (Munaretto et al., 2012).
The lagoon city had its worst flooding event ever recorded in 1966, when CO2 concentrations were still about 320 ppm.
Last week Venice flooded again, and, as expected, journalists blamed climate change and rising atmospheric CO2.
However, when we consider sea level rise rates for Venice averaged 2.6 mm/yr during 1872-1969, but then decelerated to 0.7 mm/yr for 1970-2000 (Munaretto et al., 2012), these trends are the opposite of what would be expected if CO2 emissions were driving sea level rise.

Pisa’s history provides a sea level perspective
Italy’s Pisa is famous for its leaning tower.
The city was originally built on the coast of the sea about 13 centuries before the common era (~3300 years ago). At that time, sea levels were meters higher than they are now despite the low (~270 ppm) CO2 concentrations.

During the Roman Warm Period, Pisa was still close enough to the sea coast (~4 km) to be a busy harbour (Huissen and de Graauw, 2019), accessible by canal. Dozens of ships dating to Roman times have been found buried beneath the city in recent decades.
In the last 2000 years, however, sea levels have retreated so thoroughly that Pisa now sits 9.7 km from the sea coast.

Italy’s sea level during the last interglacial
About 130,000 to 120,000 years ago, or during the last interglacial, CO2 levels peaked at 280 ppm.
Yet along the coasts of central Italy there are marine mollusck shells buried in silty sand and clay 12-35 m above today’s sea levels dating to this time period (Marra et al., 2019).

Image Source: Marra et al., 2019
In sum, the record of coastal changes throughout both ancient times and in the modern era do not support the conclusion CO2 levels are a driver of sea level change.

According to the online, German-language Merkur.de here, citing Swedish daily Expressen, 16-year old climate activist is advised by Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, among others, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany.
Wild science claims

Professor Rahmstorf and the Potsdam Institute are well known among the climate science community for their highly alarmist projections and off-the-mark science. For example, the PIK’s former director, Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, once preposterously claimed the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2030 and the world would explode with 9 billion people on it.
Alarmism as a business model
According to the Merkur, the PIK has “created a business model with climate change”, adding: “It advises state institutions and municipalities on how they can protect themselves against the severe climate changes predicted by PIK.”

The Merkur reports how Greta and Professor Rahmstorf “have met on several occasions” and how the 16-year old “calls the professor for advice.” Rahmstorf praises the teenager, saying “she knows a lot about climate science” and argues that politicians too should adopt Greta’s doomsday visions.

“Holy anger” and “religious exaggeration” 
But now some are speaking up against the excessive alarmism.
Not only are some media questioning Rahmstorf’s alarmist climate science, though it makes for good headlines, but so are other experts, such as renowned geologist Stefan Kröpelin, or Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, or veteran meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann.
Swiss meteorologist Kachelmann calls Rahmstorf a “climate-Ratzinger”, alluding to former Pope Benedict XVI, earlier known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Kachelmann, a warmist, has become turned off by the fiery Potsdam professor’s “religious exaggeration” and “holy anger” in the climate debate.
“Climate howler”
The two heavyweights recently even argued on Twitter about whether a piece of broken glass could trigger a forest fire, as Rahmstorf claims, or not. The sharp-witted, media-savvy Kachelmann recently characterized claims made by Rahmstorf as “potsdaft” – an allusion to his place of work –  and labelled him a Klimaheuler, a ‘climate howler’.
Surrounded by alarmists, rational voices not welcome

Greta Thunberg’s other advisors include Swedish Professor Johan Rockström (53) and British Professor Kevin Anderson (57), both devout alarmists. Non-alarmist climate experts and rational voices are not welcome by Thunberg and her advisors. Why ruin a good business model?

Mr. Morano’s Politically Incorrect Guide book had been recently released in the Japanese version, translated from the English by Tadashi Watanabe, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry of the University of Tokyo and Professor of Tokyo University of Science Graduate School.
Mann lost in court
The Sankei Shimbun book review, authored by Shohei Nagatsuji, explains how this summer an event occurred and challenges the foundation on which the existing IPCC bases its CO2 global warming theory, but which went unreported in Japan. This August, the reliability of Dr. Michael Mann’s hockey stick graph was rocked after he had lost a defamation case against a Canadian researcher [Dr. Tim Ball], who had sharply criticized the hockey stick graph.
“Hundreds of factors” behind climate change
The Sankei Shimbun also reports how Mr. Marc Morano’s book -「地球温暖化」の不都合な真実』- presents the criticisms of Prof. Mann and the inside workings of IPCC.

The Japanese daily explains how Morano’s book cites scientists who say “temperature is mainly determined by water vapor and clouds, so even if CO2 is doubled or tripled, the situation would be almost the same” and that there are in fact “hundreds of factors contributing to climate change.”

Marc Morano’s best selling “The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change” now in Japanese.
All focus on CO2 is “misplaced”
The Japanese daily also says Mr. Morano’s book shows how scientists from the UK and New Zealand saying that putting all the focus on CO2 is ” misplaced”.
“…amazed at each chapter”
According to the Sankei Shimbun:
We recommend you take this book because it is easy to read. You’ll be amazed at each chapter. It is full of scientific controversies and scandals over global warming that are not well understood in Japan.”
No consensus
The Sankei Shimbun concludes that Mr. Morano’s book provides “an overall picture of the global warming issue” and that it is an issue which “can be viewed from multiple perspectives.”
Overall it’s a very positive, welcome review for Marc Morano’s “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change” here in Japan. Recently Morano’s book has climbed near the top of the charts for books under Environment.

By Kirye in Tokyo
and Pierre Gosselin
No trend in long-term annual precipitation
Over the past 100 years, for example, annual precipitation has not trended in an particular direction over the long term, showing rather some cyclical attributes:

Data source: Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). 
If anything, precipitation has been rather steady for the better part of the past 2 decades, and even resembles what was observed about 60 years ago, in the 1950s.
Note how the extremes in precipitation occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the climate talk was about global cooling. But overall, there’s been no trend change in precipitation in Japan.
Typhoons trending downward modestly!
Typhoons forming, and those striking Japan, also show no worsening, as is otherwise often claimed by climate alarmists. What follows is a plot of typhoon landfalls for Japan and typhoons formed, since 1951:
Data: JMA here and here. 
The data suggest the number of typhoons forming and those striking Japan have declined modestly over the past 70 years, which is in line with the trends for global tropical storms. So there’s nothing alarming happening.
Japan sea level rise “no long-term trend”

Also nothing dramatic is happening with regards to Japan and sea level rise. This is the official conclusion of the JMA! Their site states:
A trend of sea level rise has been observed in Japanese coastal areas since the 1980s, but no long-term trend of rise is seen for the period from 1906 to 2018. Variations with 10- to 20-year periods (near-10-year variations) are seen for the period from 1906 to 2018.

 The 1981 – 2010 average is used as the normal. 
Annual sea level anomaly time series (comma-separated value file: 3 KB)
The graph indicates annual mean sea level anomalies for each year averaged among the four tide gauge stations shown in the map on the left below for the period from 1906 to 1959, and among the four regions shown in the map on the right below for the period from 1960 onward. The solid blue line represents the five-year running mean of annual sea level anomalies averaged among the four stations, while the solid red line represents the corresponding value for the four regions. The dashed blue line represents the value at the four stations for the same period shown by the solid red line (from 1960 onward) for reference.”




Japan annual temps steady 80 years, before peculiar 1990 jump
Finally, we look at Japan’s mean annual temperature trend over the past 100 years. Though we see an overall rise – it had remained more or less steady for some 80 years, from 1918 to 1990. But suddenly in 1990, the mean temperature jumped to new plateau.

Data source: JMA. 
Perhaps this may have in part been due to a change over to electronic measurement systems and urban heat island effect, along with station siting. One thing can be ruled out: Any CO2 effect would not act so instantaneously.
Japan’s climate has not really worsened
Overall in terms of weather extremes, cold and storms, things in Japan have not gotten worse. In fact one could easily argue things have tamed just a bit.

Mostly this is because we don’t go in for the pathetic jingo-nationalist, quasi-militaristic “love it or leave it”-style patriotism that John Howard attempted to link with a love of country.  But I do love Australia. I get an absurd amount of irrational pride when I hear of Australians doing well. When I read stories that Indigenous rock art might be among the oldest in the world I get excited and think, yeah suck it, caves of Cantabria! I can still remember where I was when John Aloisi scored the winning penalty against Uruguay (jumping up in my home in Cairns and cutting my hand on the overhead fan), and like all sensible Australians I let out a deep groan whenever I hear someone start yet again an “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie” chant at the tennis. But my love has nothing to do with Australian Day and no, this is not an article about Australia Day. I mean, of course we should change the date. As one who grew up in country South Australia from German ancestors, the English landing in Sydney has never resonated for me as anything more than New South Wales Proclamation Day. Thanks for the holiday and the cricket at Adelaide Oval, but otherwise ... Keep the public holiday – make it the last Monday in January – it is nicely timed to signal an end to the summer holidays. Call it “Summer Day” or some such and then find another day to actually celebrate the nation. Better still, become a republic and make it that day. But I digress. This is not about Australia Day, but climate change. Because I love Australia, and the real question is why don’t conservatives who refuse to do more on climate change love Australia? Because climate change will destroy much of what we love about this country of ours. Much of what makes Australia unique and beloved by those of us lucky enough to live here is linked to the extremes of our land and climate. In my lifetime I have mostly lived in country areas – in South Australia on the Murray River, in Redlynch just north of Cairns, and now in the northern suburbs of the bush capital that is Canberra. So I love our biggest river and the farming areas of wheat, sheep and dairy around my home town to the grapes and fruit in the Riverland where during uni I picked fruit in the summer holidays. Then there are the tropics with Mossman Gorge, the glorious drive from Cairns to Port Douglas, the Great Barrier Reef and the late afternoon rains. And yes, I love the surrounds of Canberra – where I can live near a national park with kangaroos and echidnas and be able to see the snow caps on the Brindabellas in winter and fiery red of the trees in autumn and the blossoms in spring. As anyone who has spent any time overseas knows, there is something about the sky in Australia that is different – that shade of blue so perfectly captured by Tom Roberts in his painting A Break Away!. That gorgeous clear, crisp blue. I must admit I don’t love Dorothea Mackellar’s My Country. I find the poem rather maudlin, but perhaps I am biased because I am sick of hearing climate change-denying politicians recite it as though it is evidence that climate change has not occurred. Because here’s the thing: when she published that poem in 1908, the average annual temperature in Australia was about 2C lower than it is now. And those conservatives who recite the line about “a sunburnt country” ignore that climate change is going to wreak havoc with everything we love – that tenuous balance of droughts and flooding rains, the ability of agriculture to exist on “thirsty paddocks”, our rivers, our wildlife where “orchids deck the treetops”, even the crisp air and “pitiless blue sky”. This summer has shown how precarious our Australian lifestyle is – the bushfires that have not stopped since September; the mix of fires, smoke, dust, hail (and that is just in Canberra in the past fortnight). We are a nation on the extremities, where climate change will affect and strip away what we love much sooner than will occur in Europe and North America. No patriotic Australian can be anything but angry to read stories of a billion or more animals killed in the fires – especially when you realise the koalas on Kangaroo Island are chlamydia-free and are essentially the best protection against their extinction. Our wildlife is so exceptional and precious that the upset in balance that comes from climate change will render some habitats unliveable. To read that the platypus is facing extinction due to human activity exacerbated by climate change should have every patriotic Australian filled with rage. Conservative patriots love to talk up Australia “punching above its weight” on things such as sport or business or war, but they turn to self-hating cowards when it comes to climate change. Yes, Australia “only” accounts for around 1.3% of emissions (of course well above what you would expect given our population), but given the fragility of our ecosystem, any political leaders who profess to love Australia should be energising our diplomatic networks and using every economic and political lever we have to cajole, convince and encourage other nations to act on climate change. We should do this even if it is out of purely selfish reasons of loving our country and wanting it to remain in the same state that has caused that love. If you love Australia, climate change should scare the hell out of you because the reef, our rivers, our wildlife, our fresh air, even, as we have seen since December, our relaxed summer holidays are going to be stripped away from us. Our government has more reason than most others outside of the Pacific Islands to be demanding global action on climate change. Given our wealth we should be leading the way – leading by example rather than leading to ruin as our current government has been at the most recent climate change conferences. What we love about Australia will be taken by climate change well before other nations who emit much more greenhouse gas will feel great changes. And that should enrage us and our representatives, and it should drive their actions. I love Australia and so I want action on climate change. And if you love Australia, so should you. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",2020-12-22T13:34:52.243371Z,1

,2020-12-19T19:44:19.851474Z,817,119,,"A heatwave over India that started on May 21 and has produced India’s highest recorded temperatures in two decades has claimed more than 2,000 lives and caused widespread devastation. It would be easy to dismiss this as a freak event, something so far out of the norm that there’s little chance of preparing for it. But this isn’t quite true. Even the most extreme events can be predicted – and prepared for. I specialise in a statistical approach called extreme value theory which draws inferences about very rare events. Among other uses, it can be used to estimate the probability of a heatwave occurring.  Where most statistical methods are great at modelling average values – what temperature is it likely to be next week? – they tend to be poor at modelling the extremes (what is the highest temperature we’ll see this decade?). Our model instead focuses on extreme values themselves, in this case the hottest days of the year, which are the values that can cause the greatest devastation. This also means we can figure out the rough probability of events larger and longer than any that have gone before. Just because we haven’t seen consecutive 40℃ days in the UK, or snow in the middle of the Sahara, doesn’t mean it can’t happen. Extreme value theory helps assess these probabilities.  We can use it to assess how likely the current heatwave is by analysing daily temperature maximums for Delhi over the years 1972-2013. Extreme value models can be used to estimate the temperature expected to be attained on average once a year (called the one-year return level). In Delhi the one-year return level is 45℃. However, single hot days do not have a great impact on excess mortality. Consecutive runs of hot days are more dangerous since the human body is subjected to heat stress over many days without being given the chance to recover. Fortunately the same type of extreme value models can be used to estimate the probability of runs of consecutive days above a certain temperature.  During the current heatwave Delhi recorded seven consecutive days above 44℃. That’s an entire week above an exceptionally high temperature – such an event is expected to happen on average once every 30 years. However, care must be taken with such results since they are often subject to large uncertainty as they are based upon very few rare events in the observational record. An El Niño may make such heatwaves more likely. The El Niño is one of two opposing phases in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a large-scale fluctuation of sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Right now a large El Niño (warmer waters) is currently building and will peak later this year. This generally means higher temperatures in India. Could the current ENSO be contributing to the current heatwave event? Under current conditions, the probability of observing seven days above 44℃ in Delhi is slightly increased, with the event expected to happen on average once in every 25 years. But it is difficult to definitively say that El Niño is having an effect since this result is again subject to a great deal of uncertainty. One important question for decision makers concerns whether heatwaves are going to become more likely under climate change. Answering this question becomes difficult since there are numerous sources of uncertainty – most obviously, we don’t even know exactly what “climate change” will entail. For example, different scenarios are generated, most famously by the IPCC, that aim to predict how future emissions will evolve. For each particular scenario, different climate research centres run different models that produce different replications of each future scenario.  The most common way to account for uncertainty is to take an ensemble of many different climate models – yet even this can leave a big margin for error, especially when analysing rare events such as heatwaves. In 2003 a month-long heatwave struck Europe, causing at least 20,000 deaths and possibly as many as 70,000. My colleagues and I have previously analysed this particularly hot summer to assess the effect of climate change on heatwaves. We wanted to understand whether such an event would become more likely under future climate change and whether the behaviour of heatwave events would change.  We found that generally temperatures would increase, an increase of 1℃ in global temperatures would lead to an increase of, at most, 2.6℃ in the one-year return level at Orleans in central France. However, despite the fact heatwaves like in 2003 are expected to become more likely, it is not expected that such events will tend to last longer. Statistical approaches have great potential to help decision makers mitigate for devastating events such as the current Indian heatwave. By providing reliable estimates of how often they will occur better preparation measures can be undertaken which will reduce the number of deaths.  Looking to the future, the effect of climate change is the largest uncertainty. Further collaborative research between statisticians and climate scientists presents the best chance to understand the potentially devastating effects that climate change will have on all types of extreme event.",2020-12-19T19:44:19.851506Z,1

Discriminatory, disguising or misleading
The Unwort des Jahres (un-word of the year) is a new or recently popularized term used in Germany which a panel deems “violates human rights or infringes upon Democratic principles”.
According to Wikipedia, “The term may be one that discriminates against societal groups or may be euphemistic, disguising or misleading. The term is usually, but not always, a German term. The term is chosen from suggestions sent in by the public.”
Over the years, like so many other institutions, the volunteer panel has leaned to the left and has been choosing words that tend to cast conservatives and the right political spectra in a negative light. The panel’s announcement of the un-word of the year gets broad media coverage.
Last week the panel selected “climate hysteria” as the un-word of the year.
Taboo because it “defames climate protection efforts”

According to Wikipedia, the panel – which has no scientific expert on it at all, chose “climate (change) hysteria” as the un-word of 2019 because it “defames climate protection efforts and the climate protection movement, and discredits important discussions about climate protection.”
Climate science dissent is no longer welcome, the panel wants to tell us.
According to Wikipedia:
The expression [climate hysteria] was used by many in politics, economics, and the media in 2019 – by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as well as by entrepreneurs and especially by politicians of the Alternative for Germany party. It dismisses the increased commitment to climate protection as some kind of collective psychosis. Moreover, in light of scientific findings regarding climate change, this word is misleading and irresponsibly supports anti-scientific tendencies.”
Yet, thankfully, some media have grown critical of the panel of volunteer linguists and single journalist, and all the media attention it gets. For example, Bild newspaper wrote:
As if it were the decision of an important institution, the decision of a privately organised group is reported: Four linguists and a journalist who volunteer once a year to play linguistic police. According to the motto: Listen up, citizens, the language committee has decided, this word is taboo from now on!
Ironically, in 2011 the panel chose “alternativlos” (no alternative) as the un-word of 2010 in politics because they claimed it was “undemocratic”, as any discussion on a subject “would be deemed unnecessary or undesirable”.
Today the panel appears to have forgotten about that earlier choice.
In any case, skeptics and dissenters should instead ramp up the use of the term “climate hysteria” to describe the FFF and XR movements, and all the nutty doomsday scientists who like telling us there’s no alternative to decarbonization.

,2020-12-22T13:35:49.574753Z,820,120,,"The death of famed “daredevil” climber and base jumper Dean Potter has once again raised the idea that all high-risk sportspeople are hedonistic thrill seekers. Our research into extreme athletes shows this view is simplistic and wrong. It’s about attitudes to risk. In his famous Moon speech in 1962, John F Kennedy said: Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked [by a New York Times journalist] why did he want to climb it. He said, ‘Because it is there.’ Well, space is there, and we’re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there … Humans have evolved through taking risks. In fact, most human actions can be conceptualised as containing an element of risk: as we take our first step, we risk falling down; as we try a new food, we risk being disgusted; as we ride a bicycle, we risk falling over; as we go on a date, we risk being rejected; and as we travel to the moon, we risk not coming back. Human endeavour and risk are intertwined. So it is not surprising that despite the increasingly risk-averse society that we live in, many people crave danger and risk – a life less sanitised.  Dean Potter exemplified that craving. He was a pioneering climber and base jumper, well known for scaling huge vertical rock faces without ropes and with only a parachute for protection. On May 16 Potter and fellow climber Graham Hunt died in Yosemite National Park after attempting a dangerous wingsuit flight, where base jumpers wear a special suit that enables them to “fly” forwards and control their fall. Potter’s endeavours and those of George Mallory seem motivated by something very different from hedonistic thrill. Over the past ten years we have interviewed dozens of high-risk sports people and studied their profiles in detail with a view to trying to find out what that “something different” is. Our findings are surprising. For example, it is now clear that sensation-seeking explains very little about the motive for many of these people. Many high-risk sportspeople do not crave excitement at all – yes they seek out risky environments, but only with a view to minimising any additional risk so that they can remain in control despite the apparent danger of dangling off cliffs or jumping out of planes. But there are two more striking features of our recent risk-taking research. The first is something we call “agentic emotion regulation”. Feeling agency is similar to feeling in control, but more akin to the feeling “I want to be the person who decides how my life pans out”. Some high-risk sportspeople purposefully seek out danger in order to make some sense of their feelings of lack of agency. In other words, in everyday life they do not feel like the chess player of their life but more like the pawn on the chessboard – they feel emotionally constrained and passive.  Legendary climber Patrick Berhault, who later died traversing a steep face of Switzerland’s highest mountain without a safety rope, once said he didn’t think he’d do it if there wasn’t the notion of risk. “Ordinary life lacks intensity and attraction for me”, he said, “I can’t stand it; I believe we should live!” The fascinating feature of this finding is that the lowest sense of agency is in relationships that are the most emotional: with loving partners. This feeling of low agency is made worse by the difficulty with expressing their emotions. In this way, the relationship with risk serves as a proxy for the relationship with a loving partner, except that the risk-taker is rewarded – rather than penalised – for not expressing emotion. The primary emotion to overcome in risk-taking activities is fear. If a person has difficulty experiencing and expressing emotions then the risk-taking arena becomes a rewarding place.  It is rewarding because they have moved from a feeling of inadequacy, “why can’t you tell me how you feel??” to a sense of achievement, “wow, that was amazing how you achieved that scary feat … ” In this way, the relationship with nature is more rewarding than their relationship with other humans. My vision turns black and white except for the searing red line. 
Sounds fade. I feel faint, face flushed with heat. My muscles tense, but I hold calmness in my centre and loosen my arms from the shoulders to my fingertips. The moment sickens me, and my mind tries to stop it, but I command myself to walk. – Dean Potter on facing fear and going ropeless. The second surprising thing we found in our research is that the difficulty with emotions leads people to take greater risks and to have more accidents in the high-risk environment – where accidents have serious consequences. The link between emotional expression and accidents is our most recent finding and one that was so intriguing that we ran three different studies on various high-risk sports to see if we found the same thing. Each time, we found a strong link between the difficulty in expressing emotions and the chances of being in an accident. We now understand this link. People who have difficulty identifying and describing their emotions seek risky extreme sports because they provide the experience of a more easily identifiable emotion: fear, perhaps the purest emotion of them all.  The continued search for fear (and overcoming that fear) leads people to take further risks, which in turn eventually leads to a greater likelihood of an accident. This finding was novel because the established view in emotion research is that people do not typically repeatedly approach situations that induce fear. However, extreme sportsmen and women are attracted to risk because it provides an opportunity to experience the negative emotion of fear and to turn that fear into a fantastically rewarding and positive experience (often in retrospect). Extreme sportspeople learn something about themselves by taking risks and by embracing the full spectrum of their emotions. It is a construction of the self that is played out in nature with all its inherent dangers.  They expect more from life. A craving for life in its purest, simplest, and sharpest form. Life in direct juxtaposition to death; to live fully or to die trying. In that respect, adventurers such as Dean Potter can teach us all how to embrace life and to turn directly to face our fears.",2020-12-22T13:35:49.574787Z,1
,2020-12-19T13:43:24.048151Z,822,119,,"If you’ve ever eaten fish from the sea, especially an older or larger fish, you’ve probably been exposed to the pollutant mercury. It’s invisible, odourless, and dangerous. When ingested by humans, mercury is a neurotoxin, attacking the brain and nervous system, and the development of babies and infants can be particularly hampered.  Whereas most of us are at liberty to adapt our diets, people living in the Arctic strictly rely on marine wildlife for food and, unfortunately, mercury levels in animals such as seals, beluga whales and polar bears are among the highest worldwide. It’s harming birds too – recent research shows that endangered ivory gulls have 50 times more mercury in their feathers than when records began 130 years ago. The stuff we’re really concerned about is methylmercury, the most toxic form of the element that accumulates in those animals. And there’s a mystery here – while emissions from factories and power plants have pumped a lot of mercury into the Arctic, we still know little about exactly how this is converted to methylmercury.  One idea is that methylmercury is produced in the oceans. Inorganic mercury, natural or man-made, sticks to algae in the surface waters. When these algae sink to the deep ocean, microbes are already waiting to eat them. We believe some of these microbes can convert the inorganic mercury to methylmercury.  Methylmercury is then passed along the food chain via a process known as bioaccumulation. Algae pick it up from the water, are eaten by zooplankton (krill) which are eaten by smaller fish, which in turn are eaten by bigger fish – at each step, methylmercury gets many times more concentrated, reaching dangerous levels in top predators such as seals, polar bears or even humans. But where does all this mercury come from? Mercury is unique – it is the only heavy metal that is present as gas in the atmosphere, where it stays on for an average of about a year. As a consequence, it can travel across the globe, including to the remote Arctic. One theory is that the Arctic is a global sink for increased man-made mercury emissions from North America, Europe and now Asia, and possibly causing the high mercury levels in arctic animals. However long-term data on mercury levels in Arctic animals don’t always match up with increasing man-made emissions. Other factors must be at play.  Though scientists have generally focused on atmospheric mercury sources over the past decade, models suggest that atmospheric emissions can’t account for all the mercury. A large source of mercury to the Arctic Ocean is missing.  Rivers could provide such a source, especially during spring flood of Siberian rivers. While this finding is exciting, Siberian rivers and the Arctic Ocean itself remain under-sampled. We actually have to go to Siberia during the spring floods and measure mercury to know what is coming out of the rivers, and how far it travels into the sea.  That’s why we are now investigating the mercury discharge, especially during the spring flood, of one of the largest Siberian rivers, the Yenisei. We must find out where, how and what is turning inorganic mercury – natural or man-made, from the atmosphere or from rivers – into its most toxic and bioaccumulating form, methylmercury. We already know that inorganic mercury in the oceans has increased because of man-made emissions. At the same time a warming climate and melting sea ice is likely to play havoc with Artic algae and methylating microbes. But what will this mean in the future? A previous Polarstern cruise in 2011 gave us some first insights. In research published in the journal Scientific Reports my colleagues and I presented the first full-depth high resolution profiles (> 5 km-depth) of total mercury and methylmercury in the central Arctic Ocean (79-90°N).  Our findings suggested methylmercury production in the Arctic Ocean is highest in the area of thinner and younger sea ice, probably due to a higher accumulation of algae in these areas. Methylmercury concentrations peak shallower than in the other oceans (150 m in the Arctic versus roughly 1000 m in the Atlantic). The shallow methylmercury production, close to the surface where algae thrive, likely results in enhanced biological uptake at the base of the arctic food chain. While these first few results might hint an alternative explanation for the high methylmercury levels of Arctic wildlife, many questions remain open. That’s why this summer I’ll spend two months investigating mercury changes in the Arctic while on board the German icebreaker Polarstern sailing to North Pole. Polarstern will be joined by research ships from the US and Canada – the operation, organised within the international program GEOTRACES, will be the largest exploration of mercury (and other elements) in the Arctic Ocean.  This effort involves many different research teams and will take a whole lot of coordination. At sea we also need to keep each other up to date about what we’re doing. To master these efforts the mercury teams on the three research ships connect online and will be keeping each other and the interested public informed on ResearchGate, a professional network for scientists. The three mercury teams will map mercury and methylmercury distributions throughout the Arctic Ocean, and merge their data. This is critical to understand marine methylmercury production and to predict the impact of ongoing climate changes on the Arctic mercury cycle. After all, global warming is bad enough as it is, without contaminated fish to worry about, too.",2020-12-19T13:43:24.048185Z,1

Perhaps it is their habit of curling up, their classic cute faces with turned up noses, or their bumbling manner. While foxes are cunning, hares are mad and weasels are weaselly the hedgehog is not at all threatening, but instead they are portrayed as either a stout yeoman of olde England or, if female, a maternal Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.  All of this makes hedgehogs the ideal icon for wildlife hospitals such as St Tiggywinkles or road safety adverts. My memories of 1970s hedgehogs are not so much of the stout, aproned Mrs Tiggywinkle but what appeared to be a nightly suburban back garden lawn swingers party. Hedgehogs were routine visitors to our small 1960s housing estate garden, their noisy romantic trysts dismissed as “oh its just the hedgehogs at it again”. The prospect that hedgehogs would now warrant specific conservation action would have seemed far fetched. Judging by the noise they seemed determined to conserve themselves with gusto.  Times have changed. In 2014 hedgehogs joined the list of UK Biodiversity Action Plan species, under their more official name of the Western European Hedgehog, and, more informally, 2015 sees the launch of the first Hedgehog Improvement Area in the Birmingham suburb of Solihull. Hedgehog numbers in the 1950s were put at more than 35 million, but contemporary surveys suggest that there may not be even one million. On the BBC’s Springwatch series, hedgehogs now star not as a familiar creature we can all see but as one of the endangered, heading towards extinction. Most species declines are complicated and the hedgehog’s is no exception. The animals have lost countryside habitat as the fine grain of small fields, woods and old hedgerows was industrialised, and in cities their garden homes have been tided, paved and surrounded by impenetrable fences. Perhaps we can also point to climate change, declining prey populations and predation by badgers. In addition hedgehogs are notoriously vulnerable as they cross the road – hence their resonance for road safety campaigns.  Hedgehogs would do well to heed the advice of their animated road safety avatars and a recent study of a remnant population in Regent’s Park in London suggest that they might be doing just that. The park staff, working with The Royal Zoological Society of London, have been tracking their hedgehogs’ nightly movements using radio and GPS trackers. The results show the hedgehogs avoid crossing the surrounding roads and don’t stray beyond the safety of the park. All living creatures would do well to avoid city roads. It is not hard to see the rapid selective advantage of not crossing. Oddly, road kills can be evidence of improving circumstances as revealed by hedgehogs in the Republic of Ireland. You may have been perturbed by the earlier mention of badgers as a threat to hedgehogs, after all badgers are meant to be brave and noble. They are also indifferent to a hedgehog’s spines and chomp through them.  In Ireland badgers have been subject to a cull to try and limit the transmission of bovine TB. In areas where badger numbers have been culled the numbers of hedgehog road traffic victims has increased compared to control regions with no badger reduction. Similar results are coming through from the UK’s own badger cull. In the UK the 1990s saw marked increases in otter road casualties as they recolonised much of England and beavers may be next as their populations expand. Road kill may not be the ideal methodology but can be a useful and effective bell weather of change. The hedgehog’s fate is not the only recent decline of a once familiar creature. Just look at house sparrows, starlings or wall brown butterflies – all of these creatures were once so commonplace you’d not give them a second glance, and all are now in trouble. From a species point of view it pays to be rare. We are not bad at the last ditch, highly expensive defence or reintroduction of white tailed sea eagles and large blue butterflies. Meantime the hedgehog’s supporters are rallying. This year will see the first “Day of the Hedgehog”, a follow up to a national hedgehog survey. If only they hadn’t made the event sound like a 1970s low-budget horror movie. Or maybe they know something about those back garden noises best left unsaid.",2020-12-19T16:02:13.680506Z,1

Dry summers as a doomsday scenario – are they really something new?
By Axel Robert Göhring
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Drought completely normal during High Medieval Ages.
Researchers from the German Department of Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Greifswald have shown that drought in the High Middle Ages was completely normal during the summer. Even if hardly any real scientist dares to say anything against the climate madness, many do their work properly and deliver many small mosaic pieces for dismantling all the fraud.
Last spring, however, one could hear “top physicist” Harald Lesch at the Markus Lanz’s ZDF show claim how climate change would hit quite badly in summer, how the drought of the “record summer” 2019 would have violent effects, especially on the holy German Forest (forest die-off scare came knocking again…).
So what about drought in the holy German Forest 2019? Is it real, or “interpreted”?
Well, it’s probably real. But why not? In summer it is hot and dry even in the temperate climate zone of Europe. Mr. Lesch & Co. showed a heat peak and claimed it is man-made climate change. And when a cold peak appears, then it is only weather – or even proof of climate change. Weather extremes are somehow more frequent today.
Dry summers in Europe not uncommon, new study

Biologist Martin Wilmking and his team from the University of Greifswald in the German state of Vorpommern now have shown that dry summers a thousand years ago were not uncommon in northern Germany. In fact, they were much warmer than today – and this without combustion engines, industry and motor traffic.
Prof. Wilmking and his biologists evaluated so-called proxy data, i.e. verifiable effects of climate in animate or inanimate nature. Specifically, the team worked on annual rings in living beech trees and thousand-year-old archaeological timber: the long established field of expertise is dendroclimatology (Greek: dendron – the tree).
Trees growing faster today
The authors prove once again that our forests are growing much faster today than in the past, because agriculture (also traffic & industry) provides them with a lot of fixed nitrogen (ammonium salts).
The modestly increased CO2 content of today’s air also allows the trees to open the stomata of the leaves for a shorter period of time, thus limiting water losses. In other words, our industrial civilization is considerably HELPING the forest by supplying it with building materials and  even water indirectly. This is nothing new for avid EIKE readers, as we have pointed out more than once that the planet has become much greener in recent decades.
Often dry in the prosperous High Middle Ages
If one includes the faster growth of today’s trees, one can conclude in comparison using the annual ring curves of the historical woods that it was often dry in summer in the High Middle Ages. Even the Rhine, the largest river in Europe, became dry near Cologne. Yet the High and Late Middle Ages were not a phase of decline like the Early Middle Ages. On the contrary, the courtly knightly culture flourished in Western and Central Europe. There are tens of thousands of stone castles in Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia and Austria – several in the Saale valley near EIKE’s home city of Jena.
And if you take a boat trip on the Rhine or Moselle rivers – ruins of stone castles can be seen everywhere. They all date back to the time after 1000 AD. The stone castles are a testimony to a significant increase in Europe’s economic performance, which can be traced back to the warmth of the Climate Optimum. The development lasted until the late Middle Ages, when it then became much colder again.
Politically correct theories assume that the booming economy overtaxed nature and thus undermined itself. Certainly not wrong, but without the cold, nature could have recovered faster from the overexploitation.
Warmer is better
Also findings from graves, for example near Berlin, prove that Brandenburg citizens from the Renaissance period were significantly sicker than their ancestors of the High and Late Middle Ages. The saying rings true: “Cold is bad, warm is good.”

,2020-12-22T12:36:12.519026Z,825,120,,"The California legislature may want to revisit the wording of their proposed ban on incandescents (AB 722). California assemblyman LLoyd Levine, a Democrat from Van Nuys in Los Angeles, wants to make California the first to ban incandescent light bulbs (by 2012) part of its new initiatives to reduce energy use and greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. But somebody hasn’t thought this through completely.
Why do I suggest a change? Two reasons: 1- There’s a new efficient challenger to the old tungsten filament light bulb. 2- The Compact Flourescent Lamps touted as “Eco Bulbs” have a small amount of mercury an other heavy metals in them, making disposal a problem. Some landfills won’t take them!
GE has announced an advancement in incandescent technology that promises to increase the efficiency of lightbulbs to put them on par with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL).

The new high efficiency incandescent (HEI(TM)) lamp, which incorporates innovative new materials being developed in partnership by GE’s Lighting division, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and GE’s Global Research Center, headquartered in Niskayuna, NY, would replace traditional 40- to 100-Watt household incandescent light bulbs, the most popular lamp type used by consumers today.
The new technology could be expanded to all other incandescent types as well. The target for these bulbs at initial production is to be nearly twice as efficient, at 30 lumens-per-Watt, as current incandescent bulbs. Ultimately the high efficiency lamp (HEI) technology is expected to be about four times as efficient as current incandescent bulbs and comparable to CFL bulbs. Adoption of new technology could lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 40 million tons of CO2 in the U.S. and up to 50 million tons in the Eeropean Union if the entire installed base of traditional incandescent bulbs was replaced with HEI lamps.
So take note California assemblymen and assemblywomen, how about mandating a level of lighting efficiency for bulbs rather than assuming that innovation of older technology can’t happen?

,2020-12-19T16:18:20.784971Z,826,120,,"Pesticides are intended to be harmful. They kill pests, diseases and weeds. But some also harm humans and wildlife. Pesticides are a huge global business, worth around US$45 billion. Each year, 3.5 billion kilogrammes of pesticides are applied to food crops and their use is growing. Much use of this use is at best ineffective and at worst outright harmful.  In recent research we showed that farmers in Asia and Africa have been able to cut the use of pesticides while boosting crop yields, reducing costs and delivering  healthier profits. Even the landscape surrounding the farms benefits. Each kilogramme of pesticide used in agriculture imposes €3-15 (US$4-19) of external economic costs on the environment, wildlife and human health – money spent by water companies to remove them from drinking water, for instance, or the loss of valuable pollinating insects. Any reduction in use, therefore, saves farmers costs, but also benefits the wider economy too. Cutting out pesticides can be a no-brainer. All pests have some natural predators and parasites and for farmers these are often free. Farmers can build their use into farm management and minimise or even replace synthetic pesticides. This is known as integrated pest management (IPM), an approach focused on manipulating the crop ecosystem rather than simply wiping pests out.  Through these farming strategies crop yields can be increased while reducing pesticide application and costs. Farmers get more and the environment wins too. Other research is increasingly showing that sustainable approaches in agriculture can both increase yields and improve the environment – whether the focus is management of soils, water, trees or livestock. In our research, we analysed 85 IPM projects from 24 countries in Asia and Africa that were implemented over the past 20 years. We wanted to assess their productivity and reliance on pesticides.  Across all the projects we found yields were up by an average of 41% over periods of 1-5 years after project implementation, while pesticide use went down by 69%. This goes against the conventional assumption which states that pesticide use and yields are positively correlated – as one goes up, so does the other. Our results show otherwise. Most cases we assessed fell firmly into the top-left section of the below graph where pesticide use falls and yields increase. The most significant innovation has been the deployment of farmer field schools (FFS) to spread IPM. These outdoor schools, which are run on principles of ecological education and learning through experience, don’t just teach farmers about new technology. They also boost ecological knowledge, problem-solving skills and teach farmers how to use their political strength. FFSs have been set up in 90 countries and there are huge numbers of graduates: 650,000 in Bangladesh, 930,000 in Vietnam and 1.5m in Indonesia. Some 20,000 FFS graduates worldwide are now running schools for other farmers, having graduated from farmer to expert trainer. Across the 24 countries and 85 projects we assessed, various different methods were employed to achieve these results. In the irrigated rice fields of Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, predatory beetles are excellent pest-controllers, but are killed when sprayed. Research showed insecticide applications in the first 40 days of rice planting were counter-productive. Two million farmers therefore adopted a “no early spray” rule, which saved money and reduced pesticide use by more than half. The melon fly is one of Bangladesh’s biggest pests. Rather than just spray the watermelon fields, simple pheromone traps were created using a male-scented lure in a recycled plastic jar or bottle with a small amount of insecticide. The results were spectacular: yields have risen 40-130% within 2 years, while insecticide use fell from 15 sprays per season to zero, meaning a healthy boost in profits. Clever behavioural manipulation can also make some cropped areas unattractive to pests. In Kenya, the push-pull system design – vutu sukumu – means farmers mix maize with legumes and plant grass varieties on field borders. The maize pests are pushed away by natural chemicals released by the legumes, while their predators are pulled in by the natural chemicals produced by the grass borders. As it happens, the mix also suppresses the invasive and parasitic Striga, better known as witchweed. Despite the evidence, many still believe IPM to be too complex for farmers to understand – and explicit national policy support has been relatively rare. In the past 20 years, the only countries that have seen significant falls in pesticide use are 
the UK (down 44%), France (down 38%), Japan (down 32%), and Vietnam (down 24%).   Some pesticide manufacturers have even appropriated the FFS model to promote greater use of their products. There are good reasons for such push-back: in some countries local markets for pesticides have collapsed, such as in East Java in Indonesia.   IPM has remarkable potential but the job is never done, so investment in research and development must continue in the long term. Ecological and economic conditions change; climates change too. Pests, diseases and weeds evolve, new pests and diseases emerge (often because of pesticide overuse) and pests and diseases are easily transported or are carried to new locations, often where natural enemies do not exist.  In just the past few years we have seen the emergence of the banana leaf roller in India and Nepal, the invasive cassava mealybug in south-east Asia, cucumber mosaic virus in Bangladesh, tomato yellow leaf curl virus in West Africa and cassava mosaic virus and brown streak virus in Uganda. Each requires rapid and co-ordinated action. But working with nature’s services – rather than against them – offers new routes to success. We have shown that millions of small farmers across Asia and Africa using IPM packages can deliver substantial reductions in pesticide use coupled with increased yields. Reduced reliance on synthetic pesticides delivers a range of on and off-farm benefits, including savings, improved public health and improved natural capital on and around farms. Yet, IPM, like other forms of sustainable intensification of agriculture, is much more than just a set of technologies. It is knowledge-intensive, builds social capital and so contributes to society too.",2020-12-19T16:18:20.785004Z,1

“Highly impractical and dangerous”
This of course brought ridicule from the infallible leftists and greens – and yes, even from German centrists who have long become all drugged up on green and “climate protection”.

AfD parliamentarian Dr. Dirk Spaniel told before the Parliament: “Soberly considered, bicycles are highly impractical and dangerous.”
According to Spaniel, a transportation expert, a child transported on a bicycle is exposed to greater danger than in a car. On the Green Party’s vision of a bicycle utopia in Germany and the world, Spaniel mocked: “They want to draw an ideal fairy tale world here with bicycles, which do not exist in this form.”
Twice as likely to die on a bike
As much as the left and greens like to ridicule Dr. Spaniel’s claim, it is backed up by most studies.

For example, the Washington Post here writes that “bikes are the most dangerous way to get around with the exception of motorcycles” and that in the USA, “you’re more than twice as likely to die while riding a bike than riding in a car, per trip” and riding a bicycle is “about 500 times more fatal than riding in a bus”. Here the WaPo cited according a 2007 study led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist Laurie Beck.
Why so many German politicians are now striving to transport children using such a dangerous mode of transport remains a mystery. It’s one of the side effects of being drugged on green. In their doped minds, addicts dismiss all the risks and amplify the promised benefits.
Bicycle deaths rising in Germany
As bike riding increases in Germany, so do the accidents and fatalities. According to Spiegel, citing the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden: “445 people died in accidents on a bicycle – 63 cyclists more than in the previous year and the highest number since 2009.”
“A total of 88,850 cyclists were involved in accidents on German roads in 2018,” Spiegel wrote earlier in 2019.  “That is around 11 percent more than in the previous year.”
25 times higher risk of injury
According to AfD Parliamentarian Dr. Dirk Spaniel: “Parents who transport their children on bicycles increase the risk of injury to them 25 times more than those who transport them by car.”
Time for parents to be responsible for their kids and to stop pretending they can be responsible for the climate.

Leading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image: Die kalte Sonne
For example, just days ago, leading climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed by NDR German public radio’s Anke Harnack on the topic of climate change. As protests by yellow vests in France and angry farmers in the Netherlands intensify, perhaps the establishment in Germany is having second thoughts about going down the hysterical climate rescue path that has been forcefully advocated in Germany over the recent months.
Prosperity based on “reliable energy supplies”
In the interview Vahrenholt, a leading founder of Germany’s modern environmental movement, tells the NDR that following the demands made by Greta Thunberg would put global prosperity at risk and exacerbate world hunger. He says the amazing improvement human society has seen over the last 100 years is thanks to “reliable energy supplies”.
“Huge, huge difficulties”
“Shutting these down in 12 years would indeed throw us into huge, huge difficulties.”

Vahrenholt says all the recent “panic is leading policymakers into making errors and will lead to disappointment for the youth because it is not doable.” He adds changing over the green energies is needed ultimately, but this cannot be done over a short time period of a decade or two. He says “we need two generations” to get off fossil fuels and that it’s going to require “more innovation and research in order to get CO2 emissions down to acceptable levels by the end of the century.”
Vahrenholt, the former director of renewable energies company Innogy, says he is also puzzled over why Germany refuses to do research on fusion and remains so fixated on unstable sun and wind. Vahrenholt was one for the 500 scientists who recently signed a letter to the UN declaring that the planet was not facing a climate crisis.
97% consensus claim distorted
On the claim 97% agree that man is behind global warming, Vahrenholt says this figure has been completely misrepresented, and that it is in fact “only a handful of scientists” who say that man is 100% responsible. Many scientists say that man is only partly responsible.
Chinese are laughing
The outspoken German professor of chemistry says giving in to the demands of the radical greens would lead to a deindustrialized Germany: “In the end what’s left is a deindustrialized Germany, and the Chinese are laughing their heads off.”
Leaders lack courage
On the large Fridays for Future protests, Vahrenholt says: “It’s not surprising because currently hardly a teacher, hardly a journalist, hardly a scientist has the  courage to say: ‘Dear millions of people, we find it nice that you’re concerned about the climate, but let’s really discuss among each other what really needs to be done, and how much time we have.’ This really annoys me. I may not always be right, but I’m pretty sure that the alarmists are not right.”

It turns out that the 1974/75 bush fires were considerably larger in area than the 2019/20 bush fires we have been witnessing.

The Australian bush fires of 2019/20 have seen an area as big as southern Germany (see above). But in 1974/75, they covered an area as large as France and Spain combined! Source: www.wetteronline.de. 
Snow fan writes:
On the completely exaggerated climate alarm in the German media on the current bush fires in Australia, a pleasantly objective report from WetterOnline: ‘In the summer of 1974/1975, an area in Australia burned to the tune of about the size of Spain and France. For the sake of perspective: Bush fires are generally nothing unusual in the Australian summer. Often large areas are affected. The last time a huge fire raged was in February 2009. The so-called Black-Saturday-bush fires killed over 170 people and destroyed 1800 houses. […] Since the beginning of the great bush fires in October 2019, more than 100,000 square kilometres of land burned throughout Australia, which is roughly the size of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg combined. Thousands of houses were destroyed.'”
Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg have a combined area of around 105,000 square kilometers, so there’s no doubt this season’s bush fires have been devastating.
But WetterOnline reminds Australia has seen much worse:
 In the summer of 1974/1975 the flames burned over an area of about one million square kilometers. This corresponds to an area about three times the size of Germany.”
That means an area that is nine times greater than what has been affected this year! Back in 1975, however, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were BELOW the “safe” 350 ppm.

So not surprisingly a number of cities led by socialist/green governments have attempted to implement electric public transportation buses, declaring they are the future of clean mobility.

FlixBus suspends electric bus after “repeated technical problems”
One example, Tichy’s Einblick cites, is German intercity bus carrier FlixBus, which worked with Greenpeace to promote the electric bus on the route between Mannheim and Frankfurt as a showcase project – all accompanied by ample fanfare and slogans such as “sustainable travel” and “the mobility of the future is green”.
But last April Greenpeace reported the discontinuation of the first nationwide electric long-distance bus line: “The long-distance bus provider announced on Wednesday that there had been repeated technical problems during the pilot project between Mannheim and Frankfurt with the vehicle of a Chinese manufacturer. These problems with the bus of Chinese manufacturer BYD must have been so massive that the project was suspended.”
Tichy’s Einblick reports the “only one thing that was really sustainable about the project was the disappointment of the travelers.”
Wiesbaden: 45 million euros, only on flat routes
Tichy’s Einblick also looked at the city of Wiesbaden where city bus operator ESWE Stadtwerke ordered 56 electric buses in April of this year and the first five were to run in October, with another five to follow in November. But so far none have “made any further progress yet”.

Wiesbaden plans a total of 140 electric buses, all to be supported by 45 million euros in taxpayers’ money from the Federal Environment Ministry. Yet Tichy’s Einblick reports that only the “flat inner city stretches are to be served” and that “they do not dare to venture onto the steeper streets on the outskirts.”
Also: “A battery charge should last 150 kilometers, but less if the temperatures are freezing and the bus is full: 100 kilometers.” That would mean about 3 hours of service before a recharge becomes needed.

Tichy’s Einblick also sarcastically reports that since July, “The electric buses in Trier have proven to be truly quiet and environmentally friendly: They are idol.”
“Already after two weeks the first electric bus had to stay in the workshop. Reason: Problems with the battery. An end of the problems is not in sight,” according toTichy’s Einblick.
Bremen backs off electric bus plans: “many disadvantages”
The failures of the electric buses on German streets has not gone unnoticed. Even the Green/Socialist government of the northern city of Bremen has made “a 180-degree turn”.
Earlier the city had planned to purchase five electric buses, 40 percent of which were to be funded by the federal government. But the Bremen city government opted out of the plan. “The reason: It is still unclear whether the electric drive really is the technology of the future.”
According to Tichy’s Einblick: “Bremen Mayor Maike Schaefer (Green Party) says that e-mobility has many disadvantages: ‘The batteries need cobalt, which comes from mines in the Congo. Exploitative child labor prevails there.'”
“Currently, the electric vehicles also have such a short service life that their carbon footprint does not represent any real progress compared with conventional technologies,” writes Tichy’s Einblick.

According to Tichy’s Einblick: “Bremen Mayor Maike Schaefer (Green Party) says that e-mobility has many disadvantages: ‘The batteries need cobalt, which comes from mines in the Congo. Exploitative child labor prevails there.'”
“Currently, the electric vehicles also have such a short service life that their carbon footprint does not represent any real progress compared with conventional technologies,” writes Tichy’s Einblick.

,2020-12-16T18:40:40.529158Z,834,119,,"Until relatively recently, lots of different massive mammals roamed across our planet. Mastodons, mammoths, giant elk, rhinoceros-sized marsupials, sabre-toothed cats, marsupial lions, dire wolves, American cheetahs … the list goes on and on. Then modern humans spread throughout the world and the vast majority of those large species disappeared. Our planet’s large mammal biodiversity is a shade of what it once was.  Sadly, research we’ve carried out shows that the large mammal extinctions of the past 2.5m years are continuing today – and smaller species are now also threatened. Our new study, published in Science Advances, reviewed the threats, status and ecosystem services provided by the 74 largest terrestrial herbivores (exceeding 100kg in body mass), and the conservation effort required to save them from extinction.  Our results are highly concerning. The vast majority of these large herbivores are declining in distribution and abundance, such that 60% are now threatened with extinction. These include well-known and iconic species such as elephants, hippos, all species of rhino, European bison and Indian water buffalo, but also less well-known species such as takin, kouprey, mountain and lowland anoa, and tamaraw. The situation is likely to get worse and we risk leaving empty landscapes unless urgent and drastic action is undertaken. Hunting, habitat loss and competition for food with livestock are the major threats to the world’s large herbivores. Simply identifying these threats is perhaps the most optimistic result of our study, as these are all issues that can be managed and reduced, provided there is sufficient human will to do so.  While Africa supports the greatest number of large herbivore species, south-east Asia retains the most that are threatened. The region’s woodlands are facing empty forest syndrome – where they seem intact, but there are few large animals left within them.  Overwhelmingly, it is developing countries that host the remaining megafauna – they are largely gone from the developed world. Consequently, these poorer nations bear the costs of protecting large herbivores, as well as the missed opportunity costs of setting aside large areas of land for conservation rather than food production. The developed world offers paltry support. Research efforts also suffer from this same disparity. Data deficiency is the bane of conservation management, yet the most-studied large herbivores are the common game species. We know next to nothing about large and highly threatened wild pigs such as Oliver’s warty pig or the Palawan bearded pig, for instance. Without adequate and targeted funding, it is hard to see this research occurring before it is too late for many of the developing world’s big herbivores. A world without elephants, tapirs, hippos, giraffes or gorillas would be a much poorer place. Large herbivores are inspirational, and huge numbers of tourists travel the world to observe them. Yet these species also perform fundamental roles in the ecosystems they inhabit and their loss would substantially alter the natural world. African elephants knock over trees enabling shrubland to develop, for example. This shrubland benefits browsing species such as impalas and black rhinos. Elephants also make great seed dispersers and there are concerns that this ecosystem service is being lost in parts of Asia and Africa where they are becoming scarce. Other large herbivores have also been shown to have a disproportionate impact on their environment, such that their decline is likely to have repercussions right along the food chain. The return of bears and wolves to Europe illustrates that developed countries can succeed in conserving wildlife. These large carnivores can also play fundamental roles in their ecosystems, often by limiting numbers of common herbivores such as rabbit or deer, yet globally carnivores are also still in decline.  There are plans to reintroduce beavers, lynx and wild boar in the UK, as wolves have been returned to Yellowstone National Park in the US. But what about the mega-herbivores? Why don’t we bring back herds of wild cattle (the ecological equivalent and modern variant of the extinct aurochs) to the UK? Governments are inherently risk averse when it comes to conservation initiatives, but they must start acting before it is too late for these majestic creatures.",2020-12-16T18:40:40.529196Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:41:31.966412Z,836,119,,"My mother died recently and at the funeral home I was asked if I had any ideas what kind of coffin she would like. For some reason I said something environmentally friendly. These words came out of my mouth more out of nervousness than anything previously discussed with my mother. Duly the undertaker showed us a catalogue of wicker coffins and we chose one made of banana leaves. I often think of my carbon footprint – I have not owned a car in more than 15 years, for example – but I had never thought about my “green obligations” in death. My mother may not have requested an environmentally friendly coffin, but she did state she wished to be cremated. Due to the lack of space in the UK around 80% of people request cremation – and if we think about green space being at a premium this makes ecological sense. However the energy required to cremate a single person is equal to the energy they would use in a month if they were alive. In the UK this translates to a yearly energy consumption of a town of 16,000 people.  In Asian countries where cremation is very popular there is considerable interest in using solar power to reduce such energy consumption. Another problem with cremation is air pollution, which obviously depends on the filtering system being employed. Until recent times cremations were one of the major sources of mercury pollution in the UK due to the amalgam fillings in people’s teeth. A group of environmental NGOs recently called on the EU to curb mercury emissions from human cremation. Furthermore, the clothes worn and use of embalming fluids may also increase air pollution. Humans have buried their dead for at least 100,000 years. Therefore, not wishing to throw the baby out with the bathwater, I looked into different burial options. A woodland burial initially appealed to me.  However, I would only really approve of this if it resulted in the maintenance of a high-quality conservation area and wildlife refuge. And I wonder if it became popular enough if it could result in major reforestation of the UK. But bodies would still be rotting in the ground releasing globally warming methane gas. Surely, there must be greener options than a standard burial or cremation?  Coming from a family of fishermen I thought about burial at sea, as the fish could recycle my body quickly.  But there are only three registered places in the UK and only around 50 such burials per year. As a biologist, I find the idea of becoming fish food strangely appealing. This is not a new idea: I remember reading of man who macabrely wished the meat from his body fed to the residents at Battersea Dogs Home. Not surprisingly this strange offer was declined. As a conservationist the idea of recycling my body after death appeals: some Asian cultures have what are called sky burials, where a dead human body is laid out on a mountain top for scavenging animals such as birds of prey to feed on.   From a biological point of view I cannot see anything wrong with this, providing deceased people do not have contagious diseases. Burials in the ground are more to do with people not wishing the body disturbed by animals than hygiene considerations – hence being buried six feet. Unfortunately, as much as I like to imagine my deceased body on the top of Ben Nevis being recycled by golden eagles, I can never see it being allowed in the UK. I suppose what really appeals to me is being fully recycled in a short time-frame. The problem is that cremation does not fully recycle the body and burials can take years for the recycling process to occur. Thus, if my body could be fully recycled quickly into the nutrient cycles, thereby allowing the burial plot to be constantly reused then I may have found a biologically acceptable method to dispose of my body when the time comes. A company in Sweden has tested a concept of eco-burial on dead pigs (pigs are good models for the human body), whereby the animal is frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196℃, which makes the body become brittle and disintegrate. In the case of a human, the disintegrated body would be filtered for metals (such as tooth fillings) and then buried in a shallow grave.  In tests with pigs the remains become rich compost in six to twelve months.  Plus this sort of eco-burial does not release greenhouse gases such as methane (from traditional burials) or carbon (from cremations) into the atmosphere.  The only problem being it is still in development.",2020-12-19T16:41:31.966446Z,1

My friends in journalism say news goes in cycles. If that is so, this must be the year of the creepy crawly restaurant.
Today I see on the TV news the shocking video (a frame of which is shown above) of the Kentucky Fried Chicken combo Taco Bell in New York City’s Greenwich Village that has been taken over by rats and closed down by the health department.
What’s in those buckets anyway? Just kidding, and the trademark bucket in the picture above had a little help using Photoshop. But it makes you wonder just how many restaurants in America are as bad as this?
Oddly, it was exactly one year ago today that we had the China Star meltdown, where police and fire responders to a burglar alarm found a restaurant so incredibly filthy and pest ridden, it defied description.
In his ER article last year,  reporter Ari Cohn and Chico PD officer Melody Davidson’s incident report did an admirable job in conveying the heebie jeebies via the written word to anyone whom ever ate there. Today reading the news reports online and then seeing the videos, it was “like Deja Vu all over again”.
I wrote a letter to the editor last year suggesting we need to have color coded health inspection reports posted in the entrance of every restaurant showing its last inspection status. Green for Pass, Yellow for some minor violations, and Red for get the heck outta there ! I still think its a good idea.
Some progress has been made, as now you can get inspection reports online at  Butte County’s Health Department. Here is the link: http://www.buttecounty.net/Default.aspx?tabid=312
Reading through the list of inspection reports at the Butte Health Dept website, I was surprised to learn that even some well known and considered “classy” Chico restaurants had some major violations in the last year. If you eat out a lot, this website is worth a look. Any enterprise that sells packaged food, serves food or food samples, including school cafeterias, coffee houses, country clubs, fraternal clubs, and even liquor stores get inspected by the County Health Department.
Here’s a surprising fact: Indian Casinos and their restaurants are exempt from inspections, because tribal operations are considered their own sovereign nation. That may be so, but I think any place that could potentially make people sick through sloppy food handling shouldn’t get a free pass on a legal technicality.

A new Grand Solar Minimum is expected to commence during the 2030s.
Surface climate records that have been uncorrupted by coastal (ocean-air)/urbanization biases suggest there has been a long-term oscillation in temperature since 1900, with peaks during the 1920s-1940s and again during recent decades (Lansner and Pepke Pedersen, 2018).

An analysis by Soon et al. (2015) (full paper) indicated Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures from rural locations (unaffected by artificial urban heat) aligned well with trends in solar activity since the 19th century. However, models of greenhouse gas forcing did not correlate well with the long-term hemispheric record.

A new paper (Scafetta et al., 2019) also finds the global temperature record aligns well with trends in TSI when using the observation-based ACRIM satellite data rather than the model-based (and IPCC-preferred) PMOD data for trends in recent decades.

Image Source: Scafetta et al., 2019
“By adjusting the TSI proxy models to agree with the data patterns before and after the ACRIM-gap, we found that these models miss a slowly varying TSI component. The adjusted models suggest that the quiet solar luminosity increased from the 1986 to the 1996 TSI minimum by about 0.45 W/m² reaching a peak near 2000 and decreased by about 0.15 W/m² from the 1996 to the 2008 TSI cycle minimum. This pattern is found to be compatible with the ACRIM TSI composite and confirms the ACRIM TSI increasing trend from 1980 to 2000, followed by a long-term decreasing trend since.”
“This model was extended using the ACRIM composite since 1981 and an average between VIRGO and SORCE TIM since 2013. This particular TSI model appeared to correlate well with the Earth’s global surface temperature records since 1700 [Hoyt et al., 1993, . … The TSI data from 1978 to 1981 appeared too corrupted because of uncorrected degradation of theNimbus7/ERB sensors during the solar maximum of cycle 21. For this reason, it was more appropriate to dismiss the data from this period because modifying TSI data using proxy models, as done by PMOD, would be arbitrary. We proposed that any reliable TSI composite should begin from late 1980 with the ACRIM1 record.”
“The same harmonic solar model suggests that the sun may now be heading toward a new grand solar minimum in the 2030–2040 time frame. Final evidence that TSI may have increased from 1980 to 2000 comes from Earth’s climate studies. Secular climate records correlate well with TSI curves such as the one depicted in Figure 13 and on longer ones covering the entire Holocene [1,23,60,64]. In particular, the warming observed from 1970 to 2000, followed by a temperature standstill since 2000, is a good fit for a natural 60-year cycle prediction superimposed to other contributions [20]. This pattern correlates better with a TSI evolution similar to the ACRIM composite [17–21,62,65] than with the CMIP5 general circulation climate model predictions of continuous anthropogenic warming [22]. The CMIP5 climate models use a high climate sensitivity to CO2 forcing and low secular TSI variability proxy models, such as the one proposed in [3], which was calibrated using the PMOD TSI composite model after 1980.”

Without the Earth’s greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, the planet would be on average a frigid -18°C.
But because of the preindustrial 280 ppmv CO2 and other GHGs in our atmosphere, the average temperature of the Earth thankfully moves up by 33°C to +15°C (see chart below), based on the Stefan Boltzmann Law.

 
Global warming theorists say the Earth’s surface preindustrial temperature was supposed to be 15°C. And today CO2 is supposed to have warmed it another degree, to 16°C. Image: www.klimamanifest.ch.
And because CO2 has since risen to about 410 ppmv today, the global temperature supposedly should now be about another 1°C warmer (assuming positive feedbacks) bringing the average earth’s temperature to 16°C.
And once the preindustrial level of CO2 gets doubled to 560 ppm, later near the end of this century, global warming alarmists insist the Earth’s temperature will be near 18°C, see chart above.
So we are now supposed to be at 16°C today and warming rapidly. But what is the globe’s real average temperature today? 15.8C? 16.0C? 16.5°C?
Answer: astonishingly the official institutes tell us it is only 14.7°C!
For example, data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) shows us the global absolute temperatures for the previous 5 years:

Image: www.klimamanifest.ch, data source: WMO in Geneva.
As the image above shows, the global absolute temperature last year was just 14.68°C.
This is 0.32°C COOLER than the 15°C we are supposed to have with 280 ppmv, and a whopping 1.32°C cooler than the 16°C it is supposed to be with the 410 ppmv CO2 we have in our atmosphere today.
So why are we missing over 1.3°C of heat? Why is there this huge discrepancy between scientists?
German scientists say Earth temperature was 15.5°C – in 1990!
In May, 1990, even the German government stated in its major report on climate (BT-DRS 11/8030, p. 29) that the global average temperature back then was 15.5°C and that the natural temperature was supposed to be 15°C — like NASA says. The German government reiterated that figure in 1992.

In 2003, renowned German climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif also confirmed in his book that 15°C was the “optimum temperature” for the Earth.
And in his 2003 doctorate dissertation, Tim Staeger wrote that the natural Earth’s temperature without man-made impacts is “about 15°C”.
In fact, practically all German textbooks used at schools today say that the “natural temperature” of the Earth due to the greenhouse effects of the atmosphere is a “life-friendly average of 15°C” instead of -18°C.
PIK scientist: “15°C in 1850”
Moreover, Potsdam institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) scientist Anders Levermann testified before the German Parliament last year, and confirmed that the global mean temperature of the Earth back in 1850 was 15°C, which means today it is supposed to be well over 16°C. So why is the WMO telling us it’s only 14.68°C and others like the PIK and NASA saying it’s about 16°C?
This massive discrepancy needs to be explained.
IPCC 2007 report in line with WMO
The IPCC indeed contradicts all the scientists and media who claim the global average temperature was 15°C back in 1850. Here’s the IPCC chart from the 2007 report:

How can 14.68°C be “too hot”?
As the chart above shows, the IPCC stated that the global mean temperature in 1850 was a relatively frigid 13.7°C – i.e. well below the “life-friendly” average of 15°C.
Today we are still below the 15°C, and so how can it be too hot?
Summary
There’s no doubt it’s gotten warmer since 1850, the peak of the Little Ice Age. But it’s clear nobody knows what the globe’s real average temperature is. Figures are being wildly tossed around. If we are to believe the IPCC’s 14.7°C figure, then we are still too cool and there is absolutely no warming crisis.
Scientists need to answer this question behind this huge discrepancy quickly. Would the real global temperature please stand up!

The authors of the analysis say it’s the first to incorporate historical local and global climate data and information about population density, income and poverty to estimate how many hard-hitting disasters to expect. They counted floods and storms that would affect 1,000 people or kill 100 people.  Broadly, the researchers also see governments around the world as critically unprepared. The authors found very high risks for countries such as Australia, Bangladesh and China. Risks are highest for countries that are already seeing far more extreme events than the global average. The study is published in the peer-reviewed Climate, Disaster and Development Journal. Co-author Vinod Thomas, a visiting professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila who has held senior posts at the World Bank, said policymakers for the most part do not yet incorporate climate effects into their preparedness efforts. “On the one side, there needs to be climate adaptation efforts, such as relocating people from highly exposed coastal regions or building better disaster preparedness that would withstand extreme hurricanes,” Thomas said. “Equally, there is a strong case for stepping up climate change mitigation in decarbonizing their economies.” Thomas said the findings of an “unmistakable causal link between carbon emissions and more intense floods and storms come at a crucial time,” as forest fires burn through Australia and floods and powerful storms hit the US and Europe. He said countries like Thailand, which saw massive flooding events that killed hundreds and affected millions in 2011, could not handle twice as many catastrophes each year. He said they need to conduct stress tests to understand what they can withstand. The study examined how disasters have increased as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the atmosphere over 60 years. It then projected that same trend into the future and considered how much a continued increase in floods and storms would affect regions based on how populous they are and whether residents are financially secure and prepared for disasters. The research used an economic approach, rather than relying on climate modeling – which uses computers to calculate likely outcomes based on a range of inputs. The journal publishing the study is based in Manila and not widely known. The authors said they first attempted to publish their work in the well-read journal Science. Don Wuebbles, a professor of atmosphere sciences at the University of Illinois who worked on the 2018 US National Climate Assessment, said the study might be underestimating future disasters by assuming disasters will continue to increase at the current rate. He said he appreciated that the researchers considered population growth and density but that he was “not sure they adequately considered the changes in climate for the future”. Ramón López, the lead author of the study who is a professor at the University of Chile, acknowledged the methods used might not account for the likelihood that severe events will increase at a faster rate than we have seen in the past.",2020-12-19T16:41:40.046694Z,1

Bombers was known for the biggest burrito ever made (at least in Chico). There was the “missile”, the “bomber” and the “atomic bomb” which between the habeneros, beans, and the calories, was a nearly 2 pound explosive combination.
I’m not sure where they got the idea to mix bombs and burritos, but here is an early picture from the experimental days of the restaurant where they were loading planes at the Chico Army Air Base (now the Chico Airport).

Bombers was an original, so original that those corporate franchisers at Chipotle knocked off the idea I think. But unlike Chipotle, which has food served in prison cafeteria style with steel and glass ambience, Bombers food was great, and the ambience had history you could feel.
I suppose it was only a matter of time though, they had a terrible location, and competition was springing up around them. They were also nearly invisible, which goes to show it pays to advertise.
I’ll miss Bombers.

,2020-12-19T19:46:31.195122Z,859,120,,"Seven new species of miniaturised frogs have been found in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Among the smallest vertebrates on the planet, these colourful creatures can fit comfortably on a human thumbnail.  To understand just how tiny these frogs are, consider this: the largest living vertebrate is the blue whale, measuring around 26m, while the smallest was believed to be a fish (Paedocypris progenetica) with an adult size of 7.9-10.3mm.  Then two years ago a new species of miniature frog was described, and it was a record breaker. Paedophryne amauensis,  which lives on the island of New Guinea, only grows to an average size of just 7.7mm and is now considered the world’s smallest vertebrate.  The latest discoveries in Brazil, announced in the journal PeerJ, are slightly larger, at between 9 and 13mm. But they’re still tiny compared to pretty much anything else with a backbone.  The frogs belong to the genus Brachycephalus, sometimes labelled “pumpkin toads” due to the often bright orange skin of some members. They live only in permanently-foggy patches of mountainside in Brazil’s Atlantic rainforest known as “cloud forest”.  The first Bracycephalus species was described as early as 1824 but most of the currently recognised 21 species have only been discovered in the last 15 years. The recent finding of seven new species and the difficulty of exploring the inaccessible habitat in which these animals live, suggests the actual diversity in the genus is considerably higher. Most miniaturised frog species have simplified things as a consequence of their reduced size. They have fewer vertebrae than their larger relatives, and fewer skull elements. They also often have reduced numbers of digits; regular frogs generally have four fingers and five toes, whereas miniature frogs have just three and two respectively.   Miniaturised frogs share a number of ecological traits – they are found in wet tropical regions, primarily in forests, living near the ground in the moist leaf litter. This makes sense for such tiny amphibians. After all, their high surface-to-volume ratio makes them vulnerable to desiccation (drying out) and thus they are very sensitive to water loss.  Many, however, are not dependent on water for reproduction. In fact, some species entirely lack the larval tadpole stage typical of most frogs.  Females in these cases instead produce a small number of large eggs that develop directly into small independent froglets. Although this elimination of a tadpole stage may have paved the way for the exploitation of new niches and miniaturisation, the relationship between miniaturisation and terrestrial breeding is not well understood.  It is believed that miniaturisation has evolved independently at least 11 times in terrestrial frogs and species measuring less that 13mm include representatives from 5 families and 9 genera. The Atlantic cloud forests of Brazil have the sort of diverse and humid microclimates in which frogs thrive. The forests are home to more than 400 different species, around 8% of the world’s frog and toad species. The region’s frogs are noted for the extraordinary diversity in  reproductive modes,  In fact, they exhibit  27 different reproductive modes in total including, of course, the typical reproductive cycle characterised by aquatic eggs (or “frog spawn”) that develop into tadpoles that in turn metamorphose into four-legged frogs.  But in many other species, including several found in the cloud forests, eggs and/or tadpoles are partially or completely removed from water. For example, some frogs lay their eggs in foam nests that float on the surface of ponds or on water accumulated on plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that complete development in water.  The recently found species, and most of their closest relatives, have gone a step further and completely removed their eggs from water and in the process eliminated the tadpole stage completely.  Decimation of the Brazilian Atlantic forest is one of the most alarming and desperate conservation problems in the world. In the year 1500 at the beginning of European colonisation, the area covered by the forest was approximately 1,300,000 km2.  Today the forest has been reduced to 7.6% of its original extent and the remaining forest is still under severe anthropogenic pressure.  Deforestation causes areas to dry out and eliminates those species, like miniature frogs and toads that depend on humid forests in order to breed successfully. Of the frog and toad species occurring in cloud forest, 81% occur nowhere else on earth.  No doubt there are many other frog species in Brazil that have not yet been discovered. Sadly, given the current rate of destruction and species extinction, it is possible they never will be.",2020-12-19T19:46:31.195153Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:42:08.998590Z,860,119,,"Hopes of using Davos to forge a new international consensus to tackle poverty and the climate crisis have been thwarted by the decision of the World Bank president, David Malpass, to boycott the event. To the surprise of the other multilateral institutions, Malpass turned down his invitation to attend despite being in Europe this week for the UK government’s Africa investment summit in London. In the past, World Bank presidents have played a prominent role at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, taking the opportunity to make the case for concerted action to tackle global poverty. The heads of other major international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organisation, attended the Davos event. One source said Malpass’s decision not to attend the World Economic Forum reflected the Bank’s go-it-alone approach under his presidency. “He has effectively declared UDI [unilateral declaration of independence],” the source said. “We saw it at last year’s G7 summit in France. President [Emmanuel] Macron wanted a collective statement from the international organisations but Malpass vetoed it. He wouldn’t have the word multilateralism in the statement.” Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  A spokesman for the World Economic Forum said Malpass, who was Donald Trump’s nominee to head the World Bank, had been invited. The next two most senior officials at the Washington-based institution – Axel van Trotsenburg, the bank’s managing director, and Philippe Le Houérou, the head of the bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation – are also notable absentees from Davos. By a tradition that stretches back to the 1940s, the US chooses the head of the bank while the European nations pick the managing director of the IMF. Since taking over less than a year ago, Malpass’s prioritisation of programmes for individual countries has led to suspicions in other international bodies that the bank is in effect being run from the White House. “There is no attempt to reach out to other institutions to look for system-level policy coherence,” according to one official in Davos. Those more sympathetic to Malpass said he was a shy man who did not know how to do smalltalk and hated events such as Davos. A World Bank spokesman said: “The World Bank Group is focused squarely on efforts to alleviate poverty and boost living standards. We sent senior technical experts on climate and water to the World Economic Forum to participate in discussions on how to improve development outcomes in these priority areas. “World Bank Group president Malpass has just returned from the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020, where he met with over 10 leaders of several African countries to discuss challenges they face. He also engaged with private-sector clients and partners on local currency financing, capital markets, green financing and country-specific reforms that could be made to unlock private investment in developing countries.”",2020-12-19T16:42:08.998625Z,1

December production plummets 6.8%
The economic bloodbath was even worse in the production sector which “fell even more sharply, with output falling by 6.8 percent – the sharpest drop since the end of 2009,” writes the Handelsblatt. “Concerns are growing again that the German economy may be in more difficult waters than expected.”
For Germany, “2019 was not only the worst year for industrial orders since 2008, it was also the first time since 2002 that German order books shrank for two years in a row,” reports Yahoo here.
Massive automotive layoffs
The German auto sector has been hard hit. For example, car maker Opel recently announced 2,100 job cuts in Germany. Late last year Daimler, owner of Mercedes Benz, announced plans “to ax at least 10,000 jobs,” Volkswagen’s Audi said “it would slash up to 9,500 jobs or one in ten staff by 2025 and car suppliers Continental and Osram announced staff and cost cuts.”
The Financial Times reported today that Daimler suffered its “worst results in decade” and that its earnings “plunged 60% in 2019 amid ‘Dieselgate’ woes.” Daimler also “refused to deny reports” that an additional 5,000 jobs could be cut.
The Financial Times adds: “Daimler is being forced to spend heavily on electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in order to avoid fines from Brussels for breaching new emissions regulations.”
Other reasons cited for the poor German economic results are the ongoing global trade disputes. Figures are expected to come under even greater pressure due to the spreading corona virus in China.

,2020-12-19T16:02:37.014606Z,865,119,,"The US and Europe have clashed over the threat posed by global heating as Donald Trump’s finance minister downplayed the risks of a climate crisis during the final session of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Steve Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, said the debate should be about “environmental issues” rather than climate change, that the costs were being over-estimated and that climate was only one of several concerns that needed to be discussed.  He reacted strongly after the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said it was vital to include climate risks into economic forecasts and Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said his country was stepping up its fight to reduce the use of carbon. “We don’t know how to price these risks and so we are over-estimating the costs”, Mnuchin said. “If you want to put taxes on people go ahead and put a carbon tax. That is a tax on hardworking people.” Mnuchin said technology would provide the solution to reducing carbon emissions and that the costs of action would be lower in 10 years time. “Environmental issues have an impact on the economy but it is one of many important issues.” Departure from the Paris climate agreement In June 2017 Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement saying"" “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. He claimed the agreement promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep global heating below 2C, unfairly disadvantaged the US and negatively impacted jobs and factories. Shrinking national monuments and animal protections In December 2017 Trump announced plans to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears was cut from 1.5m acres to 228,784 acres and Grand Staircase-Escalante almost halved from approximately 2m acres to 1,006,341 acres – marking the biggest elimination of public lands protection in America’s history. In late 2018 the administration then announced plans to remove key provisions from the Endangered Species Act – prompting conservationists to warn it could put vulnerable plant and animal species in more danger. Rollback of the Clean Power Plan The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of finalizing plans to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule intended to cut emissions from power plants and encourage them to move towards natural gas and renewable power. Cuts to clean water protections The Trump administration plans to remove protections from thousands of America’s streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which is feared will harm wildlife and enable pollution to enter drinking water. Currently, protected waterways provide drinking water to approximately 117 million people. More methane In September 2018, the Trump administration announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. The Obama administration tried to cut leaks by forcing oil and gas companies to capture methane (a key gas involved in global heating), but Trump's Department of the Interior has branded the rule 'flawed' and 'unnecessarily burdensome on the private sector'. Miranda Bryant Mnuchin cited the Coronavirus health emergency, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the possibility of oil prices hitting $120 (£92) a barrel, and the need to power development in poor countries as other problems that policy makers needed to be concerned about. “There are way too many people in the developing world who don’t have access to electricity. We need to create an environment where they have better lives,” he said. Mnuchin found himself in a minority of one on a panel that included the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Lagarde and Scholz. Georgieva said the investments that would be needed to transform economies could be the “silver bullet” that would lift the world economy from four lows: low productivity, low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. “We need to think of policies that are good for the economy, good for the environment and good for people” she said. Green investment could provide a use for the world’s big pool of unused savings. “Not everything is doom and gloom.” Lagarde said that pricing the cost of making the transition to a low carbon economy coupled with pressure on companies to disclose their exposure to climate crisis risk would persuade companies to move faster. The ECB head said that, according to the marketing industry, there were three things that made people move: sex, fear and greed. “I don’t want to talk about the first but the fear factor is there. Look at the complete disasters that are going on around the world.” Turning to greed, Lagarde said the recent announcement from Larry Fink, the executive director of BlackRock, that the world’s biggest asset manager was moving to sustainable investment was an indication that companies were starting to worry about the impact of the climate emergency on their bottom line. Scholz said Germany’s decision to pay out more than €40bn to coalmining regions and power companies to phase out coal plants was justified by the scale of the threat. “There is climate change and it will hurt us. It will have negative effects on the economy. Britain’s departure from the EU next week had not entirely lifted the threat from Brexit, Lagarde said, noting that the negotiations this year over the new EU-UK trading arrangement had the potential to cause trouble. “Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020. We don’t’ know exactly what the trade relationship will be. And it’s a big partner for the euro area, so that’s certainly a question mark.” Scholz expressed relief that there had not been a “hard Brexit” and predicted that Germany would not take an economic hit from Britain’s departure. “It will be more difficult for the UK because it needs its business model to be reorganised” Scholz said. He added that the City of London would be affected by Brexit. “I think we will find solutions”, Scholz said, while warning the UK that there might not be a “special, competitive advantage of being outside” the EU.",2020-12-19T16:02:37.014639Z,1

The Guardian, for example reported: “The world’s people face ‘untold suffering due to the climate crisis’ unless there are major transformations to global society.”
Like most major media outlets around the world, the Guardian handled the “statement” as if it were the final confirmation needed to finally end any further discussion and hesitation on rapidly moving to a new, transformed “global society”.

Slick sales job. Dr. Thomas Newsome falsely claiming over 11,000 “scientists” support the climate statement. Image cropped from video by University of Sydney.

Days later, after a more careful scrutiny of the list – which the media failed to carry out, it was uncovered that the list of signatories was a declaration of scientific and media sloppiness and deception. One of the signatories was even cartoon character “Mickey Mouse”. But it gets worse than that.
11,224 list analyzed by Japanese blogger
Since then Japanese climate science skeptic and blogger, Kirye, spent dozens of hours thoroughly compiling and evaluating the 11,224 signatories using an Excel spreadsheet. Her findings have added greater clarity and exposed the true extent of the once media ballyhooed statement now turned hoax.

Of the 11,224 signatories, JUST FIVE (5) claimed to be a “climate scientist”.
Only 4 were meteorologists.
A vast number did not even state PhD or professor as their professional title/discipline. Only 2,796 (24.9%) had “professor” in their title. 1,481 (13.2%) of the signatories stated some form of PhD, including PhD “candidate”.
A total of 1,021 had “doctor in their title, i.e. only 9.1%. Many in an unrelated field.
303 of the signatories listed no professional title at all!
34 names had to be discarded altogether because they were invalid.
New climate experts: nephrologists, philiologists, pharmacists!
The vast majority were active in fields totally unrelated to climate science, such as “philiogist”, psychologist, CEO, political scientist, pharmacist, medical doctor, primatologist, physiopathology of the mitochondria, sociologist, industrial systems, nanoscientist, genetics, nephrologist, economist. biotech engineer, foreign language teacher, etc.  In other words, it’s a list hyperinflated by unqualified climate activists. Others were affiliated with environmental activist groups.
“Disservice” to science …”blow to credibility”
Thie list and media handling were in fact so sloppy that it compelled German geologist and hjournalist Axel Bojanowski to write at Cicero here how the statement and list of signatories were “a disservice” to climate science and “a deep blow to the credibility of research (and the media), not only because the list of signatories has apparently been published without verification.”
“Mocks media quality control”
The former Der Spiegel science journalist added: “The fact that numerous representatives of environmental associations are among the signatories and many others without a professional title makes one doubt their scientific character” and that it “mocks” the “media’s quality control function.”

It crunched underfoot, was carried on the furnace-blast of a breeze, dust and dry leaves rattling down the wide avenues and riverbanks of the once mighty Murray River like a premonition of loss. It was written in the furrowed brows of farmers poring over district forecasts like they were scripture – ethereal in their promise of deliverance or damnation. Dry as the bones, pronounced, beneath the hides of animals starving and stunned; landscape bleached as a fossil.  Flying into Sydney in early December as the fires ringing the city had just started to burn in earnest, I had a sense of something momentous and profound unfolding, although it still seemed like a distant crisis, one that was happening elsewhere, to other people. The smoke was so thick every aircraft coming in was instructed to land with full instrumentation, so we spent 40 minutes in a holding pattern over enormous fire fronts, swinging lazy circles over great billowing plumes of ember and soot. Walking across the tarmac from the turboprop, I glanced back over my shoulder at the blood orange sun, ash sprinkling from the amber sky. When speaking at an event that evening, I joked that back home we had no water but the air was clean. Go west, where the skies are blue. I left the stash of P2 masks I’d picked up, only half-seriously, on my way to the airport with a friend who said she was taking an Uber to meetings a block away because her asthma was so bad she couldn’t walk more than a few hundred metres. Even as I was going through the motions, paying lip service to the Anthropocene, it still seemed surreal, somehow. I got on to the plane and flew back over the Great Dividing Range, vast eucalypt tracts fizzing smoke, descending once again into the arid, but breathable, air of home. There was a certain sense of foreboding in the hills in the lead-up to Christmas, as though the kindling landscape was holding its breath. The smoke swirled in from hundreds of kilometres north and settled for the festive season. We ate under grey skies, the house shuttered and our heads aching from the fumes, nights punctuated by the kind of toddler asthma attacks that leave you wired until dawn. What if he stops breathing? Hard-earned pennies were pinched and scraped to install an air purifier in his room, and in the nursery too. We didn’t need to leave our beds to know what kind of day it would be. The ochre and rust of another hazy sunrise spilling through the blinds heralded more of the same. Asphyxia. Inertia. Well before it visited itself upon us, the taste was everywhere. Death. New year brought conflagration. The text messages began rolling in. Are you OK? Sure, why wouldn’t we be? Turn on the news. It’s a gut-churning thing to see the names of places you love, those territories of the self and heart, suddenly headlines in a story of unspeakable horror. A tornado of flame, generated by infernos of such ferocity they create their own weather, rolling a fire truck. An unborn child who will never know their father, only his sacrifice. As small communities, we are constellations of people and place, oriented and anchored by and to one another. Talmalmo, Jingellic, Walwa, Corryong are more than just names in a news broadcast or an emergency warning. They are home to our families, our patients, our colleagues, our friends. For the diverse nations who live and gather along the tributaries of the Murray, the Milawa Billa, there could not be a grief more piercing than watching centuries of colonial mismanagement culminate in this ultimate desecration of country, with totem and traditional routes, sacred and spiritual places pared to ash. We all know someone who has lost something; everything. Photos from friends of a wall of fire racing across paddocks, engulfing life as it was once known. Everything is gone. The scars on our landscape will heal, but will we? Instead of celebrating, we rang in the new decade listening to emergency broadcasts, refreshing the Country Fire Authority and Rural Fire Service feeds, and watching Australian Defence Force water tankers flying low over our house. People gathered, muted and pale, in their yards to watch the midnight fireworks a few blocks away as the southerly swept in, acrid with ash. Hours before the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, called his late-night press conference to announce an unprecedented state of disaster and wholesale evacuations of East Gippsland and the north-east, we’d glanced at each other uneasily as our phones had chirped, simultaneously, with an emergency text. You need to leave were the first four words. Surely we’ll be safe here, we said, images of what had played out in Mallacoota that week vivid in our minds. The closest bush was 2km away, the fire station on the corner. Still. The rule book appeared to have been torched. We’d been asking for years that the landlord clear the gutters; all it would take was an ember on the right sort of wind. Where would we go if it came to it? Should we pack a bag? If we had to leave everything behind, what would be essential to take? We laughed at ourselves as we had these conversations – the river would be safe, if we could drive. The showground, if we had to walk. We found the passports. There were other matters to consider as thousands of people from surrounding villages and communities streamed into town, towing caravans, horse floats, trailers crammed with all things practical and precious. The supermarkets began selling out of water, servos between here and more distant towns ran out of petrol. It seemed prepper paranoid, but we agreed I should go out and fill up the car and do a massive shop. Just in case. Venturing out into the eerie still of the morning at sunrise, it could have been winter, a mephitic fug enveloping the town like mist. By the time I came out of the supermarket, where the water shelves were stripped bare and the aisles were hazy, the smoke had rolled in so thick they had disabled the automatic doors and taped a sign over the glass. Auto doors closed due to smoke. Please use side doors. Above the blood bank the sun rose, sanguineous; soporific. The sports stadium down the street opened to evacuees, along with the showground. I’d never seen so many people in town, their apprehension as palpable as the baking heat. The outpouring of support for displaced and dispossessed families and for firefighters was astonishing. Within hours of the RFS issuing their daily list of required items for affected communities and crews, it would be filled. Traffic was banked up for kilometres along the bush blocks adjoining the RFS HQ, an operation of military precision marshalling locals and their stocked boots to the driveway to unload. Dozens of volunteers sorted goods on to pallets and into shipping containers for distribution to outlying communities where people were without power, water or food. Some had lost the roof over their heads, their world reduced to ash. A ute sat in the RFS driveway, its tray overflowing with fruit and vegetables, a pallet stacked with eskies dropped off the by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, alongside. We handed over half a dozen shopping bags, and a drawing by our three-year-old son for the fireys. A burly volunteer crouched down to shake his hand and pinned it up, pride of place, on the noticeboard. As we prepared to leave, a pensioner pulled up in a clapped-out Commodore, a plastic bag full of odds and ends proffered from the passenger seat. It isn’t much, I’m sorry. I blinked away tears. The day of the firestorm, 4 January, we hit a record-breaking 46C in town. Clumsy with foreboding, I stepped awkwardly off our back deck and broke my ankle, lying dazed and thirsty in the heat. While the worst of the winds swept across the firegrounds I was in hospital, nauseous with morphine and still gripping the “green whistle”, though it had long since been sucked empty. By sunrise, I was sober, but the air outside was so toxic that, propped up in bed with towels stuffed around the doors and windows, I still had to wear a mask. Our 10-month-old was so hoarse and distressed I gave her Ventolin; she isn’t asthmatic. The PM2.5 reading (something I had only a passing acquaintance with before this summer) climbed steadily throughout the day to almost 3,000 – 15 times the level considered hazardous – before the local monitoring station went offline for the best part of a day. It seemed symbolic of the cataclysm that had unfolded in the surrounding towns and valleys, where the skies were a filthy orange and visibility reduced to metres at best. Days stretched into another week of wheezing confinement, while the prime minister bleated on about Australia being the best country in the world to raise kids. I cried when, during one of those impromptu toddler confidences, my son told me that one day he’d be older than me. I cried because I wonder if he will. To live to be my age, he will have to make it to 2055, when climate change will have rendered much of the planet inhospitable to human life, driven mass extinctions of almost every kind of species, and unleashed civil unrest over resources like food and water on a scale at which there is no precedent in human history. Moreso than the anxiety or political fury of this summer, I have been gripped by an insurmountable grief for my children and the life I took for granted which they will never be able to share. In a matter of days, 9 January, there was another evacuation order, more fires. Several straddling state borders joined up to become a “megablaze”, terminology I’d never had need for before this grim new decade. Millions of hectares of pristine national park went up, places as familiar to me as laboured breath. The roof of Australia aflame, the Alps snowy at the height of summer, with ash. As ever-increasing tracts of Mount Buffalo burned we could, on a rare clear evening, see the great fungating shadow of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud looming over the horizon, a sign that what raged below was so intense it was generating its own weather. There are many images that will come to define this summer: smog settling so thick over Sydney Harbour its iconic landmarks were obscured, the starved and scorched koalas of Kangaroo Island, a masked schoolkid steering a tinny offshore as Mallacoota was devoured by an avaricious inferno, Scott Morrison hanging a shaka on the Waikiki waterfront. But if you’ve lived in a fire zone, the pyroCb or cumulonimbus flammagenitus will stay with you forever, as a harbinger of the Anthropocene. Ignis aurum probat. Ten days into the decade, the alerts sounded uncomfortably close to home. A grass fire on the Beechworth-Wodonga road – a route we would have travelled more times than you could count – was suddenly racing out of control towards the semi-rural outskirts of Wodonga, our sister city, home to some 40,000 people, just across the Murray River. As quickly as it had started, fuelled by a wild southerly change with lightning and 100km/h winds, the blaze was declared emergency level. You are in danger. Act now to protect yourself. It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. Those in the area who could evacuate made their way into town to shelter at The Cube performance space; others hosed down their roofs and gutters, watching anxiously as water bombing aircraft flew sorties overhead, trying to contain the advancing flames. Defence crews were mobilised as the blaze spotted towards a string of barracks and bases where hundreds of unfortunate people displaced earlier in the week had taken refuge. In the next valley, residents of a relatively new development known as White Box Rise were urged to get out. In among the frantic messages from loved ones as we again hit the headlines was a text from friends who had just bought in White Box and had been scheduled to return from Melbourne that week from their Christmas holiday with their newborn baby. We’d convinced them to delay due to the smoke. This is the other side of our hill, they captioned a screenshot of the emergency alert. Sweet Jesus. Our house. As night fell, the winds eased, and a smattering of rain brought some much-needed reprieve. Evacuees were, in waves, permitted to return home. There was a nagging, contradictory sense that the gun was never really loaded, but we’d dodged a bullet nonetheless. Reams have already been written about this grim summer; an unwelcome but imperative clarion call to the millions of us sleepwalking toward the abyss. Just two months ago I sat in a climate-themed medical conference where they discussed the need for field hospitals, colocation of emergency triage and primary care, new ways of doing business when the climate rendered business-as-usual obsolete. The fires were burning, even then, and Prof David Bowman warned us that this was a season like no other. Yet it all seemed so abstract; so rhetorical. The climate emergency was something that was happening elsewhere, to other people. Until it wasn’t. Andrews has described this as a summer of firsts; there’s been so many now they seem to have lost impact as time goes on. But there are snapshots of this season I won’t forget. Toddlers receiving commendations for bravery on behalf of fathers who will miss a lifetime of milestones. Stepping on to the tarmac under that ominous, orange sky, the scarcest smattering of ash on the breeze. Evacuation sirens; smoke so dense it cancels out the sun. The fear in my son’s eyes as he struggled to catch a breath. Thousands upon thousands of livestock charred and scattered by the road; millions upon millions of native animals – likely entire species – incinerated. We need new words for collective grief of this scale. There are political observations to be made, and urgent agendas to be advanced if – and indeed, it feels so precariously like an if – we wish to survive. Already, the goalposts have shifted to “the new normal”; summers spent indoors lest the air chokes us all, Christmas under slate and noxious skies, evacuation orders covering ever-larger concentric circles until, at last, there is nothing left to burn and nowhere left to run. If we are to take anything from this season of solastalgia, it must be the immense grace and goodwill, courage and conviction that abides in our communities and comes to the fore when it’s needed most. As our climate becomes more hostile, perhaps the single greatest risk is that, in tandem, so do we. The learned helplessness of neoliberalism not only invites us to believe that we, as individuals, are powerless, it depends on it. But we’ve seen something else entirely forged in these long months: leadership from the grassroots, the ability of communities to rally around one another not thanks to political action but in spite of it. Ignis aurum probat, miseria fortes viros. As gold is tempered by fire, so strong men are tempered by suffering. Collectively, our strength is infinite. Now, more than ever, we must live as testament to that. • Amy Coopes is a Croakey editor, journalist and medical student • This piece was originally published in Croakey and is republished with permission.

,2020-12-22T13:37:01.593826Z,868,123,,"For months leading into this bleakest of summers, all anyone out this way could talk about was the dry. It crunched underfoot, was carried on the furnace-blast of a breeze, dust and dry leaves rattling down the wide avenues and riverbanks of the once mighty Murray River like a premonition of loss. It was written in the furrowed brows of farmers poring over district forecasts like they were scripture – ethereal in their promise of deliverance or damnation. Dry as the bones, pronounced, beneath the hides of animals starving and stunned; landscape bleached as a fossil.  Flying into Sydney in early December as the fires ringing the city had just started to burn in earnest, I had a sense of something momentous and profound unfolding, although it still seemed like a distant crisis, one that was happening elsewhere, to other people. The smoke was so thick every aircraft coming in was instructed to land with full instrumentation, so we spent 40 minutes in a holding pattern over enormous fire fronts, swinging lazy circles over great billowing plumes of ember and soot. Walking across the tarmac from the turboprop, I glanced back over my shoulder at the blood orange sun, ash sprinkling from the amber sky. When speaking at an event that evening, I joked that back home we had no water but the air was clean. Go west, where the skies are blue. I left the stash of P2 masks I’d picked up, only half-seriously, on my way to the airport with a friend who said she was taking an Uber to meetings a block away because her asthma was so bad she couldn’t walk more than a few hundred metres. Even as I was going through the motions, paying lip service to the Anthropocene, it still seemed surreal, somehow. I got on to the plane and flew back over the Great Dividing Range, vast eucalypt tracts fizzing smoke, descending once again into the arid, but breathable, air of home. There was a certain sense of foreboding in the hills in the lead-up to Christmas, as though the kindling landscape was holding its breath. The smoke swirled in from hundreds of kilometres north and settled for the festive season. We ate under grey skies, the house shuttered and our heads aching from the fumes, nights punctuated by the kind of toddler asthma attacks that leave you wired until dawn. What if he stops breathing? Hard-earned pennies were pinched and scraped to install an air purifier in his room, and in the nursery too. We didn’t need to leave our beds to know what kind of day it would be. The ochre and rust of another hazy sunrise spilling through the blinds heralded more of the same. Asphyxia. Inertia. Well before it visited itself upon us, the taste was everywhere. Death.

department
and from
WISN-TV
in Milwaukee…TV News Truck Breaks Through Ice:

Even though the temperatures have fallen, the ice on many bodies of water is
not thick enough to support vehicles.
A crew for a local television station drove its news truck onto a channel to
Big Muskeo Lake Sunday and broke through the ice. Crews for WDJT-TV in Milwaukee
were reportedly shooting a story about thin ice when the truck fell through.
The driver reportedly mistook the channel for a road when the accident happened.
The truck was approximately 150 yards off the boat launch, according to a
release issued by the City of Muskego Police Department.
The driver of the truck was the sole occupant and was able to get out without
injury, but the truck remains partially submerged.

Moderators note: Having worked in TV news myself, I’m
not that surprised. Often the only thing on reporters and producers minds is the
story deadline. Caution and common sense sometimes take a backseat in the news van.

Cybertarian campaigners want to stop collusion between corporations and governments to intercept citizen chat; attention-grabbing adolescents at Anonymous want to disrupt murderers who dislike mockery of their principal prophet and the gilt-edged grown-ups in national security services want to listen in on plans to revenge such blasphemy. But away from these dramatic debates over speech, privacy, the state, a less exciting conversation is underway, beyond the third-sector moralism of cybertarians, the attention span of adolescents, and the Olympian speechifying of spymasters. This conversation touches on security and communications in a less spectacular way. Electronic waste (or e-waste) is the largest source of materials left in municipal dumps around the world.  A high proportion of it is derived from the gadgets you are reading this article on: phones, tablets, and computers, which quickly move from being vital sources of everyday life to discarded garbage once an upgrade becomes available. Where did that old fat-screen analogue television go when it was replaced by the slim, flat-screen digital version? Where are those phones you threw out? A vast proportion of these deadly gizmos, with their lethal cocktails of carcinogenic gases and chemicals, end up being unsafely recycled by the poorest of the poor, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Pre-teen girls in Chinese and Indian villages are expert at the dangerous work of extracting recyclable minerals from our detritus. Increasingly, of course, the trade in e-waste is domestic. Asian middle classes are booming and as keen as their so-called “Western” counterparts to fetishise the fresh and new by dumping the toxic and the old in the villages and bodies of the desperate. The result is horrendous disease, a poisoned water table, and drifting air pollution. Because this trade occurs in what is politely known as “the informal sector” – translation, where there are no taxes, benefits, health and safety protections, or retirement payments – it is difficult to trace the precise dimensions of e-waste. But the International Telecommunication Union, a technology booster if ever there was one, acknowledges the existence of a problem as annual amounts reach a reported 53 million metric tonnes (2013), with an additional 67 million metric tonnes sold in various forms. And after recycling? E-waste ends up in some very interesting places. Two years ago, the Pentagon and the US Senate Armed Services Committee reported that vital components of the nation’s military hardware routinely include “counterfeit” electronic materials, from China (70%), the UK (11%), and Canada (9%). The Pentagon defines counterfeiting as recycled materials wrongly sold as new, or misuse of others’ intellectual property. Often these counterfeits come from recycled e-waste – the committee estimated more than a million counterfeit parts were in service in US planes. It’s no surprise much of this can be traced back to China, where counterfeiting operates at an industrial level, with factory floors populated by thousands of workers dedicated to the task. Take the Boeing P8 Poseidon, a plane used by the US Navy to drop torpedoes, depth charges and carry surveillance equipment. In 2011, Boeing reported it had discovered a faulty ice detection system in the aircraft, according to the senate committee report. Further investigation revealed the part was previously used, and made to appear new.  After tracing the parts through companies in California and then Florida, it turned out the ice detection equipment had originally come from “an affiliate of A Access Electronics in Shenzhen, China.” And before that? Who knows? Investigators from the senate committee wanted to find out but were denied Chinese visas. Now the story is in the news again. Forbes has just published a column on the topic as did National Defense magazine, an obvious mouthpiece for the military industrial complex. The principal beneficiaries of the complex are warning that this malfeasance continues unabated, and at a massive level, despite 2012 legislation designed to quell it. The senate committee report refers to “risks to national security and the safety of US military personnel” posed by this trade in counterfeit e-waste. There is no mention of the risks posed to people all over the world by the United States’ very use of matériel, of course. But the fact that e-waste is on the agenda in such powerful quarters bodes well for real reform towards managing it properly. The technology is available to recycle our electronic pleasures in a much safer way than is generally the case. In many instances, laws exist to mandate that. What we need is proper use of the technology and serious enforcement of such legislation. But beyond that, we need an end to the built-in obsolescence and advertising-fuelled clamour surrounding innovation.

Brazil’s largest metropolis is into its third month of water rationing, and some citizens have even taken to drilling through their basements to reach groundwater. Most commentators agree that the crisis is to blame on multiple factors, but few have questioned the role of the water company in charge: Sabesp. The utility, responsible for water and waste in São Paulo and the surrounding state of the same name, has clearly failed its public service remit. Yet, it’s not even clear whether public service is the highest priority for part-privatised Sabesp, whose directors have just awarded themselves bumper bonuses despite millions of their customers going thirsty. São Paulo’s water will go from crisis to crisis so long as Sabesp prioritises profits over long-term investment. Clearly there are human-induced environmental factors at play: climate change, deforestation of the Amazon, pollution, as well as overconsumption. The pressures we put on nature are likely to increase water shortages worldwide, perhaps leading to conflicts and wars. However, at the same time, there have always been droughts. Historical records going back hundreds of years show how cities and regions have struggled and often coped with extreme water shortages. So, periods without much rain are nothing new. But if that is the case, shouldn’t it be the responsibility of water utilities to plan for such events, putting in place contingency measures to manage possible water shortages? São Paulo’s extraordinary growth in recent decades has overloaded the Cantareira, the city’s water supply system. But the rapid increase in water usage was hardly a surprise; it’s something that could have been managed and planned for. Sabesp has failed to do exactly that. One of the world’s largest water utilities, Sabesp was founded as a public institution in 1973. Since part-privatisation in 1994 the state of São Paulo has maintained at least half of the company’s voting capital, though shares are also traded on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. While The Economist and others were keen to point out that Sabesp is “majority-owned by the state government”, this doesn’t tell the whole story. The utility is neither a public organisation concerned with providing a public service, nor a private company facing competition from other companies and controlled by regulatory agencies. Just like the “natural monopolies” enjoyed by water companies in the UK, Sabesp has a publicly guaranteed monopoly, yet its profits are part-privatised – earlier this year it paid out R$252m (US$83m) in dividends. São Paulo’s water is just one of many public utilities that have been privatised throughout the world over the past few decades. Governments have followed the ideological belief that, in order to conserve and manage water properly, it is essential to put a price on what used to be a public good. In 1992, the UN adopted the Dublin Principles, declaring that putting a price on water and establishing a “participatory approach” – which is about involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels – was the best way to reach a sustainable and equitable governance of water. The principles were quickly adopted by Brazil’s government, and implemented first in, you guessed it, São Paulo. The Dublin Principles call for the establishment of “basin committees”, formed of government, water companies, local residents and civil society. These committees are supposed to be responsible for deciding on water use in a particular watershed. Yet, 23 years after this mechanism was supposedly implemented by Law 7663 in São Paulo – and after 17 years of a similar rule at the national level – we still do not know who participated in these committees. On paper these committees exist, but in practice they are not empowered by state structures. Dysfunctional governance in São Paulo state has left the part-privatised utility, Sabesp, to mainly follow the principles of the market and the interests of its private shareholders. This inevitably skews its strategy towards the short-term. When deciding whether to make the necessary investments to prepare for possible water shortages, Sabesp has had to choose whether to safeguard the public supply or increase the value of its shares. The company did invest US$4 billion from 2005-2013, but that is still not enough. Many of the necessary measures to prevent the current crisis – such as upgrading the Cantareira system – were not implemented because they would be unprofitable to Sabesp’s shareholders . The company’s lack of transparency since the crisis kicked off highlights its planning failure. For many months Sabesp denied that water was being rationed. Then state governor, Geraldo Alckmin, acknowledged that there was lack of water, but said they were “isolated and private” cases. Then a bonus offered to those who economised water in their daily use, later turned into a fine for those who “waste” water. The most essential resource of all has now become a struggle in São Paulo. Yet, ever deepening inequality has turned a water crisis into a social and economic crisis – communities on the periphery of the city and slums were inevitably the first to have their water rationed. Responsibility for this crisis lies with Sabesp and two decades of running water supply as a for-profit service. It is a failure of public-private partnership. As climate change and other environmental factors make water crises more likely, we better rethink the way water is managed worldwide.",2020-12-19T16:42:27.145941Z,1

News from Antarctica: how’s the ice?
By Kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The ice in Antarctica, how is it doing? Is it melting, is it growing? In the following we wishto present the latest literature on the subject. There is a lot to report.
Fasten your seat belt, there’s a lot to cover.
Let’s start with the temperature development because along with snowfall, this is the most important control factor for Antarctic inland ice.
At NoTricksZone, Kirye shows ten coastal stations of Antarctica. None have been warming over the past 10 years. An example followws

And here’s the temperature development of the entire Antarctic according to UAH and RSS satellite measurements (from Climate4You, via NoTricksZone):



According to Clem et al. 2018, East Antarctica has cooled over the last 60 years, while West Antarctica has warmed. The authors establish a connection with the SAM ocean cycle, the Southern Annular Mode. Euan Mearns also deals with the temperature development of Antarctica during the last decades.
Increased ice
Based on height and gravity field measurements by satellite and GPS measurements on the ground, Martin-Español et al. 2017 determined an increase in ice mass in the East Antarctic and a reduction in ice mass in the (much smaller) West Antarctic for the interval 2003-2013. NASA researcher Jay Zwally also interprets an increase in the East Antarctic ice mass. However, a paper announced in mid-2018 still seems to be stuck in review…
Will the ice of East Antarctica be dragged along by the melting West Antarctic at some point in the melting vortex? No, this will not happen, Indiana University said in a press release of 2017:
New study validates East Antarctic ice sheet should remain stable even if western ice sheet melts
A new study from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis validates that the central core of the East Antarctic ice sheet should remain stable even if the West Antarctic ice sheet melts. The study’s findings are significant, given that some predict the West Antarctic ice sheet could melt quickly due to global warming.
If the East Antarctic ice sheet, which is 10 times larger than the western ice sheet, melted completely, it would cause sea levels worldwide to rise almost 200 feet, according to Kathy Licht, an associate professor in the Department of Earth Sciences in the School of Science at IUPUI. Licht led a research team into the Transarctic Mountains in search of physical evidence that would verify whether a long-standing idea was still true: The East Antarctic ice sheet is stable.
The East Antarctic ice sheet has long been considered relatively stable because most of the ice sheet was thought to rest on bedrock above sea level, making it less susceptible to changes in climate. However, recent studies show widespread water beneath it and higher melt potential from impinging ocean water. The West Antarctic ice sheet is a marine-based ice sheet that is mostly grounded below sea level, which makes it much more susceptible to changes in sea level and variations in ocean temperature. „Some people have recently found that the East Antarctic ice sheet isn’t as stable as once thought, particularly near some parts of the coast,“ Licht said.
Recent studies have determined that the perimeter of the East Antarctic ice sheet is potentially more sensitive and that the ice may have retreated and advanced much more dynamically than was thought, Licht said. „We believed this was a good time to look to the interior of the ice sheet. We didn’t really know what had happened there,“ Licht said. The research team found the evidence confirming the stability of the East Antarctic ice sheet at an altitude of 6,200 feet, about 400 miles from the South Pole at the edge of what’s called the polar plateau, a flat, high surface of the ice sheet covering much of East Antarctica.
To understand how an ice sheet changes through time, a continuous historical record of those changes is needed, according to Licht. The team found layers of sediment and rocks that built up over time, recording the flow of the ice sheet and reflecting climate change. Finding that record was a challenge because glaciers moving on land tend to wipe out and cover up previous movements of the glacier, Licht said.
The big question the team wanted to answer was how sensitive the East Antarctic sheet might be to climate change. „There are models that predict that the interior of the East Antarctic ice sheet wouldn’t change very much, even if the West Antarctic ice sheet was taken away,“ Licht said. According to these models, even if the ice sheet’s perimeter retreats, its core remains stable. „It turns out that our data supports those models,“ she said. „It’s nice to have that validation.“
The team’s research findings are presented in a paper, “Middle to Late Pleistocene stability of the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet at the head of Law Glacier,” that was published today online in the journal Geology.  The research presented is in collaboration with Mike Kaplan, Gisela Winckler, Joerg Schaefer and Roseanne Schwartz at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York.”
A Nature Editorial also dealt with the current growth of the East Antarctic ice in January 2018. Of course, the ice in this region has also been worse at times, so it continues to heat up. However, one would have to go back to the warm Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years before today):
A history of instability
The East Antarctic ice sheet may be gaining mass in the current, warming climate. The palaeoclimate record shows, however, that it has retreated during previous episodes of prolonged warmth.
The phrase “at a glacial pace” once invoked a sense of slow and unchangeable movement, an almost imperceptible motion. But decades of remote sensing and seafloor observations have shown that glaciers and ice sheets can respond to disturbances much more dynamically than once thought. But as satellites captured the surges and retreat of Greenland’s maritime glaciers in the past decades the Antarctic ice sheets — east and west of the Trans-Antarctic mountains — were at least assumed to be stable. But this, too, turned out to be wrong. First came sediment1 and model2 evidence that the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed during previous interglacial periods and under Pliocene warmth. Then came erosional data showing that several regions of the East Antarctic ice sheet also retreated and advanced throughout the Pliocene3. An extended record4 of ice-sheet extent from elsewhere on the East Antarctic coast now paints a more complicated picture of the sensitivity of this ice sheet to warming.”
Curiously enough, half a year later, the tide turned when a paper by Shakun et al. 2018, also in Nature, saw no major problems for the Antarctic ice in the Pliocene:
Minimal East Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat onto land during the past eight million years
The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is the largest potential contributor to sea-level rise. However, efforts to predict the future evolution of the EAIS are hindered by uncertainty in how it responded to past warm periods, for example, during the Pliocene epoch (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago), when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were last higher than 400 parts per million. Geological evidence indicates that some marine-based portions of the EAIS and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated during parts of the Pliocene1,2, but it remains unclear whether ice grounded above sea level also experienced retreat. This uncertainty persists because global sea-level estimates for the Pliocene have large uncertainties and cannot be used to rule out substantial terrestrial ice loss3, and also because direct geological evidence bearing on past ice retreat on land is lacking. Here we show that land-based sectors of the EAIS that drain into the Ross Sea have been stable throughout the past eight million years. We base this conclusion on the extremely low concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al isotopes found in quartz sand extracted from a land-proximal marine sediment core. This sediment had been eroded from the continent, and its low levels of cosmogenic nuclides indicate that it experienced only minimal exposure to cosmic radiation, suggesting that the sediment source regions were covered in ice. These findings indicate that atmospheric warming during the past eight million years was insufficient to cause widespread or long-lasting meltback of the EAIS margin onto land. We suggest that variations in Antarctic ice volume in response to the range of global temperatures experienced over this period—up to 2–3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures4, corresponding to future scenarios involving carbon dioxide concentrations of between 400 and 500 parts per million—were instead driven mostly by the retreat of marine ice margins, in agreement with the latest models5,6.”

Antarctica stable
Eight million years ago, the earth’s atmosphere had a similar CO2 content as today. Investigations now show that the Antarctic ice sheet had hardly retreated at that time. The ice is apparently more stable than expected. Click here for the press release from the National Science Foundation. You can also read an article in Popular Mechanics.
University of Edinburgh press release from 2017::
Central parts of Antarctica’s ice sheet have been stable for millions of years, from a time when conditions were considerably warmer than now, research suggests.
The study of mountains in West Antarctica will help scientists improve their predictions of how the region might respond to continuing climate change. Its findings could also show how ice loss might contribute to sea level rise.
Although the discovery demonstrates the long-term stability of some parts of Antarctica’s ice sheet, scientists remain concerned that ice at its coastline is vulnerable to rising temperatures. Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Northumbria studied rocks on slopes of the Ellsworth Mountains, whose peaks protrude through the ice sheet. By mapping and analysing surface rocks — including measuring their exposure to cosmic rays — researchers calculated that the mountains have been shaped by an ice sheet over a million-year period, beginning in a climate some 20C warmer than at present.
The last time such climates existed in the mountains of Antarctica was 14 million years ago when vegetation grew in the mountains and beetles thrived. Antarctica’s climate at the time would be similar to that of modern day Patagonia or Greenland. This time marked the start of a period of cooling and the growth of a large ice sheet that extended offshore around the Antarctic continent. Glaciers have subsequently cut deep into the landscape, leaving a high-tide mark — known as a trimline — in the exposed peaks of the Ellsworth range.
The extended ice sheet cooled the oceans and atmosphere, helping form the world of today, researchers say. Their study is among the first to find evidence for this period in West Antarctica. The research, published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, was done in collaboration with the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre. It was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and supported by British Antarctic Survey.
Professor David Sugden, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, said: „These findings help us understand how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has evolved, and to fine-tune our models and predict its future. The preservation of old rock surfaces is testimony to the stability of at least the central parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet — but we are still very concerned over other parts of Antarctica amid climate change.“
As the ice in West Antarctica melts, it rises isostatically, which in turn stabilizes the overlying ice, found a research team from Denmark and Colorado.
Again and again there are the climate stories about the Totten Glacier in the East-Arctic Wilkesland. Gwyther et al. 2018 was able to show that the basal melting of the glacier is subject to strong natural fluctuations (press release of the NSIDC here). There is no long-term melting trend.
Melting from volcanoes
Glaciers in the western Ross Sea are also stable (Fountain et al. 2017, press release here). The rapidly melting Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica has a hot secret that has now been revealed: Beneath the glacier lies a previously unknown volcanic heat source. University of Rhode Island press release from June 2018 (via EurekAlert!):
Researchers discover volcanic heat source under glacier

Plays critical role in movement, melting
A researcher from the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and five other scientists have discovered an active volcanic heat source beneath the Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica. The discovery and other findings, which are critical to understanding the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, of which the Pine Island Glacier is a part, are published in the paper, „Evidence of an active volcanic heat source beneath the Pine Island Glacier,“ in the latest edition of Nature Communications.
Assistant Professor Brice Loose of Newport, a chemical oceanographer at GSO and the lead author, said the paper is based on research conducted during a major expedition in 2014 to Antarctica led by scientists from the United Kingdom. They worked aboard an icebreaker, the RRS James Clark Ross, from January to March, Antarctica’s summer. „We were looking to better understand the role of the ocean in melting the ice shelf,“ Loose said. „I was sampling the water for five different noble gases, including helium and xenon. I use these noble gases to trace ice melt as well as heat transport. Helium-3, the gas that indicates volcanism, is one of the suite of gases that we obtain from this tracing method. „We weren’t looking for volcanism, we were using these gases to trace other actions,“ he said. „When we first started seeing high concentrations of helium-3, we thought we had a cluster of bad or suspicious data.“
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies atop a major volcanic rift system, but there had been no evidence of current magmatic activity, the URI scientist said. The last such activity was 2,200 years ago, Loose said. And while volcanic heat can be traced to dormant volcanoes, what the scientists found at Pine Island was new. In the paper, Loose said that the volcanic rift system makes it difficult to measure heat flow to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. „You can’t directly measure normal indicators of volcanism — heat and smoke — because the volcanic rift is below many kilometers of ice,“ Loose said
But as the team conducted its research, it found high quantities of an isotope of helium, which comes almost exclusively from mantle, Loose said. „When you find helium-3, it’s like a fingerprint for volcanism. We found that it is relatively abundant in the seawater at the Pine Island shelf. „The volcanic heat sources were found beneath the fastest moving and the fastest melting glacier in Antarctica, the Pine Island Glacier,“ Loose said. „It is losing mass the fastest.“ He said the amount of ice sliding into the ocean is measured in gigatons. A gigaton equals 1 billion metric tons.
However, Loose cautions, this does not imply that volcanism is the major source of mass loss from Pine Island. On the contrary, „there are several decades of research documenting the heat from ocean currents is destabilizing Pine Island Glacier, which in turn appears to be related to a change in the climatological winds around Antarctica,“ Loose said. Instead, this evidence of volcanism is a new factor to consider when monitoring the stability of the ice sheet.
The scientists report in the paper that „helium isotope and noble gas measurements provide geochemical evidence of sub-glacial meltwater production that is subsequently transported to the cavity of the Pine Island Ice Shelf.“ They say that heat energy released by the volcanoes and hydrothermal vents suggests that the heat source beneath Pine Island is about 25 times greater than the bulk of heat flux from an individual dormant volcano.
Professor Karen Heywood, from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the United Kingdom, and chief scientist for the expedition, said: ‘The discovery of volcanoes beneath the Antarctic ice sheet means that there is an additional source of heat to melt the ice, lubricate its passage toward the sea, and add to the melting from warm ocean waters. It will be important to include this in our efforts to estimate whether the Antarctic ice sheet might become unstable and further increase sea level rise.’
Does that mean that global climate change is not a factor in the stability of the Pine Island Glacier? No, said Loose. ‘Climate change is causing the bulk of glacial melt that we observe, and this newly discovered source of heat is having an as-yet undetermined effect, because we do not know how this heat is distributed beneath the ice sheet.’
He said other studies have shown that melting caused by climate change is reducing the size and weight of the glacier, which reduces the pressure on the mantle, allowing greater heat from the volcanic source to escape and then warm the ocean water. ‘Predicting the rate of sea level rise is going to be a key role for science over the next 100 years, and we are doing that. We are monitoring and modeling these glaciers,’ Loose said.
The scientists conclude by writing: ‘The magnitude and the variations in the rate of the volcanic heat supplied to the Pine Island Glacier, either by internal magma migration, or by an increase in volcanism as a consequence of ice sheet thinning, may impact the future dynamics of the Pine Island Glacier, during the contemporary period of climate-driven glacial retreat.’
In addition to Heywood, Loose worked with Alberto C. Naveira Garabato, of the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom; Peter Schlosser of Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University; William Jenkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts; and David Vaughn of the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom.”

The West Antarctic Kamb Ice Stream has always puzzled the researchers because here the ice thickened, in contrast to the general melting trend in West Antarctica. What could be the cause? Another volcano, as reported by the University of Washington in 2018: University of Washington 2018:
Volcano under ice sheet suggests thickening of West Antarctic ice is short-term
A region of West Antarctica is behaving differently from most of the continent’s ice: A large patch of ice there is thickening, unlike other parts of West Antarctica that are losing ice. Whether this thickening trend will continue affects the overall amount that melting or collapsing glaciers could raise the level of the world’s oceans.
A study led by the University of Washington has discovered a new clue to this region’s behavior: A volcano under the ice sheet has left an almost 6,000-year record of the glacier’s motion. The track hidden in the middle of the ice sheet suggests that the current thickening is just a short-term feature that may not affect the glacier over the long term. It also suggests that similar clues to the past may be hiding deep inside the ice sheet itself. ‘What’s exciting about this study is that we show how the structure of the ice sheet acts as a powerful record of what has happened in the past,’ said Nicholas Holschuh, a UW postdoctoral researcher in Earth and space sciences. He is first author of the paper published Sept. 4 in The Cryosphere.
The data come from the ice above Mount Resnik, a 1.6-kilometer (mile-high) inactive volcano that currently sits under 300 meters (0.19 miles) of ice. The volcano lies just upstream of the thickening Kamb Ice Stream, part of a dynamic coastal region of ice that drains into Antarctica’s Ross Sea. Studies show Kamb Ice Stream has flowed quickly in the past but stalled more than a century ago, leaving the region’s ice to drain via the four other major ice streams, a switch that glaciologists think happens every few hundred years. Meanwhile the ice inland of Kamb Ice Stream is beginning to bulge, and it is unclear what will happen next. ‘The shutdown of Kamb Ice Stream started long before the satellite era,’ Holschuh said. ‘We need some longer-term indicators for its behavior to understand how important this shutdown is for the future of the region’s ice.’
The paper analyzes two radar surveys of the area’s ice. One was collected in 2002 by co-authors Robert Jacobel and Brian Welch, using the ice-penetrating radar system at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, and the other in 2004 by co-author Howard Conway, a UW research professor of Earth and space sciences. Conway noticed the missing layers and asked his colleagues to investigate. “It wasn’t until we had spent probably six months with this data set that we started to piece together the fact that this thing that we could see within the ice sheet was forming in response to the subglacial volcano,” Holschuh said.
The study shows that the mysterious feature originates at the ice covering Mount Resnik. The authors believe that the volcano’s height pushes the relatively thin ice sheet up so much that it changes the local wind fields, and affects depositing of snow. So as the ice sheet passes over the volcano a section missed out on a few annual layers of snow. “These missing layers are common in East Antarctica, where there is less precipitation and strong winds can strip away the surface snow,” Holschuh said. “But this is really one of the first times we’ve seen these missing layers in West Antarctica. It’s also the first time an unconformity has been used to reconstruct ice sheet motion of the past.”
Over time, the glacial record shows that this feature followed a straight path toward the sea. During the 5,700-year record, the five major coastal ice streams are thought to have sped up and slowed down several times, as water on the base lubricates the glacier’s flow and then periodically gets diverted, stalling one of the ice streams. “Despite the fact that there are all these dramatic changes at the coast, the ice flowing in the interior was not really affected,” Holschuh said.
What the feature does show is that a change occurred a few thousand years ago. Previous UW research shows rapid retreat at the edge of the ice sheet until about 3,400 years ago, part of the recovery from the most recent ice age. The volcano track also shows a thinning of the ice at about this time. “It means that the interior of the ice sheet is responding to the large-scale climate forcing from the last glacial maximum to today,” Holschuh said. “So the long-timescale climatic forcing is very consistent between the interior and the coast, but the shorter-timescale processes are really apparent in the coastal record but aren’t visible in the interior.”
Holschuh cautions that this is only a single data point and needs confirmation from other observations. He is part of an international team of Antarctic scientists looking at combining the hundreds of radar scans of Antarctic and Greenland glaciers that were originally done to measure ice thickness. Those data may also contain unique details of the glacier’s internal structure that can be used to recreate the history of the ice sheet’s motion.
“These persistent tracers of historic ice flow are probably all over the place,” Holschuh said. “The more we can tease apart the stories of past motion told by the structure of the ice sheet, the more realistic we can be in our predictions of how it will respond to future climate change.” The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA. The other co-author is Knut Christianson, a UW assistant professor of Earth and space sciences.
Blown soot apparently has no influence on the Antarctic glaciers in the McMurdo dry valleys, Khan et al. 2018 (press release).
Medley & Thomas 2019 documented an increase in snowfall in the Antarctic, which benefited the ice sheet (NASA press release here). The authors establish a connection with the SAM ocean cycle, the Southern Annular Mode. The University of Colorado in Boulder, however, blames the increase in snowfall on the ozone hole (press release, paper by Lenaerts et al. 2018).
Jenkins et al. 2018 pointed to decadal cycles in the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet at the edge of the Amundsen Sea. The relationship between melting and ocean temperature is nonlinear:
West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat in the Amundsen Sea driven by decadal oceanic variability
Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased in recent decades, suggestive of sustained ocean forcing or an ongoing, possibly unstable, response to a past climate anomaly. Lengthening satellite records appear to be incompatible with either process, however, revealing both periodic hiatuses in acceleration and intermittent episodes of thinning. Here we use ocean temperature, salinity, dissolved-oxygen and current measurements taken from 2000 to 2016 near the Dotson Ice Shelf to determine temporal changes in net basal melting. A decadal cycle dominates the ocean record, with melt changing by a factor of about four between cool and warm extremes via a nonlinear relationship with ocean temperature. A warm phase that peaked around 2009 coincided with ice-shelf thinning and retreat of the grounding line, which re-advanced during a post-2011 cool phase. These observations demonstrate how discontinuous ice retreat is linked with ocean variability, and that the strength and timing of decadal extremes is more influential than changes in the longer-term mean state. The nonlinear response of melting to temperature change heightens the sensitivity of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to such variability, possibly explaining the vulnerability of the ice sheet in that sector, where subsurface ocean temperatures are relatively high.
And here are even more temporally variable relationships. Wang et al. 2019: reported on temporally variable relationships of the surface ice mass balance in West Antarctica with the SAM cycle and ENSO:
A New 200‐Year Spatial Reconstruction of West Antarctic Surface Mass Balance
High‐spatial resolution surface mass balance (SMB) over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) spanning 1800–2010 is reconstructed by means of ice core records combined with the outputs of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts “Interim” reanalysis (ERA‐Interim) and the latest polar version of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.3p2). The reconstruction reveals a significant negative trend (−1.9 ± 2.2 Gt/year·per decade) in the SMB over the entire WAIS during the nineteenth century, but a statistically significant positive trend of 5.4 ± 2.9 Gt/year·per decade between 1900 and 2010, in contrast to insignificant WAIS SMB changes during the twentieth century reported earlier. At regional scales, the Antarctic Peninsula and western WAIS show opposite SMB trends, with different signs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The annual resolution reconstruction allows us to examine the relationships between SMB and large‐scale atmospheric oscillations. Although SMB over the Antarctic Peninsula and western WAIS correlates significantly with the Southern Annular Mode due to the influence of the Amundsen Sea Low, and El Niño/Southern Oscillation during 1800–2010, the significant correlations are temporally unstable, associated with the phase of Southern Annular Mode, El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. In addition, the two climate modes seem to contribute little to variability in SMB over the whole WAIS on decadal‐centennial time scales. This new reconstruction also serves to identify unreliable precipitation trends in ERA‐Interim and thus has potential for assessing the skill of other reanalyses or climate models to capture precipitation trends and variability.”

Unless we suddenly stop eating bread or cereal it’ll keep being produced anyway, and the excess straw in the UK alone could build a new city each year.  The UK construction sector must reduce its energy consumption by 50% and its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, so radical changes are needed to the way we approach building houses. Straw could be a critical part of the transition towards a low-carbon future. The thermal insulation value of a typical straw bale wall meets the requirements of even the most demanding performance specifications. Recent research led by the BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials at the University of Bath has shown that straw bale buildings reduce energy bills by 90% compared to conventional housing stock. The manufacture of cement, used in concrete, is responsible alone for up to 8% of all industrially produced greenhouse gas emissions. Using natural materials such as straw, often directly from the field and with little further processing, significantly reduces this impact. Traditionally, the environmental impact of construction materials has been significantly less than the impact of occupation (heating, cooling and so on) over the lifespan of the building. However, in modern energy efficient buildings the proportion attributable to that “embodied” in the fabric of the building is expected to increase to at least 90%. Measures to reduce the impact of the embodied energy and carbon will deliver even more environmentally friendly buildings. Straw is just the dried stalks of plants stripped of their grain. You don’t really “make straw” – it’s a co-product of grain production, an established and essential agricultural process. So using straw doesn’t displace land required for essential food production.  In the UK more than 7m tonnes of straw remains after the production of wheat flour, and up to half this amount is effectively discarded due to its low value – simply chopped up and returned to the soil. As an average three-bedroom house needs 7.2 tonnes of straw, the “leftover” could be used to build more than 500,000 new homes – a city the size of Birmingham could be built each year using discarded straw. Straw is also a low-cost material. But more importantly, as a plant it captures and stores atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. By using more and more straw in buildings we are creating a natural carbon storage bank. Though the bible references using straw for bricks – and thatched roofs – have been common for centuries, modern straw construction was developed when mechanical baling machines were first used in late 19th-century Nebraska. Stacked like large bricks, straw bales can be used for modest loadbearing as well as non-loadbearing walls. The oldest surviving straw bale building is around 100 years old. But straw has never caught on as an alternative to bricks, concrete or timber. There are concerns about its poor durability, fire resistance, the way it attracts mice and rats and, as one of the three little pigs found out the hard way, its lack of structural integrity. Straw bales aren’t currently made to the same levels of tolerance and specification as bricks or cement. The fact they’re generally slightly different sizes combined with the need to keep bales dry during construction has meant most builders would not, until recently, consider straw bales a viable solution for anything. Other than perhaps for enthusiastic self-builders. However, the development of prefabricated wall panels using straw bale for insulation has now provided the opportunity to market straw to the mainstream construction industry. Prefabrication, or off-site manufacture, means that wall panels can be made to a very high specification in a factory, protected from variable weather conditions that would otherwise inhibit on-site building with straw.  A prefabricated product can be certified as fit for use by industry bodies, making it much more acceptable to builders, financiers and insurers. It also radically reduces site construction times, with houses able to be erected in ten weeks instead of around 16 weeks for more conventional buildings. It seems the time has arrived for straw bale construction. For the past ten years the University of Bath has been working with a local company, ModCell, to develop prefabricated straw bales. We started out looking at straw as a low-carbon cladding solution and soon moved on to developing panels that could bear heavy loads. Now, we are able to make low-energy prefabricated straw bale houses. The panels have been subjected to fire tests, thermal transmittance tests, accelerated weathering tests, acoustic tests, simulated flooding and impact testing. We’ve even tested the structures in a simulated hurricane force wind, in what has been termed the “big bad wolf” test: the panels and prototype BaleHaus passed with flying colours. These panels have now been granted certification. This in turn means insurers will cover straw houses and home-buyers will be able to obtain mortgages. Hayesfield School in Bath, EcoDepot in York and the School of Architecture at the University of the West of England have all made use of these panels. Certification means the housing market can now use straw too, with LILAC in Leeds completed in 2013 and now a new development in Bristol due for completion later this year, with proposals for larger schemes already in planning. Modern prefabricated straw bale houses are affordable, deliver excellent levels of energy efficiency in use for the home-owner or occupier and provide a genuine sustainable solution by using a cheap and widely available agricultural co-product. Other similar prefabricated systems using straw bale construction have been developed in Australia, Belgium and Canada. Entire communities, towns or even cities built from straw bales. And why not?",2020-12-19T16:43:53.262851Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:37:57.649832Z,880,119,,"Arctic sea ice melts each summer, reaching its minimum extent sometime in September, before refreezing through the winter. Over the past 35 years, the September sea ice extent has reduced by about 35% overall and this decline is projected to continue as global temperatures increase. In 2007 and 2012 the summer ice extent was dramatically lower, causing some some media speculation that we would soon see a summer which was “ice-free” (meaning a year with less than 1 million km2 of sea-ice).  Most climate scientists were more cautious. The weather in 2007 and 2012 was warmer than usual and the winds were particularly favourable for melting sea ice. Although human influence on Arctic sea ice has been
detected, there was no evidence that these weather patterns would continue each year.  In contrast, 2013 and 2014 had more sea ice than 2012, causing other  speculation that a recovery was underway. Is this claim warranted? The figure below shows Arctic sea ice extent (the black line) has undergone a long-term decrease, with the dashed line representing a linear trend. But there have also been shorter periods of rapid melt, no change, and apparent increases in extent during this decline – represented below by coloured trend lines for some deliberately chosen eight year periods. The most recent eight-year period, starting from the extreme low of 2007, shows an upward trend. This does not mean that the Arctic sea ice is recovering. As with global temperature, these erratic changes are what we expect to see. Imagine a ball bouncing down a bumpy hill. Gravity will ensure that the ball will move downwards. But if the ball hits a bump at a certain angle it might move horizontally or even upwards for a time, before resuming its inevitable downward trajectory. This bouncing ball is an analogy for the changing Arctic sea ice.  The hill represents the long-term downward trend in Arctic sea ice due to increasing global temperatures and the bumps introduce changes from this smooth trajectory. These erratic bounces could be in either direction, causing an apparent acceleration or temporary reduction in melt rate. By only examining a small part of the trajectory you might conclude that the ball was moving against gravity. A longer term view would see it as a bounce. There is no expectation that sea ice, or any other aspect of the climate, will change smoothly over time. The climate system simply does not work that way. Previous studies have suggested that natural climate variations (or “bounces”) play a key role in how sea ice evolves, and suggested that some of the rapid melt in the early 2000s was a temporary acceleration.  A new study I co-authored with a team of Canadian and American scientists, published in Nature Climate Change, highlights that the recent slower melt is a temporary, but not unexpected, deceleration. The complex climate models used to make projections of future climate also exhibit similar periods of little change and more rapid change in Arctic sea ice. The recent  trends are well within the range of these expectations. We might even see a decade or more with little apparent change in sea ice. The causes of these fluctuations in melt rate are still being explored. One suggestion is that slow variations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures are involved. More observations of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere and sea ice would help answer this question. When will the Arctic be ice-free – or equivalently, when will the ball reach the bottom of the hill? The IPCC concluded it was likely that the Arctic would be reliably ice-free in September by 2050, assuming high future greenhouse gas emissions (where “reliably ice-free” means five consecutive years with less than 1 million km2 of sea ice). We expect the long-term decline in Arctic sea ice to continue as global temperatures rise. There will also be further bounces, both up and down. Individual years will be ice-free sometime in the 2020s, 2030s or 2040s, depending on both future greenhouse gas emissions and these natural fluctuations.  Even when it reaches the bottom of the hill the ball will continue to bounce. Similarly, not every future year will be ice-free in summer. But if global temperatures continue to increase the bounces will become smaller and the ice-free periods will spread from late summer into autumn and early summer.  Commercial Arctic shipping is already increasing to exploit shorter journey times from Europe to Asia, while oil, gas & mineral extraction possibilities are being explored and Arctic tourism is growing. Decisions about such activities need to assess both the risks and opportunities. The important role of natural sea ice fluctuations needs to be considered in such assessments.",2020-12-22T13:37:57.649864Z,1

,2020-12-19T16:42:36.872570Z,884,119,,"A £30bn British pension fund has threatened to sack investment managers that do not take action on the climate crisis, criticising the sector as “not fit for purpose”. Brunel Pension Partnership, which manages pension money for nine councils in south-west England as well as for the Environment Agency, said it would review the mandates of asset managers that don’t reduce exposure to climate risk by 2022.  The Bristol-based pension fund will demand that companies in which it invests take steps to align their emissions with targets agreed at the 2015 Paris climate summit. Brunel will vote against the reappointment of board members of companies that who are not doing enough, and could also sell its stakes from 2022 onwards. Its new policy reflects the increasing pressure on the role of the asset management sector in abetting the climate crisis. Research by InfluenceMap, a non-profit, found that the portfolios of the world’s 15 largest asset managers were overweight in polluting companies, while the largest US managers opposed the majority of climate-based shareholder votes at the companies in which they invested. Mark Mansley, Brunel’s chief investment officer, said: “Climate change is a rapidly escalating investment issue. We found that the finance sector is part of the problem, when it could and should be part of the solution for addressing climate change.” Brunel’s money is spread between more than 130 investment managers, some of whom control hundreds of billions or even trillions of pounds in assets. Brunel’s managers include Aberdeen Standard, Invesco, Legal & General Investment Management, Royal London Asset Management and Wellington Management. While many asset managers have all but ignored environmental campaigners, the prospect of asset owners such as pension funds withdrawing their lucrative business has prompted some big investors to reassess their climate policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager with more than $6.9tn (£5.3tn) in assets and another manager of Brunel’s assets, last week bowed to pressure to improve its response to the climate crisis, saying it would divest from companies producing thermal coal and increasingly offer fossil fuel-free products, among other initiatives. Brunel said it had found short-termist thinking and an unwillingness among asset managers to invest in companies pursuing low-carbon technologies, and added that risk models used by investors often relied on flawed assumptions that did not take into account climate risks. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “Now is the time for everyone in the finance sector to show leadership in response to the climate emergency.”",2020-12-19T16:42:36.872607Z,1

,2020-12-19T16:27:55.704133Z,887,124,,"Last week I was informed that the MBNA credit card I’ve had for years was “acquired” by Bank of America. Ok no big deal, mergers go around all the time as big corporations get even bigger by swallowing other corporations whole.
But I was shocked to discover that my interest rate had soared. It was around 12% previously, but now, thanks to the merger and corporate greed used to pay for that merger, my interest rate was raised to: (drum roll, and please sit down while reading) 24.97%  !!  The friendly note from the “BofA customer satisfaction center: said  “I could of course pay off the balance and avoid the rate change”. Gee, thanks.
WTH? I have excellent credit, no late payments on this card, and I’ve been with BofA since 1994 when Jolene Francis signed me up. I’ve had business loans, home loans, car loans, and my savings, personal, and business checking account with BofA since then, and thanks to the same sort of corporate weasel thinking where the Bank is more important than the customer…one by one, all of these accounts where transferred to other more sensible banks when BofA announced some amazingly stupid new “plan” to improve “customer satisfaction”.
Here’s some insight into the national credit card problem by SF Chronicle columinist  David Lazarus
Now, I’d point out that an interest rate of 25% generally makes it impossible to pay off a loan if the consumer pays the minimum payment listed on the bill. So it became clear to me that BofA was financing their shiny new merger with MBNA. Despite layoffs at MBNA designed to sweeten BofA’s bottom line, they just couldn’t resist sticking consumers with the bill for their merger.
So today marks my end of my 12 year relationship with Bank of America. Hello Discover Card. Hello WaMu.
It amazes me that banks keep pulling these kind of Enronesque stunts and still keep customers. They certainly lost me, and my company business, because they simply got too greedy. The only way consumers can fight back against these sort of practices is to cancel accounts and do balance transfers to more reasonable companies. For example, Discover offered me a balance transfer at a very VERY low interest rate, a bargain compared to 25% from BofA!
From David Lazarus column I found this nugget of wisdom:
“All in all, the world of plastic is an uneven playing field. This is something that should never be far from mind as you spend the next month or so probably running up your biggest credit card bills of the year. “
Corporate mergers never seem to do anybody any good. Debt is acquired with the mergers, and workers get laid off to finance it and the customers get stuck with the bill over the long term. Customer service usually takes a nosedive. Shareholders may earn dividends, and the inner sanctum of corporate weasels that structured the deal usually make out like bandits. But the customer usually suffers at their expense.
I think on the whole, corporate mergers are bad for America, as is excessive credit card debt.

There were 107 scientific papers published this past year indicating today’s warmth isn’t even close to being unusual or unprecedented when compared to the climates of the last centuries to millennia.
As illustrated below, there were also 19 papers affirming today’s sea levels are among the lowest of the last ~8000 years.
This is added to the list of nearly 100 scientific papers published in the last handful of years indicating Mid-Holocene sea levels were multiple meters higher than they are today due to the much more extensive glacier and ice sheet melt occuring during these millennia.

Oliver and Terry, 2019  Thailand, +2.0 to 3.8 m higher than present
“~6000 cal yr B.P. old oysters can be found from between 3.8 ± 0.1 m to 2.5 ± 0.1 m above present day mean sea level. … Dead (fossil) oysters were collected from between 1 and 3 m above the centre of the live oyster band in a more sheltered cleft inside the notch. The oldest sample with an age of 5270–4950 cal yr B.P. was collected at an elevation of 3.01 ± 0.1 m above the apex of the notch. The ages decrease with elevation down to 920–710 cal yr B.P. at 1.03 m. … In all the sites, the 14C age of the dead oysters inside the notches increases with increasing elevation above present day MSL. Clearly, relative sea level was 2 to 3 m higher than present between 6000 and 3000 B.P. and has steadily fallen since.”


Brooke et al., 2019  Queensland (NE Australia), +1-2 m higher than present
“Indicator data for Queensland have been assessed for their accuracy and robustness by Lambeck et al. (2014), who identified a number of coastal and inner shelf island sites in the northeastern region, in which Cowley Beach is located (Fig. 1), where accurately dated in situ fossil coral, coral microatolls and sediment core samples provide robust sea-level records (Chappell, 1983; Chappell et al., 1983; Horton et al., 2007; Yu and Zhao, 2010; Zwartz, 1995; Fig. 3). Here, relative sea level reached a Holocene highstand between 6770 and 5520 yr BP approximately 1–2 m above the present level (Lewis et al., 2013; Fig. 3). Following the highstand, the data record a gradual fall in sea level to the present position (Perry and Smithers, 2011; Lambeck et al., 2014). … Local and regional records for the Holocene at far-field sites may also reflect the influence of climatic variations on sea level, such as shifts in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that can induce minor (<0.5 m) changes in sea level (Duke et al., 2017; Leonard et al., 2018; Sloss et al., 2018) on annual to multi-decadal, rather than millennial, timescales.”

Yamano et al., 2019 SW Japan, +1.1 to 1.2 m higher than present
“Evidence from the core samples and fossil microatolls suggests sea level reached its present position before 5100 cal yr B.P., and a relative sea-level highstand of 1.1–1.2 m above the present sea level occurred from 5100 to 3600 cal yr B.P. This was followed by a gradual fall in relative sea level. The tectonically corrected sea-level curve indicates a stable sea level after 5100 cal yr BP., with a sea-level highstand of up to 0.4 m between 5100 and 3600 cal yr B.P.”
Makwana et al., 2019 Western India, +2 to 3 m higher than present
“The BB trench site is located at an elevation of 2 m above present day msl, where it shows evidences of dominant marine processes at depth of 2 m with a horizon of clay at depth of 3.2 m. In coastal environments, clayey horizons get deposited in calmer and non turbid conditions with depth > 3 m, which explains the clay horizon at BB trench site that would have been deposited with the water level depth of 3.2 m at > 2.5 ka period.”

Loveson and Nigam, 2019 Eastern India, +4 m higher than present 
“The continuous rise in sea level ever since late Pleistocene has reached the present sea level during 6800 years 100 BP and the highest sea level of about ~4m above the present sea level is observed during 6050 BP. Since then, the sea level started fluctuating in lesser magnitudes (between +4.0m to -2.0m), responding to the cycles of global ice melting and climate thereof. … It is also observed that the magnitude of all five high stands in between 7,200 to the recent has a decreasing trend from +4m to 0m. It obviously indicates that the most of the present day coastal plains were once under the sea as evidenced by the presence of many inland leftover paleo delta signatures in the East Coast of India.”

Oliver et al., 2019  South Australia, +2 m higher than present
“Raised beach strata imaged with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at Rivoli Bay suggest a sea-level highstand of +2 m above present ~3500 years ago, steadily falling and reaching the present ~1000 years ago.”
Kylander et al., 2019  Scotland, +9 m higher than present
“At present, the Laphroaig bog is edged by a dune system, but this sand source may have looked very different at the time peat accumulation started 6670 cal. a BP. A primary control on dune building is RSL. Glacial isostatic modelling, supported by radiocarbon-dated sea-level index points, show that the RSL on Islay was about 9 m higher at 6000 cal. a BP, and fell in a linear fashion to 2.2 m higher than present at 2000–1000 cal. a BP (Fig. 7C;Dawsonet al. 1998; Shennan et al. 2006a,b).”

“Sea level was at ca 8 m above present during the last interglacial ca 120,000 yr bp inundating the entire platform during deposition of the Miami Limestone strata (Moore, 1982) …  The marls form a leaky seal on the Everglades floor (Figure 14B) slowing water infiltration and storing water, increasing the hydroperiod and providing an environment suitable for peat deposition which started ca 4,500 yr bp (Gleason & Stone, 1994) at elevations between 1 and 1.3 m above present sea level (Wanless et al., 1994). … The historic high‐water stage occurred prior to drainage when the water stage was between 0.6 and 2  m higher than present in the study area (McVoy et al., 2011; Parker, 1975; Parker et al., 1955).”
Cuttler et al., 2019  Western Australia, +1-2 m higher than present
“Ningaloo Reef grew over the last ~8,000 years (Twiggs and Collins, 2010) with rapid reef build up ceasing ~5.8 ka BP when sea level was approximately 1 to 2 m higher than present. During this phase of development, benthic cover was dominated by reef-building corals (Collins et al., 2003; Twiggs and Collins, 2010). After this sea level highstand, reef evolution at Ningaloo was characterised as ‘detrital build-up and aggradational’ as sea level fell to present levels and the reef back-stepped (seaward) to its present location (Twiggs and Collins, 2010).”
Bondevik et al., 2019 Western Norway, +8.2 to +9 m higher than present
“We conclude that the maximum sea level of the Tapes transgression lasted 2000 years from 7600 cal yr BP and extended into the Early Neolithic, to about 5600 cal yr BP (Fig. 13), with an uncertainty of about 100 years. We estimate that the highest spring tide during the Tapes transgression maximum phase was between 8.2 and 9.0 m above the present mean sea level. … To account for additional uncertainties, we suggest that the spring tide sea level at Longva would have been 8.6 ± 0.4 m above present day mean sea level during the Tapes transgression maximum.”

Yamada et al., 2019   Japan, +1 m higher than present
“Post-glacial sea level reached about 1 m higher than today around 6000 years ago and then started to fall (Yokoyama et al., 1996). As such, a sudden appearance and increase of marine and brackish diatoms just below PL-b cannot be explained by eustatic sea-level change.”
Montaggioni et al., 2019 French Polynesia, +0.8 m higher than present
“The foundations of islets (motus), namely conglomerate platforms, started to form with deposition of patchy, rubble spreads over the upper reef-rim surfaces from ca 4,500 yr BP as sea level was about 0.80 m above its present mean level. On these platforms, islets started to accrete not before ca 2,300 yr BP, from isolated depocentres located midway between outer-reef and lagoon margins. At that time, sea level at about +0.60 m above present mean sea level was starting to slowly decrease to its present position.”
Brouwers et al., 2019  Dubai, +1.6 to 2.5 m higher than present
“During Pleistocene glaciations, global sea level was 100–120 m below the present level and resulted in most of the Arabian Gulf occurring as a dry basin (Purser 1973; Gunatilaka 1986) … Since late Pleistocene to early Holocene times, the sea level rose gradually until a maximum sea level stand 1.6– 2.5 m higher than today (Gunatilaka 1986).”
Haryono et al., 2019  Indonesia, +4.5 to 6 m higher than present
“[I]n 5000 BP, sea level increases up to +5 m from the present time; it means it was warmer than the present day. … Sealevel change started in 6,000 BP and rose to reach the highest sea level in 4,500-3,600 BP as +4.5 m above present sea level. Then moderate sea level lasted for 600-700 years until 2,200 BP reached +2.8 m. Low sea level peak occurred in 3,000 BP (+4.5 m above present sea level). Meanwhile, present sea level is lower than sea level peak during the middle period, that reached 2m above mean sea level. … Marine terrace also found in +6 m above present sea level.”

Williams et al., 2019 North Vietnam, +2 to 4 m higher than present
“A freshwater coastal marsh near the mouth of the Cam River in Northern Vietnam stands 2–3 m above mean sea level and is bordered by a coastal barrier that reaches about 6 m above mean sea level. A core from the marsh contains a 14-cm-thick sand and shell layer. The presence of abundant shell fragments suggests inland transport of littoral sediment, and the sand layer is tentatively identified as a washover deposit. The coast of the study area contains a beachrock standing above the modern beach and reaching to ∼4 m above mean sea level. A tentative explanation of this beachrock is that it represents a beach that formed during a mid-Holocene 2–3-m highstand, evidence for which has been reported from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.”
Rivers et al., 2019  Northern Qatar, +1.6 m higher than present
“The Al Ruwais area of northern Qatar has been the site of shallow water carbonate sedimentation since the mid-Holocene. Two distinct depositional packages have been identified. Between ca 7000 and 1400 years ago, when sea-level was up to 1.6 m higher than today, a barrier/back-barrier system was active in an area immediately landward of the modern shoreline. During the same period, a laterally-continuous coral reef flourished in the open waters approximately 3 km to the north. Towards the end of this period sea-level fell to its current position, and the reefal system died, perhaps due to exposure or the influx of detrital sediment. Between 1400 and 800 years ago a new barrier island was established directly on top of the moribund reef, and the old barrier to the south was exposed to the meteoric realm. Over the past ca 800 years the new barrier has retreated landward as much as 1 km to its current position.”

Fachbereich, 2019  Antarctic Peninsula, +14.5 to 16 m higher than present
“Raised beaches along the coasts of Maxwell Bay, located at 7.5 to 4 m amsl (locally termed “6-m-beaches”), interfinger with terminal moraines of the last glacial-readvance (LGR), which occurred between 0.45 and 0.25 ka cal BP (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Clapperton and Sugden, 1988; Yoon et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2009; Simms et al., 2012). It is therefore likely that these beaches developed during the LGR (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Hall 2010). Recent uplift of KGI was 0.4 mm a-1 during the last decade (Rülke et al., 2015). Average uplift during the entire Holocene, however, is 2.8 to 3 mm a-1 (Bentley et al., 2005; Fretwell et al., 2010). Fall of relative sea level on KGI accelerated during the last 500 years (Bentley et al., 2005, Hall, 2010; Watcham et al., 2011). This was most likely the result of a short-term acceleration in glacio-isostatic rebound after the LGR, with a modeled peak uplift rate of 12.5 mm a-1 between 1700 and 1840 CE (Simms et al., 2012). …  Bentley et al. (2005) show that an initial post-glacial sea-level fall was interrupted by a mid-Holocene highstand at about 14.5 to 16 m amsl from 5.8 to 3.0 ka cal BP. In contrast, data presented by Hall (2010) show a continuous sealevel fall, which becomes accelerated between 1.5 and 0.5 ka cal BP.”
Nirgi et al., 2019  Baltic Sea, +10 m higher than present (rate: +3.5 meters per century)
“Considering the elevations of the pre-Ancylus Lake palaeochannel sediments in the Pärnu site and the highest coastal landforms in the area, the water level rose at least 17.5 m at an average rate of 35 mm per year, which is 5–6 m more than proposed by earlier studies in this area (Rosentau et al., 2011; Veski et al., 2005). Similar fast transgression (40 mm/yr), about 21–22 m, has been documented inthe Blekinge area between 10.8 and 10.3 cal. ka BP (Hansson et al., 2018a). … At about 8.2–7.8 cal. Ka BP, the rising Litorina Sea flooded the palaeochannel in the Pärnu site and floodplain in Reiu at an elevation of 1–2 m b.s.l., around 7.6–7.8 cal. ka BP Rannametsa site at an elevation of 4 m a.s.l. and around 7.6–7.4 cal. ka BP Sindi BOM layer at an elevation of 7 m a.s.l. (Figure 7). The Litorina Sea reached its maximum transgressional RSL ca. 10 m a.s.l. [meters above present sea level] just after 7.6 cal. ka BP, most probably around 7.3 cal. ka BP (Veski et al., 2005), as also determined in Narva-Luga region at the south-eastern coast of Gulf of Finland (Rosentau et al., 2013). Thus, during the transgression, the sea level rose by about 14 m at an average rate of 12 mm per year.”

This marked environmental change coincides with a rapid and significant sea-level rise documented in both the Danish and the Baltic area dated to around 7600 cal. a BP (Fig. 11; Morner 1969; Christensen 1995, 1997; Yu et al. 2007; Lampe et al. 2011; Sander et al. 2015) and probably of global extent related to the so-called ‘global meltwater pulse 3’ documented in Caribbean-Atlantic coral sea-level records c. 7600 cal. a BP (Blanchon & Shaw 1995; Blanchon et al. 2002; Bird et al. 2010; Blanchon 2011a,b). Based on data from a recent study on the island of Samsø in the central Kattegat, Sander et al. (2015) estimated a relative sea-level rise of ~4.5 m between 7600 and 7200 cal. a BP. A high sea level in Aarhus Bay at this stage is supported by an almost complete absence of terrestrial plant macrofossils (Fig. 5) testifying to an increased distance between the core site and the shore. … In the period of greatly increased sedimentation (c. 7700–6300 cal. a BP), the average rate is ~2.8 mm a1 (Fig. 11). The extensive coastal erosion during this sea-level highstand period is manifested in today’s landscape in the form of numerous fossil coastal cliffs situated above present-day sea level that formed during the Mid-Holocene when the relative sea level was ~3 m higher than present along the coasts of the Aarhus Bay area (Mertz 1924). … In a study of the island of Anholt in the central part of the Kattegat, the drop in absolute sea level was estimated to 2.6 m over a 700-year period between 4300 and 3600 cal. a BP (with most of the sea-level fall taking place between 4250 and 3740 cal. aBP; Clemmensenet al. 2012).”

,2020-12-19T15:49:39.236058Z,888,122,,"Share this...FacebookTwitterThe onslaught of paleoclimate evidence for warmer-than-now Mid-Holocene climates – when the Earth’s sea levels were meters higher than they are today –  stormed through 2019.
There were 107 scientific papers published this past year indicating today’s warmth isn’t even close to being unusual or unprecedented when compared to the climates of the last centuries to millennia.
As illustrated below, there were also 19 papers affirming today’s sea levels are among the lowest of the last ~8000 years.
This is added to the list of nearly 100 scientific papers published in the last handful of years indicating Mid-Holocene sea levels were multiple meters higher than they are today due to the much more extensive glacier and ice sheet melt occuring during these millennia.

Oliver and Terry, 2019  Thailand, +2.0 to 3.8 m higher than present
“~6000 cal yr B.P. old oysters can be found from between 3.8 ± 0.1 m to 2.5 ± 0.1 m above present day mean sea level. … Dead (fossil) oysters were collected from between 1 and 3 m above the centre of the live oyster band in a more sheltered cleft inside the notch. The oldest sample with an age of 5270–4950 cal yr B.P. was collected at an elevation of 3.01 ± 0.1 m above the apex of the notch. The ages decrease with elevation down to 920–710 cal yr B.P. at 1.03 m. … In all the sites, the 14C age of the dead oysters inside the notches increases with increasing elevation above present day MSL. Clearly, relative sea level was 2 to 3 m higher than present between 6000 and 3000 B.P. and has steadily fallen since.”


Brooke et al., 2019  Queensland (NE Australia), +1-2 m higher than present
“Indicator data for Queensland have been assessed for their accuracy and robustness by Lambeck et al. (2014), who identified a number of coastal and inner shelf island sites in the northeastern region, in which Cowley Beach is located (Fig. 1), where accurately dated in situ fossil coral, coral microatolls and sediment core samples provide robust sea-level records (Chappell, 1983; Chappell et al., 1983; Horton et al., 2007; Yu and Zhao, 2010; Zwartz, 1995; Fig. 3). Here, relative sea level reached a Holocene highstand between 6770 and 5520 yr BP approximately 1–2 m above the present level (Lewis et al., 2013; Fig. 3). Following the highstand, the data record a gradual fall in sea level to the present position (Perry and Smithers, 2011; Lambeck et al., 2014). … Local and regional records for the Holocene at far-field sites may also reflect the influence of climatic variations on sea level, such as shifts in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that can induce minor (<0.5 m) changes in sea level (Duke et al., 2017; Leonard et al., 2018; Sloss et al., 2018) on annual to multi-decadal, rather than millennial, timescales.”

Yamano et al., 2019 SW Japan, +1.1 to 1.2 m higher than present
“Evidence from the core samples and fossil microatolls suggests sea level reached its present position before 5100 cal yr B.P., and a relative sea-level highstand of 1.1–1.2 m above the present sea level occurred from 5100 to 3600 cal yr B.P. This was followed by a gradual fall in relative sea level. The tectonically corrected sea-level curve indicates a stable sea level after 5100 cal yr BP., with a sea-level highstand of up to 0.4 m between 5100 and 3600 cal yr B.P.”
Makwana et al., 2019 Western India, +2 to 3 m higher than present
“The BB trench site is located at an elevation of 2 m above present day msl, where it shows evidences of dominant marine processes at depth of 2 m with a horizon of clay at depth of 3.2 m. In coastal environments, clayey horizons get deposited in calmer and non turbid conditions with depth > 3 m, which explains the clay horizon at BB trench site that would have been deposited with the water level depth of 3.2 m at > 2.5 ka period.”

Loveson and Nigam, 2019 Eastern India, +4 m higher than present 
“The continuous rise in sea level ever since late Pleistocene has reached the present sea level during 6800 years 100 BP and the highest sea level of about ~4m above the present sea level is observed during 6050 BP. Since then, the sea level started fluctuating in lesser magnitudes (between +4.0m to -2.0m), responding to the cycles of global ice melting and climate thereof. … It is also observed that the magnitude of all five high stands in between 7,200 to the recent has a decreasing trend from +4m to 0m. It obviously indicates that the most of the present day coastal plains were once under the sea as evidenced by the presence of many inland leftover paleo delta signatures in the East Coast of India.”

Oliver et al., 2019  South Australia, +2 m higher than present
“Raised beach strata imaged with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at Rivoli Bay suggest a sea-level highstand of +2 m above present ~3500 years ago, steadily falling and reaching the present ~1000 years ago.”
Kylander et al., 2019  Scotland, +9 m higher than present
“At present, the Laphroaig bog is edged by a dune system, but this sand source may have looked very different at the time peat accumulation started 6670 cal. a BP. A primary control on dune building is RSL. Glacial isostatic modelling, supported by radiocarbon-dated sea-level index points, show that the RSL on Islay was about 9 m higher at 6000 cal. a BP, and fell in a linear fashion to 2.2 m higher than present at 2000–1000 cal. a BP (Fig. 7C;Dawsonet al. 1998; Shennan et al. 2006a,b).”

Meeder and Harlem, 2019  Southeast Florida (USA), +1-1.3 m higher than present
“Sea level was at ca 8 m above present during the last interglacial ca 120,000 yr bp inundating the entire platform during deposition of the Miami Limestone strata (Moore, 1982) …  The marls form a leaky seal on the Everglades floor (Figure 14B) slowing water infiltration and storing water, increasing the hydroperiod and providing an environment suitable for peat deposition which started ca 4,500 yr bp (Gleason & Stone, 1994) at elevations between 1 and 1.3 m above present sea level (Wanless et al., 1994). … The historic high‐water stage occurred prior to drainage when the water stage was between 0.6 and 2  m higher than present in the study area (McVoy et al., 2011; Parker, 1975; Parker et al., 1955).”
Cuttler et al., 2019  Western Australia, +1-2 m higher than present
“Ningaloo Reef grew over the last ~8,000 years (Twiggs and Collins, 2010) with rapid reef build up ceasing ~5.8 ka BP when sea level was approximately 1 to 2 m higher than present. During this phase of development, benthic cover was dominated by reef-building corals (Collins et al., 2003; Twiggs and Collins, 2010). After this sea level highstand, reef evolution at Ningaloo was characterised as ‘detrital build-up and aggradational’ as sea level fell to present levels and the reef back-stepped (seaward) to its present location (Twiggs and Collins, 2010).”
Bondevik et al., 2019 Western Norway, +8.2 to +9 m higher than present
“We conclude that the maximum sea level of the Tapes transgression lasted 2000 years from 7600 cal yr BP and extended into the Early Neolithic, to about 5600 cal yr BP (Fig. 13), with an uncertainty of about 100 years. We estimate that the highest spring tide during the Tapes transgression maximum phase was between 8.2 and 9.0 m above the present mean sea level. … To account for additional uncertainties, we suggest that the spring tide sea level at Longva would have been 8.6 ± 0.4 m above present day mean sea level during the Tapes transgression maximum.”

Yamada et al., 2019   Japan, +1 m higher than present
“Post-glacial sea level reached about 1 m higher than today around 6000 years ago and then started to fall (Yokoyama et al., 1996). As such, a sudden appearance and increase of marine and brackish diatoms just below PL-b cannot be explained by eustatic sea-level change.”
Montaggioni et al., 2019 French Polynesia, +0.8 m higher than present
“The foundations of islets (motus), namely conglomerate platforms, started to form with deposition of patchy, rubble spreads over the upper reef-rim surfaces from ca 4,500 yr BP as sea level was about 0.80 m above its present mean level. On these platforms, islets started to accrete not before ca 2,300 yr BP, from isolated depocentres located midway between outer-reef and lagoon margins. At that time, sea level at about +0.60 m above present mean sea level was starting to slowly decrease to its present position.”
Brouwers et al., 2019  Dubai, +1.6 to 2.5 m higher than present
“During Pleistocene glaciations, global sea level was 100–120 m below the present level and resulted in most of the Arabian Gulf occurring as a dry basin (Purser 1973; Gunatilaka 1986) … Since late Pleistocene to early Holocene times, the sea level rose gradually until a maximum sea level stand 1.6– 2.5 m higher than today (Gunatilaka 1986).”
Haryono et al., 2019  Indonesia, +4.5 to 6 m higher than present
“[I]n 5000 BP, sea level increases up to +5 m from the present time; it means it was warmer than the present day. … Sealevel change started in 6,000 BP and rose to reach the highest sea level in 4,500-3,600 BP as +4.5 m above present sea level. Then moderate sea level lasted for 600-700 years until 2,200 BP reached +2.8 m. Low sea level peak occurred in 3,000 BP (+4.5 m above present sea level). Meanwhile, present sea level is lower than sea level peak during the middle period, that reached 2m above mean sea level. … Marine terrace also found in +6 m above present sea level.”

Williams et al., 2019 North Vietnam, +2 to 4 m higher than present
“A freshwater coastal marsh near the mouth of the Cam River in Northern Vietnam stands 2–3 m above mean sea level and is bordered by a coastal barrier that reaches about 6 m above mean sea level. A core from the marsh contains a 14-cm-thick sand and shell layer. The presence of abundant shell fragments suggests inland transport of littoral sediment, and the sand layer is tentatively identified as a washover deposit. The coast of the study area contains a beachrock standing above the modern beach and reaching to ∼4 m above mean sea level. A tentative explanation of this beachrock is that it represents a beach that formed during a mid-Holocene 2–3-m highstand, evidence for which has been reported from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.”
Rivers et al., 2019  Northern Qatar, +1.6 m higher than present
“The Al Ruwais area of northern Qatar has been the site of shallow water carbonate sedimentation since the mid-Holocene. Two distinct depositional packages have been identified. Between ca 7000 and 1400 years ago, when sea-level was up to 1.6 m higher than today, a barrier/back-barrier system was active in an area immediately landward of the modern shoreline. During the same period, a laterally-continuous coral reef flourished in the open waters approximately 3 km to the north. Towards the end of this period sea-level fell to its current position, and the reefal system died, perhaps due to exposure or the influx of detrital sediment. Between 1400 and 800 years ago a new barrier island was established directly on top of the moribund reef, and the old barrier to the south was exposed to the meteoric realm. Over the past ca 800 years the new barrier has retreated landward as much as 1 km to its current position.”

Fachbereich, 2019  Antarctic Peninsula, +14.5 to 16 m higher than present
“Raised beaches along the coasts of Maxwell Bay, located at 7.5 to 4 m amsl (locally termed “6-m-beaches”), interfinger with terminal moraines of the last glacial-readvance (LGR), which occurred between 0.45 and 0.25 ka cal BP (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Clapperton and Sugden, 1988; Yoon et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2009; Simms et al., 2012). It is therefore likely that these beaches developed during the LGR (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Hall 2010). Recent uplift of KGI was 0.4 mm a-1 during the last decade (Rülke et al., 2015). Average uplift during the entire Holocene, however, is 2.8 to 3 mm a-1 (Bentley et al., 2005; Fretwell et al., 2010). Fall of relative sea level on KGI accelerated during the last 500 years (Bentley et al., 2005, Hall, 2010; Watcham et al., 2011). This was most likely the result of a short-term acceleration in glacio-isostatic rebound after the LGR, with a modeled peak uplift rate of 12.5 mm a-1 between 1700 and 1840 CE (Simms et al., 2012). …  Bentley et al. (2005) show that an initial post-glacial sea-level fall was interrupted by a mid-Holocene highstand at about 14.5 to 16 m amsl from 5.8 to 3.0 ka cal BP. In contrast, data presented by Hall (2010) show a continuous sealevel fall, which becomes accelerated between 1.5 and 0.5 ka cal BP.”
Nirgi et al., 2019  Baltic Sea, +10 m higher than present (rate: +3.5 meters per century)
“Considering the elevations of the pre-Ancylus Lake palaeochannel sediments in the Pärnu site and the highest coastal landforms in the area, the water level rose at least 17.5 m at an average rate of 35 mm per year, which is 5–6 m more than proposed by earlier studies in this area (Rosentau et al., 2011; Veski et al., 2005). Similar fast transgression (40 mm/yr), about 21–22 m, has been documented inthe Blekinge area between 10.8 and 10.3 cal. ka BP (Hansson et al., 2018a). … At about 8.2–7.8 cal. Ka BP, the rising Litorina Sea flooded the palaeochannel in the Pärnu site and floodplain in Reiu at an elevation of 1–2 m b.s.l., around 7.6–7.8 cal. ka BP Rannametsa site at an elevation of 4 m a.s.l. and around 7.6–7.4 cal. ka BP Sindi BOM layer at an elevation of 7 m a.s.l. (Figure 7). The Litorina Sea reached its maximum transgressional RSL ca. 10 m a.s.l. [meters above present sea level] just after 7.6 cal. ka BP, most probably around 7.3 cal. ka BP (Veski et al., 2005), as also determined in Narva-Luga region at the south-eastern coast of Gulf of Finland (Rosentau et al., 2013). Thus, during the transgression, the sea level rose by about 14 m at an average rate of 12 mm per year.”

For the past two years, this event gave comfort to many local families whose loved ones are serving overseas in the cause of freedom. Thanks to a great outpouring of community support, it was hugely successful. This yearâs event promises to be even better.
While the sacrifice of the men and women in our nationâs armed forces is clear, what many in our community donât know is that families of our servicemen and service women suffer even beyond the separation and the worry. Many families lose their breadwinner, and often take a large pay cut in service to our country. Sometimes it takes months for military pay to even be received as training, locations, and deployments change, leaving families to subsist on savings, borrowings, and kindness. Some families find themselves behind in rent, or leaving important bills unpaid while their loved ones selflessly serve our country.
Proceeds of this event will replenish an assistance fund used to help local military families in their time of need.
It also will provide entertainment, moral support, and inspiration. Most importantly it will provide cheer and personal contact via an Internet Video Conferencing System that will allow our troops stationed overseas to see, hear, and interact with their loved ones left behind.
On behalf of our local military families, and the members of the Chico National Guard, I ask for your support.
You can support our troops 3 ways:
1. Buy tickets to the event
2. Make a donation of goods and services for the silent auction
3. Make a cash donation.
Details are below.  Thank you for your consideration. Anthony

,2020-12-19T16:28:40.891355Z,893,120,,"This article is part of The Conversation’s worldwide series on the Future of Nuclear. You can read the rest of the series here. Nuclear power has had a makeover. What was once seen as a futuristic source of limitless energy has been reframed as a response to global warming, an ideal solution for countries looking for a continuous source of low-carbon power. But who are these countries? At the moment 31 different nations operate nuclear power plants (see page 14 here, with a total of 388 reactors, and before Fukushima, most planned nuclear power plant projects were in Asia and Eastern Europe, extending a trend from earlier years. Industry lobbyists the World Nuclear Association suggests that nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily, with more than 60 reactors under construction in 13 countries. They say that eight countries are either planning to build for the first time (Belarus and United Arab Emirates), have signed contracts (Lithuania and Turkey), or have some plans to build (Bangladesh, Jordan, Poland, and Vietnam). In contrast, the more independent World Nuclear Industry Status Report describes a declining trend, with annual nuclear electricity generation reaching a maximum of 266 GW in 2006 and dropping to 235 GW in 2013 – with 50 fewer operating reactors than the peak in 2002, and total installed capacity comparable to levels last seen two decades ago. This decline is also confirmed in BP’s recent Energy Outlook. In terms of new build, 67 reactors are under construction worldwide with a total capacity of 64 GW. For the nuclear industry this at first sounds promising, but then “under construction” doesn’t necessarily mean it will be finished any time soon – work first began on one reactor opened in Argentina last year back in 1981. It’s true to say that the risk to people, the environment and to the future of nuclear energy from another major incident is still very real, and reactor accidents from “beyond design-base” cascading events, such as the Fukushima disaster and all other major nuclear accidents, are the single largest financial risk – far outweighing the combined effect of market, credit, construction and operational risks. The thing is, in trying to “design out” these accidents, reactors have become much more expensive, complex, and hence, difficult to build on time and on budget.   Of the 67 currently being built, eight reactors have been under construction for more than 20 years, another for 12 years; and at least 49 have significant delays. For the remaining 18 reactor units, either construction began within the past five years or the reactors haven’t reached projected start-up dates, with construction projects in Finland and France very many years behind schedule. Average construction times are increasing: The Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom is building in Russia, China, and Belarus, and claims more than 20 export reactor orders in Iran, Turkey, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Jordan, Hungary, Finland, Egypt, India and South Africa. But there are questions about whether it’s got the finances and supply chain resources to carry out more than a small fraction of these – most depend on Russian finance, hit hard by the recent downturn, and Rosatom is already facing delays in its homeland due to lack of resources. Meanwhile, the World Nuclear Status Report shows that China has 28 reactors under construction – 42% of the world’s total new-build - with 21 reactors (17 GW) in operation, which in 2013 provided 2.1% of the country’s electricity. If all their reactors under construction come online before 2020, this would bring the total to 49 reactors. To put this into perspective, in 2013 alone, China installed 12 GW of solar, a threefold increase over 2012. And recent events have challenged China’s plans for nuclear. There’s been the usual construction delays, cost increases, doubts over the siting of reactors in provinces inland, and questions over safety and regulatory oversight  – and, remarkably, just last month, significant faults were found in the reactor pressure vessels already installed in the Areva EPRs at Taishan 1 and 2. While nuclear carries very real technical and regulatory risk – construction cost represents a key challenge. New builds will only go ahead after government guarantees public subsidies, including long-term power purchase agreements. This is because the private sector can’t afford to build new nuclear plants themselves. The reality is that nuclear new builds are high-value, high-risk projects with a marked tendency for significant delay and delay claims, cost growth and investor risk. For example, in Finland, their nuclear corporation TVO is pressing a €2.7 billion compensation claim for delays to the Olkiluoto EPR nuclear power plant. Perhaps amusingly, the French nuclear corporation Areva is in turn demanding €3.5 billion from TVO. The project’s turn-key price was €3 billion in 2005 and the current estimated price stands at €8.5 billion, with a construction time of 13 years and rising. And just recently, TVO has dashed Areva hopes of building any more EPRs in Finland. So the general post-Fukushima situation in the EU implies there will be limited construction in the coming decade. Although new builds are still planned in Finland, France and the UK - Italy and Switzerland have cancelled plans for new reactors, Belgium has confirmed a nuclear phase-out, and eight EU countries have signed a declaration that nuclear power is incompatible with the concept of sustainable development. At the heart of the nuclear question are differing views on value for money, foresight and responsibility. Huge long-term investments are needed and it’s clear there are critical social, environmental and economic decisions to be made. Germany, Europe’s dominant electricity user, has made its choice. Its decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 and to instead invest in renewables, efficiency measures, grid infrastructure and energy storage, will prove significant for both European and international energy policy.",2020-12-19T16:28:40.891388Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:06:41.088826Z,894,122,,"“Snowmageddon” was predicted – three feet of snow, blizzards whipped up by high winds, a freeze of the whole transport system. What New York got was “snowperbole”.  Yes, it snowed, but not as badly as predicted, and many people have been left wondering why the city was effectively shut down for what was, in New York terms, a light dusting. So what happened? The blame game began immediately. Some meteorologists have already put their hands up. “My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public” said the National Weather Service’s Gary Szatkowski, on Twitter. The politicians have defended their actions, with New York mayor Bill de Blasio saying the city shutdown was the sensible choice, given the potential for damage and loss of life. He said “we made the decision, better safe than sorry.” Is this a “forecast bust” or a case of expectations exceeding capabilities? Clearly people are not satisfied with the system. But is there anything that can be done to reduce such problems in the future? The answer, of course, is complicated. If you want to study how society could better respond to extreme weather, you need the help of political scientists, behavioural psychologists, media analysts, communication designers, town planners, engineers – and perhaps even some meteorologists. We will need time and in-depth research to assess precisely what happened in this event, but, on the face of it, the National Weather Service forecast was actually pretty good. Yes, they were predicting a chance of very high snowfall, which failed to materialise so dramatically over New York City. But Long Island and other parts of the north-east were badly hit, as predicted. Snow depth is one of the hardest aspects of weather to forecast, and the old saying of “too cold to snow” has some truth behind it. There can be a very fine line between conditions warm and moist enough to bring lots of snow, those which bring only some, and those which mean rain.  It’s also very hard to see in advance just how extreme the level of precipitation might be. We can very often say that the conditions will be right to cause a lot of rain or snow, but knowing whether a storm system will bring three inches of rain or five – or a foot of snow or three – is much more difficult. But this critical in terms of planned response. Five inches of rain might cause dramatic flooding, whereas two inches is just a normal shower. In New York, three feet of snow might cause snowmageddon. Less than a foot? Well, that’s just snow. Weather forecasting has made enormous advances. A forecast of the quality and accuracy provided by the National Weather Service this week would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. But as we have advanced we have realised more and more that we can only think of forecasts in terms of probabilities. The essence of extreme events is that, by definition, they are rare at a given location; conditions have to combine in just the right way to give us the worst case scenario. Otherwise, we just get “severe but typical”, for which we’re usually quite well prepared. Advanced predictions of the most extreme winds or rain will always see significant uncertainty. The paradox of extreme events is that it is impossible to judge the accuracy of a forecast from a one off; we need enormous amounts of computer power not just to make the forecast, but to evaluate and improve the reliability of the forecast by studying past events. Some have called for New York to be given a special high-powered supercomputer to help make more accurate predictions in future.  More processing power might well have helped in this case, but computers are not the answer to everything. Improved observations are just as important – larger numbers of measurements, provided with greater accuracy, from weather stations, radars, satellites, aircraft and elsewhere. But we also need a greater understanding of how best to use these observations and, perhaps first and foremost, a deeper understanding of the weather processes themselves. This is the “science behind the weather” that keeps me busy. It is important to realise that there is still lots about how weather works that we just don’t understand. Even where we do have a good understanding, we need to simplify things so that our computers are capable of processing all the information we have in time to make a useful forecast.  Some computer programs are so complex they take days or even weeks to model a single cloud. That’s not much use to forecasters who have to make a prediction now, about tomorrow’s weather, for a whole city, state or country. Extreme weather warnings are crucial and can save lives, but it’s important that neither scientists nor politicians promise things they can’t deliver. In a way, forecasters are victims of their own success, by raising people’s expectations of their abilities.  Any ambitious forecast system will have false alarms. Imagine, for example, an extreme storm that might occur only once in a hundred years – about 0.0027% chance on any given day or 0.01% if we restrict ourselves to winter months. Forecasting a 10% probability of this storm would be an incredibly impressive achievement. However nine times out of ten such a forecast will be perceived as “wrong” (though it may be, on its own terms, a perfect forecast).  While false alarms might be expensive, and lead to the danger that people don’t pay heed to the next one (“crying wolf”), it’s better to be safe than sorry. Response must be weighed against both the severity of the event and its likelihood. Authorities must learn how to make the most objective and rational decisions (which they may well have done in this case) while the public need to understand that “we acted on the best information available” does not mean “we got it wrong”.",2020-12-19T19:06:41.088859Z,1

,2020-12-22T13:38:59.933511Z,898,120,,"The stunning colours of coral attract many divers to the world’s reefs but, for us coral scientists, one mystery has always remained. Swimming over a reef, you can frequently spot brightly coloured coral sat next to differently coloured or colourless individuals of the same species. Why such variation in the same environment? We now have the answer. Our research at the Coral Reef Laboratory at the University of Southampton lets coral colours appear in a new light: as sunscreening pigments that help explain how corals adapt to environmental stress. Our findings are published in the journal Molecular Ecology. The underlying ecological concept may not be restricted to pigments in corals but might help to explain how species respond to changes in environmental conditions. Answers to these questions are urgently required in times of global change and alarming species extinction rates. The brownish appearances of many corals under daylight is due to photosynthetic pigments from the microscopically small plants that live in symbiotic partnership within them. But most of the green, red and purple-blue hues are caused by a family of Nobel prize-winning protein pigments. Some coral pigments glow green or red under ultra-violet or blue light, a physical phenomenon called fluorescence. During this process, light of a distinct colour is taken up by certain dye particles and re-emitted with a different, more red-shifted colour. The same process is responsible for the neon colours of marker pens or high-visibility clothing. In shallow waters the pink, purple and blue coral colours are most striking. Beyond depths of around seven metres these colours tend to become dull since their brilliance depends on the reflection of red light. Down there, where blue light dominates, the green and red fluorescence of some corals makes them stand out from the bluish-grey background.  Fluorescence can be best observed with the help of blue light torches and special filter masks under low light conditions. Using this equipment, the glowing corals make a night dive a psychedelic adventure. Some corals increase the production of colourful protein pigments when they are exposed to more intense sunlight. Humans get a sun tan – corals become more colourful. We found the pink and purple proteins act as sunscreens for the corals by removing substantial light components that might otherwise become harmful to the algae hosted in their tissue. Corals rely on these light-dependent miniature plants, the so-called zooxanthellae, since they provide a substantial amount of food.  We have also explained why some corals accumulate exceptionally high amounts of  colourful pigments in growing areas such as branch tips or near wounds. These areas contain essentially no symbiotic algae, so much of the light is reflected by the white coral skeleton instead of being used by the algae.  The resulting increased light intensities in the new parts of the coral represent a potential danger for the algal cells that need to colonise these areas. Hence, it seems the corals use a clever trick to help their symbionts. The higher light intensity switches on the genes that are responsible for the production of the sun-screening pigments.  Our results suggest that this shading effect could help the algae to enter the new tissue and establish the necessary symbiotic association. Once the population of symbiotic algae is fully established, the light levels in the tissue decrease as the algae use most of the incident light for photosynthesis. As a consequence, the genes of the chromoproteins are switched off again, allowing the coral to save the energy required for their production. Increased growth is associated with wound healing and neutralising potentially dangerous organisms by overgrowing them. The growth-related increase in pigmentation can also explain the bright colours of corals in areas where the animals have been damaged or are struggling with other organisms settling on their surface or in their skeleton. Despite these recent advances in understanding the functions of coral pigments, we still didn’t know why corals of the same species could display such different colours, even when sat next to each other. It raises challenging questions. If the production of the pigments is triggered by the light intensity, then why don’t all individuals have the same colours when they are exposed to the same light environment? And if these pigments help survival by acting as a sunscreen, then why aren’t corals in shallow waters always colourful?  Our most recent publication  explains the genetic framework that results in the dramatic differences in coral individuals. We found that instead of using a single gene to control the production of sunscreening pigments, corals use multiple copies of the same gene.  These genes do indeed respond to light, but not all of them, thus it is the number of these active genes that is important – and this varies between individual corals of the same species. Depending on how many genes are active, the individual coral will become more or less colourful, even despite being exposed to the same light conditions.  However, the enhanced protection offered by the sunscreening pigments costs the corals a lot of energy that might be diverted away from growth or reproduction. Therefore, being brightly coloured might not be a good investment for corals settling in more shady parts of the reefs. This genetic variation ensures some individuals within a coral population are well protected and are likely to survive better in stressful environments. Others are less protected but can instead invest their energy in processes that could help them to succeed in habitats with less light stress. These are probably the driving forces that keep multiple colour variants in the game for survival.  The resulting colour polymorphism makes it easier for coral species to inhabit more ecological niches in a reef. Humans can support the efforts of the corals by sheltering them from other forms of stress that they might not be able to deal with by themselves: heated waters, pollution, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, overfishing, to name only some.",2020-12-22T13:38:59.933546Z,1

According to a just-published Geophysical Research Letters paper (van der Bilt et al., 2019), not only were surface temperatures 7°C warmer than today in High Arctic Svalbard due to the accompanying “high radiative forcing” during the Early Holocene, but sea ice limits were well north of the study area back then too.
The authors point out that model “simulations neither reproduce this reconstructed pattern nor its magnitude.” This is presumably because the model simulations are predicated on the assumption CO2 concentrations are a primary climate driver.

This paper is yet another in a “growing body of recent work” that uses the prevalence of warmth-demanding (thermophilious) species present in Arctic locations to reconstruct regional temperatures based on a requisite warmth limit for the species’ survival.
Earlier this year Leopold et al., 2019 assessed temperatures were 5-8°C warmer than today in Arctic Svalbard 8 to 10 thousand years ago due to the presence of Mytilus spp, a warmth-loving mussel.

In 2010 Bob Dudley was the man tasked with steering the group back from the brink of collapse as compensation payouts threatened to suffocate the business. A decade on, Dudley’s successor will now have to navigate an environmental crisis on a global scale.  Bernard Looney becomes BP’s new chief executive next month at a time of mounting public pressure to prevent a climate breakdown by phasing out fossil fuels. His career success has been built on the millions of barrels of oil that BP produces every day, but his tenure at the helm will be defined by his response to the climate crisis. The dapper, 49-year-old Irishman has been hailed as a charismatic moderniser of the oil industry for the millennial generation. This week he launched an Instagram account to encourage a “candid” conversation about the energy transition. Many believe this unconventional oil man may be BP’s best hope of surviving the global shift from fossil fuels. Sources within the company say Looney was the natural frontrunner in the race to take over from Dudley. “It was no surprise to me whatsoever,” says one. “This is a business which needs to continue to deliver on its promises to shareholders, but must also evolve. The new leader will need to do both, and for many Bernard was the natural choice.” So, how “green” is BP’s new chief executive? “It’s a legitimate question,” says Mark Lewis, head of sustainability at the asset management arm of French investment bank BNP Paribas. “The burden of truth will rest firmly on his shoulders.” He adds: “In Europe’s financial centres the sense is that BP may be the European major with the most work to do in terms of improving their reputation and performance on climate change. I think Mr Looney will find that this is the first and most important question that he will need to give reassurance on.” Looney is a BP “lifer”. He was marked as a rising star soon after joining as an engineering graduate from University College Dublin, and primed for senior leadership. A series of plum apprentice roles beside BP bosses followed, including stints working directly for John Browne and Tony Hayward. When Dudley took the reins in 2010 he promoted Looney to BP’s senior management team. Looney later became the global boss of “upstream” oil and gas production, where he was in charge of reigniting the company’s fossil fuel growth. Under his leadership BP produced 2.6 million barrels of oil and gas every day, and secured a series of multibillion-dollar investments that will pour millions more barrels into the global market in the years ahead. Mark van Baal, from the Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This, warns that a career steeped in oil reserves may make it difficult for Looney to “imagine a future beyond oil and gas” or see renewables “as a business opportunity not a chore”. However, Nick Boyle, the chief executive of BP’s solar joint venture Lightsource BP, says he has “absolutely no doubt” about BP’s commitment to developing renewable energy. Boyle teamed up with BP two years ago and has met Looney twice in recent months. “He was genuinely interested and asking intelligent questions about challenges and what we thought the future would be for solar. We know from any of the energy projections available that solar is going to play an ever increasing part in the energy mix, and part of BP,” he says. Still, the oil bosses who have led the most meaningful climate action have tended to be new arrivals to the industry. The Danish energy giant Orsted has traded oil rigs for offshore windfarms under the leadership of Henrik Poulsen, a former telecoms boss who was once an executive at Lego. Spain’s Repsol set out industry-leading plans to emerge as a carbon- neutral company by 2050, mapped by its chief executive, Josu Jon Imaz, after a career in politics and scientific academia. Looney intends to be the exception. In an industry speech shortly before he was named as BP’s new boss, he told delegates: “We need to listen, hard, to society’s concerns. They are real concerns – the world is not on a sustainable path – and they are our concerns. Shouting louder about the good that we do is not a winning strategy. We need to demonstrate that we are part of the solution – that we get it.” He is reportedly poised to unveil the biggest strategic overhaul of the company’s century-long history. According to Reuters, the plan is to broaden BP’s carbon targets beyond the emissions it produces within its operations to include the emissions from the product it sells to customers. Environmental campaigners believe this would be a crucial step, an essential means of pushing oil companies into providing cleaner sources of energy. “Maybe it’s the Irish thing,” Boyle adds. “But he instils a confidence and a positive, can-do mentality which is infectious. It’s a big company, but he’s always been well-known as a charismatic, lead-from-the-front, roll-your-sleeves-up type of guy. The big plus with Bernard is that he gets it.” BP’s chances of surviving beyond its next environmental crisis will depend on that. Activist investors say oil firms must: Cut their own emissionsOil companies can do a lot to reduce CO2 emitted during production – by, for example, cutting methane leaks from rigs and stopping “flaring” – the burning of “waste” gas from oilfields. Take responsibility for the carbon footprint of the energy they sellOutgoing boss Bob Dudley stated that BP “cannot control” how people choose to drive or heat their homes, but setting an emissions target for the energy they produce should help a shift towards clean sources. Set a clear strategy for hitting the Paris climate goalsTo achieve net zero emissions by 2050, oil companies also need to invest in measures such as tree planting and carbon capture.

With all the hullabaloo about politically correct “Happy Holidays” greetings, as done up in electric lights on top of the Sierra Nevada Brewery, I thought the Christmas Star would be an appropriate topic.

About 2,006 years ago, according to a widely accepted historical and biblical accounts, a star rose in the east and guided three eminent thinkers, known as the Magi,  to the scene of an event that was to change the face of the world.
Since that time, astronomers and theologians have been baffled as to the precise nature of the star which, as told in the Gospel of St Matthew, led the Magi to the stable in Bethlehem where Christ was born.
Was it a miracle, a divine intervention to herald the birth of Christ? Was there a star at all, or was it simply added to the Bible to fulfil an Old Testament prophecy? Or was there some actual astronomical event that gave rise to the story of the Star of Bethlehem?
These questions have intrigued scores of scientists, writers, and artists ever since.
Evidence drawn from modern Biblical scholarship, recent findings in space and ancient Chinese history to suggest that evidence of the star’s existence could be at hand.
A British astronomer, Mark Kidger suggests that the Nativity may well have taken place at some time in March or April rather than in December.
Christ’s birth is said to have taken place while shepherds were watching their flocks at night, he notes, something that takes place at lambing-time in the spring rather than in the depths of winter. If the local inns were full, as the Gospel of Matthew insists, this would be because of the Jewish Passover, which also occurs in the spring.
Kidger concludes that Christ was born some time around March in 5 BC, taking account of the generally accepted fact that the inventor of the Christian calendar, the 6th century monk Dionysius Exiguus, was five years out in his calculations.
Ther have been several theories, including  the “star” could have been an unusual sighting of Venus, or perhaps Halley’s Comet, a supernova, or a meteor shower.
More plausible is the popular theory that what the Magi saw was a planetary conjunction, which occurs when two planets pass very close to each other in the sky, often producing a very striking configuration.
As shown in the picture above, generated by a computer program known as Starry Night, one such conjunction took place in 7 BC when Jupiter and Saturn came close to each other three times in seven months and were then joined by Mars, an event known to have been observed in Babylonia, well to the east of Bethlehem.
A more recent idea is that the Star of Bethlehem may have been an occultation of Jupiter by the moon that occurred in 6 BC, the re-emergence of the royal planet from behind the moon’s disc suggesting a royal birth.
However Kidger points out that the event would have taken place so low in the twilight sky of the region it would have been impossible to observe directly.
For his “best guess” at solving the Star of Bethlehem riddle Kidger looks to an ancient Chinese chronicle called the Ch’ien-han-shu which states that an object, probably a nova, or new star, was observed in March in 5 BC and remained visible for 70 days.
The object would have appeared in the east and remained in the sky long enough to have guided the Magi — Babylonian astrologers, according to some scholars — across the desert to Bethlehem.
“It’s hard to believe the Star of Bethlehem could have been anything else,” Kidger says of the nova, citing the coincidence in date, the duration of visibility and its position in the sky. And proof of its identity may soon be possible by looking for its telltale remains when the successor to the Hubble telescope goes online in 2011.
When a star goes nova, or supernova, if it has any planets, those planets usually become toast in the process. It may be that our birth of Christianity was heralded in by the destruction of another planet, possibly an entire civilization. As they say, God does work in mysterious ways.

,2020-12-19T19:07:05.841543Z,906,118,,"UPDATE: The national website www.junkscience.com has referenced this blog entry.
From the waaaayyyy over the top department:
The Weather Channel’s climatologist, Dr. Heidi Cullen who hosts the program “The Climate Code”, is advocating that broadcast meteorologists be denied certification (or re-certification) if they express skepticism about predictions of manmade global warming. She posted this revelation in the blog she runs on the Weather Channel website and you can read it here: http://climate.weather.com/blog/9_11396.html
She writes: “If a meteorologist has an AMS Seal of Approval, which is used to confer legitimacy to TV meteorologists, then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming.” “Meteorologists are among the few people trained in the sciences who are permitted regular access to our living rooms. And in that sense, they owe it to their audience to distinguish between solid, peer-reviewed science and junk political controversy.” “If a meteorologist can’t speak to the fundamental science of climate change, then maybe the AMS shouldn’t give them a Seal of Approval.”
Them’s scientific fightin’ words lady.
So, apparently any free speech, scientific debate, and public dialog that doesn’t agree with the peer reviewed popular scientific opinion is grounds for denying an AMS Broadcast certification?
This reminds me of Galileo and his fight with the Roman Catholic Church in 1632. Galileo wanted to publish a book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems which totally revised the earth centric view of the universe favored by scientists, scholars, and clergy of the time and built on the work of the earlier astronomer Copernicus. Galilieo was tried and imprisoned for daring to speak out against the “consensus” of the time for what he saw as a scientific truth.
I think we would all do well to follow this maxim: “People who live in greenhouses shouldn’t throw stones”.

Open scientific debate is essential to the scientific process, to call for castigating and silencing TV weathercasters who see other evidence is not only against American free speech values, it’s unprofressional for a scientist. Freedom of speech is the concept of the inherent human right to voice one’s opinion publicly without fear of censorship or punishment.
I support Cullen’s freedom of speech to make the claim that Global Warming is entirely an affliction caused by humanity, but I don’t support her call for decertifying of proponents of alternate theory
Despite receiving over 1000 blog comments by the public, most of them harshly critical of Cullen’s call for suppressing the voices of manmade global warming skeptics Cullen has refused to retract her call for AMS decertification of broadcasters who may also be global warming skeptics but instead blamed the whole mess on “spin.‿ Here is her latest post on the controversy. No mention of the word “sorry” or mea culpa in that post.
The Weather Channel has yet to officially comment on the matter. They are most likely being very careful as they are now in the middle of a scientific and political firestorm.

,2020-12-22T13:39:46.670400Z,910,118,,"Global Warming is a hot topic here on Earth, but it may be the issue will be settled not here on Earth, but on Mars.  A study of the ice caps on Mars suggests it is also experiencing a warming trend. A story about new data from NASA cites a six year study by researchers at Duke University showing that Mars may also be seeing a Global Warming trend and that both the Earth and Mars are seeing changes related to solar output.


You can click on this link to get a time-lapse image of the Mars ice cap changes between 1999 and 2001. It may take awhile to load as its 1.6 megabytes in size. Those with very high speed connections can get an even larger and more detailed time lapse here which is 6.2 megabytes in size
Planetary scientists have been watching melting of deep, wide pits in the southern Martian ice caps. The melting is substantial. According to Michael Malin, principal investigator for the Mars Orbiter Camera, the polar ice cap is shrinking at “a prodigious rate.”
Now where have we heard that before? Oh, seems Al Gore said in his movie An Inconvenient Truth that our own ice caps are melting and that we’ll see a 20 foot rise in sea level as a result. Here’s a transcript of the movie if you are interested.
The scientists believe this observed melting on Mars means that there is a layer of dry ice that is evaporating off of a thicker layer of water ice. The yearly increases in evaporation may be caused by a global warming trend happening on Mars.
The most recent images in the NASA sponsored study show changes from 1999 to 2005, suggesting the climate on Mars is presently warmer, and perhaps getting warmer still, than it was several years or decades ago.
Another recent NASA announcement, that recent water flows have also been discovered on Mars, also lends credence to the idea that Mars is getting warmer. One of the mechanisms suggested is that liquid water is subsurface, and that patches of dry ice acting as “plugs” are melting, releasing the water which moves enough surface material around before it freezes again to show up on photographic comparisons.
If both Mars and Earth are experiencing global warming, then maybe there is a larger phenomenon going on in the Solar System that is causing their global climates to change, like changes in the Sun. There’s correlating evidence showing sunspot trends match temperature trends on Earth. Mars may have a similar linkage.
But perhaps there will be those arguing it’s because we’ve landed two tiny SUV’s (Space Utility Vehicles) named Spirit and Opportunity on Mars surface.

,2020-12-19T15:49:49.387183Z,912,119,,"The publication of a hefty two-volume report on geoengineering by the US National Research Council represents a marked shift in the global debate over how to respond to global warming. To date, the debate has been about mitigation, with the need for some adaption because of the failure to reduce emissions adequately. The new report, backed by the prestige of the National Academy of Sciences of which the NRC is the working arm, now argues that we should develop a “portfolio of activities” including mitigation, adaptation and climate engineering. In other words, rather than presenting climate engineering, and especially solar radiation management (rebranded “albedo modification”), as an extreme response to be avoided if at all possible, the report normalises climate engineering as one approach among others. To be sure, the committee writing the report points to the serious risks likely in albedo modification, but it recommends the US set in train what would be a major research program into various forms of geoengineering, including field experiments in a technique to cool the planet by spraying sulphate aerosols into the upper atmosphere. And it endorses the deployment of various carbon dioxide removal methods as relatively benign ways to counter human emissions, arguing that the decision on mitigation versus carbon dioxide removal is largely a question of cost. This approach is riddled with political dangers. By mainstreaming geoengineering as a response to global warming the committee has left behind the argument put by Dutch Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen, in his famous 2006 article that opened the floodgates for geoengineering research, that desperate times will require desperate measures. With no talk of “climate emergencies” in the report, we look in vain for any clear rationale for the possible deployment of albedo modification. The “buying time” argument – according to which we can temporarily increase the Earth’s albedo (surface reflectivity) while the world decides to put CO2 controls in place – has fallen out of favour because any warming suppressed by a solar shield will just come back to bite us once the shield is removed. So there is a contradiction buried in the report: it recommends the initiation of a federal research program into albedo modification but does not give a plausible analysis of the circumstances in which the solar shield might be deployed. The  recommendation that “Albedo modification at scales sufficient to alter climate should not be deployed at this time” (my emphasis) is hardly reassuring. In the absence of a rationale, the report reverts to the standard scientists’ trope: we need more information. Deploying a fleet of planes to coat the Earth with a layer of sulfate particles “should only be contemplated” when we have enough data to know what effect it would have, and for this we need a lot of research. But who should do it? Who should oversee it? Who should own the results? Who would deploy the technologies? How can we ensure research is not misused? These questions, which ought to come before a decision is made to proceed with research, are either not considered or are shunted off to some vague “governance” space. Research does not take place in a social vacuum. When scientists propose to investigate technologies that would allow someone to take control of the Earth’s climate, and the research is proposed only because powerful interests have prevented a much better solution, then the research is intensely and inevitably political. So we should not let the genie out of the bottle unless we are pretty sure we can put it back. And that means no research before governance. The committee stresses its desire for public engagement but then undoes it by seeming to endorse a proposal for an “allowed zone” in which scientists alone would decide which experiments could take place. In this zone, experiments “should not be subject to any formal … vetting and approval”, so the report’s fine words about civil society engagement begin to ring hollow. An essential mistake of the report is the unwillingness to recognise (even though it has been pointed out repeatedly) that field experiments that do not change the physical environment can radically change the social and political environment. To maintain the physical-social separation the report must play down or dismiss the problem of “moral hazard”, that is, the likelihood that a substantial research program, let alone any deployment, would almost certainly reduce the political incentives to rein in carbon emissions. The committee’s answer is, as always: we need more information to make good decisions. Of course, this does not answer the concern at all but merely asserts that more information will always trump the flaws of politicians – as if the information deficit model has proven itself so effective in the past. The committee has a touching faith in the power of reason and holds it up as a kind of crucifix, declaring that “it considers it to be irrational and irresponsible to implement sustained albedo modification without also pursuing emissions mitigation, carbon removal, or both.” And yet this report has been written precisely because we live in an irrational and irresponsible world. And one has to ask how rational and responsible it is to include solar radiation management in a “portfolio of responses” to global warming, as this report does. The mandatory declaration that albedo modification “does not constitute a licence for unbounded CO2 emissions” becomes a kind of incantation to ward off the irrationalities of the actual world. One strategy for creating a rational world where climate engineering would never be misused is canvassed in the report. Social anxieties over deployment of climate engineering could be mitigated by “further research”. Negative perceptions of programs to modify the Earth’s albedo should be “extensively studied” so that they can be countered.  Sadly, the social world does not behave like the Earth system. It cannot be reduced to theorems and principles to be uncovered by further research. If we knew how to fix society through scientific study we would not be in such a mess that we are now considering an idea that Ray Pierrehumbert, climate science professor and a rogue member of the committee, describes as “wildly, utterly, howlingly barking mad”.",2020-12-19T15:49:49.387214Z,1

It’s now been determined that rising CO2 also causes “negligible” cooling (or warming) depending on the season.
A few years ago a seminal paper (Schmithüsen et al., 2015) was published in Geophysical Research Letters that indicated raising the concentration of CO2 causes a negative greenhouse effect, or cooling, in central Antarctica.
The forcing from the CO2 greenhouse effect ranges from -2.9 W/m² to +1 W/m², and the forcing for the Arctic (central Greenland) is said to be “comparably weak”.

Now scientists have found that CO2 – to the extent that it has a “negligible” influence on temperature – causes the climate to cool from winter to summer and to warm from summer to winter.

For the most part, CO2 varies due to temperature and water vapour level changes. The variance can range from 403 ppm during the drier winter to 377 ppm during the summer.

Similar seasonal CO2 variability can be found in pristine cave environments.
A paper published earlier this year (Al-Manmi et al., 2019) also finds CO2 rises to 756 ppm in winter but drops to 484 ppm in summer.
So observations indicate higher CO2 concentrations are linked to cooler temperatures, not warmer temperatures.

Nowhere do these observations support the paradigm that says real-world temperature (and water vapour) changes are driven by variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
If anything, it’s the other way around.

,2020-12-19T19:07:28.940141Z,918,119,,"Carbon dioxide is the “face” of the greenhouse gases, but nitrous oxide (N2O) merits its own spotlight. The same “laughing gas” once used by dentists as an anaesthetic and used today by people looking for a quick, giggly high, turns out to be pretty bad for the environment. Nitrous oxide (a molecule made of two nitrogen atoms and an oxygen atom) is over 300 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 and accounts for 6.3% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions. If nations are to meet their climate change targets, they need to pay attention to N2O. While the gas is best known for its recreational uses, most of it is actually generated through farming, where microbes in the soil combine oxygen (from the air) and nitrogen (added to farmland) to create new compounds. This results in the leaking of N2O gas from the soil. As more nitrogen is added to the soil more N2O is emitted, so the best way to manage emissions is to control the nitrogen added via synthetic fertilisers, manures and slurries. This century, the world faces a challenge to supply enough nitrogen to maximise crop yields while reducing the release of excess nitrogen into the surrounding environment as pollution. It’s an issue I looked at in a recent report for the Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology.  Nitrogen is an essential element for life, but it is mostly present as an unreactive gas, dinitrogen (N2), which only a few organisms can use directly. Agriculture was revolutionised in the early 20th century when the large-scale industrial synthesis of nitrogen fertiliser became possible. Food production increased and population growth followed; but huge amounts of nitrogen have subsequently been added to soils and the increase of N2O emissions is the inevitable result. There are some scientific developments which could help to reduce nitrogen emissions while maintaining crop yields and so global food production levels. A few are listed here.  Instead of applying fertilisers equally across a field, precision farming allows farmers to fine-tune the location and amount of fertiliser spread by machines.  This is based on soil and plant condition measurements and associated software-generated maps – optimising the yield and reducing fertiliser waste (pollution) and cost. In 2012, 20% of English farms used soil mapping to optimise fertiliser applications.  Plants could be bred to enable a reduction in nitrogen fertiliser. Most commercial plant breeding focuses on maximising crop yields under optimal plant growth conditions, which include a requirement for high levels of nitrogen (usually delivered via fertilisers). Some researchers have argued for programmes which focus on breeding plants that perform better under lower nitrogen conditions.  The final option is further away from realisation: the crops’ genetics can be altered to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilisers. Some plants such as legumes (e.g. clover and beans) work with bacteria to convert unreactive N2 from the air into a form that is available to the plant. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have recently begun research that aims to transfer this capability into cereal crops. These research efforts are part of an international focus to sustainably intensify agricultural production: increasing yields without adversely affecting the environment or cultivating more land. Nitrous oxide is critical to the debate on climate change, which means that farming is too.",2020-12-19T19:07:28.940175Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:47:07.542122Z,922,119,,"About one in nine people globally  still suffer from hunger, with the majority living in Africa and Asia. The world’s forests have great potential to improve their nutrition and ensure their livelihoods. In fact, forests could be essential to global food security, particularly when considering the importance of diverse, nutritionally-balanced diets. Forests are key to protecting biodiversity, and for mitigating the effects of climate change. This is well known. However their contribution to alleviating hunger and improving nutrition has been somewhat neglected. A recent study by the Global Forest Expert Panel on Forests and Food Security, which I chaired, shows how forests and trees can complement agricultural production and give an economic boost to some of the world’s most vulnerable regions.  Wild meat, fish, and insects are also important forest food sources. Insects are an especially cheap, abundant source of protein and fat. Caterpillars are great for vitamins and minerals. Particularly in South-East Asia, many forests and agroforests (tree-based farms) are managed by local communities specifically to enhance edible insect supply, such as the management of sago palms in Papua New Guinea and eastern Indonesia to support grub production.  Forests are also essential for firewood and charcoal. In developing countries, 2.4 billion people still use wood-fuel for cooking and heating. In India and Nepal, even better-off rural households depend on it. The volatile and often high prices for other energy sources suggest this situation is unlikely to change for some time. Access to cooking fuel provides people with more flexibility in what they can eat, including more nutritious foods that require more energy to cook. Trees offer a multitude of ecological services. For instance, they support bees and other pollinators, which are essential for crop production including on farmland. They also provide animal fodder that enables communities to produce meat and milk, and protect streams and watersheds as habitat for fish. Close to one out of six people directly depend on forests for their food and income, and it is important to recognise the rights of local people to these livelihood options. In the Sahel, for example, trees can contribute as much as 80% to household incomes, especially through shea nut production.  Novel initiatives are attempting to develop new tree commodities to supply the poor with sustainable incomes. For example, poor producers in Tanzania are engaged in a global effort to produce the seeds of the Allanblackia crop, which yield an edible oil. A private–public partnership known as Novella Africa is developing a sustainable Allanblackia oil business that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually for local farmers. Although forests are not a panacea for global hunger, they play a vital role in complementing crops produced on farms. This is especially important when the staple food supply is impaired by droughts, volatile prices, armed conflicts, or other crises.  While large-scale crop production remains important, it is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which may occur more frequently under climate change. Tree-based farming can adapt far better to such calamities. During periods of food shortage triggered by such events, forest foods can provide a vital safety net, especially for the poorest households. This forest-farm link also means that the loss and degradation of forests exacerbate the problem of food insecurity. Losing forests jeopardises “ecological services” such as a clean water supply, crucial for crop and livestock production. Managing landscapes on a multi-functional basis that combines food production, the maintenance of ecosystem services and other land use services should be at the forefront of efforts to achieve global food security. In the lead up to the UN’s finalisation of the Sustainable Development Goals later this year, the contribution of forests and tree-based systems to the “Zero Hunger Challenge” needs to be emphasised. They can be managed to provide better and more nutritionally-balanced diets, greater control over food inputs – particularly during lean seasons and periods of vulnerability (especially for marginalised groups) – and deliver ecosystem services for crop production. It will be a critical element of the responses to global hunger.",2020-12-19T16:47:07.542155Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:29:05.805357Z,923,120,,"As we enter 2020 and survey the state of the world, two competing storylines seem to dominate the present. The first is ruthless, relentless inequality. We see this not only in the imbalance of our economy, but also in our politics and government, in education and expression, and in the ways that our social structures and cultural practices dismiss and disregard people because of their gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and more.  Then there is the corollary: People standing up, speaking out, and fighting back. Young, inspirational figures like Kynan Tegar, Greta Thunberg, and Artemisa Xakriabá are spearheading movements to address the global climate crisis, because their future is at risk. And in places like Hong Kong, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Sudan and many others around the globe, ordinary citizens are demanding better treatment, more transparency, greater equality, and human dignity. They demonstrate, time and again, their willingness to sacrifice everything – their time, their efforts, even their safety – in service of a better future for us all. Unfortunately, the truth is, the courageous individuals leading the change – the people driving the conversation and making the largest sacrifices – too often are the very people most threatened by inequality. And so, I find myself asking: Why is it that those with the least tend to sacrifice the most? How can it be that the most comfortable among us contribute, in relative terms, the least? What crisis needs to befall us in order to act? To be sure, many with power and privilege already give with extraordinary generosity. As the president of the Ford Foundation, an organization originally endowed by a family of great means, I have seen firsthand how the generosity of a few can affect the lives of many. But this kind of generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice – which we see both day to day and in the data. For example, a survey from The Chronicle of Philanthropy found that, during the Great Recession, American households that earned more than $200,000 reduced their giving by more than 4%, while households that earned less than $100,000 did just the opposite. In fact, as they saw the need increase, they increased their giving, in turn – by more than 4%. And this despite the fact that tax codes in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world have built-in incentives that reward the wealthy for their charitable donations. This all-too-common discomfort with sacrifice is not about good versus bad. The disconnect – and disconnection – follows from isolation and insulation. Separation breeds selfishness, despite the best of intentions. In the United States, for instance, segregation was outlawed over 65 years ago. Yet, a recent Civil Rights Project report found that America’s schools remain both separate and unequal. We see similar trends of geographical divide in cities across America and Europe, where a lack of economic opportunity has led to the disintegration of our social fabric. Restoring unity and trust will take more than generosity and good will. Charity, while wonderful, ameliorates the symptoms of inequality, but it does not address its root causes. And we must address the root causes. Keep in mind that large swaths of people around the world are growing increasingly impatient with the status quo, and we with power will feel their ire if we ignore their righteous demands for a fair and just society. So those of us with privilege need to find ways to do more justice. That means not only helping those who are often excluded, but also undoing the systems and structures that create inequities and imbalances in the first place. That will sometimes also mean working to transfer our own power, and giving up some of the privileges we currently enjoy. Toward the end of last year, when our foundation hosted a conference on the future of philanthropy, I was struck by something Luis Miranda Jr, philanthropist and father of the entertainer Lin-Manuel Miranda, said about the philosophy with which he was raised. “If it doesn’t hurt,” Miranda argued, “if you’re not not-doing something else, then you’re not giving enough.” This conception of sacrifice is profound: only when it is uncomfortable or even painful to give do you know that you are giving for reasons beyond your own benefit. And it is worth remembering that, despite this prick of pain, sacrifice has a value beyond what is given up. When you make this kind of sacrifice, you do not give up something for nothing; you give up some of your privilege for something far more valuable: justice. If we want to address the inequality of sacrifice, therefore, those of us with the most ought to recommit ourselves to doing the most. Perhaps that means paying a higher tax rate to finance public goods or wielding our influence to promote inclusive public policies. Or perhaps it means devoting more time, money, and effort toward rebuilding the broken systems that perpetuate inequality. We all must ask ourselves what system, status, or status quo we are willing to part with to benefit others. Only then – only when we have paired our generous impulses with acts of justice – will we diminish the inequality of sacrifice, and build a better, more equitable world.

It is lengthy but well-reasoned and good reading.
From the article: “One of the biggest threats the USA faces today is a serious shortage of energy. Vulnerabilities in our system have been made glaringly obvious several times; since the 1970’s the USA has had social and economic upheaval due to the actions of foreign oil producers, and two hurricanes in 2005 showed just how fragile our remaining domestic supplies of oil and natural gas are.”
The president recently reiterated a commitment to reducing our national oil consumption, and I hope that gets implemented as its really a good idea. Hybrids and electric vehicles are looking better and better. Chances are my next car will be one of these.

In a new paper (Syring et al., 2020), scientists rely on biomarker evidence – (a) the presence of warmth-demanding species Armeria scabra and Mytilus edulis, and (b) IP25, a proxy for the presence or absence of sea ice – to suggest not only were there much warmer (4 to 5°C) northern Greenland temperatures 10,000 to 8500 years ago, but effectively sea ice-free conditions pervaded the region during this time.
The sea ice in the region has been growing “continuously” for the last 4800 years, reaching its peak during the last millennium.
The authors also find decadal- and centennial-scale periodicities in solar activity have coincided with variability in Arctic sea ice (IP25) throughout the Holocene.

In the natural world, jockeying for advantage, whether this is conscious or merely mechanical, can be a matter of life or death. Chimpanzees, our closest relatives, are highly political. They’re smart enough to realise that in the natural world brute strength will only get you so far – getting to the top of a social group and remaining there requires political guile.   It’s all about making friends and influencing others.  Chimps make friends by grooming each other and forming alliances; this behaviour is especially prominent in males wishing to be group leader. In times of dispute they call upon their friends for assistance or when they sense a coup may be successful. And the ruling group either reaffirms its position or a new group grabs control – but having the weight of numbers is normally critical to success. Back in the 1980s, the leading Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal spent six years researching the world’s largest captive colony for his classic book Chimpanzee Politics. He soon realised that, in addition to forming cliques, chimp politics still involves some degree of aggression. Humans in modern societies have largely replaced antagonistic takeovers with voting.  Chimps do not, however, live in a democratic society. For them, the social structure of the ruling party is usually one based on male hierarchy, where dominant individuals have best access to the resources available – usually food and females.  In many primate species, the ruling party members are relatives.  Alternatively, power alliances between individuals are based on reciprocal altruism – more colloquially known as “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.”  Does some of this sound familiar? However social species don’t always need a ruling party or a charismatic leader and, even among the social primates, we have examples of leaderless organisation.   Muriquis, (or woolly spider monkeys) from south-eastern Brazil live in large social groups and yet there are no leaders.  Males do not boss other males or females and there is no dominance hierarchy – a truly egalitarian society. They are very peaceful primates. Males will even wait in line for their opportunity to mate with a receptive female.   Relative to many primate species, muriquis don’t spend much time grooming each other or socialising, which may suggest a poorly developed political system. But this would be an over-simplification, as individuals socialise through group hugs – and social network analyses confirm the important roles of certain individuals. For example, the longer a male hangs out with his mother, the more “introductions” to unrelated females he will get and more offspring he may sire. While we might expect our fellow primates to display some degree of recognisable “politics”, it is more surprising to discover that this behaviour extends right through the animal kingdom – and beyond. Bacteria are simple microscopic organisms and yet even at this lowly form of existence, individuals try and influence others into following their action. They of course do not have a leader but instead live in a decentralised system where decisions are made through a system of stimulae and response related to population density, known as quorum sensing.  Bacteria vote by releasing signalling chemicals and they are able to count the number of chemicals released (votes made). For example, pathogenic bacteria must vote on when to become virulent (exploit their host); that is, to jointly release virulence factors (chemicals). By acting together they overwhelm the host’s immune system and can therefore colonise it.  More famous decentralised “political” systems exist in social insects such as bees and ants. Bees sometimes need to find a new nest site and they too use quorum sensing to decide on the location. Individuals will go and search for potential sites and upon returning to the nest they will do their famous waggle dance indicating the location of the site they have found.   However if the site the bee has found is of poor quality it will quickly stop dancing. Those individuals who are the most persistent – who shout loudest and longest from their soap boxes – will gain the greatest number of followers to their proposed new nest site. These followers, having returned from the potential new nest site, become political activists and add their dance/vote to the cause until there is a landslide victory for one particular new nest site. What these examples show us is that politics is everywhere: from the bacteria in our bodies to the animals in the world around us. Like it or not there is no escaping politics: roll on May 8.",2020-12-19T16:44:55.201939Z,1

ER Sustainability Outlook 02/27/07
Sustainability is a trend that is growing not only here, but also throughout the world.
It is an attempt to provide the best outcomes for the human and natural environments both now and into the future.  Essentially you could think of it as balanced use of the planet, where the use doesn’t outstrip regeneration.
Locally there have been a number of movements towards this goal, particularly with solar power. Butte County is particularly well suited for solar power. Climate records show that we have 219 sunny days and 57 partly cloudy days per year on average, which makes solar power viable. It wasn’t always that way, and it’s only now that solar power is becoming economically viable due to increased electricity costs, increased solar cell efficiency, and state rebate programs to help home and business owners kick-start the process.

There’s three reasons to do solar power on your home or business:
1 – You want the economic benefit of reduced power costs.
2 – You want to do something environmentally sound.
3 – You have no other power options available, such as a summer cabin.
Most often it’s the first two, but there are some limits you should be aware of related to economics. Solar power can be an expensive proposition to install, even with rebates. Thus unless you have money to burn you have to plan it carefully to ensure that you get payback on your investment. You also need an unobstructed view of the southern sky.
I myself have placed two solar power systems into use, one on my home, and another for Chico Unified School District on Little Chico Creek School, which is the largest solar power system for a school north of Sacramento.
In both cases, there were high power uses going on, which made the economics easy. My home had a deep well, a pool, and an upper and lower A/C unit, making my power bills hit as much as $500 per month in the summer! I’m studying a design for a third solar power system on my new home, purchased just last year, but its more energy efficient, making the planning task more detailed.
Typically, you’ll need to have a power bill of at least $150-200 per month or more to make solar viable for your home as a retrofit. However, if you are building a new home, planning solar into the building process is less expensive.
Some forward thinking developers are now offering turnkey solar built into new homes, such as is being done in Fresno. So far, I haven’t seen Chico developers offer such an option, but I think the time is right for our Building Industry Association, Chamber of Commerce, and City Government to work together to make such an offering practical.
The way solar power works for homes and businesses is by a reverse metering scheme based on Time Of Use (TOU). During peak power need times of noon to 6PM on weekdays, electricity is far more valuable than during off-peak times. PG&E will credit any power generated during those peak times as much as 4 times the value of electricity used during off-peak times.
It’s sort of like the stock market, sell high and buy low.
To achieve this, your home or business has to outfitted with a TOU Meter, so that PG&E can track when you use power. Then when you connect a solar power system to that, it will log when you are generating power during midday peak times, and when you are drawing power during off-peak times. The trick is to generate exactly enough power to result in a net-zero energy use, because PG&E does not pay you back for any excess power generated.
A solar power system generates DC voltage from the solar panels, and when they are working at peak you can expect a 15% solar to electricity power conversion efficiency. The DC power from the solar cells must then be converted and phased to match the 60 cycle AC power grid. This is done with DC to AC inverters, usually mounted near your mains breaker box. There’s about a 10% conversion loss in that process.
If you are planning to do solar, there are a few things you should know:
· Pick a reliable contractor experienced with the process, particularly with the California Energy Commission rebate process, because a mistake there can cost you a lot of time and money.
· Be prepared to spend money or to seek financing. There are low cost state-sponsored finance programs available.
· Be patient. The process takes time, often more than you think, especially in a retrofit. There are applications, permits, tests, and government interactions involved.
· Solar will immediately add to the resale value of your home, that value never decreases. So when you get a state rebate, say for $10,000 towards the purchase, you get to keep that as equity.
· Financing should be balanced in such a way so that it is equal to or less than your average existing electricity bill, so that you are paying yourself back. When the system is paid off, then you’ll have zero payments for energy.
· You’ll be switched to a yearly billing system rather than a monthly. If your solar system doesn’t produce enough electricity to cover all your use, at the end of the year you’ll have what’s called a “true-up” bill, which could be large, but averaged over the year will be much smaller. Be sure to plan for that.
· Right now, solar isn’t for everyone as its still a rather expensive and complicated process to install as a retrofit. However, as solar panel efficiencies increase, and more companies get online producing solar cells, the costs will come down, as happens with any new technology.
· There are state and federal tax credits for any solar installation which when figured in with rebates, can make the project quite attractive, and in some cases, a very low cost.
Given that energy demands are only going to go up, and prices will naturally follow that demand, if you have high electric bills or have a business that could benefit, solar power is certainly worth looking into.

I myself have placed two solar power systems into use, one on my home, and another for Chico Unified School District on Little Chico Creek School, which is the largest solar power system for a school north of Sacramento.
In both cases, there were high power uses going on, which made the economics easy. My home had a deep well, a pool, and an upper and lower A/C unit, making my power bills hit as much as $500 per month in the summer! I’m studying a design for a third solar power system on my new home, purchased just last year, but its more energy efficient, making the planning task more detailed.
Typically, you’ll need to have a power bill of at least $150-200 per month or more to make solar viable for your home as a retrofit. However, if you are building a new home, planning solar into the building process is less expensive.
Some forward thinking developers are now offering turnkey solar built into new homes, such as is being done in Fresno. So far, I haven’t seen Chico developers offer such an option, but I think the time is right for our Building Industry Association, Chamber of Commerce, and City Government to work together to make such an offering practical.
The way solar power works for homes and businesses is by a reverse metering scheme based on Time Of Use (TOU). During peak power need times of noon to 6PM on weekdays, electricity is far more valuable than during off-peak times. PG&E will credit any power generated during those peak times as much as 4 times the value of electricity used during off-peak times.
It’s sort of like the stock market, sell high and buy low.
To achieve this, your home or business has to outfitted with a TOU Meter, so that PG&E can track when you use power. Then when you connect a solar power system to that, it will log when you are generating power during midday peak times, and when you are drawing power during off-peak times. The trick is to generate exactly enough power to result in a net-zero energy use, because PG&E does not pay you back for any excess power generated.
A solar power system generates DC voltage from the solar panels, and when they are working at peak you can expect a 15% solar to electricity power conversion efficiency. The DC power from the solar cells must then be converted and phased to match the 60 cycle AC power grid. This is done with DC to AC inverters, usually mounted near your mains breaker box. There’s about a 10% conversion loss in that process.
If you are planning to do solar, there are a few things you should know:
· Pick a reliable contractor experienced with the process, particularly with the California Energy Commission rebate process, because a mistake there can cost you a lot of time and money.
· Be prepared to spend money or to seek financing. There are low cost state-sponsored finance programs available.
· Be patient. The process takes time, often more than you think, especially in a retrofit. There are applications, permits, tests, and government interactions involved.
· Solar will immediately add to the resale value of your home, that value never decreases. So when you get a state rebate, say for $10,000 towards the purchase, you get to keep that as equity.
· Financing should be balanced in such a way so that it is equal to or less than your average existing electricity bill, so that you are paying yourself back. When the system is paid off, then you’ll have zero payments for energy.
· You’ll be switched to a yearly billing system rather than a monthly. If your solar system doesn’t produce enough electricity to cover all your use, at the end of the year you’ll have what’s called a “true-up” bill, which could be large, but averaged over the year will be much smaller. Be sure to plan for that.
· Right now, solar isn’t for everyone as its still a rather expensive and complicated process to install as a retrofit. However, as solar panel efficiencies increase, and more companies get online producing solar cells, the costs will come down, as happens with any new technology.
· There are state and federal tax credits for any solar installation which when figured in with rebates, can make the project quite attractive, and in some cases, a very low cost.
Given that energy demands are only going to go up, and prices will naturally follow that demand, if you have high electric bills or have a business that could benefit, solar power is certainly worth looking into.

You have probably heard something about green flashes, but may not have seen one. If so, you’ll be happy to find that a number of pictures of green flashes are available on the Web like the one above. The one pictured above is special because its a TRIPLE green flash which is exceedingly rare.  Its explanation lies in refraction of light (as in a prism) in the atmosphere and is enhanced by layered atmospheric inversions and possibly fog.
There was a time when green flashes were thought to be fables. Jules Verne, of all people, fixed them as real in his 1882 novel “Le Rayon Vert” (The Green Ray). He described “a green which no artist could ever obtain on his palette, a green of which neither the varied tints of vegetation nor the shades of the most limpid sea could ever produce the like! If there is a green in Paradise, it cannot be but of this shade, which most surely is the true green of Hope.”
Green flashes are real (not illusory) phenomena seen at sunrise and sunset, when some part of the Sun suddenly changes color (at sunset, from red or orange to green or blue). The word “flash” refers to the sudden appearance and brief duration of this green color, which usually lasts only a second or two.
For an explanation along with some great pictures of the atmospheric optics involved in green flashes and other sorts of colorful atmospheric phenonmena, I recommend this website in the UK: http://www.atoptics.co.uk/

,2020-12-21T17:21:20.083867Z,932,119,,"Australia’s bushfire crisis is expected to contribute up to 2% of what scientists forecast will be one of the largest annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on record. The atmospheric concentration of the heat-trapping gas is projected to peak at more than 417 parts per million in May, and average about 414.2 parts per million for the year, according to the forecast by the British Met Office. It is a 2.74ppm increase above the 2019 average.  Science agencies have associated concentrations of more than 450ppm with average temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, a point at which some catastrophic effects of global heating may become irreversible. In its statement explaining the forecast, the Met Office Hadley Centre highlighted the role of the Australian bushfires in contributing to the unusually large forecast annual rise. Richard Betts, a professor with the Met Office and the University of Exeter, said human-induced climate change and local weather patterns had contributed to the hot, dry weather that played a key role in the severity of the Australian bushfires, which in turn increased emissions. Fires have affected more than 12m hectares of country this season, including more than 5m hectares in New South Wales. Betts said fossil fuel burning and deforestation had driven a year-on-year increase in carbon dioxide levels since 1958, when readings began at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, but the rate of the increase fluctuated depending on how much was absorbed by forests and other ecosystems. The response of ecosystem carbon sinks was expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running as warmer and drier conditions limited the ability of plants to grow and absorb carbon dioxide, increasing the risk of wildfires that released more emissions. “While human-caused emissions cause the carbon dioxide rise in concentration, impacts of weather patterns on global ecosystems are predicted to increase the rise by 10% this year,” the statement says. It says emissions from the Australian fires contribute “up to one-fifth of this increase”, or up to 2% of the total rise. Emissions from bushfires are usually considered to be climate neutral in carbon accounting, based on the assumption that forest regrowth absorbs a similar amount of carbon dioxide as was released. But scientists increasingly warn this is likely to be optimistic as many burned areas never recovered to their pre-fire state. Australia contributes about 1.3% of annual global emissions under UN greenhouse accounting rules. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the wildfire emissions would not be counted in Australia’s emissions due to the way the country constructed its greenhouse gas reporting. “Along with other accounting tricks, such as Kyoto carry over, it is a clear global signal of the effect of Australia avoiding its responsibility to take real action,” he said. Ken Thompson, a former NSW deputy commissioner for fire and rescue, said it should not be a surprise that Australia’s fires were making a mounting contribution to the climate crisis. “Our emissions from bushfires keep going up as a result of our failure to address climate change, creating the conditions for even worse fire seasons to come,” he said. Met Office research suggests a 2C rise in global temperatures is likely to lead to between 20 and 30 extra days of “very high” fire risk in south-western and eastern Australia each year. It found the area at risk of “extreme” fire danger conditions could increase by about 20m hectares, roughly the size of Victoria.",2020-12-21T17:21:20.083900Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:48:37.050360Z,934,119,,"The Prince of Wales has urged business and political leaders at Davos to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the climate crisis. In a special address at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Charles outlined a 10-point plan to help the global economy become more sustainable including the imposition of green taxes and investing in environmentally friendly technologies. He argued that taxes, regulations and policies could all be changed, as part of a drive to reverse environmentally damaging subsidies such as financial assistance for the fossil fuel industry. He also cited the “polluter pays” principle that requires those who create environmental damage to pay for the clean-up. “In order to secure our future and prosper, we need to evolve our economic model,” the Prince told an audience of politicians and business and civic leaders at Davos. “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance, when we could have done?” Charles, who is supported financially by the £1bn Duchy of Cornwall, made a direct challenge to some of the world’s wealthiest people gathered at the Swiss ski resort to think about more than money. “What good is all the extra wealth in the world gained from business as usual if you can do nothing with it except watch it burn in catastrophic conditions?” he said. Charles, who also met the climate activist Greta Thunberg at the summit, urged the private sector to use its ingenuity and practical skills to help lead the world out of a climate calamity. “The only limit is our willingness to act and the time to act is now.” Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  The prince was speaking after launching an initiative, the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council. His 10 proposals included the rapid decarbonisation of businesses, driving investment in new environmentally friendly technologies and helping consumers to make sustainable choices. Climate change, biodiversity loss and global warming are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced, he warned, adding that capital needs to be properly deployed in order to tackle these threats. The prince said global consumers could make markets sustainable, but could not make sustainable choices if these options were not clearly laid before them. Charles also warned that being socially and environmentally conscious cannot be an option for wealthier people only. Markets needed to change, so that prices actually reflected the environmental as well as economic costs. “If all the true costs are taken into account, being socially and environmentally responsible should be the least expensive option because it leaves the smallest footprint behind,” he argued, implicitly calling for subsidies and tax changes. Charles’s intervention comes nearly 30 years after he last spoke at the World Economic Forum, when he had already begun campaigning on environmental issues and corporate responsibility. He joked on Wednesday that it had been “an uphill struggle” trying to generate support but he believed the world was now at a turning point. The Prince of Wales arrived in an electric car – rather than the helicopter option favoured by some, such as Donald Trump. However, he reportedly travelled to Switzerland by private jet, a reminder of the gap between the goals outlined at the forum this week and the global elite’s behaviour. Environmental issues and the climate emergency have taken centre stage at Davos this year, with a stream of business leaders and politicians expressing concerns and signing up to initiatives to promote sustainability and climate action. But the meeting also exposed the split between the US and Europe on the issue, with Trump attacking “prophets of doom” in a speech heavily criticised by environmentalists. 1) Put nature and the protection of nature’s capital at the heart of operations. 2) Create responsible pathways to decarbonise to reach net zero, and for governments and businesses to set a clear plan for how they will decarbonise. 3) Reimagine industries through the lens of sustainable markets. 4) Identify game-changing technologies that can speed up the creation of a sustainable economy and eliminate barriers to change. 5) Remove subsidies that prevent the economy becoming more sustainable, and set taxes, policies and regulations in a way that catalyses sustainable markets. 6) Invest in science, technology, engineering and maths skills, and in research and development, to help bring emerging technologies to market. 7) Invest in nature as an economic driver of growth. 8) Agree unified metrics for measuring environmental, social and governance standards, to provide transparency to company’s supply chains. 9) Make it easier for consumers to see which products are ethical and sustainable. 10) Realign investing so it can support sustainability. This would direct trillions of pounds in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds into environmentally responsible projects that offer long-term value and rate of return.",2020-12-19T16:48:37.050394Z,1

Yes, climate change is real.
But what they don’t tell us is that in many places that change has gone in the opposite direction of what alarmists like to have us think.
Moreover, that change is obviously driven far more by natural causes, such as solar and oceanic cycles, and has very little to do with man-made CO2.
Today we look at the untampered temperature datasets of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) that go back to 1988 and which are mostly complete.
Here’s the plot of the 6 stations with adequate data:

Data: JMA
Five of the 6 stations show cooling or no upward trend. Earlier predictions of rapid warming are proving to be false.
Next is a plot of 8 stations using data from NASA, which show notable cooling trend over the past 25 years:

Deep blue Vermont says no to Big Wind
When it comes to wind energy, we’re seeing strong signals against it coming from Vermont, a state that is as politically blue, and thus pro-green, as any state could possibly be.
One would think that the Green Mountain State would welcome “clean”, renewable wind energy and happily make its contribution to rescuing the climate and environment. Vermont, after all, is home to Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben.
Ironically, Vermont’s strong environmental streak is backfiring on industrial wind. Vermont citizens are realizing industrial wind parks are not green after all, and aren’t worth defacing the rural landscape. Vermonters now more than ever want them the hell out.
For example, Windpower Engineering Development site here reports how Vermont’s political environment now “is hostile to wind energy”.
“In 2012, there were over a dozen wind projects in development. Now there are none. This is truly a sad state of affairs for Vermont,” stated David Blittersdorf, CEO and founder of AllEarth Renewables.
Large wind facilities banned
Meanwhile voters in the tiny Vermont village of Grafton have endorsed a new town plan that prohibits industrial and commercial wind, reports the Brattleboro Reformer here. “On a 95-66 vote during an all-day ballot Monday, residents approved the new town plan, which bans any large wind facility, and includes other planning updates.”
Also neighboring Windham has said “no” to industrial wind parks by developer Iberdrola, which has since “dropped its plans to build what would have been the largest wind project in the state of Vermont,” writes the Brattleboro Reformer.
Good to see Vermonters are finally waking up to the green energy madness and landscape blight and zero benefit it all leads to.

,2020-12-19T19:47:56.134534Z,937,119,,"Just because a country meets its emissions-reduction targets doesn’t mean it isn’t responsible for increased emissions elsewhere. This isn’t as weird as it sounds. The way national targets are calculated means some countries effectively “outsource” their emissions to other regions. If countries such as the UK don’t include the global emissions impact of their economy they run the risk of believing they are staving off climate change when they are not. Securing a “comprehensive, rules-based agreement” in Paris later this year is apparently one of the new UK government’s three priorities for energy and climate change – and this would no doubt include emissions targets. Such targets were also a key aspect of the previous coalition government’s intention to be the “greenest-ever”. It pledged to cut central government greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the first year and to push Europe to increase the EU emission-reduction target to 30% by 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions are usually considered in terms of those emitted within national boundaries; for example by cars and industries. These “territorial emissions” are the basis of national commitments and governments can influence them through taxes or regulations on emissions.  In the UK, the general trend is towards a reduction in these territorial emissions, though it’s tough to say exactly what has happened over the past three years as there is a bit of a lag before annual statistics can be reported. However, it is instructive to take a wider perspective. Rather than considering the emissions that occur within the UK’s borders, we could think in terms of the emissions that are given off in the process of providing the goods and services enjoyed by its citizens.  This “consumption-based” perspective looks at the whole life cycle of products consumed in a nation and reveals that supporting British lifestyles actually causes the emission of far more greenhouse gases than those emitted in the UK alone. This is because the UK’s imported goods require, on average, more greenhouse gases to be emitted during their production than the goods it exports. While goods and services are imported, emissions are effectively “outsourced” to other nations. This matters because greenhouse gas emissions have a global impact – the UK will be affected just as much by one tonne of carbon emitted in Shanghai as Sheffield. The UK has developed and signed up to a number of strategies and targets to reduce emissions, most notably the Climate Change Act which legally obliges an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However unless emissions are addressed on a global scale, we run the risk of frustrating the purpose of these strategies by shifting the burden from our shores to others. Looking at emissions based on consumption also gives us a clearer picture of which goods and services actually “drive” greenhouse gas pollution. It’s often not the processes directly responsible for the emissions. Steel, for example, requires lots of emissions to manufacture. But steel isn’t an end product – no one buys steel simply to own some metal. Rather demand for the alloy is driven by our demand for cars, white goods or buildings. This also applies to services; for example, the healthcare that we benefit from produces minimal emissions directly but relies on goods and services that result in far greater “upstream” emissions. We need to think in a more life cycle way in order to ensure we count impact effectively. This presents us with an opportunity. By reducing consumption of these goods and services and by making environmentally sound choices, we can have a far greater effect on global emissions. This can be seen clearly in the first chart above; between 2007 and 2009, the UK’s consumption-based emissions reduced far more dramatically than its territorial emissions have at any other time. This was, of course, due to the recession reducing imports of goods but these emissions remained at the lower level throughout 2010 and 2011. Reduced consumer confidence and deferrals in infrastructure investment will have played their part but the possibility of lower consumption-based emissions has been demonstrated and so there is the tantalising possibility of this lower emissions level persisting.  If so, this somewhat unintentional effect may turn out to be the most significant “green” achievement over this last government’s term. The challenge will be continuing this in the context of a stronger economy.",2020-12-19T19:47:56.134570Z,1

,2020-12-19T16:48:55.210000Z,940,119,,"Organizers in the youth climate movement plan an avalanche of activities beginning next week, determined to make the future of the climate the major issue of the 2020 election. Capitalizing on turnout in the September climate strikes, when 6 million people worldwide turned out to demand urgent action to address the escalating ecological emergency, young US organizers are making the leap from mobilization to demands. They’re planning widespread voter activation in the 2020 US presidential election as well as direct action targeting the fossil fuel industry and the banks and politicians that enable it.  “The headline message of the strikes in 2020 is: the kids are taking to the streets to strike for climate and they’re asking you to vote,” said Katie Eder, the executive director of Future Coalition, a communications and training hub for youth climate groups. There are more than 300 organizations involved in the efforts, Eder said, including some of the largest youth and adult coalitions in climate movement: Fridays for Future, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Zero Hour, Extinction Rebellion. “We’re starting to have the conversation within the strikes about how we’re balancing both the political targets and the financial targets,” Eder said, calling power and money “really key to the root causes of why we’re not addressing climate change”. Activists have planned widespread voter mobilization campaigns; three days of national strikes, marches, and direct action against politicians and banks beginning on Earth Day (22 April); regular strikes on Fridays and additional strikes targeting primary elections in every state; plus an international day of action, college divestment campaigns, and a huge push by the Sunrise Movement to turn out the vote for Bernie Sanders and a Green New Deal. Stories of climate awakening are a universal truth for young Americans living in the age of worsening climate conditions. Isabella Fallahi, who has asthma, for example, has lived within 14 miles of a coal-burning generating facility all of her life. “A lot of people don’t think of Indiana, or the midwest, for that matter, as frontline communities,” she said. “We face the silent killers. The terrible air quality because of mining projects, the terrible water quality because of mining projects, the health effects associated with both of those, droughts that cripple the agricultural economies that we’re based off of.” But Fallahi, like many other young organizers, is also galvanized by the tech proficiency of her generation, born into the era of hashtags and the ubiquitous touchscreen. She was a speaker at the UN climate change conference in Madrid (COP 25) in December 2019, when she and other youth were nearly ejected for protesting against the fossil fuel executives on panels and in negotiations. Approximately 200 young people in 40 countries, many of whom were at the conference, organized a response called Polluters Out. In 20 days, they had a website, a multilingual launch video, a press release in seven languages, and a list of demands. In actions set for March, they will call for the exclusion of fossil fuel interests at COP26 and transparency in the UN framework on climate change, as well as inclusion of indigenous and human rights in the Paris agreement. Regional efforts in the US will also call for a Green New Deal, a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure, divestments from fossil fuels by universities and campaign funds, and the targeting of specific banks for fossil fuel investments. The groups stay in touch through conference calls, Slack, Zoom, and Google Drive. Activists in Cuba – who can’t download the apps because of the US trade embargo – tune in through WhatsApp. There’s a Slack channel for supporting scientists, too. And meetings wait for organizers in the Amazon who need to travel to towns for internet access. For all of them, there is community. People to cry with over the photo of the bay in Australia, so covered in smoke that it is hardly visible. “Overall, I think the way to look at this perspective on the youth movement is: it is cohesive in that they do communicate, but the orgs are not all the same,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US Policy for 350.org and an adult mentor for Zero Hour, both organizations intensely focused on voter turnout for climate for 2020. “We want to make sure that climate becomes the number one issue on voters’ minds.” The Sunrise Movement, like 350.org and Zero Hour, has taken that to a grassroots level. That is how Naina Agrawal-Hardin ended up in the guidance office at Washtenaw high school outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an interview. She’s a leader for the Ann Arbor hub of the Sunrise Movement. And she’s 16, a junior. Her school, she said, was supportive. “Whenever I have to take conference calls or interviews during school hours, they usually will write me a pass to get out of class,” she said. Agrawal-Hardin is planning a watch party at her home – a sneak peek at the forthcoming documentary Generation Green New Deal and a video about the Sunrise Movement’s 2020 campaign, as part of its annual kickoff. Sunrise provides the documentaries, discussion questions, and near-daily training on organizing and recruitment techniques. When Agrawal-Hardin hosts her event on 29 January, she’ll be one of more than 2,000 hosts nationwide. Through 2020, the Sunrise Movement will similarly activate its 300 chapters in support of Bernie Sanders, leveraging 10,000 volunteers in most of the 50 states for door knocks, voting pledges and climate education. Sunrise endorsed Sanders as the best-positioned candidate to lead a Green New Deal and address income inequality. “By primary/caucus day in Iowa and New Hampshire, we are going to have over 20,000 young people who have signed pledges to vote for Green New Deal champions” in the two states, said Sofie Karasek, a Sunrise Movement spokesperson. “What we’re really expecting to see in 2020 is Young Green New Deal voters really become the margin of victory for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.”",2020-12-19T16:48:55.210034Z,1
,2020-12-19T13:46:14.389803Z,942,119,,"This year, more and more Australians are waking up to the need for change. Specifically, change on how we manage land and water to prepare for the fire season.  However, this change is not so simple. The logistics of such change are considerable, but they are not the biggest challenge. Instead, the biggest obstacles to creating change come in the form of those who profit from maintaining the system as it is, despite that system bringing little benefit to the country – either the people or the environment. The benefit this system brings is purely measured in terms of profit for the few and, in the eyes of the profiteers at least, far outweighs any and all other concerns. Waking up to a realisation that your political leaders may not actually have the best interests of the citizenry or the lands and waters we rely on at heart is a bitter pill for many to swallow. It can be hard to accept that their decisions are influenced more by lobby groups than by common sense or the greater good. Most Indigenous peoples are all too familiar with this reality, both in terms of promoting better management of land and water, and in dealing with the reality that governments do not have our best interests at heart. Some people have struggled to see a connection between Australia Day and the current concerns over Australia’s refusal to embrace climate change. The last Guardian article I wrote was met with countless people failing to understand how I could draw a connection to the colonial experiment that is Australia and the current situations that we find ourselves in. For me, however, they are intrinsically linked. For what single date better signifies all that is wrong with Australia than a country that blindly chooses to celebrate the worst of its own history? What date better paints a picture of a nation desperately clinging to an outdated colonial identity rather than embracing all that is special about the continent they now reside on and doing everything in its power to protect it? And indeed, what could be a better date to protest Australia’s inaction on climate change, inaction on Indigenous rights, inaction on putting the rights of the people in front of corporate interests? Despite conservative commentators wilfully pretending that opposition to Australia Day is solely about a date in the calendar, for at least the last 82 years since the first official Day of Mourning was held in Sydney, 26 January has provided a platform for Indigenous peoples to call for change. Be it in the form of self-determination, treaty, stopping Aboriginal deaths in custody, changing child removal practices, or any other number of issues. Australia Day protests, whether they are operating under the name of Invasion Day, Survival Day or Day of Mourning, have always been about highlighting injustice and rallying support to worthy causes. It is not simply a “White Australian v Indigenous peoples” issue, firstly because there’s lots of people living here who are neither, but also because there are millions of non-Indigenous people who support these calls for change and, to be fair to the other side, at least four Indigenous people who apparently want everything to stay how it is – probably more but conservative media only ever seem to bring out the same few for some reason. Change the Date has always been synonymous with Change the Nation, but as social media has brought this 80+ year-old debate into the mainstream, something seemed to have gotten lost in translation over the past few years, which is why many of us have abandoned the #Changethedate hashtag in favour of #Changethenation – to keep the conversation on track with what it has always been about. All that has changed this year with the fire season is that it has brought home, for many, the realities of a possible apocalyptic near-future for Australia if we do not change. Understanding how toxic patriotism has become in Australia is essential to this challenge. Patriotism that should be about a love of the land and people has become instead about a justification for bigotry and racism, about instilling hatred in the perceived “other”, and about providing a comfortable smokescreen for government looking after its own interests at the expense of the rest of us. That is why 26 January, the ultimate day for toxic patriotism, has always been the prefect day to call for change, to rally for support, to highlight problems and offer solutions, and to come together and grow the movement of those who want to change the nation for the better, because the only other option is to continue to blindly support the same course of action, the same way of thinking, that got us into this mess in the first place. Indigenous peoples are not the problem, but we may well be Australia’s best hope for a solution. • Luke Pearson is the founder of IndigenousX",2020-12-19T13:46:14.389836Z,1

Here it’s clear that German citizens are speaking loud and clear on the topic of climate protection: not so fast!
Rush to Green Deal without support
Lately the media and politicians have been pushing hard to start a fundamental change of society to a low-carb, de-industrialized organic garden society. For example, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen just announced a 1 TRILLION euro plan to decarbonate the continent.
Yet, public support for such an ambitious and adventurous transformation project appears to be rather soft at best in Germany.
According to Steingart:
Only 27 percent of Germans regard climate protection as a political priority. 73 percent have other concerns. Outside of the green voters (currently 23 percent in surveys), the alarmism of politicians (“climate emergency”) and scientists (“ecocide”) meets with discontent. The people want to say to the grand coalition government: Don’t throw the baby out with the bath.”
Greenland sets new record low
On another note, according to the Austrian www.wetter.at site, Greenland recorded a new all time record low temperature. The site reports:

While 2019 is the warmest year in Australia since records began, as the Office of Meteorology stated in its annual climate report, Greenland has set a new record for cold temperatures: minus 66 degrees C.”
Mother Nature tricks Europe
Meanwhile, parts of central Europe have been experiencing record warm January temperatures, and thus reinforce the collective public’s impression that the global climate is out of whack. It’s not.
How unfortunate that Mother Nature would play such a mean trick on Europe. Everywhere else it’s pretty much winter as usual:

Now European policymakers are going to have an easier time getting the public to accept the EU “Green Deal”. Boy, are they in for a cold awakening.

To officially say that we live in the Anthropocene – that is, declare the Holocene over and the Anthropocene already underway – we would have to draw an unequivocal line between the two. We’d have to agree on a point in time when human impacts on the environment became large enough to warrant an official change in scientific nomenclature. Some would assign it to the start of agriculture 11,000 years ago, while others tie it to the advent of the nuclear era in 1945, but most recognise the Anthropocene as beginning with the industrial revolution (1780s-1830s). However we now have evidence, from an ice core of the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru, of anthropogenic pollution of the South American atmosphere that precedes the industrial revolution by around 240 years. The discovery by my colleagues and I, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, underscores the difficulty in defining the onset of the Anthropocene. While we have plenty of information from around the world about pollution during the industrial period, pre-industrial pollution records are very rare. We have to look to special places on Earth where atmospheric chemicals would have been preserved chronologically, such as lake sediments or the accumulated snow on an ice cap. Quelccaya is one of those places. The largest ice sheet in the tropics is a fast-melting poster child for global warming. It’s also a perfect place to learn more about the past climate and environment – the ice core we drilled there in 2003 contained more than 1,200 years of accumulated atmospheric chemistry.  South America has a rich history of mining and metallurgy. We wondered, would the ice record evidence of ancient metallurgical activity? Air pollution would have to have existed on a truly continental scale to drift on the air from the heart of South American metallurgy in Bolivia across the Andes and onto Quelccaya, some 800 km away. It did. The story of South American metallurgy – from the rise of the Inca Empire to the Spanish conquest and even the industrial stagnation that followed the end of Spanish rule – is written in the ice. Like the native peoples before them, the Inca gathered metal ore from outcrops or exposed veins and smelted it in primitive wind-driven furnaces called huayra. The Quelccaya core first records evidence of pollution from Inca metallurgy around 1480 in the form of trace amounts of bismuth, likely released into the atmosphere during the creation of bismuth bronze, an alloy which has been recovered from the Inca citadel at Machu Picchu. Remarkably, no increases of other trace elements are apparent in the Quelccaya ice record during that period, indicating that the well-known metallurgic activities performed during the Inca reign had a negligible impact on the South American atmosphere. The Spanish conquistadors lead by Francisco Pizarro defeated the Incas in 1532, starting the colonial period of South America. Silver smelting quickly became the most important industrial activity on the continent, and the Spanish used imported and inefficient Castilian stone furnaces as well as thousands of local huayras as silver extraction spread across Bolivia and Peru. Increases in lead levels in the Quelccaya ice core date to approximately 1540 and document this initial phase of Spanish metallurgy. In 1572, the Spanish introduced a new technique called amalgamation, which allowed them to process even low-quality ores that contained much more lead than silver. This cold technique involved grinding the ore into powder, which could easily have become airborne. We believe this accounts for the sudden and dramatic spike in lead concentrations in the ice core starting around that time. Even the independence war of 1833, which marked the end of Spanish rule, is recorded in the ice. Elsewhere in the world, the industrial revolution was booming – and air pollution growing. But at Quelccaya, lead levels fell and remained low for years after the war, likely due to army destruction of mines in Bolivia and Peru and the post-war lack of infrastructure. The ice provides a detailed record of more than 1,000 years of South American history that can inform discussions of the Anthropocene timeline.  Did it spread out through South America with the trace bits of pollution from the Incas’ bismuth bronze? Or the lead concentrations from increased smelting upon the Spanish arrival? Or perhaps the more dramatic pollution created in the era of amalgamation marks the turning point.

By Die Kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)

A good six years ago, Potsdam climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf was outraged by the German Weather Service (DWD) at his at Klimalounge site.
The DWD had the audacity to contradict Mr. Rahmstorf. Specifically, it was about the presumed connection between the expansion of Arctic sea ice and cold winter weather. Rahmstorf’s simple model: Less Arctic sea ice causes cold European winters. At the time, he led a conglomeration of studies and claimed:
In my view, the above studies provide clear evidence of a link between Arctic ice loss due to global warming, and more frequent winter high pressures, particularly over the Atlantic-European part of the Arctic, and the associated influx of cold air into Europe. As we have often experienced it in recent winters – for example spectacularly in the first half of February 2012.”
In the process Rahmstorf became verbally wild and didn’t hold back dishing it out: The DWD was embarrassing, incompetent in questions of climate change, that it could not even read scientific papers, the arguments were flat. It was an unusually aggressive style of discussion that is seldom encountered in science. Rahmstorf original:
However, the taz quoted [German paper] yesterday the spokesman of the German Weather Service [DWD in German] as saying that if there was a direct relationship with the sea ice cover,  the entire winter would have to be very cold in Germany.  I think this trivial argument with which he would like to wipe from the table the climate research results shown above  is pretty embarrassing for the DWD.  Of course open water in the Arctic does not prevent stochastic weather variability. There will always be warm and cold periods. In all these studies it comes down to changing probabilities in the prevailing weather patterns: Petoukhov and Semenov estimate that the probability of cold winter extremes could triple, that is even in the Abstract. One wonders whether the DWD representative has read the relevant studies at all – and if not, why he feels the urge to comment on them in the media. Unfortunately, it has a certain tradition that meteorologists dealing with weather, are not familiar with climate science.”
More than half a decade has passed by since Rahmstorf’s rumblings. In the meantime, research has taken up the topic professionally and now has certainty: Rahmstorf was completely off the mark. Sea ice does not play a major role in the cold waves. Press release of the University of Exeter from August 12, 2019:

Arctic sea-ice loss has “minimal influence” on severe cold winter weather, research shows
The dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice through climate change has only a ‘minimal influence’ on severe cold winter weather across Asia and North America, new research has shown.
The possible connection between Arctic sea-ice loss and extreme cold weather – such as the deep freezes that can grip the USA in the winter months – has long been studied by scientists. Observations show that when the regional sea-ice cover is reduced, swathes of Asia and North America often experience unusually cold and hazardous winter conditions. However, previous climate modelling studies have suggested that reduced sea ice cannot fully explain the cold winters.
Now, a new study by experts from the University of Exeter, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the Energy and Sustainability Research Institute in Groningen, has shed new light on the link between sea-ice loss and cold winters. For the research, the international team combined observations over the past 40 years with results from sophisticated climate modelling experiments. They found that the observations and models agreed that reduced regional sea ice and cold winters often coincide which each other.
They found that the correlation between reduced sea ice and extreme winters across the mid-latitude occurs because both are simultaneously driven by the same, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Crucially, it shows that reduced sea ice only has a minimal influence on whether a harsh and severe winter will occur. The study is published in leading science journal, Nature Climate Change.
Dr Russell Blackport, a Mathematics Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and lead author of the paper said: ‘The correlation between reduced sea ice and cold winters does not mean one is causing the other. We show that the real cause is changes in atmospheric circulation which moves warm air into the Arctic and cold air into the mid-latitudes.’ Over recent decades, the Arctic region has experienced warming temperatures through climate change, which has led to a large decline in sea-ice cover. This reduction in sea-ice cover means that areas of open water increase, which in turn allows the ocean to lose more heat to the atmosphere in winter – this can potentially alter the weather and climate, even well outside the Arctic.
Recent studies have suggested that the reduced sea ice or Arctic warming has contributed to recent cold winters experienced in the mid-latitude region – and that as the sea-ice reduces further through climate change, cold winters will become more frequent and severe. Now, this new study suggests that reduced sea ice is not the main cause of the cold winters. Instead, the cold winters are likely caused by random fluctuations in the atmospheric circulation.
Professor James Screen, an Associate Professor in Climate Science at the University of Exeter said: ‘The are many reasons to be concerned about the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice, but an increased risk of severe winters in North America and Asia is not one of them.’ Dr John Fyfe, a Research Scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, who was not involved in the research, writes in Nature Climate Change: ‘Blackport and colleagues put to rest the notion that Arctic sea-ice loss caused the cold mid-latitude winters, showing instead that atmospheric circulation changes preceded, and then simultaneously drove sea-ice loss and mid-latitude cooling.’
Minimal influence of reduced Arctic sea ice on coincident cold winters in mid-latitudes by Russell Blackport, James Screen, Karin van der Wiel and Richard Bintanja is published in Nature Climate Change. It was funded through a grant by the Natural Environment Research Council.”

Rivers in particular are highly biologically diverse environments, home to a wide variety of plants, invertebrates and fish. But linked together within a river catchment, they are prone to invasion by alien species that can spread quickly between these interconnected habitats. Invasive alien plant species are of one of the biggest concerns to river environments. These contribute to the loss of native plants and invertebrates, as well as altering soil chemistry and impeding river flow. It costs the UK government around £1.7 billion to control invasive alien species and an estimated £6m alone to control the well-known troublesome Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica). Read more: Invasive plants have a much bigger impact than we imagine  Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) is an alien plant from the Himalayas introduced to Britain in 1839 by Victorian botanists, and is a prominent and familiar sight along UK waterways. Growing to up to a colossal four metres tall, this annual plant is a serious competitor to native British plants. Himalayan balsam is listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act in England and Wales which makes it an offence to plant or allow the species to grow in the wild. However, Himalayan balsam is so widespread it is increasingly challenging to tackle. Strategies for managing this species involve prevention (such as awareness campaigns and enforcing legislation to prohibit entry or spread), complete removal of the species (generally not feasible within river habitats due to their interconnected nature), and control (such pulling up individual Himalayan balsam plants prior to seeding). The most effective method of control so far, particularly for Japanese knotweed, is herbicide spraying. However, there are collateral risks to water quality and aquatic animals and plants from herbicide run-off when these plants are close to waterways. The classic signs of invasion by Himalayan balsam is a wall of vivid pink flowers and a sickly sweet smell along river banks. Most sites we have studied have been invaded for over ten years, but curiously often neighbour an almost completely green length of the same river bank. What is it about these uninvaded areas along a river that makes them immune to this alien species? If we can understand the conditions which promote or deter the pink wall, the information could be used to manage these Himalayan balsam populations. The local environment, as well as the native plant community, determines whether an invader can establish, and thereafter expand its population. Competition between plant species for resources such as space and light is brutal. It’s a battleground out there, and not all species can win. Common native plants, such as the stinging nettle, butterbur and canary reed grass, can be direct competitors of Himalayan balsam.  A study we conducted aimed to untangle the direct and indirect effects of the environment and competition on the abundance of Himalayan balsam along rivers. We surveyed sites along rivers across Scotland which varied in environmental conditions, such as the number of river flood events per year. These rivers also had areas along the bank that were heavily invaded by Himalayan balsam, close to an area which had more dominant native species and no invasion. Compared to native plants such as common reed grasses  that dominate lowland riverbanks, Himalayan balsam dislikes overly moist conditions. Instead this plant prefers drier, steeper riverbanks where it can compete more effectively with native plants. A river inundated by flood water is therefore not ideal habitat for this invader, but native dominant species accustomed to occasional waterlogging are less negatively affected. This knowledge provides us with vital information to manage Himalayan balsam indirectly, by manipulating conditions on riverbanks, such as making them less steep so that they retain more water, which Himalayan balsam dislikes. Unfortunately, river engineering practices often involve straightening and over deepening rivers. Combined with abstracting water for agriculture, this leads to drier riverbanks during the summer, which benefits Himalayan balsam. In contrast, the restoration of rivers often strives to create gently shelving riverbanks and a more sinuous channel. This means that water is retained, riverbanks are moister and native species are favoured at the expense of Himalayan balsam. In 2018 Britain experienced one of its hottest, driest summers. Changing climate is likely to provide conditions which enable invasive alien plants to thrive along rivers. Hence, managing species in light of their environmental preferences is so important. Our study showed that a large abundance of dominant native plant species are more able to resist invasion by Himalayan balsam. So there has never been a better time to embrace our native species, even a river bank favourite such as the humble stinging nettle.",2020-12-19T16:02:59.798982Z,1

German news site iwr.de here reports that the expansion of wind energy in Germany has “come the a stop” as the government has scaled back subsidies and enacted stricter permitting laws.
“As in April 2019, only nine new wind turbines went into operation nationwide in May,” IWR reported. “The year 2019 threatens to be a disaster for the wind industry in Germany.”
The IWR reported further: “In the first five months of 2019, only around 60 new onshore wind turbines went into operation nationwide. This is the result of an IWR evaluation of data from the market master data register of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA).”

At Twitter green energy activist Prof. Volker Quaschning called the collapse a “catastrophe”, tweeting that the expansion of wind power “collapsed completely”. He added that “it will be impossible to meet the CO2 reduction targets” and that 40,000 jobs in the wind industry are “on the brink”.

Others point to wind energy’s volatile power supply, cost, noise pollution, general ineffciency and danger to birds and ecosystems.

Using the modelled ice volume data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), we see June 15 volume trend has been flat since 2010:

Next we examine the fluctuating ice volume, going back to March 2006:

By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Have you noticed it too?
Over the last years it’s been climate change that is to blame for everything. Whether it’s storming outside or snowing, whether it’s not storming or not snowing, whether it’s thunderstorming with a lot of rain, or if it’s dry: everything is said to be climate change. What kind of weather would not show climate change? Any deviation from the mean is now a sign of climate change?
There are some who oppose this logic.
Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann is a shining example. On Twitter, he recently got peppered with accusations that he’s supplying the “climate deniers” with ammunition.
Carbon has made an immense contribution
This article could show the opposite because we too are convinced that mankind is changing the climate, and the use of coal, gas and oil in the entire value chain of industrial society has brought it about. On the other hand, mankind would not be where it is today without the positive effects of carbon in human nutrition, energy supply, mobility, poverty alleviation, the fight against disease with medicines and many other achievements that we owe to the combined efforts of generations before us.
And it will take some effort to get the effects of our actions under control by about 2100. Any earlier date for an Armageddon is fiction, serious science agrees.
Task for a century, not a legislative period
We would like to refer once again to what we derived in July 2017: How high can the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increase in order not to surpass the 2°C target: around 600 ppm? Assuming current (2017) 407 ppm CO2 and a current average growth of 2.11 ppm per year, the 600 ppm would be reached in 2108. Of course it would be necessary to reduce global CO2 emissions to near zero by the end of this century – a task for three global generations and not for three German legislative periods.
Desperate activists seizing upon every anomaly
Activists don’t see it that way. They announce the checkered flag will be waving for mankind in just 12 years.
But it’s difficult to justify this, so they try to take advantage of any weather. For example, it can get warm in Finland when the wind blows from the south in summer. This shouldn’t be surprising given the high solar radiation, but the activists now hype it up to turn the weather into climate.  It is quite easy to calculate how many days the daily maximum temperature there exceeded 26°C.

The number of days over all of Finland with a maximum temperature of over 26°C. Data source: E-OBS (KNMI)
It’s easy to see that warmth over Finland happens every now and then and that real conclusions cannot be drawn. There is no reason to panic about hot Finnish days.
No evidence of anthropogenic influence on cyclones
Another dubious claim that is often made is that climate change is causing more / stronger tropical storms such as hurricanes (in the Atlantic) and typhoons (in the Pacific). In recent years, we’ve seen a number of articles of this type whenever there’s been a tropical storm. A simple thermodynamic conclusion gets drawn: Warmer water contains more energy and makes storms worse.
Yet, a recent study by world-leading researchers on this topic makes it clear that it is not so easy. They find many uncertainties, and in particular that Atlantic hurricanes are not attributable to climate change, not even the associated extreme precipitation:
To date, there is no convincing evidence of a detectable anthropogenic influence on hurricane precipitation rates,…”
No trend in German precipitation
Since 2019 could be a rather active hurricane season, we have tobe prepared that climate change will be blamed by activists. But this conclusion, according to science, is not justified. It’s simple scaremongering! But we all know Greta Thunberg’s call: We want panic!
Also often reported: Forest fires in this country [Germany] are largely due to the “climate crisis”. Forest fires are the result of drought. Yet, it is not the heat that is to blame, but rather the lack of precipitation. And what about summer in Germany?

The DWD German Weather service notes: no trend has been found.
Why are they lying?
It was unusually dry last year, so yes there were more forest fires. All those who exploit a weather event for their agenda have to ask themselves: What kind of agenda is this for which you have to lie so much?

The list is compiled by non-profit group CDP which scores companies based on the environmental data they voluntarily disclose on its platform. Just 2% of the 8,000 companies it scores made the A-list, with Nestlé, Unilever, BT and Walmart among the 179 to make the cut. A focus on the climate emergency was not at the expense of business success, CDP said, with companies on the A-list also outperforming peers on the stock market by 5.5% a year. The company also has an F-list for companies that did not submit a response for climate change in 2019 – with Amazon and Facebook among the 9,225. Dexter Galvin, CDP’s global director of corporations and supply chains, said the A-list were “blazing a trail for others to follow”. He said: “Other companies should look to these leaders for inspiration and learn from them.” “The latest science says we need global emissions to urgently peak and start declining by 7.6% a year to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” continued Galvin. “Companies can and should become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.” With the financial performance of companies on the A-list better than their rivals, Galvin said this demonstrated that “leading on climate action is good business in today’s economy” and would be “essential business in tomorrow’s economy”. Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of its business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals. A-list companies scored highly because of their transparent and comprehensive disclosure of climate data. Examples of best practice include setting science-based targets, shifting to renewable energy and incentivising suppliers to reduce their emissions. Lego, for example, was praised for increasing its use of recycled materials and plant-based plastics; two years ago it started selling Lego pieces made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, has pledged to halve the amount of plastic packaging it uses over the next six years. H&M, the Swedish group that also owns & Other Stories and Cos brands, is aiming to have 100% recycled or sustainably sourced materials by 2030.

The show, Climate Change by Numbers, is all about the statistics at the heart of the effort to understand the scale and pace of human influence on our climate. Three mathematicians – Hannah Fry, Norman Fenton and David Spiegelhalter – explore the background to three numbers: BBC Four chief Cassian Harrison said the show “puts aside the politics to concentrate on the science”. Nice try, but no: science and politics can’t be separated on this or indeed any other topic where there are wide economic and social consequences, and a good dose of uncertainty.  But everyone involved in the programme is doing us a great service in reminding us that climate science ought to be allowed to be just interesting sometimes. And this kind of approach offers a far more sturdy basis for public conversation than tired insistence upon a monolithic scientific “consensus”. In an exemplary move for a TV show the team includes three academic consultants. Two of them, Tamsin Edwards from The Open University and Doug McNeall from the Met Office Hadley Centre, have long been very active on social media inviting people into an understanding of their work as unfolding and ambitious. Tamsin asks us to learn to love the uncertainty in climate science: We haven’t always sold the idea of uncertainty as not only inevitable but even exciting, and we’ve sometimes over-simplified our communication. That pause in warming of the atmosphere surprised the media and public, even though scientists always expected this kind of thing could happen in the short term. This fits nicely with my own argument that appears in a book of essays Culture and Climate Change: Narratives. As a social scientist and policy researcher with a particular interest and involvement in the media I’ve long been frustrated by the predominant tactics aimed at mobilising public concern. Phrases like “the science is finished” and “the greatest challenge facing humanity” have sought to enrol the public and politicians in a grand cause. But these approaches may alienate as many as they attract. It is far more robust to headline the natural science of climate change as a hugely ambitious risk assessment, the main contours of which have changed little since the early 1990s, and then explain that the rest of the research and policy effort is a big, messy risk management process. It is often forgotten that the IPCC’s First Assessment Report back in 1990 insisted “we are confident that … uncertainties can be reduced by further research. However, the complexity of the system means that we cannot rule out surprises.” Focusing on risk frees the natural science to become a lot more interesting on its own terms, enchanting even. Explaining it as a backroom risk assessment operation, and inviting everyone into that room now and again to follow progress will help to build trust and engagement in some of the most interesting, complex and difficult questions human beings have ever set themselves.  But the natural science is only one, albeit centrally important, part of the climate change story. In cultural terms, climate change is a difficult body of new knowledge that holds significance for all the challenges that humanity has always faced regarding shelter, comfort, food and mobility. In media terms, however, the topic often seems strangely disconnected from mainstream business, politics and everyday life.  Climate change is one of the strongest drivers of innovation in engineering and design, and is spurring radical new thinking in the arts, humanities and social sciences. It is catalysing major advances in lighting, mobility, communications, architecture, food and energy. It is also driving far-reaching and entirely novel conversations about where and how we redraw the boundaries of ethics and politics across time and space.  Not everyone is going to find all of this interesting. But slivers of these themes will be important to pretty much everyone. Giving full rein to the mad diversity of ideas set in motion by this difficult new knowledge helps to engage those people who are bored or alienated by an over-generalised and repetitive chorus of projected woe.",2020-12-19T16:45:25.962616Z,1

We are all used to the debate between states and markets, private vs public provision in shaping the direction of the energy sector; but communities, citizens and local authorities together can form a “civic” energy sector that could revolutionise the way we generate and use energy.  People in the UK are not well served by the current energy market. Investigations have found poor competition, a slow switch towards renewables, and the value in the system being captured by international companies, with very little economic benefit remaining at a local level.  But there is another way, identified by Realising Transition Pathways, a consortium of researchers from across nine UK universities. Existing community energy projects – run by groups of citizens – could link with new roles for local authorities as energy service companies to form a “civic” energy sector.  This civic sector would expand on the work of energy crowdfunding platforms such as Pure Leapfrog and mutual models such as Energy4All to provide new ways for ordinary citizens to invest in local energy resources.  The growth of a civic energy sector would be bad news for the large utilities. The UK’s traditional Big Six energy providers would lose ground in both the generation and supply markets and would need to shift their business models to provide new services. Civic energy would need some early support, but it could soon become the natural preference over what an increasingly outdated utilities sector is offering, having failed to anticipate the potential of local energy and what customers want from their energy providers. Distributed energy would need both technological and institutional change. It would require lots more small and medium scale renewables – more solar, onshore and offshore wind, biogas heat and power plants, and marine energy such as tidal generation. All of these new technologies would need to connect to much smarter distribution grids than we currently have and would require new ways of moving power from the bottom up as well as the top down.  However our work shows that local energy doesn’t mean energy independence; indeed in a civic energy future, interconnection between regions, across the UK and internationally would be critical to balance the system. This wouldn’t mean and end to big power plants, just far fewer of them. These connections would be aided by a smarter, more responsive electricity grid. This could mean a shift to tariffs based on when you use energy rather than how much you use. Consumers would have to be much more engaged. In order to develop a distributed energy system households and businesses would need to get serious about energy efficiency and be more responsive to smart meter data.  Local authorities will also be vital as, in a distributed network, consumers would likely get bills from their local authority energy company. These bills would be for services such as a “warm home” or “hot water” as opposed to the relatively crude system of just paying for energy by volume needed. The old system of paying for how much you use means big utilities can’t stomach a big fall in consumption, so why would they help you really reduce your bill?  If you were paying for “heat” and “light” rather than power by the unit, your energy supplier would want to to keep you warm and your house lit as cheaply as possible,  which means big investments in energy efficiency.  Local authorities are in a great place to do this as they are trusted far more than current utilities.  But of course not all local authorities have the same resources. The north-west of England is not as suited to solar as the south-east, for instance, and the mountainous north of Scotland can provide much more hydro-electricity than the flat farmland of the Fens.  In order to move to a distributed energy system, we would need to carefully plan for maximising energy resources in each region. Achieving this new type of energy system will be challenging – but it is possible.",2020-12-19T15:28:34.186171Z,1

Of course the West Side Highway is not underwater today.
Nor does it appear that there have been any detectable changes to its shoreline position since 1936.
In fact, outside the realm of popularized alarmism, it is well known that geological processes are more determinative of relative sea level changes than climate factors contributing to sea level rise or fall (i.e., glacier melt or advance).
Piecuch et al. (2018) concluded “the majority of large-scale spatial variation in long-term rates of relative sea-level rise on the US East Coast is due to geological processes that will persist at similar rates for centuries.”

Pfeffer and colleagues (2017) assessed 849 coastal sites and determined that geophysical processes, or vertical land motion (VLM) trends (ranging from −13 to +16 mm yr−1 ), “have been recognized as a dominant component of the total relative sea-level variations observed at coasts” at locations throughout the globe.

Image Source: Pfeffer et al., 2017
In a new paper, Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicate “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
The numbers are indeed “especially puzzling” for those immersed in sea-level-rise alarmism.
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.
The authors seek to provide a “plausible” explanation for this “enigmatic pattern” by suggesting “beach nourishment” (infrastructure development) may explain the tendencies for shorelines to grow as sea levels rise.
For those who do not ascribe to sea-level-rise alarmism, the recent reversal to shoreline accretion is not puzzling and needs no such “plausible” explanation.
Instead, these trends are consistent with a pattern of shoreline growth “all over the world” for the most recent decades.

Among a slew of other sacrifices, the program would force our prosperous society to replace diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles with electric vehicles and meat eating with vegetarianism. Liberty would be replaced by stifling government regulation.

The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains why the “Green New Deal” is neither green nor scientific, and needs to be rejected.
Lynne Balzer’s new book The Green New Deal And Climate Change – What You Need To Know explains how the climate science that’s driving the radical policy initiatives is flawed, fraught with outright scientific fraud and how all the proposed green initiatives are in fact anti-green because they would end up irreversibly ravaging our environment.
50 years of wrong predictions
This book details the 50-year history of climate change alarmism that began in the 1970’s with its dire warnings about global cooling caused by mankind and how that term changed first to “global warming” and then to “climate change” when the warming stopped.
None of the predictions, ten-year survival warnings or tipping points given during the past five decades has ever materialized.
Ms. Balzer, a schoolteacher from America’s heartland, presents compelling reasons why wind turbines, solar power and biofuels are not only impractical but would actually greatly damage the environment.  The book exposes the serious flaws in the science behind the entire manmade global warming scenario and the scientific impossibility that carbon dioxide, a trace gas, could be responsible for warming the planet.

Balzer explains how prominent climate scientists have been hiding data and attempting to destroy other scientists who disagreed with their claims.
The right antidote for the truant FFF school kids
The Green New Deal and Climate Change: What You Need to Know is essential reading for all voters and policy makers.
It’s also the ideal book for the FFF school-striking kids to read because it’s written by a schoolteacher in terms that are easily understood by laypersons.
Every responsible parent or grandparent needs to give this book to their children so that they will be able to view the climate issue critically, calmly, rationally and objectively.
Ms. Balzer’s book concludes that the energy “solutions” specified in the Green New Deal are neither green nor sustainable and that so-called renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power and biofuels, are not only impractical and economically devastating, but also very damaging to the environment.
The “Green New Deal” is one social engineering lesson we’d be far better off going without.

Routinely demonised as vandals and as a danger to other members of the public, they are often portrayed as an antisocial nuisance to be excluded by law or sometimes lured away to officially sanctioned skate parks. Skaters, being predominantly teenage lads, can seem like an alien and dangerous sub-species, scowling from beneath hoodies festooned with zombies, occult runes or lewd cartoons.  Yet the real trouble with skateboarding is that it challenges the dominant use of cities, which remain controlled by civic and corporate interests whose primary purpose is to run the place as a machine for consumption. Pesky skaters are at very least an unruly nuisance getting in the way of valued customers, or, worse still, are enjoying the cityscape for free, a specific symptom of a general teenaphobia. Iain Borden, the UCL professor whose ground-breaking book first brought the place of skaters in the city to attention recently suggested skating had achieved a more positive place in many cityscapes around the world, now recognised as a creative, challenging and healthy activity.  To an extent this is true. Skateboarding builds confidence and the social capital that can combat social exclusion, alcohol and drug abuse. The sport is becoming respectable with skateboarding designed into some spaces and superb new skate parks.  However civic respectability may not be part of the attraction.  Central to skateboarding is the sense of the skaters’ local scene, a heritage and culture that may be inscrutable to non-skaters. Skate culture is powerful social glue. Skaters will tell you that they can turn up in an unfamiliar city, skateboard in hand, and immediately be welcomed to join in with the locals.   Skateboarders’ bonds can also come as a surprise to city authorities. In the autumn of 2014 the city council in Norwich proposed a ban on skateboarding throughout the city centre. Norwich’s new skate park had been built, according to the council, on “the tacit understanding” that skaters would not use the city centre. On the evening of the council debate to herald the ban the public gallery of the town hall was packed with skaters, with more beside left outside unable to fit in following a demonstration and a public petition with more than 6,000 signatures.  The council withdrew its immediate plans for a ban although the possible use of a restriction, a Public Spaces Protection Order, has been mooted. This new PSPO legislation also threatened skaters in the town of Kettering, while more typical bans are also looming in Barking and Bristol. Iain Borden’s global optimism can seem a bit too sunny down at street level. Skaters are not out to cause conflict. They would much prefer to be left to their own devices, often out of sight and out of mind. While the ominous hoodies and garish logos may look like trouble, it is worth taking time to watch skaters using their favourite spots, as against the fleeting encounters on the high street.  Skate scenes are very sociable, with their own etiquette for taking turns, working out tricks for competitions and looking out for each other. The sport fuels creativity through photography, video and graphics. Skaters treasure and look after top spots, raising money to build ramps and blocks. The spots may not be theirs to own, but they are very good at colonising a city’s forlorn and forgotten corners.  In my city of Newcastle upon Tyne the top local site, the Wasteland, was an old factory floor – skated for more 20 years. “Our summer home” the skaters would say – and they visited it up until the very day when developers finally excavated the concrete, including the parting graffiti: “Farewell our fair weather friend”.  A new wasteland has been found, again a demolished factory site – and money has been raised from DIY skate competitions to build new ramps and blocks. Revealingly the same site is also features on a recent list of Tyneside’s top eyesores.  The skater’s eye sees the city differently. In Tyneside their other favourite site is across the river in Gateshead. Called Five Bridges it is a windswept plaza where pedestrian walkways converge under a vast and gloomy flyover. It is an unlovely space, but Gateshead Council put more than £11,000 into building skate ramps and jumps – a great deal of money to invest in entertaining unruly youths.   It did so after an elderly resident had told her councillor about the skaters who hung around on the plaza. Bracing himself for the usual complaints the councillor was surprised to hear that she liked it when the skaters were there because then it felt safe to walk through. So don’t think of skaters as hooligans and vandals. They are much more like a badly dressed version of the Boy Scouts, although the skaters I got to know through my research are not so keen on that cosy description. Maybe a better idea is like the elves in the fairy tale The Elves and the Shoemaker, a mysterious and often invisible presence busily making the city a better place to live.",2020-12-19T16:19:39.174449Z,1

A case for psychotherapy
In a recent paper dubbed “The Denial of the Apocalypse – Dealing with the Climate Crisis from the Perspective of Existential Psychotherapy” appearing in the German Das Psychotherapeutenjournal (The Psychotherapist Journal), author Fabian Chmielewski explains which “denial processes are effective and what the psychotherapists could and should concretely do about it”.
Panic over climate change is normal
According to Chmielewski, a psychologist with a practice in Hattingen, being in panic about the rapidly approaching climate apocalypse is in fact rational behavior, while having doubts and remaining calm about it is abnormal and thus needs to be addressed.
The journal’s editorial, written by Hans Schindler, comments that although Chmielewski’s paper is contentious, it is “a suitable impetus for the necessary debate about the socio-political responsibility of our professional group and for the discussion about the possibilities – and limits – of engagement in our roles as psychotherapists and citizens.”
Leading journal in Germany
Das Psychotherapeutenjournal is not just some crackpot publication that gets little attention in Germany, rather it is indeed the organ of the Bavarian State Chamber of Psychological Psychotherapists.
The journal is co-financed by the membership fees of the other German state chambers and sent throughout Germany. It is the central organ of a corporation under public law, which represents the profession of psychotherapists by law.
Concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’
The abstract of Fabian Chmielewski paper:
A broad consensus of serious research warns of the scenario of a soon inevitable spiral of man-made climate change. Nevertheless, both large sections of the population and decision-makers do not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it. The gloomy prophecies of climate scientists are played down or even denied, the necessary climate policy steps are not taken. The article looks at these phenomena from the perspective of existential psychotherapy and tries to point out possible causes and mechanisms of this repression as well as to derive concrete psychotherapeutic ‘interventions’. It also argues for the active participation of psychotherapists in health campaigns against this widespread “existential neurosis”.

Chmielewski claims that the “Fridays for Future” strikes and demonstrations are the clearest and most media-effective indication of the impending doomsday scenario, and calls for the implementation of the drastic climate policy measures demanded by science and that both doctors and psychologists warn of the health consequences of climate change and give it top priority. Here, he suggests, panic is the psychologically appropriate response.
Top human health priority
Chmielewski notes that at its annual general meeting, the Marburger Bund (association of physicians) demands: “Stopping climate change caused by humans and its consequences for human health must also be given absolute priority in health policy action”.
“Existential threat”
In the paper, Chmielewski writes that in recent times, various psychologists and psychotherapists have marked climate change as an “existential threat” (Psychologists for Future, 2019).
And when it comes to scientific dissent with regards to the upcoming climate doomsday, auditor Chmielewski writes that despite the scientific certainty of climate doomsday:
Nevertheless, important decision-makers are either completely denying man-made climate change or trivializing it and the urgency of the pressure to act. […] A large part of the population does not seem to be adequately interested in the impending destruction of the world as we know it and – as Brick and van der Linden (2018) put it – has only one lethargic “yawn” left for the apocalypse. Even more questionable seems to be the motivation of people to reject the human cause of climate change as a lie – sometimes with astonishing aggressiveness and with reference to untenable conspiracy theories.”
Suggesting compulsory hospitalization, medication
Also commenting on Chmielewski’s paper at the critical German achgut.com here, Air Tuerkis notes that generally therapists are rightly afraid to impose a certain point of view on people. But according to Chmielewski: “Exceptions are to be made, however, if an acute own or foreign endangerment is present”.
Tuerkis continues:
The concept of an ‘acute danger to oneself or others‘ is quite explosive here. It releases the therapist, for example, from the duty of confidentiality. The term normally aims at impending criminal offences that pose a danger to life and limb and above all a the danger of suicide. In Bavaria the legislator speaks of a danger to public safety to a considerable extent.”
A ‘considerable and acute danger to oneself or others’ is even sufficient as a reason for compulsory hospitalisation and compulsory medication. In this case, the patient could be admitted provisionally for up to 48 hours without a court order.”
In other words, back to the dark days days of Soviet-style punitive political psychiatry. Dissenters should be medicated into changing their views.

“Gigantic costs”
He told the Handelsblatt that the once highly praised “Energiewende” was “poorly implemented” and that the costs will be “gigantic”.
Image: Twitter.
“Germany, with its promotion of renewable energies, is a particularly deterrent example in this respect. Such mismanagement adds up to gigantic additional costs,” said Lomborg.
Great doubts concerning costs
The high profile  Danish economist also told the Handelsblatt that the goal of climate neutrality makes no economic sense, saying: “That is easy to say, but extremely difficult to implement. I have great doubts as to whether all these states will be able to answer the question of what it will cost in the end.”
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that bans would be counterproductive, and that consumers will simply spend the money they save by not flying on other CO2-causing products. “The only sure way to reduce CO2 emissions is to make people poor.”
Technology is the key
Lomborg says that he supports a CO2 tax over the short-term to reduce CO2 emissions but that that ultimately the only way will be through improved technology, and not political measures. “We need innovations to combat climate change. That must be our first priority. […] The key then is innovation.”

Citizens will rise up against bans
Lomborg says technical innovation is better than demanding people pay 16% of GDP on climate protection. “People don’t want that. They will then vote for politicians like Trump or Bolsonaro.”
Only one percent comes from wind and sun
When it comes to wind and sun as a supply of energy, Lomborg says that ultimately the huge costs will have to be correctly taken into account, and warns that they are far from being a cheap supply.
“You have to see the cost of the whole system. […] And we should not lose sight of the dimensions: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), one percent of global energy demand is currently covered by wind and sun, while the IEA estimates that it will be about four percent by 2040,” Lomborg told the Handelsblatt.
Going it alone, shifting emissions “crazy”
And the Danish economist warns against Europe going it alone on CO2 reductions. If it does, ” then the energy-intensive industry will disappear in the direction of the USA or Asia. It is crazy to drive the energy-intensive industry out of Europe and shift emissions to other regions of the world.”
Education and development
Lomborg also told the Handelsblatt that the best way to protect developing countries from climate change is to invest in their education and health care – so that they will be able to “get themselves out of sheet metal huts.” Storms wreak far greater damage on impoverished societies than on developed ones.
“If we lead people out of poverty, they will become less vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and to many other challenges. Yes, we must fight climate change, but we must do it intelligently,” said Lomborg

,2020-12-19T16:45:47.694157Z,975,119,,"Although many supporters of Donald Trump seemingly believe that global warming is a hoax, almost everyone else agrees that the climate emergency should be at the top of the list of important policy issues. Identifying the problem, however, is not much use unless we also identify the appropriate tools to address it. In my own field of specialisation, central bankers have caught climate-change fever. Under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, for example, both the International Monetary Fund and now the European Central Bank have declared the planet’s climate health to be “mission critical.”  To be sure, financial institutions must fundamentally rethink some things in the light of the climate crisis. For example, a bank or insurance company calculating risks to real-estate loans would make a serious mistake if it followed the standard methodology and plugged into its formulas the probability of a flood based on data from the past 100 years. Instead, it should take a forward-looking approach, which means using estimates of the increasingly elevated probability of such disasters. But central banks and international financial institutions simply lack the necessary tools to have first-, second-, or maybe even third-order effects on greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. So, what policy tools would have first-order effects? In the US, the “green new deal” signals commitment to the climate cause. But I fear that the legislative proposal that its congressional supporters have introduced will do more harm than good. It includes extraneous measures such as a federal jobs guarantee. This proposal creates a factual basis for a lie that US climate-change deniers have long been telling: that global warming is a hoax promoted as an excuse to expand the size of government. That is a sure-fire way to generate votes for Trump in November. Technological innovations in areas such as solar power certainly will play a big role in mitigation. But technology is not a policy. Subsidies are a policy. There is a case to be made that governments should subsidise research in climate science and relevant technologies. There is also a strong case that policymakers should allow free trade in solar panels, turbines and other equipment, to lower the cost of generating renewable energy at no cost to domestic taxpayers. But the policy that will move us closest to achieving global environmental targets, such as those in the Paris climate agreement, at relatively modest economic costs, is to raise the price of emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If, for example, solar power or other renewables can in fact meet most of our energy needs at a reasonable cost, then a high carbon price will encourage that result. And if some other technology or approach is needed, the carbon price will reveal that as well. The price of carbon can be raised via one of two policies: a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, that is, a system of quantitative emission limits with tradable emission permits. In theory, the two approaches are equivalent: the quantity of carbon permits is calculated carefully, so that the resulting price when they are traded is the same as the price that would be achieved by the tax. In the real world, however, there are significant differences between regulating prices and quantities. The most important differences relate to uncertainty and political economy. For starters, it would be great if policymakers could commit to a century-long rising path for the carbon price. People could then plan far ahead. Firms would know with certainty the penalty for building long-lasting coal-fired power plants. But, even assuming a miraculous burst of multilateral cooperation, today’s leaders cannot bind their successors 50 years into the future, which rules out precise certainty about the future price or quantity of GHG emissions. What is critical, though, is quickly to establish the expectation that the price of carbon will follow a generally rising path in the future. To achieve this, governments must start increasing the price today; lofty statements from public officials and optimal calculations from climate modellers will not do the job. Predicting political economy, meanwhile, is extremely difficult. In the climate-change arena, everything is judged to be “politically impossible,” and was even before Trump. Even so, at the global level governments are probably more likely to agree to quantitative emission targets – as in the 1997 Kyoto protocol and the 2015 Paris accord – than to a global carbon tax, which would be considered too severe an invasion of sovereignty. When it comes to the national implementation of any global effort to limit CO2 emissions, however, I lean toward a carbon tax over tradable emission permits. Previous attempts to introduce emission permits, such as the EU’s emissions trading system, have revealed a tendency to mollify industry by issuing more permits than originally intended and giving too many to legacy firms. The logic of doing so is to “make them whole,” but this can result in windfall gains when the firms sell the permits. In any case, putting the price of carbon on an upward path, whether via a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, is the right tool for the job. Obviously, no single citizen can expect to solve the problem of climate change alone. But whereas some individual actions are mainly symbolic, others can have an effect that is at least proportionate to the number of citizens undertaking them. For frustrated young people, one piece of advice is clear: while going to a Greta Thunberg-inspired demonstration is fine, registering and voting is critical. If Americans aged 18-24 were to turn out and vote in the same proportions as older age groups, Trump would almost certainly not be re-elected. With Trump gone, the US could rejoin the Paris agreement and adopt effective measures to combat global warming – and other governments would lose an excuse they currently have to delay action. • Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

,2020-12-19T15:29:39.406205Z,978,119,,"As bushfires raged across Australia’s south-east, Scott Morrison responded to questions about the climate crisis by stressing the nation-state’s weakness, not its power. Australia produces just 1.3% of global emissions, he said, and it wasn’t credible to suggest that “doing something more or less” would change a worldwide phenomenon.  Yes, he did insist his government was acting. We were, he said, “doing our bit” and “carrying our weight”. Those are lines with which you might dismiss an overzealous charity panhandler: “I’ve already given, thank you!” They’re a response to a tiresome obligation. They’re not a promise of solutions. Morrison has not said that temperatures will stabilise and the climate emergency will be averted. How could he? The only international mechanism currently in place stems from the Paris accords, the agreement by which the nations of the world pledged to keep global temperature rises below 2C. But Paris is palpably failing. None of the major powers will meet their targets – and no other plan exists. In democratic theory, the modern state legitimates itself through a simple bargain: we pay its taxes and obey its law. In return, it protects us and keeps us safe. The increasing inability of states to keep that pact in respect of climate will only become more obvious, exacerbating an already widespread cynicism about the political class. Paradoxically, a growing perception of state impotence will almost certainly be accompanied by ever more aggressive demonstrations of state power. In Australia, Morrison’s supporters talk about fuel loads and arson. In part, the pivot away from climate represents a simple bait and switch. After the world recorded its second-hottest year ever, conversations about hazard reduction help drown out conversations about climate. But the new focus also shifts the debate in a direction the government likes. If environmental bureaucracy had prevented hazard reduction (it didn’t), the answer lies in slashing green tape, an easy extension of an already existing ideological commitment to deregulation. More importantly, the identification of (a largely bogus) arson outbreak transforms an ecological crisis into a law and order problem, paving the way for new legislation and fresh penalties. And that’s something the state can deliver. Think of Morrison’s almost instant response to the needles-in-the-strawberry affair. Decrying fruit saboteurs as “cowards” and “grubs”, the prime minister introduced harsh new laws that would send them to jail for as long as 15 years. More police powers and increased sentences play to the strengths of what Nietzsche called “the cold monster”, allowing the leaders who announce them to sound stern and authoritative. Accordingly, in Australia in 2019, politicians spent more time discussing how best to punish environmental protesters than they did devising legislation that might protect the climate. Peter Dutton, for instance, called for activists to be “shamed”, jailed and cut off welfare. “These people are anarchists and fringe-dwellers and they should face the full force of the law,” he said. No government minister used similar rhetoric about carbon polluters. Similarly, in Queensland, the Labor premier Annastacia Palaszczuk almost certainly can’t deliver the jobs that rural supporters of Adani think the Carmichael coalmine will bring them (the employment promises keep shifting) and nor can she save the Great Barrier Reef (since that would entail stopping climate change). She can, however, rush through Joh-era style laws to jail Extinction Rebellion members. The state, by definition, possesses a monopoly on coercion. As a result, politicians incapable of any real policy agenda know they still unleash force. As Morrison himself says, the core responsibility of a prime minister is to “keep Australians safe”. If the 2019-2020 fire season really does foreshadow the new normal on a warming planet, governments face a looming crisis of legitimacy, precisely because there’s nothing safe about a country in flames. We’re likely, then, to see politicians asserting authority in an all too traditional way, with an increasing resort to the rhetoric of national security. As I have argued previously, it’s not difficult to imagine what Morrison’s slogans of “resilience and adaption” might mean in the context of, say, climate refugees. For decades, we’ve seen asylum seekers used as targets whenever a weak leader wants to look tough. Global heating will make future governments seem extraordinarily weak – even as a huge new wave of refugees arrives. In the midst of a genuine emergency, with the army already on the streets, the likely conjunction of climate and border politics does not bear thinking about. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",2020-12-19T15:29:39.406238Z,1

,2020-12-19T16:46:51.097002Z,981,120,,"Catching a glimpse of the northern lights is apparently the top experience for Britons compiling a “bucket list” of must-do experiences before they die. It’s not surprising, the aurora borealis is a breathtakingly beautiful natural phenomenon, but one that is seldom seen from the British Isles. Nevertheless, on the morning of March 18, the British press were reporting a brilliant display of the northern lights the previous night.  Social media was overflowing with photographic evidence of a display stretching from Scotland to Somerset.  But what had brought the lights to the UK that night? The story begins in the early hours of March 15, when a magnetically active region of the Sun’s surface crackled and erupted, hurling billions of tonnes of the solar atmosphere out into the solar system.  Unless you have a keen interest in our local star, you were probably unaware this had happened.  It didn’t make the news.  But for scientists studying how solar activity affects the space environment surrounding our planet, it was the start of an interesting couple of days. Within hours, the trajectory of this magnetised outpouring of subatomic particles had been modelled.  The cloud, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), was heading in our direction at about one million miles an hour.  It looked like it would deliver a glancing blow to planet Earth some time on March 17, but what would happen if it did?  Space weather forecasters the world over set to work. A likely outcome in this scenario is that the arrival of the CME will trigger a geomagnetic storm.  This occurs when the magnetic field within the CME couples with the Earth’s magnetic field, allowing energy and matter to transfer from the CME to the near-Earth space environment.   The most obvious symptom of a geomagnetic storm is more intense aurora borealis due to the increased inflow of electrically-charged particles to the Earth’s upper atmosphere.  But less attractive side-effects include disruption to hi-tech navigation and communications systems, and the risk of damage to satellites and power grids.  Space weather forecasting, while still in its infancy, is a serious business. By March 16, forecasters at the US Space Weather Prediction Center were predicting the CME would trigger a geomagnetic storm in the days that followed.  Then, at around 4am UK time on March 17, it engulfed NASA’s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, the space weather monitor that constantly samples the solar wind upstream of the Earth.   For the first time since it left the Sun, it was possible to measure the orientation of the magnetic field inside the CME.  The orientation of this field, the remnants of the Sun’s magnetic field torn away when the CME was launched, is crucial. It controls the coupling between the CME and the Earth’s own magnetic field.  Although it can take almost any orientation, if the field inside the CME points southwards, it will oppose the Earth’s magnetic field (which, as any compass shows, points north) and these opposite polarity fields interact strongly.  If the CME’s field points northward, the interaction is much weaker. The satellite revealed that the field inside the incoming CME was strong, and as it streamed past the Earth over the course of the morning, it fluctuated between northward and southward orientations, triggering mild geomagnetic disturbances.  Then around noon, the CME’s magnetic field turned southward and stayed southward for the next 12 hours. The strong and sustained coupling poured energy into the magnetosphere, the region of space normally dominated by the Earth’s magnetic field, triggering the strongest and longest geomagnetic storm of the Sun’s current 11-year cycle of activity. Excited aurora-spotters all over the globe weren’t disappointed.  As night fell, the northern lights, and their southern counterpart the aurora australis, lit the skies with dancing displays of green and red light.  Normally concentrated in ring-like ovals that circle our planet’s magnetic poles, the auroral zones expanded equatorward, pushing auroral displays as far south as Kansas and Virginia in the northern hemisphere, and as far north as New Zealand and Australia.  In the UK, those hoping to see the aurora were battling a blanket of mist and fog that settled across much of the country, but many of those with clear a view of the sky reported sightings of the northern lights. Although the biggest geomagnetic storm of the current solar cycle, this St. Patrick’s Day storm was not a once-in-a-lifetime space weather event.  Mid-latitude aurora sightings are rare, but typically occur a handful of times in each 11-year solar cycle.  The current solar maximum is not as intense as the previous peak in 2003 and the frequency and severity of geomagnetic storms has been lower.  Over the coming days, high-tech infrastructure operators will look at how their systems responded to the storm, but the early indications are that there were no significant problems. So if this wasn’t a unique event, why did it make the headlines? One reason why public interest in the northern lights has increased since the previous solar cycle is the advent of social media and mobile technology.  Now anyone can sign up to space weather alerts and have warnings of solar flares, CME eruptions or geomagnetic activity delivered to the phone in near real-time.  Hopeful aurora spotters can find out what others in their country or region are seeing and interact with them easily, most commonly by using the #aurora hashtag. Lancaster University’s AuroraWatchUK service is Britain’s most popular aurora alerting system and uses real-time magnetic field measurements from across the UK to sense the geomagnetic disturbances associated with the northern lights. Social media channels now mean our alerts can reach huge numbers, improving the odds of people seeing the aurora from their back garden.  During the St. Patrick’s Day storm, our social media posts reached more than 200,000 people, with thousands of shares and retweets. For UK-based aurora-spotters, geographic location, weather and light pollution are not ideal.  But if you want to tip the odds slightly in your favour, as well as looking up, you should really think about looking at your phone.",2020-12-19T16:46:51.097035Z,1

,2020-12-19T15:30:06.558400Z,984,120,,"Wheat has been found in a settlement on England’s south coast dating back to 6000BC – 2000 years before farming reached Britain. This finding overturns many cherished archaeological beliefs – or myths – about the era. Though they were once patronised as simplistic hunter-gatherers, it turns out early Britons must have been active traders with the agricultural superpowers of their day in France and the Balkans. It’s time to reassess Mesolithic man. The introduction of farming is usually regarded as a defining historic moment for  human societies. Agriculture creates the conditions for permanent settlement, urbanisation and complex societies.  The positive impact and significance of farming, starting during the period known as the Neolithic, is often contrasted harshly with preceding hunter gatherer cultures. These societies, associated with a period entitled the Mesolithic in Britain (c. 10,000-4000 BC), were relatively mobile and the passage of time has been unforgiving in respect of the survival of their material culture.  This has meant a tendency to presume the peoples of pre-farming Britain were socially simple and geographically isolated. The recent TV show 10,000 BC, which approximates this period, perpetuates the view that life at this time was simply “nasty, brutish and short” with little for people to do other than eat hazelnuts as they waited patiently for wiser peoples from the East to arrive along with the lifestyle benefits of the new technology – farming. Yet Mesolithic societies were as complex as any other. For instance, the earliest built ritual monuments in Britain, usually associated with farming societies, emerged as early as 9000BC near Stonehenge and one structure in Scotland may represent a calendrical device nearly 5000 years older than the first historical calendars.  The first permanent homes and domestication of animals including the dog also occurred before the introduction of farming.  Yet, the use of grain and specifically wheat, remained essentially absent and a key indicator of farming in regions far from south west Asia, where grain was domesticated 12000 years ago.  Consequently, a debate continues as to whether farming was introduced following colonisation by groups already practising agriculture or the new technology was adopted by indigenous hunter gatherer populations. Was farming a movement of people or ideas? Farming is thought to have been introduced to Britain in around 4000BC, perhaps held back by the island’s new isolation following sea level rises at the end of the ice age. The same processes, however, also provide an opportunity to preserve evidence and Britain’s continental shelf has exceptional archaeological potential.  To investigate whether early traces of farming might be preserved in sediments on the sea bed, we gathered a team from the Universities of Birmingham, Bradford and Warwick, together with the Maritime Archaeology Trust. Our results, just published in the journal Science, suggest that grain, rather than indicating the onset of farming, was actually present in Mesolithic settlements in Britain 2000 years before local agriculture. We found evidence of grain after analysing DNA recovered from the uniquely preserved Bouldnor Cliff off the south coast of Britain. In the past ancient DNA has most commonly been obtained from anatomically intact material, such as hair, bones and teeth. It has only recently become clear that DNA can also be retrieved from other materials, including sediments, or SedaDNA – a discovery which has the potential to revolutionise the field.   The sedaDNA sequences at Bouldnor Cliff suggested a mixed habitat of oak forest and herbaceous plants, much as we would expect.  We found traces of animals that could indicate human activity – lots of dogs, for instance, and aurochs (ancestors of the modern cow), as well as deer, grouse and rodents. However, in later sediments, dated to 6000 BC, the results revealed the presence of Einkorn wheat. This was 2000 years earlier than expected and at a time when the cutting edge of agriculture may have lain in the northern Balkans or possibly on the Mediterranean coast of France. What does this mean? In the absence of direct evidence for cultivation, it seems likely that wheat was imported rather than grown locally. If so the implications are considerable.   The presence of wheat suggests the existence of a web of social networks stretching between Mesolithic Britain and the advancing Neolithic front far to the south and east. Far from being simple or isolated, the Mesolithic peoples of southern Britain were probably engaged in trading or gifting exotic foodstuffs across much of continental Europe – it seems absolutely unreasonable to imply that hunter gatherer groups were passive recipients in such an exchange. The results also indicate that key historical events, including the arrival of people in the Americas and agricultural development of Southeast Asia, may also be best explored through investigating the extensive land masses that were lost to the seas as a consequence of global warming.  The results of the work at Bouldnor Cliff now suggests that that such landscapes also retain caches of genetic material that may not be preserved or even represented on land. If so the analysis of marine sediments may be an archaeological “game-changer”.",2020-12-19T15:30:06.558433Z,1

By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2018, we reported on a paper that derived the sensitivity of our climate system with the best data available. Lewis/Curry (2018) reached the result: 1.3 °C for doubling of the CO2 in the atmosphere with a rise (Transient Climate Response), long-term equilibrium (ECS) of 1.7 °C (see Table 3 of the paper).
The numbers hardly react sensitively to the choice of (larger) time windows, they fluctuate very little, whether one evaluates 1870…2016 or 1930…2016. There has been a whole series of precursor studies also from other authors who also arrived near these quite small values. Also papers examining historical periods (last glacial maximum to pre-industrial) do not contradict these low figures.
So the much more dramatic sensitivity estimates, especially from GCM model considerations (for General Circulation Models), — 1.86 °C for TCR and 3°C for ECS — are not applicable? “It’s not that simple,” some activists insist because then the low sensitivity of the Earth’s climate would not necessitate urgent action to reduce greenhouse gases.
So how can we save the GCMs from empiricism with their worrisome projections? A key argument so far is this: models predict a different spatial distribution of ocean warming than what we observe:

 

Fig.3: The warming patterns derived by models (top) and the observed patterns. Of particular importance is the fact that the CMIP5 models indicate a rather uniform warming of the tropical Pacific as a result of the (mainly man-made) forcing (hence the model-mean), but the observations show a significantly stronger warming of the western tropical Pacific compared to the eastern one.  The images were generated with the KNMI Climate Explorer.
So it could well be, activists say, that the deviation are just a “whim of nature”, an internal variability, and after the end of this rather random episode, the warming becomes much stronger on a global scale on accordance to the models. There is talk of “trajectories” which were and will be possible, and the observations strongly deviate negatively because they are a random one of the possible warming patterns. In short: “What we have observed so far is not the real reality, but it will certainly get much worse. Believe the climate models!”
2 new papers
Here we present two current papers that provide explanation. To start: The observations of the warming rate are correct, the deviating patterns of the climate models are caused by their inadequacies and these patterns will not change.
In Dong et al (2019), the authors show that if the convective regions with many clouds in the western Pacific warm up more strongly than those with hardly any convection in the eastern Pacific, the overall global warming is much less pronounced.
Let’s take a look at the clouds in the tropical Pacific:

Fig. 4: The convection(CAPE Index) over the tropical Pacific. The west-east gradient can be seen clearly. Source.
Convection in the western tropical Pacific leads to an increased heat radiation into space, which means that the warming there can be reduced much more effectively than would be possible with a stronger warming of the eastern Pacific with less convection, see Fig. 4.
The paper finds:
For the west Pacific patch, warming is communicated to the upper troposphere, which warms the whole troposphere across all latitudes, causing a large increase in outgoing radiation at the TOA. Furthermore, the patch of warming locally decreases tropospheric stability, measured here as estimated inversion strength (EIS), but increases EIS remotely over tropical marine low clouds regions, yielding an increase in global low cloud cover (LCC) which enhances the global SW reflection….The results first highlight the radiative response to surface warming in tropical ascent regions as the dominant control of global TOA radiation change both in the past and in the future. …This surface warming pattern yields a strong global outgoing radiative response at TOA that can efficiently damp the surface heating, therefore producing a very negative global feedback.”
It is therefore a clear physical mechanism that leads to the observed stronger warming of the tropical West Pacific leading to lower global sensitivities (= stronger negative global feedback).
The second paper, Seager et al (2019), deals with the same phenomenon and concludes that the observed pattern is not random, but a direct result of forcing. It states:
The main features of observed tropical Pacific climate change over past decades are consistent with a response to rising CO2, according to fundamental atmosphere and ocean physics….However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias (ein Streifen kühleren Wassers in Äquatornähe des Ostpazifiks, d.A.), misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2.”
Climate models have such large deficits in the depiction of events in the tropical Pacific that they are globally incorrect in determining the response to the forcing (see Fig. 3) and systematically overestimate the sensitivity to the forcing (according to Seager et al, and Dong et al).
So will we read anything about this in the media? A possible headline might be: “Climate models calculate the future too hot! Don’t hold your breath.
PlayStation climatology
We eagerly await to see whether the results of these two important studies will even be included in the IPCC’s forthcoming progress report. Here hundreds of pages dealing with model projections would have to be critically revised. One more reason for us to trust empiricism and “PlayStation climatology”.
But what is to become of the “panic” which Fridays for Future wishes to impose on us? Policymaking is hot because the models are too hot. Which scientists have the courage to be responsible and to enlighten FFF and policymaking?

Whenever NASA GISS announces how recent global temperatures are much hotter than, for example, 100 years ago, just how statistically reliable are such statements?
Most will agree, based mainly on sundry observations, that today is indeed warmer than it was when surface temperatures began to be recorded back in 1880. But we will never really know by how much.
Surface station datasets full of gigantic voids
When we look at NASA GISS’s site here, we can see how many surface stations have data going back to earlier years. Today we see that 2089 stations are at work in Version 3 unadjusted data.
Yet, when we go back 100 years (to 1919), we see only 997 of these surface stations have Version 3 unadjusted data that is complete:


Source: NASA GISS
Note how the Version 3 unadjusted datasets going back to 1919 are poorly distributed and sorrowfully lacking over Africa, Canada, the Arctic and all across the Southern Hemisphere. Never mind the oceans.
Only a measly 174 surface stations go back to 1880!
And when we look at the number of stations in Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880, ONLY 174 stations actually provide us with a complete thermometer dataset:
giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data_v3/ …

As is shown, Version 3 unadjusted data going back to 1880 covers only some parts of the US and Europe. All of Canada and Russia are void of data, and so it is impossible to know what the temperatures there really was.
The same is true for the entire southern hemisphere, let alone the entire globe. The bottom line: There is no way of knowing what the global temperature really was back in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Japanese expert: data of “no scientific value”
This tells us that global temperature trends since the start of the Industrial Revolutions presented by NASA are fraught with huge uncertainty.
“This is nothing new,” says Japanese climate expert Dr. Mototaka Nakamura in an email to NTZ. “We simply did not have many observing stations in the 1800s and early 1900s. They can produce ‘new data sets’ and claim that they have ‘better data sets’ all day long, but they just can’t make any meaningful difference for periods up to 1980.”
“Not real data”
“These datasets are products of simulation models and data assimilation software, not real data,” Dr. Nakamura added. “This problem has been present in data products produced by all institutions from the beginning – NASA, NOAA, NCEP, ECMWF, UMet, etc.”
“Spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with”
But the data shortcomings get even worse. Dr. Nakamura wrote: “A far more serious issue with calculating ‘the global mean surface temperature trend’ is the acute spatial bias in the observation stations. There is nothing they can do about this either.  No matter what they do with the simulation models and data assimilation programs, this spatial bias before 1980 cannot be dealt with in any meaningful way. Just look at the locations of the observation stations used in GISS products for various years on their page.”
Dr. Nakamura commented earlier here at NTZ: “The global surface mean temperature change data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to the public.”
So how can we be sure about the globe’s temperatures, and thus it’s trends before 1980? You can’t. The real data just aren’t there.

The study found that for Vietnam “none of the meteorological trends such as frequency, central pressure, wind speed, or storm intensity show any significant increase or decrease over the last four decades.”
But such a trend is not only seen for Vietnam, but virtually the entire Pacific. For example Japanese climate blogger Kirye compiled the stats on Japan typhoon landfalls and here we see they have not risen significantly, and the number of typhoons formed has even fallen:

Number of typhoons formed: jma . Number of typhoons landings in Japan: jma
At his latest Saturday Summary, meteorologist Joe Bastardi shows that this year’s hurricane season is off to a slow start as conditions in the main development zone will remain unfavorable for at least another week.
All of this tells us that global warming alarmists’ warnings of more frequent and intense storms have been completely WRONG so far.

Now new research suggests that rabbits will be particularly hard hit as climatic changes alter their habitat over the coming decades. Rabbits, hares and pikas could become this century’s new climate migrants – with up to two-thirds of species forced to relocate. There are almost certainly going to be extinctions among some of the more sensitive and less adaptable species.   Rabbits and their relatives hares (referred to in North America as jackrabbits) and the lesser known pikas belong to a group of mammals known as lagomorphs – of which there are 87 species worldwide.  Lagomorphs are particularly interesting to ecologists – and those of my colleagues who work in Global Food Security – as they are a major human food resource, valued game species, agricultural pests, model lab animals and key elements in food webs.  You can find rabbits, hares and pikas almost everywhere, across a huge range of environmental conditions. They’re native to all continents except Antarctica, found from the equator to the Arctic, and from sea level to the very top of the Himalayas.  A quarter of lagomorphs are already listed as threatened, and 13 species are endangered or critically endangered. We were particularly interested in how predicted changes in climate would affect this already highly vulnerable group. In our study, colleagues from Queen’s University Belfast and I collated all known records of lagomorph species worldwide. Environmental conditions such as temperature or rainfall were correlated with the sites where each species occurred to establish the suitable habitat within which each can persist. Widely accepted climate models of projected future conditions were then used to extrapolate how suitable habitat would change. The results, published in the open access scientific journal PLOS ONE suggest that two-thirds of all lagomorph species will be affected. Rabbits, hares and jackrabbits are likely to shift towards the poles with little change in the total size of their range – the geographical area in which the species can be found.  Pikas meanwhile, are likely to shift to ever higher altitudes as the lower slopes warm up leading to huge range declines. This is likely to lead to the extinction of some such as Kozlov’s Pika Ochotona koslowi, a mysterious species unique to China.  Of course the animals won’t just remain still while the climate changes around them – moving towards the poles or to higher ground is a standard strategy to track shifts in suitable habitat. Rabbits, hares and jackrabbits can move long distances and can potentially move to cooler conditions without losing too much of their range; the effects of such shifts on ecosystems are largely unknown but likely to cause significant disruption.  The smaller and less bouncy pikas won’t be so lucky. Pikas inhabit generally cooler conditions in the high mountains of the Himalayas or Rockies and will be driven further upwards until no suitable habitat remains. My colleague Neil Reid, a conservation biologist and lagomorph expert at Queen’s, points out that “they will likely be pushed off the top of the mountains, literally, with total extinction the most probable outcome”. Species traits can be useful indicators of potential responses to climate change, yet have rarely been linked to changes in distributions. Smaller-bodied species were more likely to exhibit range contractions and shifts to higher ground, but species capable of having large numbers of offspring were more likely to shift towards the poles.   The effect of climate change on lagomorphs is predicted to be so substantial that almost a third of the Earth’s land area (31.5 million km2) will lose at least one species by 2100. It is predicted that northern China will lose up to ten species, whereas Montana and North Dakota in North America are likely to gain up to five species – climate rabbit refugees perhaps, fleeing the ever-warming southern states and Mexico. Generally, species on islands and mountains will be the hardest hit by changing temperatures.  However predictive models are simplified versions of reality and as such are rough approximations of what seems likely to happen. Those we used did not account for the complexity of ecological systems, such as how species – like plants or predators – interact with lagomorphs.  Moreover, small burrowing species such as the Pygmy rabbit Brachylagus idahoensis may be able to shelter from the effects of climate change, while larger species like the European hare Lepus europaeus may have to adapt to mitigate the effects of warming temperatures – for example in the way that the Antelope jackrabbit Lepus alleni uses its long ears to shed excess heat.  So we have to be careful in the interpretation of our models – but the consistency of the results across all lagomorph species does not paint a good picture of the future for the group. Conservation strategies, such as assisted migration – where humans deliberately move species to areas of more suitable conditions, pre-empting future changes – may be one of the few options to save highly range-restricted species, even if it is highly controversial.  Collection of more species records, particularly for already rare species, as well as targeting data-deficient geographic regions (such as Russia) will be vital in increasing our knowledge of the most threatened lagomorphs and informing future conservation management.",2020-12-19T15:30:55.431859Z,1

After laying their eggs on some beaches, the turtles must move to cooler waters to feed, but higher temperatures mean some are having to swim further to reach suitable areas, according to France’s Hubert Curien Institute.  Pikas, small mammals native to North America, are increasingly moving off high-alpine boulder piles to adjacent forests. A study in the Journal of Mammology notes that the cool, moist, rocky habitat they require is getting hotter, drier, and less snowy. Because they live high in the mountains, when their terrain becomes inhabitable, there’s nowhere left to go. Warmer temperatures are causing monarch butterflies’ southern migrations to be delayed by up to six months. Columbia University’s Earth Institute explains that this is causing migrations to fall out of sync with the bloom time of the nectar-producing plants the monarchs rely on for food, contributing to the 95% decrease in their numbers in the last two decades. Puffins in the Gulf of Maine normally eat white hake and herring, but warmer oceans are causing these fish to move north. The puffins are trying to feed their young butterfish instead, but they are unable to swallow them. Over the past 20 years, conservationists calculate that fledgling survival rates have declined by 2.5% a year. The Scottish Association for Marine Science says that the melting of sea ice is affecting the wider food chain, as zooplankton feed on the algae growing on sea ice. These microscopic creatures are eaten by fish and shrimps, which are eaten by seals, ultimately forming the basis of 70% of polar bears’ diet, according to one science journal.",2020-12-22T12:39:03.781725Z,1

Global accounting firm PwC’s annual survey of CEOs shows bosses are preparing to cut jobs and don’t think Australian business and government is doing enough to deal with global heating – a dismal picture that is set to get worse once the effects of the past month’s deadly bushfires take hold.  Economists expect the damage to industries including tourism, agriculture and retail from the unprecedented fires to carve up to 0.2 percentage points from Australia’s already anaemic growth figures. Experts say the damage to the tourism sector is likely to top $1bn, and there is little likelihood that sales figures will show that Christmas revived a retail sector struggling to hold on as consumers who haven’t enjoyed a pay rise for years keep their wallets firmly shut. In September and October, before the bushfires peaked, PwC surveyed 1,600 CEOs around the world, including 117 Australians. Even then, 65% of Australian bosses said climate change was a major threat, up from 60% last year and 43% a decade ago. “The fact that it’s actually now in the top 10 of our CEO survey, not only in Australia but in many other markets, says this is something that’s not going away and it’s a genuine threat to our economy and our communities,” PwC Australia’s head of energy, utilities and resources, Mark Coughlin, said. “We actually just have to get on with it.” The proportion of Australian CEOs expecting global economic output, or gross domestic product, to drop has skyrocketed from 7% two years ago to 59% this year. With confidence that customers will spend thin on the ground, a whopping 77% are planning “operational efficiencies” – corporate code for cuts. This includes a quarter of CEOs who plan to cut jobs, a potential further blow to an economy where the unemployment rate remains stuck above 5%. Economists are pessimistic about the chances of an improvement any time soon, with Deloitte Access Economics predicting GDP growth will remain stuck at 2% for the rest of the financial year – well short of the 2.75% predicted by the Morrison government at the last federal budget and less even than the 2.25% estimate delivered in December. ANZ estimates the bushfires will carve o.1% to 0.2% off GDP growth, but the bank’s chief economist, David Plank, said the full effect wouldn’t be visible until GDP figures for March were released in June. The bushfires are unusual because natural disasters usually have little effect on GDP, which Plank said was a “pretty flawed way of measuring these things”, as it didn’t take into account the losses of forests and animals or people’s homes and businesses. “We basically said it’ll be a larger impact given the sheer size of the event and the global news around it,” he said. He said ANZ credit card data indicated a “quite weak” Christmas shopping season – further bad news for a retail sector rocked by a series of failures, including the collapse last week of fashion chain Jeanswest. Some of the weakness may be due to the rising popularity of Black Friday moving sales forward into November, and some may be due to smoke haze, Plank said. “It’s very hard to disentangle – I don’t think we’ll ever be able to,” he said. Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway said the bushfires would cost his sector “at least $1bn through the firestorms and down-the-line impacts”. He said there had been an immediate “significant drop in domestic travel to many Australian regions, fire affected or not”. “It has remained hard to get a full estimate but based on the collective insights coming from the major tourism and accomodation bodies it will rise above $1bn, not fully factoring in retail and hospitality spend losses.” The fires also hit farmers hard, forcing them to shoot thousands of injured animals and disrupting the dairy industry in southern NSW. Bega chairman Max Roberts said milk was now getting off dairy farms but getting to and from the company’s processing plant remained difficult because the road south to Victoria remained cut. Trucks bringing supplies in and products out of the factory were detouring through Canberra, he said. “With our current rules on log books it makes a one-day trip into a two-day trip,” he said. “There’s certainly a cost associated with that but it’s not insurmountable.” He said the fires cut all three main highways in the area at the same time – an “unusual” event, even though in the past two out of three have been simultaneously blocked by floods. “It’s an event that will change how we do things,” he said. “I think hopefully the whole debate about how we handle climate will get some sensibility about it.” However, PwC’s survey shows that just 12% of Australian bosses think government and business are working together effectively to deal with climate change risks, a figure that has barely moved in five years. “The public discourse in Australia has been very challenging … around energy, climate, etcetera,” Coughlin said. “That really doesn’t help. When I go to meetings around the globe, particularly in western Europe, climate sciences, risks, opportunities etc has been part of the dialogue for a decade or more. “They’re talking much more about net zero [carbon emissions] where we’re debating the impacts or otherwise.”",2020-12-19T16:21:33.006843Z,1

By Snowfan
The strength of particle radiation of a solar storm is given as a three-hour value in the Kp index, the daily value is called the A index.
The following table shows the development of hurricane DORIAN compared to solar activity in the daily values of the A index.
Source: https://nextgrandminimum.com/
The parallels are astonishing: It would seem DORIAN was “fed” by the strength of the solar storm in its development, especially in its peak around September 1, 2019.
It’s well known, of course: correlation isn’t causation.
So the question arises: How could solar storms influence earthly hurricanes? And the question certainly cannot be vice versa.
A commentator made the following interesting comments on hurricane activity in 2017 (including IRMA), and 2018 in the North Atlantic and a connection of solar activity with regard to changes in the jet stream:
Interesting sequence of events here; July 9/10 we had a sharp ‘Kp’ impact after a prolonged period of quiet.
On July 11th, TS Barry had been activated, by the end of the week we had the Jet Stream phenomenon, first over the pacific then over US states.
The theory is that a burst of ‘Kp’ activity expands upper atmosphere and triggers profile changes which can activate or exacerbate potential or base line activity lower down in the atmosphere.
Science in this area is in its infancy; however a discussion of what is involved can be seen at
https://howtheatmosphereworks.wordpress.com/about/solar-activity-and-surface-climate/storm-analysis/
This is also an impressive parallel development of hurricane “IRMA” (Cat. 5) and the solar storm in September 2017:

IRMA– Recorded peak intensity and (below) overall progress

 
The influence of solar activity on the Earth’s weather, e.g. sudden stratospheric warming in the winter over the Arctic with violent “Arctic outbreaks” in the mid-latitudes, is already well known.
Why shouldn’t solar activity also have a significant influence on the formation and development of cyclones through solar storms over the stratosphere and the jet stream?

Animal crime is an emotive issue, and one on which the main political parties differ significantly.  Labour’s stance to retain the Hunting Act 2004 stands in contrast to the Conservatives’ pledge to revoke the ban on hunting. And Labour’s introduction of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 during the last parliament suggests a positive attitude towards animal welfare.   In its policy statement, the Labour Party identifies that more should be done to end wildlife crime and animal cruelty. These terms are used to refer to a wide range of illegal activities, from the persecution of British animals like birds of prey, to the global trafficking of endangered species and their parts.  Wildlife crime is considered to be one of the most prevalent forms of crime globally. The demand from source countries is a major problem, particularly Chinese demand for prize items like elephant ivory, and Vietnam’s demand for rhino horn.  The 2014 London Conference on illegal wildlife trade concluded that poaching and trafficking require action by source, demand and transit countries. As a major destination for trafficked wildlife, the EU has a role to play in addressing global wildlife crime, and Labour’s policies acknowledge this. Experts in the field have been making these calls for several years.  Criminologists and conservationists also say there is a lack of resources for wildlife law enforcement, as well as a lack of frontline knowledge when it comes to catching traffickers within the UK. It is also an area where corruption and the involvement of organised crime and different types of criminal require a dedicated enforcement approach. There is general political agreement that wildlife crime is important. But in practice, police forces are not required to prioritise it. Despite the efforts of individual police, enforcement officers and NGOs, wildlife crime enforcement remains significantly under-resourced. Criminologists and conservationists have repeatedly identified this fact.  Labour’s basic pledges are sound: it is necessary to combat illegal wildlife crime and prevent the trafficking and poaching of endangered species including elephants, rhino and some sturgeon species.  But these should be criminal justice priorities, not just animal welfare ones. Even if tougher sentences and stricter wildlife laws were introduced, it is unlikely that the number of offences would reduce. In some cases strong penalties already exist, but they are underused: so why would a new regime make any difference?   Instead, an improved enforcement strategy is needed, with increased resources for police and conservation bodies. We also need to reform wildlife crime laws so they are less confusing, and to reduce overlap and address inconsistencies. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee addressed part of this issue back in 2012: the committee identified sentencing inconsistency and prosecutors’ lack of expertise as issues in wildlife crime enforcement.  Austerity measures are also a factor. While the UK has an excellent network of police wildlife crime officers, many of them carry out their roles in addition to their “main” duties. Evidence to the government’s committee suggested that, in some areas, wildlife crime enforcement is under threat from police budget cuts. The Law Commission says UK wildlife laws should be reformed and combined; another move that would improve wildlife protection. Indiscriminate methods of killing wildlife like snares should be prohibited, and loopholes should be closed. Some wording in laws means that wildlife can be killed on technicalities when the law is meant to protect it. Phrases like “wilfully” or “intentionally” should be replaced with wording that actually helps investigators where an offence has clearly been committed. They should not have to prove the wildlife knowledge or intentions of the offender.   One of the problems with wildlife laws is that there are too many, providing different levels of protection for animals. This causes confusion both for the public and enforcers. The coalition government’s Red Tape Challenge suggests that there are 159 regulations relating to biodiversity, wildlife management, landscape, countryside and recreation. Wildlife investigators and campaigners often complain about ambiguous wording and different standards of protection across wildlife legislation. Because of this, a high level of legal expertise is often required even at the investigative stage. The Law Commission sought to address this with plans for a more streamlined legal regime. They suggested increased use of civil and administrative penalties, rather than the existing reliance on the criminal law.   Our current wildlife law enforcement regime makes little provision for crime prevention. Its primary function in practice is to detect and apprehend the offender after the offence has been committed. In the case of wildlife, killed as a result of wildlife crime, this is too late.  Labour’s policy suggests that they see animal protection as important.  This is good news. But if this is the case, we need effectively enforced and coherent wildlife laws as part of our criminal justice system.  As the election heats up, it will be interesting to see which of our political parties is willing to name animal protection and wildlife crime as important policing issues. But ultimately, it will be more important to see which party will commit to providing resources to make this a reality.",2020-12-19T15:31:32.844093Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:49:37.234269Z,1012,119,,"The world’s energy watchdog has warned the oil and gas industry that it risks a public backlash by failing to act on the climate crisis in favour of making short-term profits. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil companies must balance their desire for near-term returns and a long-term future by playing a much more significant role in combating the climate crisis. The IEA is preparing to make its most direct call for oil companies to help tackle the climate crisis at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos on Tuesday. The oil and gas industry faces “twin threats” to its financial profitability and social acceptability, according to the IEA. “There are already signs of both, whether in financial markets or in the reflexive antipathy towards fossil fuels that is increasingly visible in the public debate, at least in parts of Europe and North America,” it said. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said: “No energy company will be unaffected by clean-energy transitions. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.” The report said that although some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat the climate crisis, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role. Oil companies could do more now to help shrink the industry’s giant carbon footprint but most companies were yet to play a meaningful role, according to the report. The world’s oil companies have channelled less than 1% of their spending towards alternative energy technologies outside of oil and gas, despite growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The leading oil companies spend about 5%, the report said. The IEA has called on the oil industry to use its “extensive knowhow and deep pockets” to help accelerate the development of clean energy and carbon capture technologies that could help absorb the greenhouse gas from factories before they enter the atmosphere. Last week Microsoft announced plans to establish a $1bn (£770m) fund dedicated to “carbon reduction, capture, and removal technologies” and aims to become “carbon negative” by 2030. The IEA report found that the combined spending of large oil and gas companies in projects beyond oil and gas was just over $2bn last year. “Without the industry’s input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,” Birol said. “The first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the carbon footprint of their own operations. As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers.” Birol said a large part of these emissions could be brought down relatively quickly and easily by investing in technology that can stop methane leaking from fossil fuel projects into the atmosphere. The IEA has faced scathing criticism in the past that it is undermining the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy by mapping out influential future energy scenarios – used by governments to help set energy policy – which are not aligned with global climate targets. The IEA has called for a “grand coalition” of policymakers, investors and oil executives to work together to tackle the climate crisis but this is the first report to focus directly on the role for oil and gas companies in the energy transition. In Europe, major oil companies are facing rising public opposition, including a growing number of cultural institutions that have said they will no longer accept financial support from oil and gas companies. Last week the Royal College of General Practitioners cancelled a conference organised by the trade body Oil and Gas UK that was scheduled to take place on its premises later this month because it “conflicts with the college’s longstanding commitment to combat the impact of climate change on the environment and on the health of our patients”.",2020-12-19T16:49:37.234301Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:31:46.316432Z,1014,120,,"In a few densely forested patches of Nigeria and Cameroon there lives a gorilla so rare and so elusive that the best way to study it is through training sniffer dogs to track down its faeces. This is the Cross River gorilla, and there are just 200-300 left in the wild. To find these shy creatures and learn more about them a team of scientists from Germany and the US turned to detection dogs. They have written about their findings in the Royal Society Open Science journal.  Most of us wish our encounters with faeces to be brief before we flush them away, but this is not the case for conservation biologists. The TV series You Are What You Eat hit on a truth: faecal matter is a rich source of information about its depositors. Faeces doesn’t just tell us what the owner has been eating – it also contains DNA, gut parasites, and hormones which can tell us about reproduction and stress levels.  The researchers in this particular study were after gorilla DNA, which can be used to determine the sex and identity of the individual; this information can then be used to estimate population size, the numbers in a social group, how far the group moves around and how closely related the individuals are. In the past wild population sizes were estimated by capturing individual animals, marking them and then after some time trying to recapture them.  It is possible to estimate population size using data gathered this way, but clearly this method is not appropriate for large and endangered species like gorillas.  However, this process can be simulated using the “recapture” of faeces from the same individuals, which is what the scientists did in this study. Gorillas, as you might imagine, create large piles of faeces. But despite their size, finding such deposits in a tropical forest is not an easy task for humans, especially when the gorillas themselves are so shy.  One way to overcome this problem is by using specially trained detector dogs to find the gorillas’ faeces (or scats as we biologists call them). The use of dogs as odour detectors goes back to the 1960s when they were first exploited to detect narcotics, and these days their olfactory abilities are employed to sniff out everything from explosives to cancerous tumours to the floating poop of killer whales. Scientists still debate how good a dog’s sense of smell is.  But research shows that they can detect chemicals in parts per trillion, whereas most chemical sensing machines work in parts per billion. Dogs possess 20 times as many olfactory receptors as humans, and they dedicate 40 times more of their brain to processing smells.  It is said that if their smell was taste they could detect a teaspoon of sugar in the amount of water needed to fill two Olympic swimming pools. They also can detect all the separate components of a smell; their nose can determine the ingredients list of whatever they are sniffing. Moths and bees can also be trained to detect explosives or drugs, while African pouched rats can detect landmines and even tuberculosis better than humans with machines. The advantage dogs have over insects and to an extent rats is their ability to cover large areas in short periods of time. But as with all detection animals the problem is the need for a human handler who often slows the dog down, especially in a mountainous tropical forest. The dogs used in this study were Working Dogs for Conservation flown in from the US . They proved more successful at finding scats than human fieldworkers and they were less biased in site location. Where human fieldworkers tended to look for gorilla nests and then procure scats nearby, dogs would instead scan the whole area.  This meant the dogs found scats belonging to more individual gorillas, which in turn bumped up the estimated population size.  Given sufficient field time the authors believe detection dogs would provide a precise estimate of gorilla population size. However, specially trained dogs and handlers imported from the US meant the cost per scat found was seven times more expensive than those found by human fieldworkers. This pilot study of just a few weeks cost nearly US$100,000.  The authors of this study recognise, despite the cost, the value of using detector dogs in longer term studies of highly endangered species such as Cross River gorillas, especially if dogs are simultaneously searching for scats of several endangered species.  And they suggest the establishment of a local detection dog program. Gorilla-hunting sniffer dogs for Africa? It’s a novel cause – but a worthy one.",2020-12-19T15:31:46.316465Z,1

A few months ago Armstrong and Lazarus (2019) indicated “trends in recent rates of shoreline change along the U.S. Atlantic Coast reflect an especially puzzling increase in accretion, not erosion.”
From 1830 to 1956, shorelines eroded at the rapid rate of -55 cm per year on average. Since 1960, the U.S. Atlantic coast has been expanding (accretion) at a rate of +5 cm per year.

New study: 45% of 53 long-term North America tide gauges show negative acceleration
A new paper (Boretti, 2019) utilizes 90+ years of continuous tide gauge data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) to record the sea level trends from the West Coast (20) and East Coast (33) of North America.
Boretti finds the average sea level change for the 20 West Coast tide gauges amounts to -0.38 mm/yr, whereas the average sea level rise rate is +2.22 mm/yr for the 33 East Coast gauges. Much of the relative differences between the two coasts can be explained by land subsidence (sinking) or uplift (rising).
“Nearly the entire East Coast of the United States, from Massachusetts and parts of Maine to Florida, is known to be affected by subsidence [6–10]. Subsidence is much stronger along the East Coast of the United States and significant only in Southern California along the West Coast, and it increased in intensity since the mid-1900s.”

Image Source: Boretti, 2019
Of the 53 total tide gauges on North America’s East and West coasts, 45% (24) are negatively accelerating, 14 document falling sea levels, and just 11 have sea levels rising more than +3 mm/yr.
The overall acceleration for both the East and West coasts amounts to just +0.0028 mm/yr² and +0.0012 mm/yr², respectively, when using the late 1800s and early 1900s as the starting years.
An analysis by Houston and Dean (2011) showed that when the sea level trend begins in 1930, the U.S. coasts as a whole actually decelerated overall (-0.013 mm/yr²) during 1930-2007.

These modest trends would not appear to support the conention that modern sea level changes in this region are rising at alarming rates.

,2020-12-19T19:34:30.630153Z,1020,120,,"Much of the Earth was once cloaked in vast forests, from the subarctic snowforests to the Amazon and Congo basins.  As humankind colonised the far corners of our planet, we cleared large areas to harvest wood, make way for farmland, and build towns and cities. The loss of forest has wrought dramatic consequences for biodiversity and is the primary driver of the global extinction crisis. I work in Borneo where huge expanses of tropical forest are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. The biological cost is the replacement of some 150 forest bird species with a few tens of farmland species. But forest is also frequently retained inside or at the edges of oil palm plantations, and this is a pattern that is replicated globally. The problem, according to new research published in Science Advances, is that the vast majority of remaining forests are fragmented. In other words, remaining forests are increasingly isolated from other forests by a sea of transformed lands, and they are found in ever-smaller sized patches. The shockwaves of loss thus extend far beyond the footprint of deforestation. The team, led by Nick Haddad from North Carolina State University, used the world’s first high-resolution satellite map of tree cover to measure how isolated remaining forests are from a non-forest edge. Edges are created by a plethora of deforesting activities, from roads to cattle pastures and oil wells, as well as by rivers.   They found that more than 70% of remaining forest is within just 1km (about 0.6 miles) of an edge, while a 100 metre stroll from an edge would enable you to reach 20% of global forests. Comparing across regions, the patterns they find are even starker. In Europe and the US, the vast majority of forest is within 1km of an edge – some of the most “remote” areas in these regions are a stones throw from human activity. “Getting away from it all” has never been more challenging.  If you want remote forests on a large scale you’ll have to head to the Amazon, the Congo, or to a lesser degree, central and far eastern Russia, central Borneo and Papua New Guinea. These findings wouldn’t be cause for alarm if wildlife, forests, and the services that they provide humankind such as carbon storage and water, were unaffected by fragmentation. However, by drawing together scientific evidence from seven long-term fragmentation experiments, Haddad and colleagues show that fragmentation reduces biodiversity by up to 75%. This exacerbates the extinction risk of millions of forest species, many of which we still don’t know much about. Forest species struggle to survive at edges because these places are brighter, windier, and hotter than forest interiors. Edges become choked by rampant vines and invaded by disturbance-tolerant, parasitic or invasive species that outcompete the denizens of dark forest interiors. In Borneo, for example, small forest patches house bird communities that are far more similar to those found in the surrounding oil palm than to those of larger forest tracts.   The survival of large, carbon-rich trees – the building blocks of any intact forest ecosystem – is reduced in smaller and more isolated forest fragments.  These patches thus fail to maintain viable populations, which over time are doomed – an “extinction debt” yet to be paid. With so much global forest in close proximity to humans, larger forest animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, tapirs or curassow birds are being hunted to extinction in individual areas. This shifts animal communities within the forest fragments to one dominated by small-bodied species.  Further, hunters are willing to penetrate forests for several kilometres from edges in search of game, effectively making the truly wild global forest estate yet smaller.  The insidious effects of fragmentation mean that the top conservation priority must be preventing further incursions into dwindling wildernesses. By preventing the first cut we can help to prevent global fragmentation and the further loss of biodiversity. Of course, we should not ignore fragmented regions.  Some of these, including the Brazilian Atlantic forest, Tropical Andes and Himalayas, share a toxic mix of hyperdiversity, endemic species with tiny ranges, and severe fragmentation. The critically-endangered Munchique wood-wren, for instance, exists only in a handful of peaks in the Colombian Andes, but these are now isolated from each other by cattle pastures and roads. Here we must seek to restore forest cover and improve connectivity between larger fragments if we are to prevent extinctions. However, the rapid expansion of human populations, greed, and meat consumption mean that more forest is likely to be lost, even if farm yield and efficiency can be improved to help bridge gaps between current and future demand. The difficult question is where should this expansion happen? Given the severe degradation of small and isolated fragments, perhaps conversion could target some of these patches, coupled with wilderness protection and expansion. Next time I visit my local National Park – the highly fragmented Peak District – I will spare a thought for the species that are being harmed by their habitats being broken up into ever smaller chunks. There are no easy answers to the problems of fragmentation, but our forests urgently need a global management plan.",2020-12-19T19:34:30.630187Z,1

According to scientists, the overwhelming majority of the “significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China” since the early 1990s can be attributed to the combination of CO2 fertilization (56%) and climate change (35%).

“The recent warming hiatus (1998–2013) was identified as a potential key mechanism behind the increased land sink during this period via reduced ecosystem respiration (Ballantyne et al., 2017).”
“At the global scale, simulated NPP [net primary production, greening] increased substantially over the 20th century to present day from 56.2 (mean of 1901–1910) to 66.0 Pg C/year (mean of 2007–2016) with positive contributions from all drivers considered, including rising CO2 concentrations (referred to as CO2 fertilization), nitrogen deposition, climate, and carbon‐nitrogen as well as carbon‐climate synergies. The relative contribution of these drivers to this overall NPP increase amounts to 60% for increased CO2, 15% for nitrogen deposition, 8% for carbon‐nitrogen synergy, 9% for carbon‐climate synergy, and 8% for climate. Both CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition individually caused a smooth, transient increase in NPP, in line with the trajectory of the corresponding drivers.”
“[R]esults show a global NPP [net primary production, greening] increase of 3.4 Pg C/year between the early 1990s (mean of 1990–1996) and the end of our study period (2010–2016), with CO2 fertilization and climate being the dominant drivers, accounting for 56% and 35% of the overall change, respectively.”
“Carbon‐climate interactions led to significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China.”
A dozen new papers attest to the substantially positive impact that CO2 fertilization and warming has had on the biosphere.
• Due especially to the rise in CO2 concentrations, 52% of the globe’s vegetated lands have shown statistically significant greening/gross primary production trends since 1981, whereas just 12% of vegetated areas have been browning. CO2’s greening effect has been underestimated by 60% with outdated models.

“Historical increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration, from 280 to current 400 ppm, has resulted in enhanced GPP [gross primary production/greening] due to its radiative and physiological effects, which is indirectly evident in amplified seasonal swings of atmospheric CO2 concentration and large scale increase in summer time green leaf area. Thus, these observables, expressed as sensitivities to ambient CO2 concentration, might serve as predictors of changes in GPP and help to reduce uncertainty in multimodel projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities. This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades: 52% of the vegetated lands show statistically significant greening trends over the 36-year record of satellite observations (1981–2016, Methods), while only 12% show browning trends, mostly in the North American boreal forests due to disturbances.”
“Here, we apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (EC) to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of GPP using historical simulations and satellite observations of LAI focusing on NHL. We find that the EC estimate [of the effect of CO2 on greening/GPP] is 60% larger than the commonly accepted multi-model mean value, in line with a recent study that assessed the impact of physiological effects of higher CO2 concentration on GPP of northern hemispheric extra-tropical vegetation. Detailed independent analyses of insitu CO2 measurements and atmospheric inversions imbue confidence in our conclusions. Our central finding is, the effect of ambient CO2 concentration on terrestrial photosynthesis is larger than previously thought, and thus, has important implications for future carbon cycle and climate.”
• According to observations, the Earth – especially its dryland regions – has been greening due to climate change (CO2 and temperature rise).
Brandt et al., 2019
“Recent Earth observation studies find a greening of the Earth and in particular in global drylands, which is commonly interpreted as a global increase in net primary production and has been attributed to climate change. Although changes in rainfall, fire regimes, elevated temperatures, atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen depositions are suggested explanations, only few studies provide quantitative evidence on both the biophysical processes (changes in vegetation cover, structure and composition) and controlling factors of long-term dryland vegetation trends.”
Qiu et al., 2019
“Our results show that both net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) of northern peatlands increased over the past century in response to CO2 and climate change.”
• The “remarkable” vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin since 2000 is expected to continue for 73% of the region.

“Changes in Vegetation Greenness in the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Basin over 2000–2015 … In this study, the vegetation dynamic characteristics were analyzed for unconverted forestland, shrubland, grassland, cropland, and converted forestland, shrubland, and grassland from cropland over 2000–2015 in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River. … The results obtained were as follows: (1) Vegetation greening was remarkable in the entire study region (0.036 yr−1).”
“Overall greening trend in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River indicated great achievements have been obtained since the implementation of the GTGP. Vegetation restoration exerted stronger influences on converted types from cropland than unconverted types. In the future, approximately 73.1% of the study region is expected to continue increasing [greening].”
• Water-use efficiency – the ability for plants to compensate for water loss – has improved directly due to “rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”

“Human-caused CO2 emissions over the past century have caused the climate of the Earth to warm and have directly impacted on the functioning of terrestrial plants. We examine the global response of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) to the historic change in atmospheric CO2. The GPP of the terrestrial biosphere has increased steadily, keeping pace remarkably in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2. Water-use efficiency, namely the ratio of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis to water loss by transpiration, has increased as a direct leaf-level effect of rising CO2. This has allowed an increase in global leaf area, which has conspired with stimulation of photosynthesis per unit leaf area to produce a maximal response of the terrestrial biosphere to rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change.”
• A “large increase” in total biomass and improvement in water use efficiency is assessed for the Amazon region under elevated CO2 (700 ppm). Elevated CO2 “nullified” the effect of drought.
Oliveira and Marenco, 2019
“The large increase in total biomass and the substantial improvement in WUEP [water use efficiency] under eCO2 [elevated CO2, 700 ppm], and the sharp decline in leaf area under water stress widen our knowledge on the physiology of this important species for the forest management of large areas in the Amazon region.”
“Climate models predict an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and prolonged droughts in some parts of the Amazon, but the effect of elevated CO2 is still unknown. Two experiments (ambient CO2 ‒ 400 ppm and elevated CO2 ‒ 700 ppm) were conducted to assess the effect of drought (soil at 50% field capacity) on physiological parameters of Carapa. At ambient CO2 concentration, light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (PNsat) was reduced by 33.5% and stomatal conductance (gs) by 46.4% under drought, but the effect of drought on PNsat and gs was nullified at elevated CO2. Total plant biomass and leaf area production were also reduced (42‒47%) by drought. By changing leaf traits, Carapa is able to endure drought, as the consumptive use of water was reduced under drought (32‒40%). The improvement of PNsat under elevated CO2 and water stress and the leaf plasticity of Carapa broaden our understanding of the physiology of Amazonian trees.”
• Plants grown under elevated CO2 have “higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area.” Elevated CO2 “may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit” in soybeans.
Bencke-Malato et al., 2019
“In this study, we evaluated the individual and combinatory effects of E[CO2] [elevated CO2] and water deficit on the physiology and root molecular responses in soybean. Plants growing under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] exhibited increased photosynthesis that resulted in a higher biomass, plant height, and leaf area. E[CO2] decreased the transcripts levels of genes involved in iron uptake and transport, antioxidant activity, secondary metabolism and defense, and stress responses in roots. When plants grown under E[CO2] [elevated CO2] are treated  with instantaneous water deficit, E[CO2] reverted the expression of water deficit-induced genes related to stress, defense, transport and nutrient deficiency. Furthermore, the interaction of both treatments uniquely affected the expression of genes. Both physiological and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that E[CO2] may mitigate the negative effects of water deficit on the soybean roots.”
• Elevated temperature and CO2 increased maize and soybean yield by 25%-31%.
Qiao et al., 2019
“Maize had 25% yield increase under elevated temperature (eT). Soybean had 31% yield increase under elevated CO2 (eCO2) with eT. Elevated temperature with and without eCO2 increased grain oil concentrations.”
• Rice yield is “significantly higher” with elevated CO2.
Raj et al., 2019
“Climate  change  associated  with  rising  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  concentration  may  have  impact  on  crop production and soil health. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration may enhance crop growth with higher demand for nutrients by the crop. An experiment was conducted during July-October, 2013 using Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment facility at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi to study the impact of elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) dose on growth, yield and nitrogen uptake in rice crop. Four doses of N, i.e., control, 0.6 g N pot-1 (75% recommended dose of N), 0.8 g N pot-1 (100% recommended dose of N) and 1.0 g N pot-1 (125% recommended dose of N) were applied in both ambient (395 ppm) and elevated CO2 (550±20 ppm)  conditions. Grain and biomass yield of rice was significantly higher under elevated CO2 condition. Plant growth and yield parameters also increased with increased N doses in both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions. Nitrogen concentration of grain and straw decreased under high CO2 level but N uptake increased under elevated CO2 condition. Agronomic efficiency of N was higher under elevated CO2 while recovery efficiency of N remained unaffected. The study showed that although yield of rice increases under elevated CO2 condition, to maintain plant nitrogen concentration, application of additional dose of N is required.”
• Trees “may temporally benefit from warming climate” in Asian boreal forests.
Zhang et al., 2019
“While summer GST [ground surface temperature] had a somewhat consistently positive correlation with tree growth, winter GST has shifted from a negative to a strongly positive correlation with growth in the last decade, coincidental with a sharp increase in winter GST since 2004. Winter GST is also strongly correlated with the rapidly thawing permafrost dynamics. Overall, our results suggest a link between recent changes in the permafrost and shifts in climate‐growth correlations for one of the main boreal tree species. As a result, L. gmelinii has experienced an important increase in radial growth that may indicate that, unlike what has been reported for other boreal species, it may temporally benefit from warming climate in the continuous permafrost region of the Asian boreal forests.”
• Due to climate change, the height growth for oak trees has been “significantly higher” during the last 30-35 years than the decades prior.
Gulyás et al., 2019
“Due to climate change, it is important to know to what extent forests will be impacted by atmospheric changes. This study focuses on the height growth response of sessile oak.”
“The relative top heights of the young stands were significantly higher than of the older stands, which means that the overall growing conditions were better in the last 30-35 years due to atmospheric changes than the mean conditions during the lifetime of old stands.”

According to scientists, the overwhelming majority of the “significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China” since the early 1990s can be attributed to the combination of CO2 fertilization (56%) and climate change (35%).

“The recent warming hiatus (1998–2013) was identified as a potential key mechanism behind the increased land sink during this period via reduced ecosystem respiration (Ballantyne et al., 2017).”
“At the global scale, simulated NPP [net primary production, greening] increased substantially over the 20th century to present day from 56.2 (mean of 1901–1910) to 66.0 Pg C/year (mean of 2007–2016) with positive contributions from all drivers considered, including rising CO2 concentrations (referred to as CO2 fertilization), nitrogen deposition, climate, and carbon‐nitrogen as well as carbon‐climate synergies. The relative contribution of these drivers to this overall NPP increase amounts to 60% for increased CO2, 15% for nitrogen deposition, 8% for carbon‐nitrogen synergy, 9% for carbon‐climate synergy, and 8% for climate. Both CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition individually caused a smooth, transient increase in NPP, in line with the trajectory of the corresponding drivers.”
“[R]esults show a global NPP [net primary production, greening] increase of 3.4 Pg C/year between the early 1990s (mean of 1990–1996) and the end of our study period (2010–2016), with CO2 fertilization and climate being the dominant drivers, accounting for 56% and 35% of the overall change, respectively.”
“Carbon‐climate interactions led to significant increases in tropical forests and the forests of North America, Eurasia, and China.”
A dozen new papers attest to the substantially positive impact that CO2 fertilization and warming has had on the biosphere.
• Due especially to the rise in CO2 concentrations, 52% of the globe’s vegetated lands have shown statistically significant greening/gross primary production trends since 1981, whereas just 12% of vegetated areas have been browning. CO2’s greening effect has been underestimated by 60% with outdated models.

Winkler et al., 2019
“Historical increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration, from 280 to current 400 ppm, has resulted in enhanced GPP [gross primary production/greening] due to its radiative and physiological effects, which is indirectly evident in amplified seasonal swings of atmospheric CO2 concentration and large scale increase in summer time green leaf area. Thus, these observables, expressed as sensitivities to ambient CO2 concentration, might serve as predictors of changes in GPP and help to reduce uncertainty in multimodel projections of terrestrial carbon cycle entities. This study is focused on the northern high latitudes (NHL, north of 60°N) where significant and linked changes in climate and vegetation have been observed in the past 3–4 decades: 52% of the vegetated lands show statistically significant greening trends over the 36-year record of satellite observations (1981–2016, Methods), while only 12% show browning trends, mostly in the North American boreal forests due to disturbances.”
“Here, we apply the concept of Emergent Constraints (EC) to reduce uncertainty in multi-model projections of GPP using historical simulations and satellite observations of LAI focusing on NHL. We find that the EC estimate [of the effect of CO2 on greening/GPP] is 60% larger than the commonly accepted multi-model mean value, in line with a recent study that assessed the impact of physiological effects of higher CO2 concentration on GPP of northern hemispheric extra-tropical vegetation.

Four doses of N, i.e., control, 0.6 g N pot-1 (75% recommended dose of N), 0.8 g N pot-1 (100% recommended dose of N) and 1.0 g N pot-1 (125% recommended dose of N) were applied in both ambient (395 ppm) and elevated CO2 (550±20 ppm)  conditions. Grain and biomass yield of rice was significantly higher under elevated CO2 condition. Plant growth and yield parameters also increased with increased N doses in both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions. Nitrogen concentration of grain and straw decreased under high CO2 level but N uptake increased under elevated CO2 condition. Agronomic efficiency of N was higher under elevated CO2 while recovery efficiency of N remained unaffected. The study showed that although yield of rice increases under elevated CO2 condition, to maintain plant nitrogen concentration, application of additional dose of N is required.”
• Trees “may temporally benefit from warming climate” in Asian boreal forests.
Zhang et al., 2019
“While summer GST [ground surface temperature] had a somewhat consistently positive correlation with tree growth, winter GST has shifted from a negative to a strongly positive correlation with growth in the last decade, coincidental with a sharp increase in winter GST since 2004. Winter GST is also strongly correlated with the rapidly thawing permafrost dynamics. Overall, our results suggest a link between recent changes in the permafrost and shifts in climate‐growth correlations for one of the main boreal tree species. As a result, L. gmelinii has experienced an important increase in radial growth that may indicate that, unlike what has been reported for other boreal species, it may temporally benefit from warming climate in the continuous permafrost region of the Asian boreal forests.”
• Due to climate change, the height growth for oak trees has been “significantly higher” during the last 30-35 years than the decades prior.
Gulyás et al., 2019
“Due to climate change, it is important to know to what extent forests will be impacted by atmospheric changes. This study focuses on the height growth response of sessile oak.”
“The relative top heights of the young stands were significantly higher than of the older stands, which means that the overall growing conditions were better in the last 30-35 years due to atmospheric changes than the mean conditions during the lifetime of old stands.”

,2020-12-22T12:50:05.935179Z,1023,119,,"Ordinary people from across the UK – potentially including climate deniers – will take part in the first ever citizens’ climate assembly this weekend. Mirroring the model adopted in France by Emmanuel Macron, 110 people from all walks of life will begin deliberations on Saturday to come up with a plan to tackle global heating and meet the government’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050.  The assembly was selected to be a representative sample of the population after a mailout to 30,000 people chosen at random. About 2,000 people responded saying they wanted to be considered for the assembly, and the 110 members were picked by computer. They come from all age brackets and their selection reflects a 2019 Ipsos Mori poll of how concerned the general population is by climate change, where responses ranged from not at all to very concerned. Of the assembly members, three people are not at all concerned, 16 not very concerned, 36 fairly concerned, 54 very concerned, and one did not know, organisers said. The selection process meant those chosen could include climate deniers or sceptics, according to Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, which is running the assembly along with the Sortition Foundation and the e-democracy project mySociety. “It is really important that it is representative of the UK population,” said Allen. “Those people, just because they’re sceptical of climate change, they’re going to be affected by the steps the government takes to get to net zero by 2050 too and they shouldn’t have their voice denied in that.” The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The UK climate assembly differs from the French model in that it was commissioned by six select committees, rather than by the prime minister. Their views, which will be produced in a report in the spring, will be considered by the select committees but there is no guarantee any of the proposals will be taken up by government. Allen said it was rare for members of a citizens’ assembly to get locked into dissent. She pointed to the success of the Irish citizens’ assembly in 2016, which helped break the deadlock in the abortion debate. “This climate assembly is going to come up with recommendations that are going to be really invaluable in highlighting public preferences,” she said. Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy at University College London, is one of four experts who will guide the members of the public in their decision-making. He acknowledged the scale of the challenges they faced in finding solutions to reaching net zero by 2050, which he said was “a hell of a job”. As well as four experts to the assembly, a panel of advisers including representatives from the Confederation of British Industry, Trades Union Congress, National Farmers’ Union, environmental NGOs and renewable energy companies have helped provide the questions on which assembly members will be asked to give their views. The key subjects to be considered will include transport, agriculture, domestic energy, and how consumerism is driving global heating. As well as policies such as bringing forward the ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040, the panel will consider technological solutions to cutting carbon emissions. Watson said many technological initiatives were surrounded by hype. “It is really important we get across [to the assembly members] not just that the option is x, but what the status of that option is in the world,” he said. The assembly will meet for four weekends. On the third weekend they will begin making decisions about ways to meet the net zero target. A spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion, which is calling for the government to create and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate, said they welcomed the fact that such assemblies were being used in mainstream politics. “However, because it is not commissioned by the government it is not what we are looking for. We want something with real teeth, that has actual power to influence policy,” she said.",2020-12-22T12:50:05.935220Z,1

5 crewmen to fly over to New York
But German online leftist daily TAZ here has uncovered that Greta’s climate publicity jaunt is going to wind up creating a massive carbon stomp, one far greater than anyone would have dared to imagine.
The TAZ writes that Greta would have been far gentler to the climate had she simply taken a commercial airliner. The reason, the TAZ writes, is because a crew of 5 men will have to fly over to New York in order to take the boat back!
This is what Andreas Kling, press spokesman for Thunberg’s skipper Boris Herrmann, told the TAZ on Thursday.
“There’s no other way,” said Kling!

10 tons instead of 4
Citing carbon emissions calculator site atmosfair, each crewman flying from Hamburg to New York will emit 2 tons of CO2 for the flight, i.e. a total of 10 tons. Had Greta simply taken a roundtrip commercial economy-class flight, she would have wound up emitting less than 4 tons.
The 16-year-old Greta and her father set sail last Wednesday afternoon on board the ocean-going yacht Malizia II with two sailors and a publicity filmmaker.
Hundreds of journalists travel to Plymouth
Moreover, “hundreds of journalists, supporters and spectators” travelled to Plymouth to watch Greta’s departure, thus adding enormously to the carbon emissions that the trip was supposed to reduced. The journalists could have witnessed here departure via live feed or a webcam rather than travelling in automobiles and what not to Plymouth.
Spokesman Kling says now they are considering sending Greta back from New York via cargo container ship.
Gee, cutting back fossil fuels “not easy” after all
Aware that the trip is possibly turning into public relations farce, sailor Herrmann told the TAZ: “The journey symbolizes two things: that it is not easy to replace fossil fuels and that mastering this challenge can be a great adventure”.

,2020-12-22T12:51:18.265526Z,1029,120,,"As a result of membership of the Common Fisheries Policy, we are now allowed to catch less than 20% of the fish that swim in British waters. The other 80% we have given away to the rest of Europe.  Nigel Farage, UKIP leader, on the campaign trail When fact checking this statement, it is first of all worth pointing out that if the UK was allowed to catch 20% of the fish that swim in British waters and the EU took the rest, then there would be no fish left in the sea. In attempting to check the facts behind this assertion, one must assume, therefore, that Nigel Farage is referring to the allocations of fishing quotas which are determined by the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In 2015, the CFP allocated the United Kingdom a total of 612,612 tonnes of quota from more than 100 different fish and shellfish stocks. The total EU quota for these stocks was 2,069,202 tonnes, so the UK was allocated 30% of these fish (and shellfish) quotas.  These figures include various fish which live beyond the boundaries of UK waters, such as Arctic cod and west of Ireland sole. If one considers the 73 different fish stocks which live in UK waters, the total EU quota was 1,920,915 tonnes, of which 585,211 tonnes was allocated to the UK (which also happens to be 30%). Individual quota allocations differ according to stock, as figure one below shows. For example, the UK gets 84% of the North Sea haddock quota, 81% of North Sea monkfish quota and 98% of west of Scotland prawn quota; but only 4% of North Sea sprat quota, 18% of northern hake and 28% of North Sea plaice. Although UK waters are extensive, as the map below shows, the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them. Some, like mackerel, make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period. Others are more sedentary, like prawns which stay close to their burrows in muddy habitats.   Many species live in different places either at different times of the year or in different phases of their life cycle. In the case of North Sea herring for example, most of the juveniles live in the south east corner around the German bight, whereas the adults tend to congregate around the Shetland Isles prior to spawning at various sites along the British coast. North Sea cod are found throughout the North Sea but prefer spawning along the border between UK and Norwegian waters.  So despite the UK having quite extensive waters, fish stocks do not respect political boundaries, and many are mobile at some stage in their life: these fish are exclusive to neither the UK, the EU, nor the bordering Scandinavian states, but are a shared resource. It would be a major undertaking to establish exactly which proportions of each fish stock would occupy any national waters. These are also likely to change throughout the year, and from year to year. The CFP was designed to manage the mobile fishing fleets that pursue these common, mobile resources. Although the majority of fish stocks around the UK are managed under the CFP, some important stocks, mainly local shellfish species such as crabs, lobsters and scallops, are also managed under national jurisdictions and bilateral agreements, for example between the EU and states such as Norway and Iceland.  The status of all stocks is determined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the recognised authority that provides scientific advice to managers. This advice is updated annually and, where possible, includes measures of stock status such as the total biomass of adults and the rate of exploitation the stock has been subjected to by the fishery.   Although the CFP is much derided, various reforms have actually resulted in improvements in the status of many fish stocks in the last decade or so: exploitation rates are down, and in most cases, to levels which are sustainable. The ICES advice also includes recommendations for total allowable catches (TACs) for each stock. Each TAC is then considered by the EU and divided into the quotas which are allocated among the member states according to fixed percentages, under allocation keys known as “relative stability”, which are based on historic fishing patterns.    In 2015, the UK was allocated 30% of the EU quota for fishing ground stocks which occur in UK waters. The area of UK waters relative to other member states is certainly high, but the exact proportions depend on the region and which components of member state waters should be considered.   If Farage’s point is that most of the quota for fish stocks that live in UK waters are fished by other member states, then he is correct; but the figure is not 80%, more like 70%. However, these are not “our” fish, the fish that live in UK waters are no more British than they are German, Dutch, Belgian, Irish or Norwegian: they are in fact European. This is a thorough and well-illustrated response which uses the most reliable and up-to-date information available. By demonstrating that the majority of fish in our waters are in fact European rather than British it highlights a key point – even if Britain left the EU we would still need to negotiate quotas which took this into account. There is no guarantee this would ensure any more of the catch. It’s also interesting to look at these figures in terms of value rather than just landings. Three of the top five most valuable UK fisheries are for shellfish: prawns, scallops and crabs. For these more sedentary species we already have almost complete control. Although some fish, such as haddock are mainly eaten in the UK, a lot of shellfish from British waters is exported to EU countries. The vast majority of our scallop catch – the UK’s third most valuable fishery – goes to France and Belgium. Likewise Spain and Portugal take a lot of our crabs and prawns. Let’s concentrate on looking after what we are responsible for, more wisely.",2020-12-22T12:51:18.265559Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:34:53.543232Z,1032,118,,"You never forget the first time you see an iceberg. The horizon of a ship at sea is a two dimensional space and to see a three dimensional piece of ice appear in the ocean is quite something. But, in truth, the first iceberg you see is likely to be small. Most icebergs that make it far enough north from Antarctica to where they are danger to shipping are sometimes many years old and at the end of their lives. They are small fragments of what once left the continent. Once in a while, however, a monster breaks free from the edge of Antarctica and drifts away. Tens of kilometres long these bergs can tower perhaps 100 metres above the sea and reach several hundred more below the surface. These are called tabular icebergs – and while it is rare for humans to see something on such a scale they are part of the normal cycle of glacial ice in Antarctica. Everyone knows Antarctica is an ice-covered continent, but the ice is not static. To a scientist it is a dynamic environment – it’s just a question of the timescale you are looking at. Snow falls on the continent and over time it has built up layers of ice which flow in glaciers towards the coast.  On reaching the sea, these glaciers fracture and release icebergs or form large regions of floating ice known as ice shelves. In a few special places glaciers can extend tens of kilometres into the ocean – giant fingers of ice several hundred metres thick, pointing out into the sea. Just like a wall they shield what is in their lee, and rather than the ocean being covered by drifting sea ice it can remain open throughout the year to form what is called a polynya. The ocean still freezes, but the ice is constantly pushed away by the prevailing winds. Open water throughout winter helps seals and penguins survive, and stimulates phytoplankton production.  A new research article in the journal Nature Communications by a French team working in Antarctica has looked at the history of the polynya in the lee of the Mertz Glacier going back 250 years. This glacier forms one of these fingers of ice reaching out from the continent and the polynya in its lee can be up to 6,000 square kilometres. What they did was take a core sample of sediment from the sea bed in the lee region (the red star in the above images) and look back in time using climate proxies such as the titanium content – which can be considered a proxy for the how much of the sediment comes from the land.  The proxies tell us which species of plankton dominated the region in a particular period: if the sediment is dominated by species which live in open water then they can infer that the polynya existed and so the Mertz Glacier had a long tongue extending north. If the sediment is dominated by species which live in the sea ice, then the polynya and the glacier tongue were absent. It is quite an elegant way to investigate glacier flow.  What they found is that every 70 or so years the Mertz polynya is absent for tens of years. Given that the glacier is advancing about 1 km per year this means a super-iceberg tens of kilometres in length has regularly formed in this region. These days we can see this happen in almost real time through the amazing access we have to satellite imagery and in February 2010 an iceberg containing almost 900 billion tonnes of fresh water broke free. You may think it would drift north, away from the continent, but icebergs this big don’t have an easy path. They crash and bounce along any relatively shallow region of the sea floor and wipe out anything in their way. Most people know trawling harms the sea floor; imagine the trail of damage 900 billion tonnes of ice scraping on the sea floor can leave. Very large icebergs get identifying codes; this one became C28 as it was the 28th large iceberg from this sector of Antarctica. It took two months for C28 to reach the deep water before it shattered into two pieces (C28A and C28B since you ask) both still massive, and both went on to spawn further icebergs as they fractured into ever smaller pieces over the next few years. When still close to shore these giant bergs are bad news for penguins, who suddenly have to travel much further – around the iceberg – to find open sea, and their food. Chicks growing up near a massive iceberg may starve and die and some entire colonies may become unviable. As they drift away these huge icebergs create their own habitat cooling the seas and freshening the waters, and also seeding the oceans with iron which means more algae and plankton at the bottom of the food chain in remote locations such as South Georgia, where icebergs run aground and die.  Over the past 50 or so years the robust cycle of growth and decay in the Mertz glacier has broken down. The researchers think this is due to large-scale changes in the way the wind circulates over Antarctica – the so-called Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Other studies have shown us that the way the SAM has changed over recent decades has an anthropogenic footprint. It seems even in Antarctica we can identify human impacts on climate processes that are likely to have been operating for thousands of years.",2020-12-19T19:34:53.543289Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:51:55.865210Z,1033,119,,"It was more than 100F (38C) in the attic where telephone technician Brent Robinson was working. The 55-year-old, who had worked for 30 years at Verizon, was installing a phone service for a residential customer in Rancho Cucamonga, 40 miles east of Los Angeles in southern California. He had been out for days sick earlier in the week. After he finished the job in Rancho Cucamonga, he collapsed in the car park of a grocery store where he had gone for a cool drink; paramedics could not revive him. Robinson, who died in 2011, is one of dozens of workers who die every year because of heat exposure. In 2018, 60 workers died due to temperature extremes, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data on workplace fatalities. Though the climate crisis is creating conditions where workers are facing hotter temperatures on a more frequent basis, there are no federal safety protections for workers in extreme temperatures, and only three states, California, Washington and Minnesota, have heat stress workplace protection standards. The fatality was one of several over that decade suffered by telecommunications technicians on the job. According to the CWA, it was the last fatality since the union began pushing to include heat stress workplace standards in collective bargaining agreements. “Unfortunately these catastrophic events have to occur to get employer’s adequate attention,” said David LeGrande, now retired Occupational Safety & Health Director for the CWA. The CWA represented Robinson at Verizon at the time of the incident, and LeGrande was one of the leads involved with the union’s investigation of Robinson’s death. LeGrande said: “We are, to my knowledge, the first union that has negotiated protective language with employers. That has been carried out on a national basis.” Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. According to projections conducted by the not-for-profit organization Climate Central, the number of dangerous heat days for 133 US cities, will increase from 20 a year on average in 2000 to 58 in 2050. A dangerous heat day is defined as one in which the heat index, accounting for heat and humidity, exceeds 104F (40C). “Climate change means it’s only getting hotter, and workers are at exposure for all kinds of excessive heat,” Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman from California, told the Guardian. Earlier this year, she introduced the Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act of 2019, which would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) to issue and enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job. Chu said: “It all started when I was in the California state assembly. The United Farm Workers came to me about the situation with Asuncion Valdivia. He was a farmworker picking grapes for 10 hours straight when he collapsed in 105F temperatures. “Instead of having any kind of proper treatment for him, a supervisor told his son to take him home. They didn’t even call an ambulance. On the way home, the son saw his father foam at the mouth, fall over and die. So the son had to watch his father die of a preventable heat stroke.” In the California state assembly, Chu authored a bill for the California division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/Osha) to enforce heat standard protections for outdoor workers, which passed in 2005, making California the first state in the US to mandate employers to provide workers with periods of rest, shade and adequate water while doing outdoor work. In 2015, the state of California settled two lawsuits brought by the United Farm Workers. “Those called for greater protections for all outdoor workers in high heat temperatures and also called for establishing a mechanism where farmworkers can call us directly to report complaints to CalL/Osha,” said Marichel Meija, national field coordinator for the United Farm Workers Foundation. “We now have regular communications with Cal/Osha to ensure situations are investigated.” Now the United Farm Workers and several other organizations are pushing for similar standards to be enforced across the US. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1992 and 2016, 783 workers in the US died and more than 69,000 workers suffered serious injuries due to heat exposure on the job, though labor advocates argue the real numbers are even higher due to widespread under-reporting and employers misclassifying worker deaths as non-work-related. “We’ve had issues where workers are not classified as dying because of their job when we know that is the case,” said Rebecca Reindel, senior safety and health specialist at the AFL-CIO union federation. “With heat you’re running into a lot of vulnerable workers, immigrant workers, where employers will pass it off, say something else happened, and no one is following up and that person’s family don’t know their rights to get it classified as a workplace fatality.” As workers in the US are facing workplace environments that are getting hotter, and experiencing extreme temperatures more frequently, critics say the Trump administration has refused to address the problem. In an April 2019 report, the AFL-CIO noted federal Osha’s inspections related to heat declined by 49% under the Trump administration’s first two fiscal years in office. More than 130 organizations petitioned Osha in 2018 to develop federal heat standards, with Chu prompted by the agency’s inaction to introduce legislation in Congress. “This bill would have such a high impact for so many workers forced to work every day in conditions they can’t control,” said Reindel of the AFL-CIO union federation. “It’s a structure to identify the hazards. These programs are really good because workers are part of the process, and when workers are part of the process that’s when you get to the root of the problem.” According to an Osha spokesperson, the agency launches a heat awareness campaign annually the Friday before Memorial Day, has been educating employers and workers about the dangers of working in heat since 2011, and in 2017 helped update an app for heat safety. The agency did not respond to requests for comment on petitions calling the agency to enact federal heat safety standards.",2020-12-19T19:51:55.865243Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:25:47.591353Z,1034,119,,"Greta Thunberg summed up 2019 in five words: “Our house is on fire.” In Australia, this is now literally the case. Wildfires there have been raging for more than a month and now span an area larger than Switzerland. The situation bears all the hallmarks of a hot new world: lives lost, livelihoods ruined and species pushed towards extinction, accompanied by government inaction, industry PR spin, abetting rightwing echo chambers, and taxpayers footing the multibillion-dollar bill. Insanely, the Australian government remains in denial – ignoring the science, downplaying the seriousness and subservient to coal. The fossil fuel industry, meanwhile, is busy greenwashing and gaslighting: Chevron is boasting about its $1m donation – 0.00667% of its annual earnings – to the Australian Red Cross, and Exxon Australia just wants everyone to “Stay safe and have fun”. All this is set to a backdrop of mutually reinforcing rightwing new outlets, online bots and trolls, which are distracting and misinforming the public about the science and politics of climate-catalyzed fires. The charity of everyday people (and some celebrities) rising to meet the disaster has been inspiring and essential. Yet, tragically, it also unintentionally serves to reinforce the false narrative, perpetuated by fossil fuel propagandists, that we are all equally to blame. In reality, today’s climate chaos is big oil’s legacy, not ours. Unlike the rest of us, the fossil fuel industry saw this climate chaos coming, then literally and figuratively added fuel to the fire, doubling down on a business model incompatible with the science of stopping global warming; buying political inaction; and building a global climate denial and delay machine that has confused the public and fomented distrust of science, media and government. In October last year, the US Congress began to investigate this history. Before a packed audience at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled Examining the Oil Industry’s Efforts to Suppress the Truth about Climate Change, the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the climate scientist Dr Martin Hoffert about his collaborative research with Exxon in the 1980s. “So in 1982,” she said, referring to a recently uncovered internal company memo containing a graph of global carbon dioxide and temperature levels rising over time, “1982 – seven years before I was even born – Exxon accurately predicted that by this year, 2019, the Earth would hit a carbon dioxide concentration of 415 parts per million and a temperature increase of 1C. Dr Hoffert, is that correct?” “We were excellent scientists,” answered the former New York University physics professor, triggering laughter from the audience. “Yes, you were; yes, you were,” the congresswoman agreed. “So they knew.” This was the first time that Congress – indeed, any legislative body in the world – had heard a firsthand account – from someone who was actually involved in the work – of just how much, and how early, the fossil fuel industry knew of the potential global warming dangers of its products. The event showed how effective such hearings can be. In the space of a couple of hours, expert witness testimony (including by one of us) and thousands of pages of documented evidence entered the congressional record. Masterful questioning helped translate a key whistleblower’s knowledge into a viral C-Span moment. It was just one hearing, but it had the makings of the tobacco industry investigations led by Representative Henry Waxman in the 1990s. He could just as easily have been speaking about fossil fuels when he described the purpose of that congressional oversight: “To build a public record and eventually create enough momentum in Congress and among the American public for legislation.” Our message to Congress after its first foray into investigating fossil fuels is this: keep going. Because big oil is the new big tobacco. Investigative journalism and peer-reviewed research, including our own, clearly demonstrate that the fossil fuel regime has deliberately denied Americans and Congress their right to be accurately informed about the climate crisis, just as tobacco companies misled Americans about the harms of smoking. From strategy to networks to personnel to rhetoric, the fossil fuel regime’s efforts to deny and delay come straight out of big tobacco’s playbook. The historical record is incontrovertible. As we summarize in a recent report, the fossil fuel industry’s own internal documents reveal that it has been studying CO2 pollution for more than 60 years. As early as the 1950s, it knew its products had the potential to change the climate. By the late 1970s and early 80s, Exxon scientists were explicitly aware that burning fossil fuels could lead to what they called “catastrophic” global warming. In 1986, an internal “greenhouse effect working group” at Shell concluded: “The changes in climate … may be the greatest in recorded history.” For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, we are still only looking through the keyhole But instead of taking action or warning the public, fossil fuel interests stayed quiet. Then, in the late 1980s and early 90s, when global warming finally caught the world’s attention, the carbon majors sprang to action and took the low road, spending billions of dollars over the next 30 years on advertising and lobbying challenging science, slandering scientists and attacking policies to protect their profits. In so doing, they have undermined – and continue to undermine – Americans’ chances of a just and stable future. Today, the case for subterfuge is so strong that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 14 US cities and counties have variously sued ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies for fraud, damages or denial. Maui and Honolulu have recently added their intentions to file lawsuits. In Australia, there are mounting calls to make polluters, not just taxpayers, pay for wildfire relief and climate mitigation. For all the skeletons we have already found in big oil’s closet, however, we are still only looking through the keyhole. Tracking down a few hundred documents has allowed us to uncover some key cogs in the climate denial machine. Yet it is a sprawling, well-funded, well-oiled network that stretches far beyond ExxonMobil and the Kochs: a labyrinth of people and money connecting fossil fuel companies, utilities, ancillary manufacturers, trade associations, PR firms, advertising agencies, libertarian foundations, thinktanks, legal firms and individuals, all feeding an echo chamber of pundits, astroturf groups, blogs, media and, yes, politicians. Network analysis has identified at least 4,556 individuals and 164 organizations in the global web of denial. We believe the American public deserve to know the truth – and see the receipts – of these dealings that have already led to deaths, destruction and the injustices of a collapsing climate. This is where congressional authority to request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas, comes in. Key breakthroughs in tobacco control came as congressional investigations – as well as legal discovery and industry whistleblowers – exposed thousands, and ultimately millions, of damning documents. The tobacco industry was found guilty of racketeering in part because of the ways that individual companies had coordinated with each other and with third-party allies to present false information to consumers. That history is a precedent for Congress to investigate an industry network that has misled the public and policymakers in an effort to deny the dangers of its products and derail regulation. As the congressional scholar Morton Rosenberg recently testified in the Senate: “Congress and its committees have virtually plenary power to compel production of information needed to discharge their legislative functions.” We are not politicians or political strategists, so we do not presume to dictate how Congress exercises its investigatory powers. But as experts in the history of climate denial and global warming politics, it is our opinion that holding the fossil fuel industry accountable would be one of the most impactful ways for Congress – and governments around the world – to combat the climate crisis. Impeachment investigations understandably occupy much attention. Unfortunately, irreversible global warming and the fossil fuel regime underwriting it will be even harder to unseat than a president, and time is not on our side. Geoffrey Supran is a research associate in the department of the history of science at Harvard University, where he investigates the tactics of fossil fuel interests. He previously co-led the fossil fuel divestment campaign at MIT, as well as the first major scientist protests against the Trump administration Naomi Oreskes is professor of the history of science at Harvard University and the co-author, with Erik M Conway, of Merchants of Doubt and The Collapse of Western Civilization",2020-12-21T17:25:47.591386Z,1

Although this incredible beech, found on the National Trust’s Devil’s Dyke estate, is slightly taller than the previous champion – another of this genus in Gloucestershire – these are not actually the tallest living trees in Britain but the tallest native trees – ones known to have been growing in Britain since the last ice age.  If we included all trees – native or those introduced at a later date – there would be others in the running. Currently the tallest tree growing in the UK is a Douglas fir growing in Reelig Glen, near Inverness which measures just over a massive 66 metres. Height, of course, is not the only thing that can make a tree stand out. Other categories competing for most impressive tree include age and mythology. Here are four others that fit the bill. When Nottinghamshire residents go just about anywhere in the world and explain where they live, the immediate response is “Aaah! Robin Hood!”  Famous around the world for harbouring the infamous folk hero, the “Major Oak” is one of Britain’s oldest oak trees. No one is sure exactly how old it is but estimates of 800 to 1,000-years-old mean that it has survived through at least eight centuries of change. The major is a fine example of Quercus robur, or the English Oak, and brings thousands of tourists to Sherwood Forest every year. Sadly visitors can no longer climb inside the tree as it is now fenced off and to prevent them from falling, the massive branches are propped up on large poles.  It is debatable whether Robin and his Merry Men did actually hide inside this tree but keeping things inside it has been recorded several times during its history, initially as the “Cockpen Tree” when it was used to contain birds before a cock fight. It was only named the Major Oak in the late 1700s after Major Hayman Rooke, the local historian who described it. In the 19th century it was known for a while as the “Queen Oak”. Nottinghamshire is also home to the original Bramley apple tree. Bramleys are large, sour apples well known all over the world for their cooking quality, and they all descend from one 200-year-old tree which still exists today. The tree was first grown from a pip in 1809 in a back garden in Southwell by a young local girl called Mary Ann Brailsford. Once the quality of the fruit had been noted in the 1860s the tree was propagated by Merryweather’s Nursery, also in Southwell.  It’s astonishing to imagine that every single Bramley apple tree across the world has been cloned from this original tree (or indeed from a clone of a clone of a clone of this original tree)  originally grown from a pip so many years ago by a little girl. Although the original was grown from seed, new Bramley apple trees are grafted onto another type of apple tree to help reproduce them. Bramleys are also sterile, able to receive pollen but not able to pollinate other Bramleys themselves. This is because they have an extra set of chromosomes, which means they need two other different types of apple tree to pollinate – otherwise their apples won’t grow and swell. We have to move along to Wales to see Britain’s oldest tree, a 5,000-year-old yew growing in St Cynog’s churchyard at Defynnog near Sennybridge, Powys.   It’s not surprising that this is a yew, as these conifers have an amazing ability to regenerate. For centuries yews have been known as the “tree of life” due to their longevity. When the centre dies away and they become hollow, the cylindrical shape of the trunk is actually amazingly strong and is still able to support the massive crown of the tree.  Yew trees have been long associated with churches and graveyards and in ancient legends they were associated with immortality. In Wales the tradition of the yew as such a symbol is linked with ancient Druid beliefs and customs, and was often a meeting place where rituals and festivities took place. Finally, the award for the tree with the widest trunk goes to another English Oak with an amazing 12-metre circumference. This tree is known as the “Majesty” and is growing in Fredville Park, in Kent. Although the tree is completely hollow, the trunk has not split. One journal entry recorded a visit to the tree in 1793: Call on John Plumtree, Esq. of Fredville, who very politely shews us his famous oak, called Majesty - measure this tree; 4 feet from the ground the circumference is 31 feet; it is supposed to contain from 36 to 42 tons of timber. Two branches separated from this tree about four years ago, in a calm day, which contained three tons of timber. Another oak, called Beauty, 14 tons of timber; girt, 4 feet from the ground, 16 feet 4 inches, is 63 feet high, perfectly straight, and a beauty indeed!",2020-12-22T12:52:40.500150Z,1

The post-2013 “relatively stable” ice sheet even gained mass during 2017-’18 (Andersen et al., 2019).

Ruan et al., 2019    
Decelerated Greenland Ice Sheet Melt Driven
by Positive Summer North Atlantic Oscillation
“The GrIS lost mass at a rate of about -102 Gt/yr in early 2003, increased to -393 Gt/yr during 2012-2013, but suddenly reduced to no more than 75 Gt/yr during 2013-2014 (Bevis et al., 2019). It is suggested that this deceleration is due to the increased snowfall accumulation driven by the positive phase of summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO; Folland et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2015).”
“It is shown that the deceleration of GrIS melting since 2013 is due to the reduction in short-wave solar radiation in the presence of increasing total cloud cover, which is driven by a more persistent positive summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO) on the decadal time scale.”
“After an extreme year of the GrIS mass loss in 2012 (Tedsco et al., 2013; Nghiem et al., 2012) the rate of mass loss dramatically decreased since 2013 and has returned to about the same level (or even less) as was observed during 2004-2005. This indicates that the deceleration in GrIS mass loss since 2013 is mostly attributable to a reduction in the total mass loss during the summer season.”
“[T]he total cloud cover decreased with a rate of around 0.5% per year before 2013 in most of Greenland except the northeast area. As a result, the melt-albedo feedback is enhanced (Hofer et al., 2017) and the increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone leads to accelerated melt of the GrIS (Box et al., 2012; Van-Angelen et al., 2012; Franco et al., 2013). Since 2013, the total cloud cover over most of southeast Greenland increased at a rate of more than 0.1% per year.”
“The lower SLP over Greenland is also consistent with the dramatic cooling of the northern North Atlantic Ocean during the same period. On the surface, the mean summer sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre is more than 2ºC colder than the SST during 2003-2013; in the upper 300m, the volume mean ocean temperature is nearly 1.6ºC less (Fig. 6). The cooling of the ocean is not only helpful for the atmospheric configuration over the Greenland, but also favorable for the reduction of mass loss due to warmer water intrusion into the marine-terminated glaciers, though the latter process explains only around 30-50 Gt of the total mass budget of the GrIS (Zwally et al., 2002; Box et al., 2009; Tedstone et al., 2013).”


Andersen et al., 2019
Update of annual calving front lines for 47 marine
terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland (1999–2018)
“Currently, the mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is the largest Arctic contributor to global sea-level rise (van den Broeke et al. 2009, 2017; Box et al. 2018).”
“The period 2007–2012 underwent a rapid loss of glacier area, compared to 2013–2018, in which glacier area was relatively stable, associated with a small area change. The year 2017–2018 stands out as the only period with net area gain (+4.1 km2).”

It’s time to take the debate away from the extreme factions and to move it to cooler heads, says veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann
Former German Public television meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann wrote an essay commentary for the Swiss online Die Weltwoche here titled “Tell me where you stand”, where he compares today’s white-hot intolerance seen in climate science to the political intolerance witnessed in former communist East Germany.
“Religious furor”
In East Germany, either you adhered to the state’s hard communist doctrine, or you were the enemy. Such is the atmosphere we see today in climate science. Kachelmann writes: “Again today it’s either-or, and nothing in between.”
“Debates are important, and we must conduct them with arguments and without the religious furor that is being practiced today by both sides.”
The veteran meteorologist describes how on the climate issue “there are two irreconcilable camps”: the climate deniers and climate hysterics – each arrogantly claiming “infallibility”. It is no longer possible to be in between. Even those in between get insulted and attacked equally by both sides.
Natural science at schools have been “almost completely gutted”
While Kachelmann writes “deniers” are mostly older, right wing persons, the alarmists are made up of mostly “ugly young people” who are the products of school systems that have had their “natural science subjects almost completely gutted out”.
“These people don’t need graphs, but rather the godlike feeling of being on the correct side, which is why you don’t have to be so precise with facts,” Kachelmann comments.
“Today, the divining militancy of both sides is preventing a serious debate on priorities,” He says. “The green and brown nuts try to recruit for their political advantage those who have a big opinion on the subject, but no idea about it.”
Academic (green) supremacists
One example of the militant intolerance Kachelmann describes is illustrated by a recent Twitter comment by Potsdam scientist Stefan Rahmstorf, who reacted to German parliamentarian Philipp Lengsfeld, who earlier had tweeted on a “remarkable” statement recently published by 90 leading Italian scientists who challenged the alarmist climate science and claims of consensus.

That comment by Lengsfeld was obviously too much for Rahmstorf, who was obviously unnerved that a parliamentarian would make such an observation. He not only attacks Lengsfeld and this site here, but he also insults and slanders the 70 Italian scientists.
His Twitter comment in English:
It is particularly noteworthy when a member of parliament cannot distinguish a climate denier website from serious science and falls for a list of signatures by predominantly unprofessional and emeritus people – even more untrustworthy than the lung physicians.”
In Rahmstorf’s view, anyone who challenges the Potsdam alarmist climate position is an enemy of the climate state, and any scientist who questions the science is equivalent to a tobacco scientist.
Yes, its’ time to move the debate and science over to moderate voices.

,2020-12-21T17:28:54.617905Z,1040,120,,"A mission to Mars has captured the public’s imagination and the possibility of making that second small step has never seemed so close. Current NASA plans include sending humans to the red planet as early as the 2030s.  Should we ever establish colonies on Mars, we’d need to build power generation engines. This would imply finding energy sources and working substances to convert heat into useful energy. Now, in research published in the journal Nature Communications, my colleagues and I have found a way to make this happen using a substance easily found on the planet: the solid form of carbon dioxide, known as dry ice. We have developed an engine which can harvest energy from dry ice as it turns from solid into gas. For Martian exploration, it could be a game changer. To understand why, let’s go back to Earth for a moment. Here, we use water to turn the energy stored in coal, oil or gas into useful mechanical or electrical energy through what is known as a “heat engine”. In a steam engine, the most common form of heat engine, fuel is used to heat up water which then vapourises into high-pressure steam. This steam then powers a turbine to generate electricity, or a locomotive engine to create motion. Water is an ideal substance to use as it is widely available and cheap, and it is capable of undergoing a phase change (from liquid to vapour) within temperature ranges that are easily achievable with our current technology on Earth.  This whole situation changes dramatically on Mars; although water is still available on the surface of the red planet, it is locked in solid form. Heating it to melting point and then to boiling point to use it as a working substance requires a lot of energy.  However Martian dry ice already exists close to its “sublimation point” – the temperature at which it turns directly from solid to gas. It therefore only takes a relatively small nudge for dry ice to change states. The challenge is to harness the energy released by this change to power a heat engine – or even a whole colony. We turned to a common scientific effect you’ve probably noticed before in your kitchen. When a water droplet is placed on a hot surface held above 100ºC it boils off, creating steam. However when the surface is heated above a certain temperature, known as the Leidenfrost point, the water no longer boils away. Instead, the drop sits on a layer of its own vapour and levitates on top of the surface. This is known as the Leidenfrost effect. This same effect allows dry ice to levitate freely on top of solid surfaces, as it directly changes from solid to vapour and therefore it too is kept afloat by a layer of newly-formed gas. We can put this to use. By placing water droplets and small blocks of dry ice on top of hot, turbine-like surfaces, we have used the Leidenfrost effect to create rotational motion. The turbines channel the released vapour, whose flow in turn drives the levitating surface above to rotate. In a series of experiments, we have shown that carbon dioxide is a viable working substance for heat engines. By channelling the vapour released upon sublimation of dry ice discs on top of turbine-like surfaces, we have been able to use dry ice to power an electrical generator. Crucially, the vapour produced by the dry ice discs generates enough pressure to overcome gravity, lifting the disc off the turbine surface through the Leidenfrost effect. The discs thus become levitating rotors, meaning the engine is extremely low-friction.  You won’t find solid dry ice occurring naturally here on Earth. However satellite images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show the situation is very different on the surface of Mars where large gullies can be found, about 2 km in length. These structures are very different from Earth’s water gullies.  Instead of fanning out at their bottom end as you would expect from a gully created by water, Mars’ gullies end in a pit-shaped apron. NASA scientists have recently shown that such shapes might be caused by gliding boulders of solid dry ice, which sublimate (turn to gas) as temperatures rise in the Martian summer. Carbon dioxide thus plays a similar role on Mars to water on Earth. It is a widely available resource which undergoes cyclic phase changes under the natural Martian temperature variations. Perhaps future power stations on Mars will exploit all this CO2 to harvest the energy from the sublimation phase change as dry-ice blocks evaporate, or to channel the chemical energy extracted from other carbon-based sources, such as methane gas. One thing is certain; our future on other planets depends on our ability to adapt our knowledge to the constraints imposed by strange worlds, and to devise creative ways to exploit resources that do not naturally occur here on Earth.",2020-12-21T17:28:54.617938Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:13:59.670161Z,1041,120,,"Almost all of us walk somewhere every day of our lives. According to the UK’s most recent National Travel Survey 22% of all trips are undertaken on foot – and walking continues to be the second-most important form of transport for all journeys after travel by car or van. For short trips of less than a mile, walking is totally dominant accounting for over 78% of all such travel. One third of all trips less than five miles in length are also on foot.  By contrast, cycling accounts for just 1.5% of all journeys. Even if we only look at all trips under five miles, cycling still makes up less than 2% of journeys.  But you wouldn’t get this impression from listening to politicians, reading policy documents, or observing investment in infrastructure. While both cycling and walking improve personal health and the environment, one gets far more attention than the other. The government has just released its response to a major consultation on its “vision for cycling and walking”, for instance. The document’s name? Cycling Delivery Plan. Although walking is given some consideration in the detail of the document, the priority is clear. While cycling is being actively promoted as a healthy and sustainable form of urban transport, walking remains largely neglected in terms of active policy and investment. Look at London’s “cycle superhighways”, for instance, announced earlier this year to much fanfare. These highways follow significant increases in trips by bike in central London following investment in new infrastructure promoted by the London mayor.  Such investment is of course welcome and long overdue, and much remains to be done as cycle infrastructure remains poor in most other parts of the country. But the fact cycling is beginning to be considered an important form of urban transport that needs to be planned for highlights the fact that travel on foot is not given such recognition. It can, of course, be argued that pedestrians do already have their own dedicated infrastructure – in urban areas at least – in the form of pavements, pedestrian zones, and crossings. For the most part we accept these conditions as adequate and do not question how they might be better, however a closer look suggests that this is rarely the case.  In most locations, road space continues to be dominated by, and planned for, motor vehicles and people on foot are crammed on to pavements that are often too narrow. Pedestrians are made to wait for long periods to cross busy roads, exposed to traffic noise and emissions, and then given insufficient time to cross before the lights change to keep the traffic moving.  Poorly placed (and often unnecessary) street furniture, together with inconsiderately (and potentially illegally) parked cars often obstruct the pavement, while pedestrian surfaces are often poorly maintained and rarely cleared of leaves or snow and ice. Try to negotiate the average urban pavement with a child’s buggy or in a wheelchair and the difficulties become all too obvious. Poor pedestrian infrastructure disadvantages all those who do not have access to, or choose not to use, a motor vehicle. We’ve got into this situation because walking is taken for granted. Such a simple activity has been largely ignored in the planning process; it is seen as making few demands on the environment and thus needs only a minimum of facilities. In contrast, because motor vehicles make much greater demands on the environment their needs have been prioritised.  Pedestrians also suffer from being classed as “walkers” – those who walk for pleasure rather than as a means of transport. The cultural dominance and convenience of the motor vehicle has meant that urban space has been disproportionately allocated towards cars and away from pedestrians. When walking for anything other than recreation is increasingly seen as abnormal, cars will always win.  I recently headed some research in four English cities which clearly demonstrated this. As one respondent in Leeds said “you feel unusual walking”. Most respondents enjoyed walking, and did walk sometimes, but they frequently encountered unnecessary difficulties and inconveniences. The problem was summarised neatly by a Lancaster respondent: “That road is awful, the pavement is very narrow, and in autumn it’s covered in leaves so you slip over half the time, it’s terrifying. But by car the road is fine”. Walking is a cheap, simple, healthy and environmentally friendly way of travelling short distances. It is something most people enjoy doing, but our cities are built in ways that often make life difficult and unpleasant for pedestrians.  Walking needs to be taken more seriously as a means of transport (and not only as a form of exercise or leisure) – and should be actively planned for and given priority, as is beginning to happen with cycling. If more people walked and fewer people drove, it would not only benefit personal health but also cities would be more pleasant for all.",2020-12-19T16:13:59.670195Z,1

NASA GISS likes to go back in history and alter the temperature figures from recorded datasets from all around the world, and then declare global warming.
Yet when we examine the (real) unadjusted, unaltered data, we find an entirely different story: In many places there has been little or even no warming over the recent decades. Many locations have seen cooling, in fact.
For example, using the data from the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), I checked 12 France stations which have August temperature data going back to 1982. Seven of 12 stations show August temperatures there have not warmed since 1990!

France August temperatures haven’t risen in almost 3 decades. Data source: JMA.
Looking at the 6 stations that have complete data going back to 1996 in the Scandinavian country of Finland, we also see the same story for August:

Three of 6 Finland stations have seen a cooling trend for August since 1996. The warming at the other three are statistically insignificant. Data source: JMA.
In neighboring Sweden we also find 6 stations for which the JMA has almost complete data going back over 2 decades:

Six stations in Sweden show a cooling trend for August since 1995. Data: JMA
These show no warming as well.
So when we look at the untampered data at stations in Europe, we find that there has not been any warming over the past recent decades. The story is the same at many stations scattered around the globe.
NASA GISS claims that warming has occurred because it simply changed the data to make it appear that way. Real data tell a different story.

Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning puts German ARD broadcasting’s feet to the climate fire. Photo. Die kalte Sonne.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning wrote a complaint to German ARD public broadcasting concerning its December 2, 2018, one-sided reporting of the Indian island of Ghoramara and the sea level rise it is allegedly experiencing. The €6.9 billion euro publicly funded, 22,612-employee ARD is the German equivalent to the UK’s BBC.
What follows is the exchange between Lüning and the ARD editorial staff:
======================================
From: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
To: NDR Rundfunkrat
Date: 3 December 2018
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
On December 2, 2018, you reported on the Tagesschau.de evening news on the Indian island of Ghoramara, which according to your report is “sinking into the sea” due to climate change.
https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/indien-klima-ghoramara-101.html
In concrete terms, the report cites rising sea levels as the only cause. This, however, distorts the facts, as the shrinking of the island actually has a number of reasons. Although the globally rising sea level plays a role, other processes are much more important, which your correspondent Bernd Musch-Borowska fails to mention a single word about and thus ultimately over-dramatizes the role of climate change. This is all the more regrettable because the report appeared on the first day of the Katowice Climate Conference and thus casts the technical robustness of your reporting in to doubt.
In view of the enormous importance of climate change in the public debate, you should make additional efforts to avoid such one-sided and technically unbalanced presentations in your program, e.g. by consulting experts before publication.
The island of Ghoramara lies at the mouth of the Ganges. As in many deltas of the earth, strong currents prevail here, which lead to a constant rearrangement of sediment and a systematic shifting of the islands. Similar coastal dynamic processes can be observed in the area of the East Frisian Islands.
The island of Ghoramara and neighboring islands in the Sundarbans have therefore always been exposed to major morphological changes. In addition, there is a rate of subsidence of several millimeters per year, which is also typical for deltas, an amount which even exceeds the global (eustatic) sea-level rise of 2-3 millimeters per year. In addition, the construction of several dams in the catchment area of the Ganges has led to a reduced sediment load in the river and delta, further exacerbating erosion.
Also activities on the island of Ghoramara have made the problem worse. Strong groundwater removal has led to an additional compaction and lowering of the island. In addition, the islanders have removed part of the protective mangrove vegetation in the process of creating additional arable land, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion during storms.
If you are interested, I would be happy to provide you with the relevant technical literature.
The Tagesschau article falsely suggests that sea-level rise is the main problem for Ghoramara. This is wrong. What is true is that the shrinking of the island of Ghoramara has a variety of causes, which can be divided into 1) natural, 2) non-climatic anthropogenic and 3) climatic anthropogenic causes. I would therefore like to ask you – at the same place as the original report – to list the complete range of causes so as not to provide a basis for accusations of climate dramatization on the occasion of the current climate conference in Katowice.
Best regards,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning

Date: 10 January 2019
Dear Dr. Nenz,
Dear Dr. Gniffke,
Thank you for sending the statement. Of course, the answer is not satisfactory, because you reply to my accusation of selective and distorted reporting by claiming that the climate conference and the scarcity of the reporting justify the deliberate omission of important contextual information. The incomplete presentation, however, automatically leads to an artificial dramatization. Ultimately, it is deliberate cherry-picking.
The editorial team is thus in the same line as the former editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Christopher Schrader, who in your program ZAPP openly admitted that in his articles he follows a personal mission and prefers to leave scientific uncertainties unmentioned in order to prevent citizens from becoming unrestful and doubting the energy revolution.
https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/zapp/Von-wegen-Klima-Wissenschaftsjournalisten-wettern,klima302.html
I was also surprised that another mistake had crept into your answer. You wrote that there are “more violent and more frequent storms” in the area of the Indian island of Ghoramara due to climate change. This is also wrong, especially as it is not even claimed in your original article. Studies in the northern Indian Ocean have not found a trend in tropical cyclones for the last three decades. See Hoarau et al. 2012:

It would be really important that you introduce quality assurance measures in your ARD editorial office in the area of climate change reporting in order to avoid such obvious mistakes and distortions. As you may know, this is not the first case. As an example, I would like to mention your reporting on the warming of the North Sea in 2017:
http://www.kaltesonne.de/um-antwort-wird-gebeten-der-fall-nordsee-erwarmung/
For the sake of transparency, I would also like to ask you to allow us to publish your Ghoramara statement on the website www.kaltesonne.de.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning
Again the ARD editors followed by dodging the facts of their poor reporting in a response to Lüning’s message above, even going so far as to deny everything. What follows is their response to Lünings accusations:
From: Dr. Kai Gniffke (Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell)
To: Dr. Sebastian Lüning
Date: 25 January 2019
Dear Dr. Lüning,
We regret that our detailed response to your program complaint was not satisfactory from your point of view. As we have already stated in the opinion, we believe that the situation of Ghoramara has been accurately described in the criticized report. In principle, not all aspects of a complex issue can be presented in a single contribution. We understand your comments as a suggestion and have already written that an in-depth consideration, for example in the context of a longer radio feature, is conceivable.
In your reply, you also mentioned our report on the warming of the North Sea in 2017, which you also criticized. We refer you to our corresponding statement, which you had already published on your website. You are also welcome to publish our most recent statement there.
We thank you for your comments and assure you that we will continue to report on climate change and its impacts.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. Kai Gniffke
First Editor-in-Chief ARD-aktuell
Clearly the ARD’s reporting was sloppy and intentionally one-sided with the aim of generating climate urgency. And the reactions by its editors told us us they had no plans to change anything with regards to quality control and its obligations to viewers.
But today, months later, Die kalte Sonne here informs that ARD editor Kai Gniffke has left the ARD. But don’t expect the quality of climate science reporting to improve at ARD any time soon.

This year marks the 50th Davos but there is not exactly a party mood. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow, is “committed to improving the state of the world” but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s. Not in every way, obviously. The percentage of the world’s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply, largely because of rapid growth in China and India. The gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution. Living standards have risen, whether measured by incomes per head, life expectancy or technical progress. There were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that China has become. Under Mao, China was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off. Nobody had the slightest interest in China’s growth rate or its trade policy. A small group of developed countries – led by the US – accounted for the lion’s share of global GDP and called all the shots. That is no longer the case. By the early 70s, the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end. The Bretton Woods currency system, held together by the link between the US dollar and gold, would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the American economy caused by the cost of the Vietnam war and higher domestic spending. The mood music does not seem to have changed all that much. The 2020 Davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming. It is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007-09 but the recovery has been tepid. Wage growth, investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor. Financial markets look dangerously overvalued. So why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971? Well, for a start there seemed a simple – if harsh – way out of the economic problems associated with the end of Bretton Woods. Inflation, according to economists such as Milton Friedman, was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges. The answer was to reduce budget deficits, to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks. This was broadly the system in place from the mid-1970s to the moment when everything went pear-shaped in 2008. At that point, there was something of a crash rethink. Interest rates were slashed, central banks pumped money into their economies, budget deficits were allowed to balloon. Yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened. The main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy. In the event of another crisis, central banks look to be short of conventional weapons. Tentatively, there are signs that fiscal policy – regulating the economy through tax and public spending – is making a comeback. In Britain, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, says interest rates are going to stay low for years to come, making it possible to borrow cheaply for long-term infrastructure projects. Clearly, the money could be put to good use. The big, inescapable difference between the 1971 Davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency. A flick through Fritz Schumacher’s seminal 1973 green text – Small is Beautiful – finds no mention of global heating. It simply was not a political issue back then. Now, of course, it is. Each year the WEF asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade. Unsurprisingly, against a backdrop of droughts, hurricanes, bushfires, melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet, for the first time the top five threats are all environmental. Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos and the WEF’s executive chairman, has written to all those attending this year’s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. An indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on Tuesday when Donald Trump drops by. What Trump should say – but won’t – is as follows: the US recognises the existential threat posed by global heating. It accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late. As a businessman, he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources. To that end, the White House is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due to be held in Glasgow at the end of this year. As the world’s biggest economy, the US will commit to stringent emissions targets, commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar Marshall Plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low-carbon future. Why? Because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism, now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself.",2020-12-19T16:14:21.291253Z,1
,2020-12-22T13:41:40.969153Z,1048,119,,"Efforts to reduce levels of one potent greenhouse gas appear to be failing, according to a study. Scientists had expected to find a dramatic reduction in levels of the hydrofluorocarbon HFC-23 in the atmosphere after India and China, two of the main sources, reported in 2017 that they had almost completely eliminated emissions.  But a paper published in the journal Nature Communications says that by 2018 concentrations of the gas – used in fridges and air conditioners – had not fallen but were increasing at a record rate. Matt Rigby, from Bristol University, who co-authored the study and is a member of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, said academics had hoped to see a big reduction following the reports from India and China. “This potent greenhouse gas has been growing rapidly in the atmosphere for decades now, and these reports suggested that the rise should have almost completely stopped in the space of two or three years. This would have been a big win for climate.” Scientists say the fact they found emissions had risen is a puzzle and could have implications for the Montreal protocol, an international treaty that was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer. Kieran Stanley, the lead author of the study, said that although China and India were not yet bound by the agreement, their reported reduction would have put them on course to be consistent with it. “Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,” he said. “However, without additional measurements, we can’t be sure whether India has been able to implement its abatement programme.” HFCs were hailed as an answer to the hole in the ozone layer that appeared over Antarctica in the 1980s because they replaced hundreds of chemical substances widely used in aerosols that depleted the thin layer of ozone that protects Earth from harmful rays from the sun. But in recent years there has been mounting concern at how the potent greenhouse gas was undermining efforts to keep global heating below dangerous levels. Scientists say one tonne of HFC-23 emissions is equivalent to the release of more than 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Experts estimate that had the HFC-23 emissions reductions been as large as reported, the equivalent of a year’s worth of Spain’s CO2 emissions would have been avoided between 2015 and 2017. • This article was amended on 6 February 2020 because HFC-23 is not used in inhalers, as an earlier version wrongly said. This has been corrected.",2020-12-22T13:41:40.969187Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:29:31.843454Z,1049,119,,"World leaders and business chiefs meeting in Davos this week will be confronted for the first time with an agenda on which the climate and ecological crises take top billing. Financial and economic concerns have been shunted down the list of priorities in favour of five environmental issues: climate breakdown and extreme weather; failure to mitigate or adapt to climate change; human-made pollution; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Green campaigners and social and human rights activists have been raising concerns on all of these for more than two decades, but it seems that finally the world’s powers are paying attention. In some cases it may be too late to act to avoid the consequences of the delay in taking action. Since 2015 when the landmark Paris agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen a further 4% and although there are signs the rate of increase may be slowing, that is nowhere near enough. Oceans are at the hottest ever recorded. Last year, ecological scientists said 1 million species were on the brink of extinction. The biomass of wild animals on the planet has fallen by more than 80%, about half of the area of key natural ecosystems has been lost, and insect populations have crashed, according to the report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that by 2030 the world must be on track or exceeding 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels would be all but inevitable. Warming has already topped 1C and 2019 was the second hottest year on record. As the Davos agenda shows, businesses are taking note. Ashim Paun, the global co-head of environmental, social, and governance research at HSBC, said: “Will 2020 be an inflexion point? Our investor clients increasingly think climate change is absolutely core to their investment processes. So this year we look to major political and policy developments – the details of the EU green deal in March, the outcome of elections, particularly the US where we see the outcome as fairly binary for climate, and whether this year’s climate talks in Glasgow [in November] can regain previous momentum.” There is plenty that all people around the world can do to get involved and shape the direction of this crunch decade. “2019 proved that activism works,” said Richard George, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace. “The amazing contributions from the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion, along with many others, got us a net zero target [in the UK and other countries], and almost universal agreement that not only is climate change happening but action to stop it is both vital and urgent. What we need now is real action to get the carbon out of our energy, transport, food and finance sectors, which means turning up the heat on politicians and corporations. This is the year to do it.” There will be international conferences this year on the climate, the oceans, biodiversity, deforestation and a host of other pressing environmental concerns. Many targets and deadlines for taking action are pegged to 2020, and governments and businesses will have to answer for any failure to meet those goals. The world is changing and leaders in all spheres are recognising that people are no longer willing to passively accept environmental destruction. Here’s what to look out for in 2020. Nearly five years have passed since the signing of the Paris agreement pledging to prevent global heating of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Since then, progress has stalled. Last year’s UN climate conference in Madrid ended inconclusively with no agreement on some basic aspects of implementing Paris. More importantly, countries’ commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 accord are inadequate to stay within the 2C limit and would lead to a disastrous 3C rise. That makes this year’s climate summit the biggest since Paris. Governments must come to COP26 in Glasgow in November armed with new emissions targets commensurate to the risk of climate breakdown. If Donald Trump is still in power, other countries must press ahead without the US and face down challenges to the Paris accord from Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia and others. That will be a massive struggle, and strong clear messages from civil society will be vital to its success. Trump has blasted through federal protections ranging from clean air and water to Alaskan drilling and pipeline construction, and if he wins a second term he is likely to continue on that track. In international terms his influence has been baleful on climate action: he started the formal process to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, and that decision that will come into effect the day after the presidential election on 3 November. COP26 begins on 9 November and the US delegation will be drawn from the Trump White House whatever the election outcome. British diplomats will be looking to use the supposedly friendly relationship between Trump and Boris Johnson to try to ensure the US does not play a disruptive role. Trump will also preside over the G7 meeting in June, which means environmental issues will be off the agenda. In some previous years, notably 2005-07, the then G8’s focus on the climate proved a valuable spur to progress in the UN climate talks. This year that will be missing. Plastic pollution, overfishing, overheating and acidification from climate change are driving a crisis in the oceans. The World Ocean Summit in early March in Tokyo will set out the latest science on ocean health and present possible solutions. Later that month, from 23 March to 3 April, comes the final scheduled meeting of the UN effort to draft a new global treaty on the seas. IGC4 aims to set out a new legally binding instrument on “the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction”. Ecosystems around the world, from the Amazon to the Antarctic, are on the verge of collapse owing to human encroachment and exploitation, pollution, water scarcity and the impacts of global heating.  Two meetings will focus attention on the loss of biodiversity and ways to stem further destruction. The World Conservation Congress in mid-June in Marseille is a four-yearly meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organisation that compiles the global red lists of endangered and threatened species. A series of meetings held under the UN convention on biological diversity will culminate in a meeting at Kunming, China, in October where progress – or the lack of it – on protecting wildlife and plants will be assessed. The current global biodiversity action plan runs from 2011 to 2020 and its key aims are likely to be missed. A new action plan for the next decade should be adopted at the Kunming conference. The Paris agreement was not the only major international achievement of 2015: there was also the signing of the UN sustainable development goals, a set of 17 plans to remedy social and environmental ills – including eliminating poverty and hunger, empowering women and girls, improving access to healthcare and education in developing countries, and providing access to clean water and sanitation. Most of the goals are pegged to 2030, and this year is a staging post to assess progress at the UN high-level political forum in New York in July. The last few years have seen a new wave of environmental activism targeting businesses, whether through divestment campaigns aimed at fossil fuel investors, arts sponsorship deals or direct action. That is likely to increase in 2020 as the impact has become clearer. BlackRock made an unprecedented decision last week to start stepping out of investments with a high climate risk, and other funds will come under pressure to follow suit. There are a variety of ways people can make their views known to company boards, from questioning their pension funds to joining protests or even becoming a shareholder. Globalisation has led to a massive increase in carbon from shipping, which now represents 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but will reach 17% by 2050 if unchecked. But shipping has been deliberately excluded from UN climate negotiations and little progress has been made in the last two decades on cutting greenhouse gases from one of the dirtiest forms of transport. At the International Maritime Organisation meeting in March in London, countries are supposed to come up with a new way forward to fulfil the UN agency’s aims of halving shipping emissions by mid-century – a goal that campaigners say is still inadequate. Last year Extinction Rebellion led effective protests. This year, decisions deferred last year will come back to the agenda. In 2010, companies from around the world joined forces on a target to banish deforestation for palm oil from their supply chains permanently by 2020. That target looks far from being met, but at the Consumer Goods Forum in June in London the signatory companies will have to explain their progress and what they hope to do to improve their performance. Palm oil is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation, particularly in south-east Asia where wildlife ranging from the orangutan to the Sumatran elephant and rhino are being endangered. Consumers have the chance to make their views felt: nobody wants their grocery shopping to contribute to species loss, and there are ways to grow natural resources without causing ecological disaster. It is up to producer companies and retailers to make the difference. The new European commission took office in Brussels late last year with one central promise: a green deal for Europe, by which the whole of the European economy and EU regulations would be overhauled to put environmental protections at the heart of continued prosperity. Clean energy, transport and industry will create new green jobs to replace those lost in polluting industries, and citizens will enjoy cleaner air, water, a healthier natural environment and a stable climate. That is the goal, at least. Living up to that promise will involve hard choices and skilful diplomacy, and in the course of this year the European commission, member states and EU parliament will face a series of key votes and decisions. The EU will also play a leading role in COP26, and the EU-China summit pegged for mid-September in Leipzig in Germany will be key. With the US rejecting the Paris agreement, cooperation between the world’s other biggest emitters will be vital, so the EU must forge a partnership with China or face failure at COP26.",2020-12-19T16:29:31.843487Z,1
,2020-12-19T15:59:12.811892Z,1050,120,,"The Black Death struck Europe in 1347, killing 30-50% of the European population in six violent years. It wasn’t a one-off epidemic: it signalled the start of the second plague pandemic in Europe that lasted for hundreds of years and only slowly disappeared from the continent after the Great Plague of London in 1665-1666. These outbreaks were traditionally thought to be caused by rodent reservoirs of infected rats lurking in Europe’s cities, or potentially by rodent reservoirs in the wilderness. But our research, published in the journal PNAS, suggests otherwise.  If the “reservoir” thesis were correct, we would expect plague outbreaks to be associated with local climate fluctuations, through changes in agricultural yields and primary productions in forests, affecting the number of urban and wildlife rodents, resulting in more plague. We found that Europe’s plague outbreaks were indeed associated with climate fluctuations – but in Asia. The Black Death came to Europe from Asia. Historical records tentatively map it back to outbreaks in 1345 in Astrakhan and Sarai, two trade centres located on the Volga river near the Caspian Sea.  Where the Black Death came from before it hit those cities is not known, but by recovering fragments of DNA from the teeth of plague victims in Europe, the closest currently known living relatives of this medieval strain of the plague causing bacteria Yersinia pestis are circulating in marmots and long-tailed ground squirrels in north-west China. Some dominant narratives on the plague are poorly substantiated. One being that medieval plague was transmitted by black or brown rats and their infected fleas jumping to humans. This was indeed how the third plague pandemic in the 19th and 20th centuries was transmitted – but there is poor archaeological evidence there were many rats across much of northern Europe in the Middle Ages aside from small populations of black rats in harbour towns, and no historic records that rats played a role in the disease. “Rodent reservoirs” represent another dominant narrative. The idea is that the disease was introduced in medieval Europe once (the Black Death epidemic) after which it settled into local rats or wildlife rodents, and continued to cause outbreaks in European cities for hundreds of years.  This is the narrative we aimed to substantiate through evidence, but which we ended up challenging. Using tree-ring based climate records from Europe and Asia, we showed that plague reintroductions into European harbours were associated with periods of wet conditions, followed by a drought, across large parts of Central Asia.  These conditions were tough for rodents in the region, traditionally the hosts of the plague bacterium, and their numbers would plummet. Infected fleas would seek new hosts, often latching onto passing human traders or their camels, though we don’t yet know exactly how the plague made the journey westward. What we do know is that, 14-16 years after the rodent-killing drought, we would often find plague reintroduced into Europe.  The chart below shows these climate fluctuations in Central Asia preceded the Black Death in 1347, the Italian plague of 1629, and the Great Plague of Marseille a century later, but notably not the London plague of 1665 or the outbreak in Vienna the following decade. This followed a pattern that we associate with current-day plague outbreaks. What is the implication of such a finding? In terms of our understanding of the past plague pandemics, it provides a different perspective as to how the disease moved across Eurasia, driven by climate events that were and still are frequently occurring.  It implies that there might never have been permanent reservoirs of plague among European rodents. While alpine marmots might have been affected and transmitted plague in medieval Europe, we found no indications that they can form a long-term reservoir, as their cousins in Asia do. Furthermore, the observation that plague disappeared from the European mainland, while outbreaks in the Middle East and northern Africa continued to follow upon climate events in Central Asia strongly suggests that the reason why plague disappeared from Europe should be phrased not in terms of why its reservoirs disappeared, but why the disease could no longer spread efficiently across the continent. It gives historians, epidemiologists and biologists new questions to ask in their quest to reconstruct what exactly happened during one of the most devastating pandemics in human history.",2020-12-19T15:59:12.811927Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:52:39.493714Z,1051,120,,"The solar eclipse due to cover much of Europe on March 20 will be the continent’s first for 16 years. Back in 1999, as people stopped staring at the sun and got back on with their day they caused a power surge which still stands as a UK record – greater than anything after a football match or royal wedding.  At the time, solar power made up just 0.1% of all Europe’s electricity produced from renewables. Since then it has increased to at least 5% as countries subsidise renewables to meet EU targets. The installed capacity of solar power in continental Europe is expected to reach 90 GW this year, comparable to 150 coal fired plants. Under clear skies, regulators expect some 35 GW of solar energy to fade away with the eclipse before being re-injected into Europe’s electrical system. This is a big test for solar power. It’s the first time when such an event could have a significant impact on those European countries with lots of solar panels such as Germany (with 44% of continental Europe’s installed capacity), Italy, Spain and France. Much more, European grid integration means everyone could be affected. Keeping the grid stable during the eclipse is the main concern for power utilities. The electrical grids of continental Europe are linked together in what’s called the European synchronous area, allowing countries to juggle excess energy between them to meet demand. Grid regulators will have to coordinate across regions to manage the solar drop off along and demand, all in real time.   According to ENTSOE, Europe’s association of national grid operators, around 50% of the lost power will come from Germany and 21% from Italy. The grid will be losing 0.4 GW/minute at the start of the eclipse and gaining 0.7 GW/minute as the sun returns.  This is a huge amount of electricity generation to come online at once. The European power system will need to adapt in real time, with countries helping each other by providing the necessary reserves of coal, gas and hydropower to keep things running. Electric grids operate on the principle that demand and supply need to be carefully balanced. In continental Europe, grids are connected as one synchronous network. The normal operating frequency is 50 Hz, with two statutory limits, the upper limit, which is 50.5 and the lower limit which is 49.5. Above the upper limit, the generators will trip, while below the lower limit demand will disconnect completely, that means power won’t reach end users and blackouts will happen.  Think of it like driving a car with a target speed of 50 miles/hr (+/-0.5mph). The accelerator is generation, the forces dragging on the car represent the demand. Keeping the frequency at 50Hz means maintaining secure operation of the system, quality of supply and operate economically. Despite the impact on solar energy the eclipse’s most significant effect on the power grid will actually be as a result of human behaviour. During the 1999 eclipse in the UK, people stopped working to enjoy the phenomenon, as highlighted in this graph by Solar Power Portal. The 3 GW surge was greater than the 2.8 GW surge after England played Germany in the 1990 world cup semi-final, or the 2.4 GW surge after the 2011 royal wedding. Something similar will happen this time round. There will be a drop in demand before maximum eclipse, and increased demand after as people come back inside, turn on the tv and fire up the kettle.  In this time the system will have to adapt to the changing load and this could be a challenge. Planning is critical, as you can’t just instantly increase electricity generation. But electricity surges happen from time to time – the 2014 World Cup provides a recent example – and grid coordinators have contingency measures in place to balance supply and demand. The solar eclipse on Friday is a good test for the future, when even more electricity will be produced from renewables like solar and wind, which are more volatile and dispersed generation. Germany, Italy and the US are among the countries where solar will make up a large proportion of overall power. In such situations, even cloudy weather will create a big decrease in production.  If you want to look at what happened during the eclipse, then BM reports provides near real time and historic data on the UK’s national grid balancing system – electricity generation, system prices, warnings, frequency, wind forecasts, market activity, and so on. So, while most people will spend Friday morning observing at the sun with their pinhole cameras, I’ll be keeping one eye on the grid.",2020-12-19T19:52:39.493747Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:14:40.291096Z,1053,119,,"The prime minister says the Coalition is acting on emissions, meeting its targets and doing more than Labor did when in power. What’s the reality? No. National emissions peaked in 2007, the last year of the Howard government, came down each year under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, and have flatlined since the Coalition was elected in 2013. This graph by Nick Evershed, Guardian Australia’s data and interactive editor, sets it out clearly. (Specifically, that they are on average 50m tonnes less each year under the Coalition than Labor.) This was not correct until last year, when the government released revised historic emissions data (as explained here). Since then, Morrison’s claim is roughly accurate. But it is a meaningless statistic – a clear case of nonsense framing to mask what is happening. Labor can’t be held responsible for the historically high emissions level it inherited when it came to office, and pollution fell about 14% in the nearly six years Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were prime minister. The ALP can’t take all the credit for the decline. The millennium drought, the global financial crisis and a high Australian dollar all had some impact. But government policies, including the carbon price scheme introduced in partnership with the Greens and independents, had some effect. Emissions reductions stopped under the Coalition about the time the carbon price scheme was repealed in 2014. The most recent quarterly greenhouse data found rising pollution in most parts of the economy were offset by a significant fall in emissions from agriculture due to drought and floods – a shift that has nothing to do with the government. This is where we risk getting buried in numbers, but bear with me. It makes sense for governments to set emissions targets. How else to assess whether countries are playing their part in addressing a dramatically escalating global problem? But the most important initial question about a government target, before asking whether it will be met, is whether it addresses the problem faced. As far back as 1990, the Coalition went to an election under Andrew Peacock promising to cut emissions 20% by 2000. But Australia’s first target under the Kyoto protocol, the initial climate pact signed in 1997, allowed it to increase emissions by 8% above 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012. Put another way, the Howard government adopted a goal that allowed it to emit even more heat-trapping gas as part of an agreement under which developed countries were supposed to be cutting pollution. As has been well ventilated, it was no accident that 1990 was chosen as the baseline year. There was a hell of a lot of land-clearing and deforestation that year, releasing a stack of carbon dioxide. As the graph above shows, emissions plummeted after 1990, largely because land management in Queensland changed. It meant Australia had set itself a target that allowed it to not just increase pollution by 8%, but dramatically ramp up emissions from fossil fuels and other industry. As this graph shows, that’s what happened. It leaves out emissions of what is known as LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) – which are important, but have been used to muddy the picture – to show Australian pollution from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture and waste is up about 30% over three decades. So, yes, Australia “beat” its first Kyoto target. If it had used any year after 1991 as the baseline it wouldn’t have. And fossil fuel emissions – the primary driver of the climate crisis – have continued to rise. Australia’s 2020 target is usually described as a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. As analysts and politicians have pointed out, it is neither meeting nor beating that goal. Government data shows emissions are expected to be just 0.3% lower this year than at the turn of the millennium. Again, the wonders of greenhouse accounting. As the ANU economist Stephen Howes explains, Australia’s 2020 target was expressed in more than one way. It was also listed with the UN as a 0.5% cut below 1990 emissions levels – that baseline year again – for the average of the years 2013 and 2020. Under that complicated formulation, Australia will technically beat its 2020 target. But it will still be putting the same amount of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere this year as it was 20 years ago. Not much. The Department of the Environment and Energy projects that pollution will be only 4% lower in 2030 than today. It expects that despite assuming that, due to the falling cost of solar panels and some state-based targets, renewable energy will rise to provide 51% of electricity in the national grid by then (a level that the government opposed as damaging to the economy at last year’s election). If the department projections are correct, it means we will not have made a 5% emissions cut below 2000 levels by 2030, let alone 2020. That, despite Morrison claiming it will be met “in a canter”, the government is not on track to meet that either. Before getting to the specifics, it is worth considering what was agreed in Paris, and what it means for Australia. The headline goal of the 2015 pact was to limit global warming to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep it as close to 1.5C as possible. Scientists say that means net zero emissions by about 2050. That this is the implicit target of the Paris agreement is now broadly accepted across the engaged community. More than 70 countries say they are working towards that goal. In Australia, a coalition of groups including the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Energy Council issued a statement in December saying the country should adopting policies that put it on a path to net zero national emissions. Every state, whether run by the Coalition or Labor, has a net zero emissions goal. The Morrison government doesn’t. Asked by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell on Monday about a suggestion federal Labor would recommit to net zero emissions by 2050, the prime minister said he had “no idea what the Labor party is talking about”. Pressed further, he acknowledged the government promised at last year’s Pacific Islands Forum, where Australia faced sustained criticism from island nations for its support of the coal industry, that it would consider it. But he stressed he was concerned that “it wouldn’t be a good thing” and did not think it should be adopted unless it was clear what it would mean for jobs. Australia disregarded scientific advice in setting its initial, medium-term target under the Paris agreement. The then Abbott government was advised by the Climate Change Authority that Australia’s part under a meaningful global pact would be equivalent to a cut of between 45-63% below 2005 levels by 2030. It instead opted for a 26-28% reduction over that timeframe. Again, there was some fudging. Rather than stick with 1990 or 2000, the government opted for a baseline year that – as emissions were substantially higher in 2005 than in 2000 – made the proposed cut appear larger. If the government had stuck with 2000 as the baseline, its Paris target would be a 16-18% cut. Department data suggests national emissions are expected to instead be 16% below 2005 levels by 2030, well short of the minimum 26% goal. The government plans to make up the difference through another accounting measure: claiming credit for “beating” or, as it now describes it, “overachieving” its Kyoto targets. Using what are known as Kyoto “carryover credits” is politically and legally contentious, and opposed by many countries at climate talks. Critics say Australia is still trying to claim credit for a 30-year-old land-clearing loophole that it used against targets that were already far lower than what scientists said was necessary. Not so far. The government’s main climate policy remains the $2bn climate solutions fund, under which taxpayers pay businesses and land-owners to limit pollution, mostly by planting or protecting vegetation. Recent evidence suggests it is struggling to find people to sign up. In October, the government quietly commissioned a review of the policy in what was seen as an acknowledgement that it was not delivering what was needed. The Coalition supports some energy projects, particularly pumped hydro storage, and is promising a long-delayed electric vehicle strategy and a “technology investment roadmap”. Morrison says Australia is leading the world on renewable energy, and emissions from the electricity sector have fallen while those from other sectors increase. But spending on clean power fell 56% last year, and the government has rejected calls for an overarching policy to drive private investment. Australia is responsible for about 1.3% of pollution, but has only 0.3% of the global population. It is one of the top 20 emitting nations, releasing more than G7 members Britain, France and Italy. It is also the third biggest exporter of fossil fuels and aims to expand the trade. Several analyses have found that, even by the inadequate standard of international action to address the climate crisis, Australia is performing poorly. Science and policy body Climate Analytics says it is expected to fall even further behind because, unlike comparable countries, it has no plan to introduce an effective national emissions reduction policy.",2020-12-19T16:14:40.291128Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:21:52.599730Z,1054,119,,"More than half of all Australians have been directly affected by the summer’s bushfire crisis, including millions suffering health effects, according to a new survey from the Australia Institute. As fire crews in New South Wales and Victoria prepare for the return of severe fire conditions later this week, the survey of more than 1,000 people found 57% of Australians were directly affected in some way by the fires over the past three months.  About a quarter of those surveyed (26%) reported illness or health effects as a result of smoke haze, while a third (33%) reported a change to routine – such as not jogging outside – as a result of the conditions. About 15% said they had been forced to change or cancel holiday or travel plans, while 12% said regular places of business or leisure were closed as a result of the disruption. The number of people reporting negative health impacts has been extrapolated in the nationally representative survey to represent about 5.1 million Australian adults. The number of people reporting poor health as a result of the fires was highest in NSW, where 35% of those surveyed saying they had suffered illness such as breathing or respiratory problems because of the smoke. In Victoria, the figure was 29%, but the survey was taken from 8-12 January, before the hazardous levels of smoke haze hit Melbourne the following week. With 9% of respondents saying they had missed work because of the fires or smoke, the Australia Institute is estimating that at least 1.8 million work days were lost as a result, based on the assumption of one day off for each worker affected. Using Australian Bureau of Statistics labour figures, the survey estimated disruption of the workforce to have cost more than $1.3bn in lost economic production, which it says is a “conservative” estimate. “In many areas, including in large cities, workplaces closed for many days and in some cases for a week or more,” the survey said. “If we assume an average of two days of lost production on average, the estimate of lost production doubles to $2.6bn.” The research also showed a correlation between those directly affected by the fires and concern about the impacts of climate change. People who had been impacted by the fires were much more likely to be “very concerned” about climate change (58%) than those not impacted (32%). Those directly affected were also more likely (68%) to say Australia is experiencing “a lot” of climate change impacts, compared with those not affected (42%). The findings also showed greater concern for Australia’s forests and wildlife and government inaction among this group. Only about a third of all surveyed said they believed the federal Coalition had done a “good job managing the crisis”. Tom Swann, senior researcher at the Australia Institute, said the findings underscored the extent of the “vast” social, economic and medical impacts of Australia’s “national climate disaster”. “This research suggests that, as Australians face the escalating impacts of climate change in their own lives, calls for policies that reduce carbon emissions will continue to grow,” Swann said. “Even looking simply at lost work days, the bill is in the billions of dollars. The broader impacts and recovery efforts will cost many billions more and take many years. “That is why it is so concerning that rising emissions threaten to make events like this even more common in the future.” Swann said the findings should give extra impetus to the organisation’s call for a levy on fossil fuel producers to help pay for the escalating cost of natural disasters. “Establishing a National Climate Disaster Fund would move some of the financial burden of these events from the households, businesses and taxpayers that are currently forced to pick up the tab,” he said.",2020-12-19T16:21:52.599764Z,1
,2020-12-19T19:53:20.527643Z,1057,119,,"Donald Trump told the world’s business leaders to stop listening to “prophets of doom” as he used a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum to attack the teenage activist Greta Thunberg over her climate crisis warnings. The US president hailed America’s growth record and compared campaigners against global heating with those who feared a population explosion in the 1960s and mass starvation in the 1970s. On an opening day in Switzerland dominated by the climate emergency, Thunberg scoffed at Trump’s claim that his backing for a new initiative to plant 1tn trees showed his concern for the environment. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour,” Thunberg said. “And we’re asking you to act as if you love your children more than anything else.” The US president and Thunberg did not meet face to face at the WEF, but Trump left few in doubt about who he was referring to as he defended his record since entering the White House three years ago. “This is not a time for pessimism,” he said. “This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers. “They want to see us do badly, but we don’t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s. These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country or eradicate our liberty.” He said he was “a big believer in the environment” in a speech that ensured he was absent from Washington as impeachment hearings took place on Capitol Hill. “The environment to me is very important,” he said. He made no mention of the climate emergency but backed the plan – launched in Davos – to capture carbon by planting trees on a mass scale in the coming years. “What I want is the cleanest water and the cleanest air,” he said. Environmentalists were unimpressed by a speech in which Trump boasted that his support for the coal and oil industries meant the US was self-sufficient in energy. Thunberg said: “Planting trees is good, of course, but it’s nowhere near enough, and it cannot replace real mitigation and re-wilding nature. We don’t need to lower emissions. Emissions need to stop.” Thunberg had three demands for her Davos audience: The halt of all investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments. An immediate end to all fossil fuel subsidies. An immediate exit from fossil fuel investments. “We don’t want it done in 2050, 2030, or even 2021, we want it done now,” Thunberg said. “You might think we’re naive, but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals, and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she said. She then added that the right, the left, and the centre of politics had all failed the sustainability test. “No political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world.” Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace’s executive director, said: “The 1tn trees initiative didn’t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, and Trump had failed to appreciate the scale of the crisis. “To assume you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries.” Trump said the American dream was back, “bigger, better and stronger” than before, adding that the benefits of growth were going primarily to low-income workers rather than the better off. Trump added that 7m jobs had been created and 12,000 factories opened during his presidency. Many of the president’s claims were rejected by the Columbia University economics professor Joseph Stiglitz. “Research shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today,” he said, noting that growth had been faster under Barack Obama than it was currently under Trump, and that life expectancy had fallen every year of his presidency. Although the US economy grew far more rapidly in previous decades than it has since he was elected in November 2016, Trump said: “I’m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before.” The main hall in Davos, together with an overspill room, were packed to hear the president, although there were some titters as he ran through a litany of boasts. “I hold up the American model as an example to the world,” Trump said, contrasting his record with that of his predecessor, Obama. The US was “thriving, flourishing and winning” unprecedentedly, he added, citing trade deals signed last week with China and Mexico-Canada as models for the 21st century. “I am looking forward to a tremendous new trade deal with the UK,” Trump said, noting that Britain had a “wonderful new prime minister” in Boris Johnson, who was keen on a deal. The president said the economic boom had happened despite the US Federal Reserve, which “raised rates too fast and cut them too slowly”.",2020-12-19T19:53:20.527676Z,1
,2020-12-22T12:53:14.452579Z,1059,119,,"The search for alternative energy sources in the age of climate change has overlooked tidal energy: a vast and unexploited worldwide resource.  For three decades now, tidal lagoon schemes have been recommended as an economically and environmentally attractive alternative to tidal barrages. More recently, two proposals for tidal lagoons in Swansea Bay, Wales have emerged and there have been several reports documenting how such a project there could have the potential to harness significant energy resources.  Tidal energy involves constructing a barrage, a dam or some other sort of barrier to harvest power from the height difference between high and low tides. The power is generated by running the water through turbines, found within the barrier. The technology used is very similar to that found in hydropower schemes, however unlike rivers tidal currents run in two directions. Where a tidal barrage blocks off an entire estuary, a tidal lagoon instead impounds an artificially created area of the sea or estuary. A lagoon doesn’t necessarily have to be connected to the shore – it could even sit out in the ocean.  As the tide goes out the lagoon remains closed, and full. It then opens the flood gates to let the water out until water levels on each side of the lagoon wall are even. When the tide comes in the process is reversed.  It’s tough to estimate exactly how much tidal power can be exploited, but the UK may have close to half of Europe’s total. And few potential sites worldwide are as close to electricity users and the transmission grid as those in the UK.  Swansea Bay is located in the Bristol Channel on the South Wales coastline. As part of the Severn Estuary it experiences one of the world’s largest tidal ranges, often reaching 10m.  A tidal lagoon has been mooted in the bay before, back in 2004, but the latest proposals are on a grander scale. The structure shown below would cover 11.5 km2, cost £913m to construct, and would be capable of generating 495 GWh per year – enough energy to power 155,000 homes. The Swansea Bay scheme demonstrates a renewed interest in tidal power, which has many advantages compared to other renewable sources. It is well documented that increasing integration of volatile, unpredictable sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar power jeopardises the stability of the power grid. In order for the grid to remain stable the power generated at any instance has to match demand, therefore it is important that the transmission network contains power sources that are immediately available. While the sun may stop shining, and the wind can drop, the tides remain predictable – an obvious advantage for tidal power and a great help for National Grid forecasters. Yet improvements are still needed. The upfront costs remain high, and there are some ecological implications. Experiences with artificially closed compounds have demonstrated that the costs of managing an artificial tidal basin (for example in the case of La Rance, Brittany, and Cardiff Bay), Wales are high and need careful monitoring and planning.  Turbines can become more efficient, perhaps learning from the wind industry about aspects such as varying the speed of turbines. We need to develop better 3D modelling to get a better sense of how the tides ebb and flow, and how turbines perform under turbulence. But there are important positives that should lead to more tidal power. The re-opening of dams and barriers, often built between the 1950s and 1970s can have great ecological benefits for the water bodies behind them due to a creation of a gradient that is beneficial to aquatic ecology (brackish water) and an increased oxygen content; in such instances, tidal technology can also be used as a tool for water quantity management, while generating power.  They can actually improve some ecosystems and have additional societal benefits besides renewable energy such as flood defence, environmental and ecological water quality improvement, fisheries and even tourism functions.  New technologies are being developed that would allow energy to be harvested from new areas, where the difference between high and low tides are measured in centimetres rather than metres. All this make an investment in a tidal lagoon for Swansea Bay seem like a strong investment in the future.",2020-12-22T12:53:14.452610Z,1

,2020-12-19T15:59:44.433109Z,1062,119,,"Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis has unfolded in waves across the spring and summer, demanding coverage across many months that has encompassed a vast geographical area and has tried to make sense of dozens of interrelated narratives, from the personal stories of individuals caught in the disaster to the devastation of wildlife, social media misinformation and the overarching relevance of the climate crisis. The key vehicle for delivering the news on the bushfires has been our daily live blog. Our first day of live coverage, incredibly, was on 10 September, months before the normal onset of the bushfire season, when fires raced through parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Since early November we have covered the fires live on 32 days, including continuously from 16 December to Christmas Eve, and again from 30 December to 11 January, often for more than 12 hours a day. But of course an event of this size and drama cannot be covered solely from the office. The logistical challenges of putting reporters and photographers into fire zones hundreds of kilometres from their Sydney or Melbourne bases have been huge. The safety of our journalists has always been our priority, but inevitably in a situation where the demands on them are extreme and communications often impaired, there have been anxious moments. We have been rewarded by extraordinary dispatches, telling the stories of places whose names have sadly become synonymous with disaster: Balmoral, Cobargo, East Gippsland. In other towns, such as Mallacoota and Malua Bay, we have been able to reconstruct the terrifying events there through the accounts of residents both in print and audio. The crisis came at what is usually the quietest news time of the year, when many staff are on leave. Many gave up their summer breaks to work long hours on our coverage. Some were themselves caught up in the fires while on holiday, able to report on a harrowing experience only when communications were restored. Reporting events on this scale has been challenging enough, but putting them in the context both of Australian domestic politics and the wider question of climate change has put even greater demands on our reporters and opinion writers. From the start we have been at pains to keep the climate crisis at the forefront of our coverage, by explaining the science and holding the government to account for its response. The photographer Chris Hopkins and I drove from Melbourne to Bairnsdale, Victoria on Monday 30 December, the day after emergency services took the unprecedented step of advising everybody in the far-east wedge of the state to get out. Under a bridge on the eastern side of Bairnsdale, next to a sign that said “no camping”, we found evacuees such as 77-year-old Marilyn Withers, whose face was red from the 43C heat. That night the temporary campground under the bridge swelled to the hundreds, including many who had fled with just the clothes on their backs and who were now sleeping in their cars. The discount department store sold out of tents that night, we were told. Many people had not intended to flee, but changed their minds when they saw the size and speed of the smoke column. It looked like a moving volcano. We watched from a pie-and-sandwich shop on the edge of town alongside Alan and Jenny Blair, who had made a last-minute decision to leave their six-hectare property at Wy Yung. While we spoke the wind was roaring in from the north-west, pushing the fire towards Wy Yung and Bairnsdale. At 5pm, the wind changed, sparing the Blairs’ home but devastating the villages of Clifton Creek, Sarsfield, and Bruthen, taking 43 houses and a school. The next morning at the official evacuation centre it was easy to spot those whose houses had been lost. They walked around white-faced, desperate to talk to someone but wary of the notebook. I made friends with the animals: 250 horses held safe in the saleyards, countless dogs, five chickens laying eggs in the back of a Landrover. Shellshocked humans who did not want to talk about how they were doing told me about how their pets were faring, and then their kids, and then finally themselves. Everyone who stayed to defend their property told us they would never do that again. I grew up in the shadow of bushfires, on the other side of the Victorian alps. When a woman told me the church where her family was buried had burned down, I told her my family’s church had burned too, in another bushfire. It feels inevitable now that if you live in Australia some part of your life will burn down. It’s just a matter of when. My first fire callout this season was to the well-heeled Sydney suburb of Turramurra in November, where no property was lost, houses were doused in the delightfully coloured pink fire retardant and some departing firefighters handed us ice creams on their way out. My most recent was to the area around Nowra, south of Sydney, and the NSW southern highlands in January, where houses were lost and fires created their own lightning storms. In between, I went to the Mount Gospers fire twice and the Green Wattle Creek fire as it hit Balmoral again and again over consecutive days. Reporting on the fires requires a lot of driving, instinct and guesswork. There is often more information in the newsroom than on the ground, and we relied a lot on firefighters, the fire and traffic apps and radio broadcasts. I also received text updates on wind and weather changes from my dad, who can read charts better than I can. We would find crews, conduct interviews, take photos and get advice about where we could see firefighting efforts without getting in the way or getting too reckless. Then we’d park the car for half an hour, file to Guardian Australia’s live blog or the news desk, and do it all again somewhere else. In Kurrajong Heights, photographer Jessica Hromas and I met a strike team waiting for a fire to come up from the gorge and into the suburbs. A firefighter told us where to park our car – facing out and with doors unlocked – and said he’d give us a radio so he could tell us when to escape. Again and again I saw the short-lived relief in people’s faces as a wind change saved their home, before they realised it meant someone else would likely lose theirs. From a personal point of view, it has been heartbreaking. The scale of the disaster, the fear and anger and sense of powerlessness on the ground is palpable, and it’s the moments that are hard to write about in the usual news style that I will remember the longest: The sound of thunder in Nowra rolling overhead from dirty brown clouds, knowing it was one of three storms generated by a nearby fire. The feeling of guilt having firefighters check on our welfare and make sure we weren’t hungry. The steely bravery on the face of a 12-year-old kid who wasn’t evacuated before the roads closed and was now helping their mum put out spot fires in the backyard. The overwhelming desire to hug interview subjects, either because they’d just gone through something horrific or they’d just done something extraordinarily selfless, and because this isn’t just a news story, this is home. There has been a lot of anger and politics swirling around Australia’s bushfires, as well as a lot of facts – some relevant, some not, and some fake. As an environment reporter, one of my main roles during the bushfire crisis has been to get into that swirling mess and come out with something that gives people a clear picture of what’s going on. So while some of my colleagues have been delivering blistering and heart-wrenching narratives from the fire grounds, I’ve been knee deep in academic papers about bushfires, and conversations about the Forest Fire Danger Index and the Indian Ocean dipole. I have been talking to ecologists to work out what the environmental impact of these fires will be – the answer is unfolding, but the experts say they’ll be amazed if we don’t see species becoming extinct. We’d had warnings this bushfire season was going to be bad – rainfall had been at record low levels in many areas, and temperatures at record highs. As the fires took hold in NSW and continued in Queensland, a blame game emerged. These fires had little to do with the climate crisis, some were saying, but were down to “greenies” and their “policies” to stop hazard-reduction burning in forests and national parks. Australia has plenty of academic expertise on bushfires because it’s part of our lived experience. One of the first people I spoke to, Prof Ross Bradstock, gave an almighty sigh when I called him up to ask if this really was all the fault of the Greens. This was “conspiracy stuff”, he said, an accusation that almost always came up after major bushfires. I later took a further look at hazard-reduction techniques and their limitations. I tried never to leave the climate question unanswered. I’ve spoken to I don’t know how many experts in their field over the last few months. I’ve disturbed conservationists and scientists on their holidays. One ecologist on Kangaroo Island was telling me what was going on while she and her children evacuated her house from the threat of a fire. The climate crisis comes up in every conversation.",2020-12-19T15:59:44.433143Z,1

By Die kalte Sonne

The Gulf Stream provides heating for Western Europe. Some climate activists paint horror scenarios on the wall that the Gulf Stream is slowing down or even stopping due to climate change – with fatal consequences for Europe. However, other scientists see no evidence of this in the hard data. You can find more on this discussion at our DkS archive.
Today’s blog post: What’s new on the Gulf Stream?
In February 2019, Lozier et al. reported in Science that the models did not even correctly quantify the most important drives of the Gulf Stream. The dominant factor is not the Labrador Sea east of Canada, but the Arctic Ocean east of Greenland. See also report in The Daily Caller.
The Gulf Stream is apparently not as vulnerable to climate change as we thought. ScienceNews on 31 January 2019:
Climate change might not slow ocean circulation as much as thought
New findings from an international ocean observing network are calling into question the long-standing idea that global warming might slow down a big chunk of the ocean’s “conveyor belt.” The first 21 months of data from sensors moored across much of the North Atlantic are giving new insight into what controls the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, a system of currents that redistributes heat around much of the Western Hemisphere.
Researchers had thought the strength of that circulation, known by the acronym AMOC, was largely influenced by the sinking of cold freshwater in the Labrador Sea, between Greenland and Canada. And climate simulations suggest that the sea’s deepwater formation might slow as the world continues to warm — which also could slow down the entire Atlantic current system and possibly make temperatures on land in the northeastern United States and the United Kingdom plunge. That concept inspired the (otherwise unrealistic) 2004 climate apocalypse film The Day After Tomorrow.

This MDR report from July 2018 also deals with fundamental problems of understanding:
Does a weak Gulf Stream deliver heat to us?
A new study is causing uproar and a lot of criticism. It deals with the Gulf Stream. So far it has been said: If it becomes weaker and possibly fails to appear at all, then it gets cold. A research team from China and the USA now claims the opposite. They say that a weakening Gulf Stream is heating up the global temperature once again.”.

Also see the articles on the study in Die Welt. Backers of the tough IPCC line were horrified. Alarmist site Klimareporter does not like the study at all and calls it “provocative“. Also the climate alarmist SZ daily was also dissatisfied. It is best to have the results explained directly by the authors without filtering. What follows is the accompanying press release from the University of Washington dated 18 July 2018:
Atlantic Ocean circulation is not collapsing – but as it shifts gears, global warming will reaccelerate
A huge circulation pattern in the Atlantic Ocean took a starring role in the 2004 movie “The Day After Tomorrow.” In that fictional tale the global oceanic current suddenly stops and New York City freezes over. While many aspects of the movie are unrealistic, oceanographers are concerned about the long-term stability of the Atlantic Ocean circulation, and previous studies show that it has slowed dramatically in the past decade. New research from the University of Washington and the Ocean University of China finds the slowdown is not caused by global warming but is part of regular, decades-long cycle that will affect temperatures in coming decades. The paper [Chen & Tung 2018] was published July 18 [2018] in Nature.
“Climate scientists have expected the Atlantic overturning circulation to decline long-term under global warming, but we only have direct measurements of its strength since April 2004. And the decline measured since then is 10 times larger than expected,” said corresponding author Ka-Kit Tung, a UW professor of applied mathematics with an adjunct appointment in atmospheric sciences.
“Many have focused on the fact that it’s declining very rapidly, and that if the trend continues it will go past a tipping point, bringing a catastrophe such as an ice age. It turns out that none of that is going to happen in the near future. The fast response may instead be part of a natural cycle and there are signs that the decline is already ending.”
The results have implications for surface warming. The current’s speed determines how much surface heat gets transferred to the deeper ocean, and a quicker circulation would send more heat to the deep Atlantic. If the current slows down, then it will store less heat, and Earth will be likely to see air temperatures rise more quickly than the rate since 2000.
“The global climate models can project what’s going to happen long-term if carbon dioxide increases by a certain amount, but they currently lack the capability to predict surface warming in the next few decades, which requires a knowledge of how much the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases is being absorbed by the oceans,” Tung said.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is a conveyor belt that brings surface water northward in the Atlantic; from there, the heavier salty water sinks and returns at depth from the Labrador and Nordic seas, near the North Pole, all the way south to the Southern Ocean. Most people are interested in what happens at the surface — the Gulf Stream and associated Atlantic currents carry warmer water north, bringing mild temperatures to Western Europe.
But the new paper argues that the most important step, from a climate perspective, is what happens next. In the North Atlantic, the saltier water from the tropics sinks almost a mile (1,500 meters). As it does, it carries heat down with it away from the surface.
Changes in the strength of the AMOC affect how much heat leaves our atmosphere. The new study uses a combination of data from Argo floats, ship-based temperature measurements, tidal records, satellite images of sea-surface height that can show bulges of warm water, and recent high-tech tracking of the AMOC itself to suggest that its strength fluctuates as part of a roughly 60- to 70-year, self-reinforcing cycle.

When the current is faster, more of the warm, salty tropical water travels to the North Atlantic. Over years this causes more glaciers to melt, and eventually the freshwater makes the surface water lighter and less likely to sink, slowing the current.
When the AMOC is in a slow phase, the North Atlantic becomes cooler, ice melt slows, and eventually the freshwater melt source dries up and the heavier saltier water can plunge down again, which speeds up the whole circulation.
The new study argues that this current is not collapsing, but is just transitioning from its fast phase to its slower phase – and that this has implications for heating at the surface.
From 1975 to 1998, the AMOC was in a slow phase. As greenhouse gases were accumulating in the atmosphere, Earth experienced distinct warming at the surface. From about 2000 until now, the AMOC has been in its faster phase, and the increased heat plunging in the North Atlantic has been removing excess heat from the Earth’s surface and storing it deep in the ocean. “We have about one cycle of observations at depth, so we do not know if it’s periodic, but based on the surface phenomena we think it’s very likely that it’s periodic,” Tung said.
The new paper supports the authors’ previous research showing that since 2000, during which observations show a slowdown in surface warming, heat has accumulated deep in the Atlantic Ocean. The new study shows this is the same period when Atlantic overturning circulation was in its fast phase.
Recent measurements of density in the Labrador Sea suggest the cycle is beginning to shift, Tung said. That means that in coming years the AMOC will no longer be sending more of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases deep into the North Atlantic. “The good news is the indicators show that this slowdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation is ending, and so we shouldn’t be alarmed that this current will collapse any time soon,” Tung said. “The bad news is that surface temperatures are likely to start rising more quickly in the coming decades.”

Die Welt reported on July 21, 2019:
Deep temperatures have been measured in the North Atlantic since the 1940s,” reports Professor Monika Rhein of the University of Bremen. These temperatures are an indirect indication of the strength of the Gulf Stream. “These measured data show strong fluctuations, but no trend in any direction,” says the oceanographer, summing up the long series of measurements. A decrease in the Gulf Stream has therefore not yet been observed.”
The German Climate Consortium published a Brochure on the Gulf Stream in July 2018.
Thibodeau et al. 2018 2018 analyzed oxygen isotopes of foraminifera of a Northwest Atlantic sediment core and found that the attenuation of the Gulf Stream (AMOC) in the 20th century led to a Gulf Stream minimum in the 1970s. The Gulf Stream was also particularly weak during the Little Ice Age, a natural cold phase. See also report in the Daily Mail.
McCarthy et al. 2018 found that a part of the Gulf Stream variability was related to the NAO ocean cycle.
Yan et al. 2018 complained that climate models represented the strong Gulf Stream variability only in a diminished form, an important inadequacy of model simulations.
Todd et al. 2018 short-term changes of the Gulf Stream after powerful hurricanes.
Good et al. 2018:
The observed AMOC overturning has decreased from 2004–2014, but it is unclear at this stage whether this is forced or is internal variability.
Lique & Thomas 2018 warned that the Gulf Stream could change over time. Report on this at Scinexx:

North Atlantic: climate change shifts the circulation
Sinking zones of the Atlantic circulation could shift considerably
Shifted engine of circulation: Climate change could not only weaken the Atlantic circulation flow, but could also shift it, as a simulation now suggests. The large sink zones of warm water would no longer lie off Greenland, as they do today, but in the Arctic Ocean and the subtropical Atlantic. This, however, could have a strong influence on the current – and also alter the heat exchange and the buffer effect of the ocean, as the researchers report in the journal “Nature Climate Change”.

Editor Alan Rusbridger launched the project by declaring the case for the divestment of fossil fuel investment is overwhelming both on moral and financial grounds.   While this campaign and those against Harvard, Oxford, Sydney and other universities are great at generating publicity – the Wellcome Trust announced it had already sold off its £94m investment in ExxonMobil – they may be doing more harm than good.  The tactics applied harken back to the anti-apartheid boycotts of the 1960s-1980s in the hope that the campaigns will ultimately filter through to the money making parts of the fossil fuel industry. Yet none of the arguments for fossil fuel divestment appear to understand the nature and importance of ownership in modern shareholder societies.  One of the hallmarks of investing in a company is that share ownership confers the legal right of proportional ownership.  Legally, any individual holding a specific ownership share can bring issues to the company and has proportional rights to vote on all motions put to the ownership either by the board or shareholders. While corporations have to engage in conversations and negotiations with a multitude of “stakeholders”, it is only those who possess ownership rights that they are, in practice, accountable to in a fiduciary sense.  Shareholders determine the composition of the board, and the value of their investment will be influenced directly by what the board and senior management do. Those behind divestment campaigns have lost sight of the fact that investment can imply control.  Significant ownership shares, or coalitions of ownership shares, can be turned into activist voting blocks and also ensure that specific ownership interests get seats on the board.  For example, investor Dan Loeb used his fund’s position in Yahoo! to force a change of CEO while also gaining a seat on its board.  Groups such as Domini Social Investments are quite enthusiastic about their effective use of an activist investor approach to inducing corporate change.  On average they put a dozen proposals to shareholders of major corporations such as Apple, Energen and Pepsico a year, addressing issues ranging from methane emissions to political contributions and the role pesticides in the decline in the number of honeybees. Investment can influence corporate actions, which is why pension funds and institutional investors want to hold significant shares in key companies. The greater the investment, the more likely it is that the company’s management must take the viewpoint of the investor seriously, as in the Yahoo! case.  Divestment does little more on this dimension other than to turn an inside voice that can demand that a company listen into an outside voice that a company can easily ignore. Divestment does not destroy value – it simply transfers it to another set of owners who are not so morally outraged and are willing to pick up the shares set aside, at a slight bargain.  As the outraged owners are being replaced by less moral types, the likelihood that inside pressure can be brought to bear declines.  Hence, if the point of the divestment campaigners is to publicly shame the fossil fuel companies and put pressure on them to change their strategies, the campaign is doomed to fail.  Rather than the board and management having to suffer owners who are concerned about the moral direction of the company, they are now happily accountable to owners who are less likely to care about such things. Divestment campaigners seem to believe their investment goes to the company – that somehow this divestment starves the company of the ability to invest, or raises the cost of capital and debt.  In fact, buying shares does nothing to alter the cash flows available to that company for future investment.  The only time the company receives funds is when it issues new shares, and divestment will have no influence on this. Indeed, most major energy firms have not had new share offerings in decades.  Hence the conclusion that such divestment would reduce the investment capital available to fossil fuel companies has no basis in either financial reality or fact.   One response to this last general point is that while divestment will not hurt large companies, it will restrict investment in smaller fossil fuel and mining companies.  In reality this also makes no sense.   First, the groups that would divest are not so rich that they can move financial markets with their divestment alone or even in concert with others.  For example, while Harvard has lots of money in its endowment (US$36 billion) it still won’t change the price of oil or the value of oil companies. The university’s endowment pales in comparison to Bridgewater Associates (a hedge fund with US$169 billion under management) and most major pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, the majority of whom are unlikely to jump on the divestment bandwagon.  Harvard might divest, only to leave the investment to be picked up easily by investors from China, Qatar, or Indonesia.  Second, even if small companies did suffer through divestment there is nothing to stop the larger fossil fuel firms simply using their cash flow and borrowing capabilities to purchase their now cheaper and more vulnerable rivals.  So rather than divestment hurting the large amoral multinational fossil fuel companies and its remaining investors, it provides an opportunity for them to control and consolidate the industry further, potentially reaping more dividends from the act of consolidation.   If the divested funds were used to purchase shares in “alternative energy” companies all that would be happening is that the shares of those companies would be changing hands. Again, this share investment would not add to the cash flows or available investment capital of these companies unless the redirected investment went into new share offerings. Divestment campaigns can no doubt make people feel good about themselves and the actions they are taking to make the world a better place.  They can also put pressure on organisations who don’t have active ownership structures but instead view themselves as accountable to a range of people who act as if they have ownership rights – think of universities and their faculty, students and alumni.  All of this is noble.   However, such campaigns may be inferior to a more activist alternative, which is to either increase the investment or to work to pool the investments of like-minded shareholder groups so as to form ownership blocks that can demand changes in the board, management and strategy. In the end, it may be that moral outrage is not as effective as capitalism because one of the points of capitalism is to separate ownership from management while allowing owners control over managers.   One can express moral outrage about short-term shareholder capitalism but shares do not care who owns them and it is the job of the shareholder as owner to ensure that the company is run according to their wishes.  If the divestment advocates want companies to operate according to different precepts, perhaps more active ownership control would achieve their goals more quickly and effectively.",2020-12-19T16:09:25.866766Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:15:13.129804Z,1071,120,,"Mongolia is hoping a massive dam on its largest river could provide much needed power and water for the country’s booming mining industry. However environmental groups are concerned that the hydroelectric power plant and a related pipeline project will do immeasurable environmental damage to oldest and deepest freshwater body in the world: Lake Baikal. As Baikal sits just over the border in Russia, Mongolia risks seriously annoying its northern neighbour at at time when the lake is already experiencing problems with invasive algae along its coasts, unregulated mining and a water level which just passed a “critically low” point. The Shuren Hydropower Plant, planned on the Selenga River in northern Mongolia, was first proposed in 2013 and is currently the subject of a World Bank-funded environmental and social impact assessment. In tandem, Mongolia is also considering building one of the world’s largest pipelines to transport water from the Orkhon River, one of the Selenga’s tributaries, to supply the miners in the Gobi desert 1,000km away. The impact of these projects will be most keenly felt downstream in Lake Baikal. The lake formed in a tectonic rift zone more than 25m years ago in southern Siberia. With a maximum depth of almost 1,700m, Baikal contains 20% of the world’s unfrozen freshwater.  Due to it’s great age, depth and remote location, more than 2,500 species have been documented in the lake, of which more than 75% are believed to be endemic and are found nowhere else in the world – from the microscopic plants that provide the lake with most of its energy to one of the world’s few truly freshwater seals, the nerpa or Pusa sibirica. Because of its unique characteristics and biodiversity, Lake Baikal was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. By far the largest and most important of the 350-plus rivers that flow into Lake Baikal is the Selenga River, which contributes almost 50% of the lake’s water. The Selenga and its tributaries cover a vast area, much of it in northern Mongolia, and the catchment of Lake Baikal is bigger than Spain. The river enters Lake Baikal through the Selenga Delta, a wetland of internationally recognised importance.   The delta is crucial to the health of Lake Baikal. Its shallow waters are a key spawning ground for Baikal’s many endemic fish and is on the migratory route for millions of birds every year. It also filters out impurities flowing through the river before they reach the lake. The Shuren dam isn’t the only threat to the delta, but it may be the most important. The Selenga is already very polluted; mining for gold and other minerals in northern Mongolia has resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in the water. Sewage and waste-water treatment plants along its banks are often old, leading to elevated concentrations of nutrients and other contaminants.  However, actually disrupting the river flow into the Selenga delta and Lake Baikal has the potential to cause untold damage to the lake and its life. Any lowering of the delta’s shallow waters will disrupt the spawning grounds of many endemic fish species – and other species, including birds and aquatic insects will lose their homes.  Biodiversity loss has the potential to degrade Baikal’s unique ecosystems, resulting in severe economic implications for local and regional economies. Such is the concern that several environmental NGOs such as Rivers Without Boundaries and academics from Mongolia and Russia have lodged a request for the World Bank to be investigated as they claim the bank is disregarding its own regulations by funding an assessment for a project on a unique river system that is home to endangered species. The Russian Security Council, which advises the president on national security issues, has also voiced its concern. But Russia cannot be let off the hook either. In the early 1950s, a hydroelectric dam was built in the city of Irkutsk on the Angara River, Lake Baikal’s only outflow. On completion, the water levels of Lake Baikal increased by more than a metre, flooding almost 150,000ha of land, displacing 15,000 people and disrupting the Selenga delta spawning grounds. More recently, the Irkutsk dam has been implicated (along with lower than expected rainfall) in contributing to some of Lake Baikal’s lowest water levels for several decades. But these problems may pale into insignificance if the Shuren Hydropower Plant and the Orkhon-Gobi Water Diversion schemes in Mongolia get the green light.",2020-12-19T16:15:13.129837Z,1

,2020-12-22T12:53:46.163413Z,1077,119,,"One weekend during the fiercely hot summer of 2018, when every single fan in Sweden had sold out, my boyfriend and I decided to get out of Stockholm and go camping. When we arrived at the campsite, we were asked not to smoke, and told firmly that no fires of any kind could be lit, owing to the forest fires that had been raging from the Arctic Circle to the Baltic Sea. Later that day, we received emergency notifications on our phones. Several more fires had broken out all over the country. I slept uneasily that night – and not only because I was on a yoga mat besieged by midges. It was my first experience of living with the climate crisis as a low-level but present danger.  This unease is now very familiar to most of us, and has been heightened by what we’re seeing in Australia. Since the fire season began there, in the middle of last year, 29 people have died, along with more than a billion animals, and an area comparable in size to the whole of England has been ablaze. It’s a vicious reminder that, for all the sophistication of the modern world, something as primitive as fire can still bring us to our knees. As shocking as the scale of the destruction has been, though, it’s easy to see it on our computer screens here on the other side of the world, in the middle of a British winter, and feel disconnected from it. We accept that the climate emergency is now truly upon us yet still feel that it’s mostly happening to other people, elsewhere. But wildfires are increasingly a problem for everyone, including in the UK. Last August, there were almost five times as many of them around the world as there had been the previous August. In the EU, the number of wildfires in the first half of 2019 was three times the annual average for the previous decade. And while they used to be a serious problem only in hotter, southern European countries such as Portugal and Spain, now northern Europe is in trouble too. The Swedish fires of 2018 were by far the most severe in the country’s history, burning an area almost twice as large as the worst previous wildfire, in 2014. In the UK, 2018 and 2019 were the worst two years on record for wildfires, particularly on moors in the north-west of England and parts of Scotland. One fire last year, at Marsden Moor in Yorkshire, destroyed almost three square miles of land. The damage is on a very different scale to the almost 30,000 square miles that have burned in Australia, of course, but this is still a development we can’t afford to ignore. Aside from all the more immediate effects – the threat to humans, livestock and wildlife – the recent increase in wildfires has been linked to severe air quality problems. People living up to 62 miles (100km) downwind of fires in the Pennines in 2018 were exposed to toxic fumes. And as there is no sign of cooler weather in the years ahead, it is reasonable to expect more fires in 2020. The EU has now established a fleet of firefighting planes, and the European Forest Institute has warned that unless we take steps to protect the countryside – for instance, by planting less-flammable species and creating barriers to the spread of flames – emergency services won’t be able to prevent the rapid spread and firestorms that have characterised the Australian crisis. This isn’t all because of the climate crisis – changes to land use and increased urbanisation over several decades are also factors. Weather patterns are noisy data, and it’s difficult to attribute any single wildfire to the climate crisis. The scientific consensus, however, is that it is increasing the intensity and frequency of fire-conducive weather across the world. Even those fires that are eventually linked to human error, like a still-lit disposable barbecue, are increasingly likely due to warming temperatures. Hotter summers mean more barbecues lit in the first place. The climate crisis is going to change the way we behave in every aspect of our lives. And with the probability of another summer of extreme weather coming, we will need to adapt to new dangers that won’t just be on the other side of the planet but, quite literally, in our own backyards. It’s not at all clear that we’re ready for what might be coming. There is still a cognitive jump yet to be made when those of us in Europe read about the fires in Australia, from mourning the destruction there to recognising that we face some version of the same threat. When we look at Australia, we’re not looking at the future that might await Europe. That future is already here. • Imogen West-Knights is a writer and freelance journalist",2020-12-22T12:53:46.163446Z,1

Seas rose and fell by multiple meters (-5 m to +3 m) within 1250 years until as recently as 4000 to 2000 years ago.
A new paper (Loveson and Nigam, 2019) reveals sea levels were still rising at a rate of 2.2 meters per century between 8100 and 7200 years ago, reaching a highstand of 4 meters above today’s sea level 6050 years ago.
For the next several millennia sea levels rapidly rose and fell within a range 6 meters – between 4 meters above to -2 meters below present levels.
A drop in sea level at one point reached an amplitude of -5 meters in just 1250 years (4350 to 3100 years ago) followed by 3 meters of sea level rise within 1200 years (3100 to 1900 years ago).
As recently as about 300 years ago mean sea level on India’s eastern shore was still about 1 meter higher than today.

,2020-12-19T15:32:05.528647Z,1080,119,,"Falling ocean oxygen levels due to rising temperatures and influence from human activities such as agrochemical use is an increasingly widespread problem. Considering that the sea floors have taken more than 1,000 years to recover from past eras of low oxygen, according to a recent University of California study, this is a serious problem. Ocean regions with low oxygen levels have a huge impact on aquatic organisms and can even destroy entire ecosystems. Areas of extremely low oxygen, known as oxygen minimum zones or “dead zones”, are estimated to constitute 10% and rising of the world’s ocean. This expansion has been attributed to a warming climate, which increases water temperature, changes ocean circulation, and decreases the solubility of oxygen in sea water. At the same time fertiliser and pesticide run-off from farming and other human activities leads to rising levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous reaching the sea.  Together, these two processes speed up the release of chemicals from ocean sediments and promote algal blooms. Subsequent algal death and decay result in increased consumption of oxygen in the water. The result is that other aquatic species such as invertebrates on the seafloor and fish suffocate for lack of oxygen. Due to circulation and runoff effects, dead zones are especially severe around large cities on the western continental coasts such as the coast of Peru, and within enclosed or semi-enclosed regions like the Baltic Sea or Gulf of Mexico. What effects will these changes have? We don’t yet know how great the effects of human-caused climate change will be, nor how much can be done to try and mitigate the effects on the environment. Even if oceanic oxygen levels rise again, will the world’s ocean ecosystems be able to recover?  The University of California study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studies fossils of over 5,400 sea animals including seed shrimps, molluscs, and brittle stars in order to try and answer this question. By examining seafloor sediments the researchers assessed how global warming affected sealife during the transition from the last ice age to the more-recent interglacial period, between 17,000-3,000 years ago. What the study found was that within only 130 years the oceans underwent devastating changes that led to complete collapse of invertebrates on the seafloor. More worryingly, the fossil records show that ecosystem recovery took at least 1,000 years. So the current growth of dead zones could leave drastic and long-lasting changes to marine life biodiversity. Climate change caused by human activity has already caused significant environmental damage over a relatively short time – the vast increase in pollution, ocean acidification, overfishing and deforestation in just the last 50-100 years, for example. However long it takes us to reverse the effects of global warming, if indeed we can, it will likely take ocean ecosystems many orders of magnitude longer to recover. Though microscopic organisms residing in the ocean and on the seafloor might seem to have little relevance to us, even small changes in ocean ecosystems can have enormous effects on the entire ocean food chain, from the smallest bacteria to the largest fish. Any impact on the creatures higher up in the food chain will have a massive impact on the human communities that rely on them economically and as a food source. Studies have shown that populations of mid-water fish such as Pacific hake decreased by up to 60% during periods of low oxygen off the coast of Southern California.  Conversely, numbers of Humboldt squid, which are more tolerant of low-oxygen waters, have increased significantly in the same location. Even the fish that can survive in dead zones are not faring well: large numbers of female Atlantic Croaker have been found to be growing testes-like organs instead of ovaries, a sexual deformation which causes infertility. Any shifts in ecosystem biodiversity can lead to a vicious feedback loop: dead zone seafloors turn into biodiversity deserts, where little but methane- and hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria survive. Paired with changes in nutrient cycling which result in the release of nitrogen gas, levels of greenhouse gases being released from the ocean to the atmosphere increase and contribute to further global warming. To prevent the possibility of a 1,000-year (or longer) recovery period from a dead zone seafloor, we need to be much more aware of how the various environmental aspects are connected. An understanding of how de-oxygenation has affected the ocean in the past and how our actions are affecting the ocean in the present is critical to either preventing a recurrence or at least minimising effects of what we have already done.",2020-12-19T15:32:05.528679Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:52:38.258813Z,1081,119,,"One of the UK’s flagship sustainability policies is in big trouble. Less than a year from now, the theory goes, all new homes will be “zero-carbon”. The reality is rather different. Economic meltdown, a housing crisis, pressure from developers and poorly designed legislation have all combined to leave the country way behind schedule. The policy dates back to 2006, when the Labour administration introduced stringent sustainability legislation. All new homes, they said, would be “zero-carbon” by 2016. The provision of solar panels (and other renewable energy technologies) and better energy efficiency would balance out emissions from heating, lighting and use of appliances leaving net emissions at zero.  To achieve this, building regulations were to be progressively tightened in the run up to 2016 and a Zero Carbon Hub would be formed to knock together the heads of house builders, NGOs and bureaucrats.  At the time this target was hailed as world leading and on some level the policy has been a success. By December 2014 some 33,000 homes had been built to sustainable standards, according to one measure. However, we need to look at the bigger picture. Fast forward a decade or so and under the Conservative-led coalition government the agenda has spluttered from problem to problem. The reforms to building regulations have been delayed and are not achieving the kinds of levels envisaged. The latest were introduced a year late and only achieved a 33% improvement in energy performance, against a promised 44%. This leaves a big gap between where we are now and the next iteration, which is supposed to achieve “zero-carbon”. More worryingly, despite six years of negotiations it still isn’t clear how “zero-carbon” will be defined. What we do know is that zero-carbon is likely to be anything but.  The definition of emissions, for example, was weakened in the 2011 budget. It now includes emissions from heating and lighting but it wont include those from “unregulated energy” – that is, energy used by appliances within the home.  Emission reductions won’t even have to be achieved in the house itself. “Allowable solutions” have been introduced instead, a level of emissions above which developers can pay into a fund for low-carbon infrastructure to be built elsewhere as a way to “off-set” carbon.  Precisely at what level these allowable solutions will kick in is not clear, nor how the fund will work in reality. What is clear is that developments of fewer than ten houses (which comprise the vast majority of house-building) will be exempt from allowable solutions. Tellingly, the WWF left the Zero-Carbon Hub in protest against what it saw as a “watering down” of policy. With so many details still to be decided, it is unsurprising that there is little confidence that the 2016 target will be met. This is not necessarily the coalition’s fault however. In many ways it is the result of inherent contradictions within the policy. The underlying rhetoric has been that technology – solar panels, heat pumps, insulation and so on – will do all of the hard work and consumers need not worry themselves about how they engage with and run their homes.  But who pays for this technology? Government figures show that complying with the 2010 sustainable building regulations meant a 5% increase in real production costs compared to 2006. Complying with 2013 regulations would see that figure rise to 9%. Want to build to the strictest zero-carbon standards? That’s a 50% increase. Labour never adequately addressed the question of “who pays”, sowing the seeds for today’s problems.  More often than not it has been housing developers who have had to shoulder the costs because there has never been a significant enough “price premium” attached to sustainable homes.  These costs would come down as technologies and expertise became more widespread, but the 2008 credit crisis and the increased politicisation of housing affordability and supply changed things. These sustainability requirements had the potential to hinder the construction of new housing, so developers were vocal in their opposition. The coalition has been more sympathetic to developers than other parties may have been. Yet in many ways these policy reforms were inevitable. While it would be nice to say that the government should force increased costs on builders, the reality is very different as the government must consider whether environmental policy will jeopardise housing supply. In the midst of a financial crisis, the industry couldn’t afford the costs associated with the initial zero-carbon proposals. In many ways this watering down could have been avoided if the initial policy had more of a focus on giving home owners an incentive to be greener. The challenge for the next administration is finding a way to encourage developers to build the homes we desperately need while sharing sustainability demands between both buyers and builders. We need homes, but we owe it to future generations to make them green.",2020-12-19T16:52:38.258850Z,1

In recent years there has been a push to create the impression carbon dioxide is a pollutant, or toxin. Consequently, there have been a few studies suggesting exposure to higher CO2 concentrations (~1500 to 2500 ppm) severely impair human cognitive and decision-making performance (Satish et al., 2012, Allen et al., 2016).
If true, this would be rather problematic for elementary school children, as they are routinely exposed to CO2 concentrations ranging between about 1500 and 3000 ppm in their classrooms (Corsi et al., 2002).
Driving alone in one’s vehicle could mean exposure to “3700 ppm … above outdoor [CO2] concentrations” (Satish et al, 2012), or about 4100 ppm.
This elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm suggests the world’s highways are teeming with cognitively-impaired drivers.
2 new studies show elevated CO2 has no effect on cognitive performance
The results from a 2018 study (Rodeheffer et al., 2018) measuring the cognitive and decision-making performances of submariners exposed to elevated CO2 undermined the attempts to portray CO2 as a brain-function-impairing toxin.

In the study, subjects were exposed to 3 CO2 conditions: 600, 2500, and 15000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no significant differences” in how the subjects performed for any of the CO2 exposure levels.

A new study (Scully et al., 2019) assessing the capacity of elevated CO2 exposure to affect cognitive and decision-making performance appends the Rodeheffer et al. (2018) results.
This time, “astronaut-like” subjects were exposed to four CO2 gradients: 600, 1200, 2500, and 5000 ppm.
The results indicated there were “no clear dose-response patterns” evident for any of the exposure conditions.
In fact, the performance of subjects exposed to 5000 ppm slightly exceeded the performance of subjects exposed to 600 ppm CO2.
These results suggest the elevated-CO2-is-toxic-to-brain-functioning paradigm is not supported by real-world experiments.

===============================================
World may get another climate realist leader
By Kirye
As the working class struggles economically, signs of profound anti-establishment shifts are emerging in Japan, spurred on by a new political leader who is a climate and energy realist.
Rising Japanese political star Taro Yamamoto aims to shake up Japan’s crusty establishment down to the core. Image: Twitter here.
Growing poverty in Japan
In the House of Councillors election held on July 21, 2019, I voted for the recently founded Reiwa Shinsengumi party led by Taro Yamamoto . Why? According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), 57.7% of families, 81％ of single mothers and 1 of 7 children feel impoverished. These are shockingly dismal social and economic indicators for one the richest countries on the planet.
Part of this is due to an increased tax burden that have made people unhappy and poorer while the super rich profit from tax cuts. Moreover, Japanese finance minister Tarō Asō suggested that Japan could even learn from constitutional changes made by the Nazi party! Japanese president Shinzo Abe spends time on the golf course.
In contrast Taro Yamamoto, leader of the newly minted Reiwa Shinsengumi party, helps out at soup kitchens and fights for Japan’s many forgotten citizens.
Enough is enough – historic election result
Today there’s finally a growing feeling among the Japanese citizenry that the country is in need of toppling establishment structures and bringing in a new president and political party who work for justice, life and on behalf of the poor.
In the recent Upper House election, Mr. Yamamoto hauled in 992,267 votes, and so was the candidate with the highest number of votes in history in proportional representation. Now the Reiwa Shinsengumi has gone from a political group to political party, and is becoming more famous as many Japanese media are reporting on the phenomenon.
Energy and climate realist

When it comes to energy, party leader Yamamoto wants to use natural gas thermal power as a main energy supply, and to end the use of nuclear power (Japan is an earthquake country, so his ideas are valid).
On climate, I personally have never heard Mr. Yamamoto mention that CO2 is bad, despite so many Japanese people having been brainwashed by the media into believing we have to cut CO2 emissions. Many Japanese have never even heard of Climategate. Where does he stand on climate?

Yamaoto at JAJ press conference.
To find out, last Wednesday I took part in a press conference held by the Journalists Association of Japan and had the opportunity to tell Mr. Yamamoto the real story of how CO2 is not climate’s main driver (1:34:34 mark and 1:38:00). In summary I told him: Just this year alone, almost 200 new papers which do not support the anthropogenic global warming theory have been published so far. Last year the number of skeptic papers was 504. Moreover, NASA’s website shows only 166 stations have data that go back to 1880, and less than 1000 stations have the data from January, 1919.
I also told Mr. Yamamoto how distinguished Japanese climate scientist Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, who used to work for NASA, reminds us that only 5% of Earth’s surface has been adequately measured by thermometer over past 100 years and how the surface temperatures have been substantially affected by the urban heat island effect. Also how the real world’s temperature remains a far cry from the IPCC’s prediction.
He answered:  “In a sense it is wonderful if the fact spreads abroad and that it is controversial.”
He added:
Some people say that warming is not good, and are criticizing me because I aim breaking with nuclear power generation and I am pushing the generation of thermal power.”
This is a fresh perspective that has long been lacking in Japan, and so Mr. Yamamoto could act as a figure for changing public perception on the issues of climate and energy. Eventually the facts will win out because the sham cannot hide reality for long.
Growing roster of worldwide climate realist leaders – alarmists in panic
Already a number of worldwide leaders have expressed strong doubts on CO2 being the dangerous climate driver, for example US President Donald Trump, Russia President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and the UK’s Boris Johnson. Others include Eastern European leaders, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. The momentum is real. So it’s little wonder global warming alarmists are becoming increasingly spooked and hysterical.
Some people believe that Mr. Yamamoto will be the next President of Japan, and I hope so. If it becomes reality, the world will be adding yet another climate realist to the growing roster of climate-realist leaders.

,2020-12-19T15:32:51.883769Z,1086,119,,"New details of a nightmare period on Earth with surface conditions as frigid as present-day central Antarctica at the equator have been revealed thanks to the publication of a study of ancient glacier water. The research, by an international team led by Daniel Herwartz, is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and shows that even tropical regions were once covered in snow and ice. In the most recent ice age, the last glacial advance (ending about 12,000 years ago) ice sheets extended across Europe at the latitude of southernmost England and reached south of the Great Lakes in North America. Beyond lay tundra, woolly mammoths and so on – but the equatorial belt of tropical rainforest was still there. Much more drastic situations occurred far earlier in Earth’s history however, and it is these that are supported by the new study. The periods have been dubbed “Snowball Earth”. This term first rose to prominence in the 1990s on the back of decades of geological observations of rocks deposited by glaciers, on land and at sea, during much of the period lasting from about 720m to 630m years ago at locations from across the globe which – at the time – were on the equator or no more than 40 degrees from it.  This was not easy for geologists to establish, because organisms that would leave large, easily recognisable fossils (so useful for relative dating) had not yet evolved. Moreover, the distribution of continents was different and has to be deduced by measuring traces of the Earth’s magnetic field captured into the rocks when they formed (paleomagnetism). Over the period in question, a single super-continent known as Rodinia was beginning to break apart, but still straddled the equator. Why the climate should ever veer so extremely as to become caught in Snowball Earth conditions is a complex matter. On the one hand the Sun was 20-30% fainter than it is now, and thus provided less heat. However, the ancient atmosphere had much more carbon dioxide in it than now, so there would have been a more effective “greenhouse effect” to trap heat and keep the planet warm.  Changes in the Earth’s orbit, or in the tilt of its axis, might have tipped the balance – these are the likely cause of more recent glaciations – but it is possible that full Snowball Earth conditions can be initiated only when a super-continent lies across the equator. As land reflects more solar heat than the oceans, equatorial Rodinia maximised the amount of heat bounced back into space rather than absorbed into the seas and kept on Earth. Snowball Earth conditions gripped Rodinia at least twice, in an older episode known as the Surtian and in a younger episode known as the Marinoan. Herwartz and his team studied rock samples from the Dabie-Sulu belt in modern day eastern China. Back in Surtian and Marinoan times this region was between 15 and 35 degrees north, the same sort of latitude as present-day Mexico, India or the Sahara.  The team also studied rocks from a much older proposed Snowball Earth episode, about 2.2 billion years ago, sampled in Karelia, in present-day northwest Russia close to the border with Finland. These too were at a low latitude at the time in question. 
0 The researchers’ key innovation was to analyse oxygen left behind by ancient glacial water as it reacted with rocks to form new minerals. They used this to work out the prevailing surface temperatures. Oxygen comes in three stable forms, or “isotopes”. Nearly 99.8% of oxygen atoms are oxygen-16 (made of 8 protons and 8 neutrons). Most of the remainder is oxygen-18 (8 protons and 10 neutrons), but there are also traces of oxygen-17 (8 protons and 9 neutrons).  A water molecule containing a heavier isotope of oxygen has the same chemical properties as a water molecule containing the lighter oxygen-16 but will evaporate less readily and condense more quickly. This means that the oceans lose water molecules containing oxygen-16 at a faster rate, and rain (or snow) falling far from the ocean will be poorer than average in the heaver isotopes. The ratios of the different oxygen isotopes in the recent geological past can be used as a proxy for global temperature, or to estimate how much water from the oceans has been removed and stored in glaciers. It is far from simple to get at the information locked in ancient rocks of the kind studied by Herwartz’s team, but by including the extremely rare oxygen-17 isotope in their study, they were able to show that both of the heavier isotopes must have been rarer than expected in the glacial water that had reacted with the rock. The difference in the depletion of oxygen-17 compared to the depletion in oxygen-18 enabled them to demonstrate likely mean annual surface temperatures of as much as 40°C below zero. Such low temperatures imply that the oceans would have been deeply frozen too, supporting the full Snowball Earth model. But if the land where the rocks originated was so cold because it was several kilometres above sea level, the possibility that the planet was more of a Slushball Earth, with open seawater near the equator, cannot entirely be ruled out.",2020-12-19T15:32:51.883801Z,1
,2020-12-21T17:29:32.283561Z,1088,119,,"The speed with which the conservative side of politics and the media has gone from assuring us climate change was not a problem, so we don’t need to worry about reducing emissions, to asserting that climate change is a problem, but we still don’t need to worry about reducing emissions, is breathtaking. Literally, given the levels of smoke still around. You don’t get a cookie for saying you think climate change is real.  I’m sorry, you don’t. All you get is the capacity to say you have reached 1990 levels of comprehension – as that was when the first IPCC report was issued. You don’t get a prize for spending 30 years doing all you can to halt, undermine and dismantle action to reduce emissions, only to now say: “Hey, climate change is real.” Consider that the Sydney Morning Herald this week ran a front page story headlined “Minister slams climate debate”, with the lead that “Australia’s bushfire crisis has prompted a blunt warning from Science Minister Karen Andrews to those she says are wasting time arguing about whether climate change is real”. Oh good, that’s all sorted then. But when you read on, you see nothing in her statement suggest one iota of a shift in the government’s position on emissions. She told the Herald: “My starting position in the discussion tomorrow will be that the climate has changed and it continues to change. We need to focus on the steps to adapt and mitigate the impact of those changes.” The important point is she desires to mitigate the impact of the change, not to mitigate the actual change. Right now the government is indulging in the equivalent of responding to polio by promising to invest in more iron lungs. And bizarrely, it is getting credit for it. Adaptation is not mitigation. What is being said now is no different to what was said by Tony Abbott back when he was prime minister. In 2015, Abbott told parliament: “As far as the government is concerned, climate change is real. Mankind makes a contribution, and it is important to have strong and effective action to deal with it. “We have met and beaten our Kyoto targets ... We are on track to meet and beat our current commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 by 13 per cent on 2005 levels.” He then concluded: “I’m not going to put someone’s job at risk, a region’s, town’s future at risk, I’m not going to put up electricity prices to do it, I’m not going to put a tax on them to do it. I’m going to achieve it in the way we’ve met our Kyoto 2020 targets, meet and beat, and we’ve done that through better technology, through the policies we’ve put through the emissions reduction fund, and we’re going to continue to do that because it is really important.” Oh sorry, that wasn’t Abbott, that was Scott Morrison in his interview with David Speers last Sunday. If you can discern any difference in language between what Morrison is now saying and what Abbott said in 2015, then your level of reading between the lines has become so great you are seeing things that are not there. Just because we all desire the Coalition to do something on climate change doesn’t actually mean they will. And their actions over the past decade mean they have not earned the benefit of doubt, rather they have earned our total scepticism. The same goes for the conservative media. This week the NT News was getting praise for its front page, in which it stated: “What Australian needs now is real, affordable solutions – not armies of keyboard warriors.” But aside from the pretty random sideswipe at keyboard warriors, the statement is the perfect representation of meaningless dribble designed to sound like a bold stance. You know what is a real and affordable solution? Putting a price on carbon. And yet in the NT News editorial, the word emissions was not even mentioned, and I am prepared to bet my superannuation fund they would not suggest a price on carbon was an affordable solution. Similarly the Daily Telegraph’s editorial on Thursday on “Moving climate debate forward” praised the government’s policy and demanded the ALP come clean with how much theirs would cost. Give me strength. It seems that moving forward is reenacting the exact same coverage that occurred during the last election. You can’t say you agree with the science on climate change and then completely disregard the science that calls for the need to reduce emission by 45% from  2010 levels as soon as possible and to get to zero net emissions by at least 2050. Saying you agree with the science of climate change but that you believe the government’s current plan is adequate is like saying you agree with vaccination, but you chose to only get one of your three kids immunised because, heck, that is more affordable. The cheapest way to deal with the cost of climate change is to reduce our emissions and prevent, as much as is possible, further increases in global temperatures. Dealing with climate change will be tough – people will lose jobs, the prices of some things will rise, but the cost of inaction is going to be much greater and more damaging – both to our economy and to our society. Fortunately, the path to a vibrant emissions-free economy remains, and as Ross Garnaut has pointed out, such a shift will be extremely beneficial for our economy if we act now. Indeed perhaps the most frustrating thing about the past decade is that not only have we have wasted a chance to reduce emissions, we have forgone the opportunity to set up our economy for the next 100 years. Do not fall for the government’s spin. The need for action on climate change is the need to reduce emissions and to also take a leading role in that fight on the international stage. So when you hear someone in government say they believe in climate change, ask what they are doing about reducing emissions; everything else is spin.",2020-12-21T17:29:32.283593Z,1

The authors of a new study (Jiao et al., 2019) point out that temperature changes in the Tianshan mountains are “mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods.”
Despite some warming since the 1950s, the authors do not maintain CO2 changes were an influencing climate factor in the 1680-2012 reconstruction.
The 1708-1801 period is shown to be about 1-2°C warmer than the the 1950-2012 period.

Jiao et al., 2019
“Regional climate change is affected by large-scale climate-forcing factors, such as solar activity and atmospheric–oceanic variability (Fang et al., 2010; Linderholm et al., 2015; Rydval et al., 2017). On the one hand, based on the MTM analysis results, the temperature changes in the study area are mainly influenced by the solar activity via the mean minimum temperature within approximately 11-year periods (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2015). The tree-ring chronology was developed by samples of Schrenk spruce collected from the National Nature Reserve of the Western Tianshan Mountains. The mean minimum temperature in the growing season is the main and stable limiting climate factor. Therefore, the mean minimum temperature series in the growing season during 1680–2012 was reconstructed based on the STD chronology.”
“In the past 333 years, the mean minimum temperature has roughly experienced three relatively cold periods and relatively warm stages (relatively cold periods: 1680–1707, 1802–1911 and 1935–1997; relatively warm periods: 1708–1801, 1912–1934 and 1998–2012). By analyzing similar trends in regional temperature changes in our reconstruction series with drought events, large volcanic eruptions and other reconstruction series around the study regions in Xinjiang and even large-scale regions, we found that the mean minimum temperature of the reconstruction was accurate and reliant. Moreover, the mean minimum temperature was influenced by solar activity (sunspots) and large-scale atmospheric–oceanic fluctuations (NAO, WPO, ENSO, TBO) based on the MTM and spatial correlation analysis.”

So the report is now looking more and more like a junk-science-based instrument designed to boost the plant-based substitute meat industry, which include major companies such as Beyond Meat.
Kleiner Perkins: biggest Beyond Meat investor
Generation Investment Management is connected to Kleiner Perkins, where former Vice President Al Gore is one of its partners and advisors.
Who’s Kleiner Perkins? It turns out they are Beyond Meat’s biggest investor, according to bizjournals.com here. Beyond Meat is a Los Angeles-based producer of plant-based meat substitutes founded in 2009 by Ethan Brown. The company went public in May and just weeks later the more than quadrupled in there value.
Yes, Al Gore, partner and advisor to Kleiner Perkins, Beyond Meat’s big investor, stands to haul in millions, should governments move to restrict real meat consumption and force citizens to swallow the dubious substitutes and fakes.
If taken seriously, the World Research Institute Report, backed by Gore hacks, will help move the transition over to substitute meats far more quickly.
According to S___:
All these “We need to cut beef consumption to save the planet” stories originate from the World Resources Institute whose co-chair is a partner in the firm that collaborates w/ the main investor in @BeyondMeat and his co-founder is a partner in the main investor.”

,2020-12-21T17:30:42.706629Z,1094,120,,"The European shale gas boom has not materialised in the way that some were predicting. We are a far cry from the situation a few years ago, where interest in fracking in Europe was gathering pace on the back of the successes in North America.  The UK appeared to be leading the way, with drilling activities in north-west and south-east England. Companies started snapping up exploration licences right across the continent, and prospects from Scandinavia to the Urals found themselves being eagerly appraised. So what’s happened, and what do the prospects for Europe look like now? Of the countries in mainland western Europe, France has the most potential for unconventional hydrocarbons. The shales of the Paris Basin are thought to have major shale gas and minor shale oil potential, while the Jurassic shales in the south-east of the country may also have some shale gas potential. But a fracking moratorium has been in place since 2011, and was upheld in 2013. For the present, therefore, France ne frac pas. Germany, like France, has not permitted fracking since 2011. But unlike France, it does not have huge quantities of prospective shale. Most of the potential interest in fracking is for gas from low permeability sandstones and coal beds, and there have been moves recently to permit fracking at depths of more than 3,000 metres. The only other mainland western European country with significant shale gas potential is the Netherlands. There is considerable public opposition, however, particularly with conventional gas extraction having been linked to subsidence and induced seismicity in the Groningen area. No fracking for shale gas has been permitted so far. Shale gas in Europe by country With large areas of apparently prospective shale and a government supportive of fracking, Poland looked to be the frontrunner of the European shale gas boom. The reality has been rather more sobering, however.  Many boreholes have been drilled, few have produced the results that were hoped for, and most of the major companies have now withdrawn from the country. Polish shale gas may still prove to be viable in the long-term, but abundant shales and an enthusiastic political leadership do not guarantee fracking success. Ukraine was also seen as a major exploration target, with prospects for shale gas in both the west and east of the country. Exploration began in both areas, but subsequent political upheavals and the violent conflict in the Donetsk region have ensured that fracking has not taken off and has little likelihood of doing so in the near future. The prospective shales of western Ukraine continue into Romania and Bulgaria. Romania saw some exploration for shale gas by Chevron, but poor results and environmental protests saw the company pull out of the country in early 2015. Bulgaria, meanwhile, placed a moratorium on fracking in 2012. Hungary and the Lithuania-Kaliningrad region of the Baltic are also thought to have unconventional hydrocarbon potential, but little exploration activity has taken place. Shale oil in Europe by country The only Scandinavian country where shales have proven of interest is Denmark, where the US Geological Survey suggested that there were 2.5tn cubic feet (tcf) of onshore gas resources in the Alum Shale.  The government issued a moratorium on fracking in 2012, but Total was allowed to continue with exploration in Jutland and Zealand, with plans to carry out test drilling this spring. There have been reports that the government may consider lifting the moratorium if Total decides to go ahead with fracking on the back of good results.  The geology in southern Europe is tectonically complex. There are few shale basins, so the region has seen very limited interest in fracking. The Jurassic shales of the Basque-Cantabrian basin of northwest Spain are considered to have some potential for shale gas, and some exploration has begun there. It is clear there are very few European countries in which fracking is likely to happen any time soon, if at all. Many apparently prospective European shales have turned out to be more geologically complicated than expected.  This is related to the fact that although shale is a very common rock, it has not been a common subject of research – at least until recently. Much remains to be understood about how shales form, how they vary, and how they behave when fracked.  Environmental and political concerns have also come to the fore more than might have been anticipated, while the oil-price slump has made all efforts look much more expensive than they did a year ago.  For the companies concerned, this has changed the economics – particularly where the geology has proven complex. Europe’s shales were always going to be different to those of North America. To major companies, they now look a great deal less enticing.  Nonetheless, it is crucial that fracking research continues. A good understanding of shale geology is still in its infancy. If fracking is to take place anywhere in Europe, baseline environmental information from potential fracking sites needs to be collected, analysed, and made publicly available, along with long-term monitoring data.  Shale scientists must also develop meaningful dialogues with the public, explaining what we know and don’t know about the possible risks. The Research Fracking in Europe (ReFINE) project is involved in this work, looking at things like how far hydraulic fractures go, how large an earthquake fracking can cause, and the likelihood of leaks from shale-gas wells.  Meanwhile the EU announced several weeks ago that it was awarding €12m (£8.6m) to researchers looking at the environmental impact of fracking, and the risks of chemicals and gases being dispersed below the ground. Europe might never lead the world in fracking, but it can lead the world in fracking research.",2020-12-21T17:30:42.706674Z,1
,2020-12-19T16:15:29.624413Z,1095,120,,"Prince William recently spoke at one of the largest illegal wildlife summits ever held in London. He said, “Poaching is an economic crime against ordinary people and their futures.” The quote could have been better. Poachers, after all, are merely the corner boys of the global illegal wildlife trade, the ones who benefit least financially and risk most, usually their lives. They’re ordinary people too, and vilifying them is not getting to the heart of the issue.  William had travelled to Tanzania, Kenya and Namibia in September and October this year, to learn about conservation, and a video of his trip to Tanzania was presented to the attendees. It did not go down well with various NGOs and campaigners who accused the video of promoting a “white saviour” image, given that only one African, a student, spoke to the camera, while the rest of the interviewees were international participants. Certainly, the team making the video could have better selected the participants and had a wider range of people speak. But that would be putting a sticking plaster over a very serious wound. There are fundamental issues at the heart of conservation, which as a movement was built on inequality and can also perpetuate that same inequality.  In the Guardian’s reporting of the Prince William incident, Dr Mordecai Ogada, director of Conservation Solutions Afrika, said: Conservation even now, nearly 55 years after Kenya got independence, is still the one arena where Prince William can waltz in to Kenya and tell us he wants us to do this, that or the other … He couldn’t do that in education, banking or other fields, but conservation still has that romantic, Out of Africa feel about it. This is the bigger issue we should be having a conversation about. Why, decades after the independence of many countries in the Global South, does conservation still have this (neo-)colonial undertone? In conservation, history is always present. Across the Global South, researchers like me often work in post-colonial landscapes, areas marked by evictions, forced settlement of herders, the fencing of large swathes of land for private use, or other access restrictions. This, understandably, can foster resentment, disenfranchisement and anger in people living in those regions.  I’ve looked at elephants in South Africa’s Kruger National Park, for instance, where the very name “Kruger” is divisive given he was an Afrikaner leader with a dubious relationship to conservation. There, the government has settled land claims of people who were dispossessed from the park land – for example, in 2016, six communities received 84m rand (£4.5m). Rates of visiting the park are still recovering from the fact that generations of South Africans who were classified as “non-white” were denied access to large sections of national parks under apartheid. I recently attended a session on human and wildlife “conflict” and coexistence in southern India. I realised this wasn’t a simple north-south issue. A lot of my Indian colleagues had also been trained under our current ideas about anthropogenic activities threatening biodiversity. This concept can risk bleeding into a perception of humans themselves being the threat. For example, an article in Nature on future threats to biodiversity and paths to prevent them takes on the distinctly misanthropic and negative “humans are killing the planet and all its inhabitants” when reported in the New York Post. At the same meeting, I heard sentiments way too close for comfort to the “noble savage” trope about communities, in this case local ethnic minorities, who live alongside wildlife. I was disappointed that we seemed to reduce people to bad guys, victims, or romanticise them even though conservation paradigms have supposedly shifted to centring, or at least considering people. As we talked about low-paid immigrant workers on tea plantations, I noticed there weren’t any representatives present. This risks them being “othered” and the psychological distance creating a space for us to accept them facing risks, like being killed by an elephant as they walked to work. I talked to a journalist colleague in Johannesburg and she shared a similar sentiment, the world wants wildlife stories about a collectively imagined “wild Africa”, not human stories. Because the human stories are complex, less palatable, and potentially threatening to biodiversity. And it’s a shame because Johannesburg is such a vibrant hub of entrepreneurship and creativity. We should be leaping onto that for conservation and collaborating, not seeing it as the opposition. I am not naïve enough to think that the global distributions of funding and biodiversity map onto each other. In fact, it’s no coincidence that richer countries have lost most of their large mammals in favour of agricultural, industrial and urban development. But how can we manage the funding and conservation efforts without perpetuating the “white saviour” issue?  The answer to me is clear. Conservation can’t be the preserve of people who can afford international travel and to take unpaid internships. We can make choices about communication, participation, training, educating, hiring, salaries, promotion and project leadership (let’s not trap people in assistant positions) and focus on diversity in those. The opening to every conservation text book reads like the fall from the garden of Eden and we have to turn that around; people (and not just white people) are the opportunity. Skills in spatial analysis, human behaviour, modelling data are vital to a vibrant and technology-driven approach to conservation and these are marketable skills. We need to capture this exceptional human talent, make sure a wide range of people have access to funding and ensure people feel heard in conservation so they choose to make it their career. There are already some incredible leaders and people sharing platforms, and hopefully Prince William will do that in his next speech.",2020-12-19T16:15:29.624447Z,1

Human activity has clearly altered the land surface, oceans and atmosphere, and re-ordered life on Earth. This suggests that the planet has entered a new human-dominated geological epoch, called the Anthropocene.  However there has been significant scientific debate concerning exactly when this epoch began. We argue, in a new paper in Nature, that the Anthropocene began with the irreversible exchange of species between the New and Old Worlds following the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas. The resulting global networks of trade led to a rapid, repeated, cross-ocean exchange of species, which is without precedent in Earth’s history. It provides an unambiguous event after which the impacts of human activity became global and set Earth on a new trajectory. Defining the beginning of the Anthropocene as a formal geologic unit of time requires two requirements to be met. First, that there is evidence of long-term changes to the Earth as a global system. Second, that there is a marker of a global event that can be dated in layers of rock, sediment from the ocean floor, or ancient glacier ice. This marker is called a Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), also known as a “golden spike”. GSSPs have been used to define geological time for the past 600m years.  In our research we found that most previously proposed Anthropocene start dates, including the earliest detectable human impacts through farming and historic events such as the start of the industrial revolution, should be rejected. They are not based on a globally synchronous markers and may not be permanent changes that could still be seen in a few million years – the time span of a typical epoch. We found only two GSSP dates that fit. There was the 1610 Orbis (Latin for “world”) spike, when the impacts of the collision of the New and Old Worlds a century earlier were first felt globally. The species exchange between the Old and New Worlds is noted in the fossil record at this time, coupled with a marked drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide, centred on 1610. Then there was the 1964 Bomb Spike, the peak in radionuclide fallout from nuclear weapons testing, which is coincident with the acceleration of very recent global environmental changes.  While both GSSP dates appear to adhere to the criteria for the beginning of the Anthropocene, we suggest that overall, 1610 is the strongest contender. A drop in CO2, centred on 1610, was a result of European arrival in the Americas. This arrival led to the deaths of around 50m indigenous people, most within a few decades of the 16th century and mostly due to smallpox. The resulting near-cessation of farming across a continent and re-growth of Latin American forests and other vegetation removed enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce a pronounced dip in CO2 seen in Antarctic ice core records.   The decline in carbon dioxide fits the formal requirement of a dated global environmental change that is captured and preserved in natural material. The irreversible exchange of species fits the other requirement of evidence of long-lasting changes to the Earth. For example, fossil pollen of maize, a Latin American species, first appears in marine sediment in Europe in 1600, becoming common over subsequent centuries. In geological terms the 1610 drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide is also associated with the coolest period of the Little Ice Age – a period between about 1300 and 1870 when North America and Europe experienced colder winters – when many changes occurred in geological deposits worldwide. The boundary therefore also marks Earth’s last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long-term global warmth of the Anthropocene. The second possible starting point which we and other research groups have identified is the 1964 peak in radionuclide fallout.  The advantage of this GSSP is that it is recorded in many geological deposits worldwide and it coincides with the huge acceleration of human impacts starting in the 1950s that continues to the present. Yet, from a geological perspective, there is one key disadvantage of this date: while nuclear weapons could dramatically alter the planet’s environment, so far they haven’t. The radioactive fallout from bomb tests is a very good marker, but is not itself an Earth-changing event leading to long-lasting changes. The start of the industrial revolution has commonly been suggested as the beginning of the Anthropocene. It is a clear turning point in human history and the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use is a critically important long-term global environmental change.  However, there is a lack of a suitable golden spike at this time because most impacts were local – while smog soon covered towns in the north of England, most of the rest of the world continued largely untouched. Meanwhile the global exponential rise in carbon dioxide is too smooth an increase to form a marker.   We could instead date the Anthropocene from a hand-picked year, not tied to a specific event in the fossil or atmospheric record, but tied instead to broad change in the Earth as a system – this is how geologists date eras beyond 600m years ago where well-preserved rock sections and specific events are hard to find. However picking the year 1760 or 1800, or when ever, is fraught with difficulty as any date chosen would be open to challenge as being arbitrary. Nonetheless, the collision of the Old and New Worlds is linked to the industrial revolution. Europe’s annexing of the Americas provided major new imports of agricultural commodities, thereby freeing Western European labour from the land – this, alongside coal, was one of two essential precursors to the industrial revolution. So dating the Anthropocene to 1610, some 150 years prior to the beginning of the industrial revolution, is consistent with the material causes of that turning point in human history. Formally ratifying the Anthropocene as an epoch requires the agreement of a series of geological committees. If it is adopted, we consider it a defining moment for humans, a time that has fundamentally changed our relationship with our environment.   Embracing the Anthropocene essentially reverses 500 years of scientific discoveries that have moved humans to a position of increasing insignificance, from the 16th-century Copernican revolution and the modern understanding that our sun is one of 1024 stars in the universe, to the 19th-century Darwinian revolution that established humans as merely a twig on the tree of life with no special origin.  A 21st-century adoption of the Anthropocene reverses this insignificance: humans are not passive observers of Earth but central to it, where the future of the only place where life is known to exist is being determined by our actions. A more widespread recognition that human actions are driving far reaching changes to the life-supporting infrastructure of Earth will have implications for our philosophical, social, economic and political views of our environment. But we should not despair. The power that humans wield is unlike any other force of nature, it is reflexive and therefore can be used, withdrawn or modified. The first stage of course is recognising it.",2020-12-19T15:34:09.597537Z,1

But long-term studies in both hemispheres indicate extreme precipitation patterns were more common prior to the 20th and 21st centuries. Natural variability dominates precipitation patterns so thoroughly that an anthropogenic signal cannot be detected in observed records.
Internal climate variability (ICV) masks detection of an anthropogenic influence in extreme rainfall patterns (Bhatia and Ganguly, 2019).

Contrary to modeled expectations, there has been no “coherent picture” of an increase in extreme precipitation on a global scale in recent decades (Tabari and Willems, 2018).
