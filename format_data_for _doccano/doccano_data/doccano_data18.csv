Sun factor grossly underestimated
Lately the sun’s activity has been very quiet as the star at the center of our solar system transitions over to a new solar cycle. April sunspot activity was very low in May. Vahrenholt then cites a recent study by Lewis and Curry showing that climate sensitivity to CO2 is in fact “up to 45% less than what the IPCC and the mainstream of climate science would like to have us believe.” Vahrenholt comments:
What was interesting however was the reaction of the mainstream: the methods used by Curry and Lewis in the study were not doubted. However, it could mean – according to the mainstream – that the earth will react very differently to CO2 in the future, i.e. get warmer. That’s what we can call speculative science, namely trust in the models which in the past have failed and have not been able to depict ocean circulation and clouds.”

So with CO2 not being at the factor it was made out to be, and because the Paris Accord is based on the spectacle of a rapidly warming planet, Vahrenholt writes that the “foundation of the Paris Accord has collapsed.”
Only Europe and Canada exiting coal
Another reason the Paris Accord is collapsing is because it’s not going to do anything we were promised it would.
When it comes to coal, Vahrenholt notes, so far only Europe and Canada have expressed some sort of a commitment to exit coal, and then he reminds us China, India and all developing countries will still be permitted to continue “massively” expanding their use of coal. He writes:
In China 280,000 MW and in India 174,000 MW are going to be added. By comparison: the entire brown coal fleet in Germany has a capacity of 22,700 MW. 1600 coal-fired power plants will be built in 62 countries across the world, most of them, by the way, will be built by Chinese power plant builders with the help of credits from China. Approximately 15,300 MW in Pakistan, 16,000 in Bangladesh, and even Myanmar with 5100 MW. (Source: South China Morning Post).
In other words, Angela Merkel and her green punch drinkers think the climate is going to be saved if Germany shuts down 1/20 of what China and India are going to add. No wonder Trump dumped the idiotic Accord.

Coal to expand 43% worldwide
And to illustrate what a farce the Paris Accord has become, the German energy expert adds: “In total, coal power plant capacity will expand by 43% worldwide.”
Germany to lay out the blueprint for its own demise
Currently Germany is gradually growing obsessed with the idea of a coal exit, and is setting up a Coal Commission to launch the endeavor. The Commission “however will not be made up of energy, power grid and technology experts, but rather with Greenpeace, BUND and local citizens initiatives who are against brown coal,” writes Vahrenholt.
“The idea of including critics of alternative energy, which has become the largest destroyer of nature since WWII, never dawned on any politician.”
Green state fundamentalism
The Coal Commission of course should include Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, fiormer director of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute and architect of the Great Transformation masterplan, which calls for an immediate end to the economic model that is based on “fossil industrial metabolism”, making climate protection the “fundamental target of the state by which the legislative, executive and judicial branches are to align themselves.”
Paris absurdity

According to Vahrenholt, the phase-out of coal will mean the decarbonization of Germany, which in turn will mean its deindustrialization. This, according to Vahrenholt, all coming to the great delight of the Chinese
A dismayed Vahrenholt sums up:

“Trump was clever enough, to exit the Paris absurdity early enough.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe time in running out for the purveyors of the “rapidly accelerating sea level rise” scare story.
Especially IPCC alarmist scientists like spreading scare stories about sea level rise, and how it’s accelerating.
So far global CO2 emissions have in fact continued to climb at a rate that is defined as the “business as usual” emissions scenario RCP8.5, which means a sea level rise of up to 97 cm by 2100, according to the most recent IPCC projections:

IPCC AR5 sea level rise for 4 different emissions scenarios. So far CO2 emissions have been on the worst case path.
Could even be 90 by 2060!
And some experts even suggest that sea level rise may occur even far more quickly. For example the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PACIOOS) here wrote. “Recent observations and projections suggest that 3 feet (90 cm) or more of sea level rise could occur earlier than 2100 and even as early as year 2060.”
Meanwhile some time ago alarmist climate site Skeptical Science here wrote: “Overall, the range of projected sea level rise by 2100 is 75 to 190 cm.”
Of course, hysterical sites like Skeptical Science don’t publish anything without first injecting a good dose of hyperbole. So we will put them down for 1200 mm of sea level rise by 2100.
Gap between reality and IPCC about to become glaring
The following chart depicts the IPCC alarmists, like Skeptical Science, projection (1200 mm), the conservative IPCC AR5 business as usual estimate (800 mm), the projected linear trend of the satellite measurements trend (320 mm), and the projected trend of what the tide gauges –  i.e. where people actually live – have been observing (160 mm):

Observed data show no signs that sea levels are rising as quickly as IPCC models have been suggesting. IPCC alarmist scenarios are about 7 times higher than what is observed by tide gauges. Chart: notrickszone.com.
Acceleration not showing up in the observations
Naturally the alarmists always claim that the sea level rise rate will be modest at first, but that it will really begin to take off in a decade or two once the oceans warm and expand, and Greenland and Antarctica start to melt in earnest.
But there’s only one problem: So far there hasn’t been any noteworthy acceleration seen in neither the satellite data or tide gauge data.
Moreover, Greenland and Arctic ice volume have been increasing. And so has Antarctica. Of course we do see a paper from time to time with alarmist scientists statistically waterboarding some rate increase out of the sea level data, but almost always the increase gets traced back to natural variation.
Time is running out – for the alarmists
What’s clear is that we will certainly know what sea level rise is doing in 15 years, ca. 2033. by then the IPCC claimed acceleration should making its debut in earnest.
However, if the tide gauges don’t show some real, major acceleration by then, from 1.6 mm/year to say 4 mm/year, then it will be safe to say that any IPCC of over 70 cm was nothing but wolf-crying.
We’re watching carefully. The days of the sea level scare story are numbered.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother new false-alarm paper reveals that coastal wetlands may not only persist well into the 21st century despite present rates of sea level rise, but the coasts may expand and even prosper due to the natural ability for soil to “build up vertically by sediment accretion”.  

Headline/image source: Sciencenews.org
“Coasts are growing all over the world”
Two years ago, a ground-breaking paper was published in the journal Nature Climate Change indicating that the Earth’s shorelines have been growing overall since the mid-1980s (Donchyts et al., 2016).
In other words, because “coasts are growing all over the world”, there is more land area above sea level today than there was 30 years ago.
This conclusion has again been confirmed by a new paper (Luijendijk et al., 2018) that indicates only 24% of the world’s beach shorelines are eroding, whereas 76% of the world’s beach shorelines are either growing (28%) or stable (48%).
Supposedly “vulnerable” Pacific islands are expanding 
Hisabayashi et al., 2018 found that 15 of 28 studied atoll islands in the southwest Pacific grew in shoreline area during 2005 to 2015.
Kench et al., 2018 examined “101 islands in Tuvalu over the past four decades (1971–2014)”, a period in which local sea level has risen at twice the global average.  They found a “land area increase in eight of nine atolls.”
“Surprisingly, we show that all islands have changed and that the dominant mode of change has been island expansion, which has increased the land area of the nation. … Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average [<2 mm/yr-1] (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm.yr−1). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls.” (Kench et al., 2018)
Coastal marsh area has been stable or expanding

Kirwan et al., 2016 reported that coastal marshes and their “vulnerable” ecosystems are not only persisting despite present-day sea level rise, coastal marsh area has generally been stable or expanding.
In fact, it was claimed that sea level rise rates of 10-50 mm/yr (1 to 5 meters per century) during the 21st century would not be substantial enough to submerge the globe’s coastal marshes.
“Coastal marshes are considered to be among the most valuable and vulnerable ecosystems on Earth, where the imminent loss of ecosystem services is a feared consequence of sea level rise. However, we show with a meta-analysis that global measurements of marsh elevation change indicate that marshes are generally building at rates similar to or exceeding historical sea level rise, and that process-based models predict survival under a wide range of future sea level scenarios. We argue that marsh vulnerability tends to be overstated because assessment methods often fail to consider biophysical feedback processes known to accelerate soil building with sea level rise, and the potential for marshes to migrate inland. … In summary, dynamic models of marsh vertical accretion indicate that marshes will generally survive relative SLR rates of 10–50 mm yr−1 during the twenty-first century, depending on tidal range and suspended sediment availability.” (Kirwan et al., 2016)
Coastal wetlands may not be threatened by sea level rise
Adding yet another layer to the strengthening conclusion that global sea levels aren’t rising fast enough to “spell doom” to “vulnerable” coastal ecosystems and communities, Schuerch et al. (2018) find that the natural ability of coastal wetlands to “build up vertically by sediment accretion” could potentially lead to “wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area“.
More and more, scientists are undercutting alarmist proclamations of catastrophic 21st century sea level rise brought on by anthropogenic global warming.

“Rising sea levels don’t have to spell doom for the world’s coastal wetlands. A new study suggests salt marshes and other wetlands could accumulate soil quickly enough to avoid becoming fully submerged — if humans are willing to give them a little elbow room. … The new study builds on previous work that suggests rising seas will increase sediment buildup in some parts of coastal wetlands. This increased sediment, as well as human adaptations to allow wetlands to move inland as the seas rise, could allow the coastal fringes to not only survive but to increase their global area by as much as 60 percent.” (Sciencenews press release for Schuerch et al., 2018)

“On the basis of our simulations, we find that, globally, rather than losses, wetland gains of up to 60 per cent of the current area are possible, if more than 37 per cent (our upper estimate for current accommodation space) of coastal wetlands have sufficient accommodation space, and sediment supply remains at present levels.”
“[M]ost large-scale assessments have overestimated the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to SLR [present-day sea level rise]. These differences highlight a major knowledge gap in our understanding of the responses of coastal wetland areas to global environmental change. It has been argued that the reason for the observed discrepancy is that large-scale assessments have so far failed to consider the well understood biophysical feedback mechanisms that are typically included in local-scale models. These mechanisms include the ability of coastal wetlands to build up vertically by sediment accretion, which is enhanced with increasing inundation heights and frequencies, triggered, for example, by accelerating SLR [present-day sea level rise], and which enables coastal wetlands to persist or even prosper with SLR [present-day sea level rise].”
“[W]e project that until 2100, the loss of global coastal wetland area will range between 0 and 30 per cent, assuming no further accommodation space in addition to current levels. Our simulations suggest that the resilience of global wetlands is primarily driven by the availability of accommodation space, which is strongly influenced by the building of anthropogenic infrastructure in the coastal zone and such infrastructure is expected to change over the twenty-first century. Rather than being an inevitable consequence of global sea-level rise, our findings indicate that large-scale loss of coastal wetlands might be avoidable, if sufficient additional accommodation space can be created through careful nature-based adaptation solutions to coastal management.”
“[O]ur calibrated model, which includes mangroves as well as tidal salt and freshwater marshes, correctly predicts observations of present-day vertical wetland change, obtained from large meta-datasets from all over the world (Crosby et al., 2016; Kirwan et al., 2016; Lovelock et al., 2015), for 78% of all coastal areas where data are currently available (N=46).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, the observed mean thickness of the sea ice in the region north of (Arctic) Svalbard was substantially thinner (0.94 m) in 1955 than it has been in recent years (~1.6 m, 2015/2017).

Graph Source: Rösel et al., 2018

In 1955, the atmospheric CO2 concentration hovered around 315 ppm, about 90 ppm lower than today’s CO2 values.
It is widely assumed that the steep and substantial rise in CO2 concentration since the 1950s is largely responsible for warming the Arctic, and consequently the decline in the Arctic’s sea ice volume and extent (IPCC, 2013).  This assumption is significantly predicated on the observation that sea ice has undergone precipitous losses since the 1970s, which is when the satellite era began.
However, longer-term observational data do not appear to support the conclusion that Arctic region sea ice is driven by linear trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration.  Indeed, there is evidence that Arctic sea ice extent was comparable or lower than now in the 1940s and 1950s (for example, see this annotated graph from Gagné et al., 2017).  Several other recently published papers also fail to support a CO2 – Arctic climate connection, as detailed in several articles found here at NoTricksZone during 2018.

Regional Arctic sea ice was thicker than now in the 1950s?
In another newly published paper, observations from an Arctic region north of Svalbard affirm that sea ice thicknesses were indeed much higher than today during the 1970s, or when the linearly-decreasing sea ice trend documented by satellites (conveniently) commenced.
However, looking closely at Table 3 (shown in the introductory graph above) from the same paper, we see that sea ice thickness values may have been lower in the mid-1950s (0.94 m) than they are today (~1.6 m thicknesses on average).
If sea ice was was thinner than it is now during the same period of time that CO2 concentrations were substantially lower than they are now, this documented observational evidence appears to again undermine the conclusion that CO2 concentration rises are significantly connected to sea ice losses – or to the Arctic climate in general.

Thin Sea Ice, Thick Snow, and Widespread Negative
Freeboard Observed During N‐ICE 2015 North of Svalbard
“We present a continuous time series of in situ measurements from the N‐ICE2015 expedition from January to June 2015 in the Arctic Basin north of Svalbard, comprising snow buoy and ice mass balance buoy data and local and regional data gained from electromagnetic induction (EM) surveys and snow probe measurements from four distinct drifts. 
“The observed mean snow depth of 0.53 m for April to early June [2015] is 73% above the average value of 0.30 m from historical [1955, 1970s] and recent observations in this region, covering the years 1955–2017.”
“The modal total ice and snow thicknesses, of 1.6 and 1.7 m [2015] measured with ground‐based EM and airborne EM measurements in April, May, and June 2015, respectively, lie below the [1970s] values ranging from 1.8 to 2.7 m, reported in historical observations from the same region and time of year [but well above the sea-ice thickness values of 0.94 m for 1955].”

1. Warmer period of the 1930s
In 1998 D. Dahl-Jensen et al. pointed out in the journal Science that the 1930s is 0.5°K warmer than the present time based on a bore-hole study of Greenland ice sheet.
The following data support D. Dahl-Jensen’s findings, from Soon 2012.

Also heat waves were far worse across the USA in the 1930s:

More heat waves in the 1930s.
The strongest hurricane was the Labor Day hurricane, which hit in 1935. Hurricane Irma and Harvey had much higher central pressure at landfall. (U.S .National Hurricane Center):

Strongest hurricane occurred in the 1930s.
2. Arctic temperature and sea ice extent
Parts of the Arctic were warmer in the 1930s:

Arctic sea ice levels were just as low in the 1930s as they are today:

3. NASA & NOAA altered the data
The climatic data above can be understood with solar activity change (aa Index) and ocean oscillation (Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index), see the 2 charts that follow.

(Archibald)
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index was also in its warm phase during the 1930s:

PDO index was positive from1925 to1945. Data: Japan Meteorological Agency.
In summary, increasing solar activity with positive PDO index caused the warmer period of the 1930s. However, NASA and NOAA have made data tampering to stress recent warming.
Recent temperature data shows strong influence of ocean oscillation (El Nino) and no relation with CO2 increase as follows:

4. MWP & LIA caused by changes in solar activity
Solar activity proxies show the MWP & the LIA in Japan and China as follows:

Graphic above: Quansheng GE. et al., Advances in atmospheric sciences, Vol. 34, 941-951, 2017.
There are hundreds of other proxies worldwide that support solar activity as the main climate driver.
5. Sea level rise
Almost 25-years of meticulous data gathered by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology displays no discernible sea-level rise for Solomon Islands and Nauru. See the two graphs that follow:


Source: WUWT.
6. El Nino linked to solar activity
A publication by Njau (2006) showed El Nino starts at the year of sunspot minimum or maximum, thus showing that solar activity has a major impact on oceanic oscillations, which in turn powerfully impact weather and climate.
7. Extreme weather and solar activity
Bucha (1988) showed decreased solar activity causes meandering of jet stream which produces extreme weather in broad area. Since 2006 decreased solar activity has been causing heat waves, wildfires and heavy rainfall and snowfall all over the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo matter how hard climate-catastrophe obsessed alarmists attempt to beat out a little doom from the data, their results still fall far way short of their projections. Moreover, the modest warming the planet has seen over the recent decades is tied more to natural cycles.
One alarmist tweeted in response to one of my recent posts with a WoodForTrees chart showing a temperature rise over the past 40 years. His aim was to say: The temperatures are rising fast and are right on course with the models:

At first glance we see that the satellite data do show a warming trend over the past 40 years, and so the alarmists must be right – some might think.
But look at the chart more closely.
If you do, you’ll see that the global temperature over the past 40 years has risen from an anomaly of -0.2°C to +0.3°C, meaning a whopping 0.5°C over 40 years, which is 1.2°C per century.
When we put this in perspective, this is far lower than the than 4 to 6°C per century that the alarmists often like to have the public believe.
Putting this on a chart (I had to do a little rescaling):

Of course the recent pause was interrupted by an El Nino event and the latest satellite data show that the global surface temperature is down to a mere anomaly of only 0.12°C:

Chart snipped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary, July 14, 2018.
Temperature is not the only magnitude that global warming alarmists have totally exaggerated. Another example mentioned earlier is Arctic sea ice, which has been expanding over the past decade, i.e. doing the opposite of what was forecast:

Al Gore’s hysterical projections of ice-free Arctic late summers are exposed as an absolute sham. 2018 uses a conservative projected value.
Today the doomsday scenarios and projections made 10 years ago have yet to show any signs of coming true. In fact, many scientists are projecting a cooling tendency ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’re seeing lots of headlines about heavy snowfalls and cold temperatures gripping Eastern and Southern Europe. Not surprisingly some activist scientists are blaming manmade global warming.

Expected snow depths by January 15. Chart: WXCharts.EU.
Junk theory: Global warming causing more snow extremes
Yet global warming logically isn’t supposed to be directly causing massive snow and bitter cold, and so there has to be some explanation for the unexpected cold and snowy weather. So to explain its all, a gaggle of activist scientists have concocted a theory that claims “unprecedented” Arctic sea ice loss over the past two decades has led to an increase in blocking over North America and Europe [e.g., Liu et al., 2012; Francis and Vavrus, 2012] and so is indirectly causing lots of snow and cold.
These desparate scientists then hope that the public and media will be gullible enough to buy into it.
Blocking is strongly tied to weather extremes in the midlatitudes (e.g., cold snaps, heat waves) and can persist for days to weeks [e.g., Black et al., 2004; Dole et al., 2011], so more blocking could mean more weather extremes as Arctic sea ice continues to decline (Note: Arctic sea ice in fact hasn’t declined in more than 10 years).
Analyses: no data to support the theory
However, a recent paper authored by Elisabeth A. Barnes, Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University, says the data to support this just aren’t there.
The paper’s abstract:
Observed blocking trends are diagnosed to test the hypothesis that recent Arctic warming and sea ice loss has increased the likelihood of blocking over the Northern Hemisphere. To ensure robust results, we diagnose blocking using three unique blocking identification methods from the literature, each applied to four different reanalyses. No clear hemispheric increase in blocking is found for any blocking index, and while seasonal increases and decreases are found for specific isolated regions and time periods, there is no instance where all three methods agree on a robust trend. Blocking is shown to exhibit large interannual and decadal variability, highlighting the difficulty in separating any potentially forced response from natural variability.”

The results of the analyses are summed up in the following charts of the paper’s Figure 3:

Time series of blocking frequencies for the three indices and four reanalyses for (a, c, and e) Asia in DJF and (b, d, and f) the North Atlantic in JJA. Trends significantly different from zero at 95% confidence are denoted by asterisks in the legend of each panel for Asia (1990–2012) and the North Atlantic (1980–2012). Filled circles (stars) denote the seasons following the 5 highest (lowest) years of September Arctic sea ice extent over the trend period. Blocking frequencies are averaged between 40° and 80°N for the 2‐D indices. Chart: Barnes et al (2014)
Not supported by observations
The findings reiterate those of Barnes [2013], The 2014 paper concludes that “the link between recent Arctic warming and increased Northern Hemisphere blocking is currently not supported by observations.”
Blocking events well within historical observed range
The paper adds:
While Arctic sea ice experienced unprecedented losses in recent years, blocking frequencies in these years do not appear exceptional, falling well within their historically observed range.”
In other words, the theory that global warming is causing more extremes due to melting Arctic sea ice is just plain crap. There’s no data to support it. It’s just a hypothesis – one that was rolled out in a desperate attempt to explain events that weren’t supposed to happen.

The media, alarmist scientists and many leading policymakers often tell the public “the Arctic is rapidly melting”. And if a poll were done today, a vast majority of the people in Japan and elsewhere would say this is true. Unfortunately they have become the victims of “fake news”.


Luckily we have some hard data from the Arctic. And if one looks at them, it is true that sea ice has seen a declining trend – if we go back 40 years.
Yet, if we look at the past 12 years, we see that the trend for minimum has stopped, and one could argue even reversed:

The above Arctic sea ice volume chart, which relies on data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), shows that there has even been a modest increase in the minimum sea ice volume recorded every late summer.  
Overall, Arctic volume has been stable, slightly on the rise over the past 12 years, as the full year data from the DMI show:
Yet, the media constantly falsely report that the Arctic sea ice is still melting away rapidly (it isn’t), and many have even made the alarms louder.
Sloppy, misleading media
Unfortunately the media have been sloppy, lazy and misleading in their reporting of what is really happening at the poles of the Earth. If they did their homework, they’d realize their shrill headlines are inappropriate and outdated.
In early September NoTricksZone’s author Kenneth Richard presented a number of papers, where he wrote:

An accumulating collection of “headlines” taken from the 2018 scientific literature is indicating the Arctic region is no longer experiencing accelerated mass ice sheet/glacier loss, warming, or sea ice declines.”

Disservice to the public
Why the media, IPCC and many policymakers ignore this remains a mystery. It’s a disservice to the public and taxpayers who have entrusted them to conduct policymaking responsibly and honestly.

In the wake of Florence, climate ambulance chasers have been making wild exaggerations and claims.
WaPo Weirding
For example, the Washington Post editorial board claimed President Trump and climate change deniers were “complicit” in Florence because they play down humans role in increasing the risks our obstruction of addressing those risks.
Of course this is just the latest pathetic effort to criminalize climate science dissenters.
CNN fake news again
Meanwhile CNN even claimed there’s been a 40% increase in extreme storms since 1950, hat-tip Ryan Maue, who commented:

CNN has a great weather coverage team in Atlanta … but network in past has a checkered record on climate science using Bill Nye as their expert.  Lol!

In a nutshell, climate alarmists will say anything, no matter how absurd, to make the junk science look real. It’s time to come to terms with the reality that the mainstream media often deceives the public.
Media silent on “complicit” in hurricane disintegration
If climate skeptics are complicit in Florence, then on the other side of the coin skeptics also have to be responsible for the hurricanes that fizzle out.
At Friday’s Daily Update, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi posed a question to the climate ambulance chasers and folks at the Washington Post: “How come Florence didn’t intensify more? How come Isaac is falling apart at the heart of the hurricane season? […] How come everything is dying? There’s so much more than just simplistic arguments that are done for agendas.”

Media totally AWOL as Isaac and Joyce dissipate. Chart: Weatherbell Analytics.
Often things just don’t work out the way the alarmists would like them to. And so they need to resort to less than honest tactics to convey drama over to the audiences.

Bad weather reporting has recently seen a series of blatant exaggerations aimed at making viewers think things are much worse than they really are.
This year’s 2018 Media Bad Weather Exaggeration Award has to go to Hurricane Florence reporter Mike Seidel below of The Weather Channel:

His projectile stunt also didn’t go very well.
Previous winners
And what follows are winners from previous years. Of course this is not to say that extreme weather can be taken lightly. But it would be nice if reporters stayed accurate. Their credibility is already pretty ruined and such antics don’t help.
One blooper comes from an MSNBC reporter covering the extreme conditions from tropical storm Hanna back in 2008:

 
What follows is my favorite, Hurricane Irene in 2011:

 
Next is Ryan Maue’s favorite — well, at least it’s one he brought up recently. In October, 2005, reporter Michelle Kosinski is using a canoe when a regular pair of rubber boots would have sufficed. Can we believe anything we see on our screens?

 
Right on par with Michelle Kozinski’s stagecraft is ABC’s Lucy Yang’s fake deep water after heavy rains in New Jersey, 2010:

 
It’s got to be frustrating when people totally ruin your dramatic story of danger and peril. The next video is of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, New Jersey, 2012…CNN embarrassed again:

 
Finally, Anthony Watts presents here Anderson Cooper’s tactic used to fake deep flood water.

Within the last few years, over 30 papers have been added to our compilation of scientific papers that find the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 concentration changes is low to negligible.
Link: 85 Scientific Papers – Low CO2 Climate Sensitivity
A few of the papers published in 2018 that were added to the list are provided below.

Fleming, 2018


“The results of this review point to the extreme value of  CO2 to all life forms, but no role of  CO2 in any significant change of the Earth’s climate. … Many believe and/or support the notion that the Earth’s atmosphere is a ‘greenhouse’ with CO2 as the primary “greenhouse” gas warming Earth. That this concept seems acceptable is understandable—the modern heating of the Earth’s atmosphere began at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850. The industrial revolution took hold about the same time. It would be natural to believe that these two events could be the reason for the rise in temperature. There is now a much clearer picture of an alternative reason for why the Earth’s surface temperature has risen since 1850.”


“There is no correlation of CO2 with temperature in any historical data set that was reviewed. The climate-change cooling over the 1940–1975 time period of the Modern Warming period was shown to be influenced by a combination of solar factors. The cause of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age climate changes was the solar magnetic field and cosmic ray connection. When the solar magnetic field is strong, it acts as a barrier to cosmic rays entering the Earth’s atmosphere, clouds decrease and the Earth warms. Conversely when the solar magnetic field is weak, there is no barrier to cosmic rays—they greatly increase large areas of low-level clouds, increasing the Earth’s albedo and the planet cools. The factors that affect these climate changes were reviewed in “Solar magnetic field/cosmic ray factors affecting climate change” section. The calculations of “H2O and CO2 in the radiation package” section revealed that there is no net impact of CO2 on the net heating of the atmosphere. The received heat is simply redistributed within the atmospheric column. This result is consistent and explains the lack of CO2 correlations with observations in the past. The current Modern Warming will continue until the solar magnetic field decreases in strength. If one adds the 350-year cycle from the McCracken result to the center of the Maunder Minimum which was centered in 1680, one would have a Grand Minimum centered in the year 2030.”



Smirnov, 2018  


“From this, it follows for the change of the global temperature as a result at doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2 molecules [is] ∆T = (0.4 ± 0.1) K, where the error accounts for the accuracy of used values, whereas the result depends on processes included in the above scheme. Indeed, we assume the atmospheric and Earth’s albedo, as well as another interaction of solar radiation with the atmosphere and Earth, to be unvaried in the course of the change of the concentration of CO2 molecules, and also the content of atmospheric water is conserved. Because anthropogenic fluxes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulted from combustion of fossil fuels is about 5% [Kaufman, 2007], the contribution of the human activity to ECS (the temperature change as a result of doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide amount) is ∆T = 0.02 K, i.e. injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuels is not important for the greenhouse effect.”



Davis et al., 2018


“[T]he contemporary global warming increase of ~0.8 °C recorded since 1850 has been attributed widely to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Recent research has shown, however, that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been decoupled from global temperature for the last 425 million years [Davis, 2017] owing to well-established diminishing returns in marginal radiative forcing (ΔRF) as atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. Marginal forcing of temperature from increasing CO2 emissions declined by half from 1850 to 1980, and by nearly two-thirds from 1850 to 1999 [Davis, 2017]. Changes in atmospheric CO2 therefore affect global temperature weakly at most.”

Holmes, 2018 


“Calculate for a doubling of CO2 from the pre-industrial level of 0.03% [300 ppm]: [formula found in text] Calculated temperature after doubling of CO2 to 0.06% [600 ppm] ≈ 288.11 K. Climate sensitivity to CO2 is ≈ 288.14 – 288.11 ≈ – 0.03 K.”


“The change would in fact be extremely small and difficult to estimate exactly, but would be of the order -0.03°C. That is, a hundred times smaller than the ‘likely’ climate sensitivity of 3°C cited in the IPCC’s reports, and also probably of the opposite sign [cooling]. Even that small number would likely be a maximum change, since if fossil fuels are burned to create the emitted CO2, then atmospheric O2 will also be consumed, reducing that gas in the atmosphere – and offsetting any temperature change generated by the extra CO2. This climate sensitivity is already so low that it would be impossible to detect or measure in the real atmosphere, even before any allowance is made for the consumption of atmospheric O2.”



Allmendinger, 2018


“Knowledge about thermal radiation of the atmosphere is rich in hypotheses and theories but poor in empiric evidence. Thereby, the Stefan-Boltzmann relation is of central importance in atmosphere physics, and holds the status of a natural law. However, its empirical foundation is little, tracing back to experiments made by Dulong and Petit two hundred years ago. … For studying the pressure dependency, the experiments were carried out at locations with different altitudes. For the so-called atmospheric emission constant A an approximate value of 22 Wm−2 bar−1 K−0.5 was found. In the non-steady-state, the total thermal emission power of the soil is given by the difference between its blackbody radiation and the counter-radiation of the atmosphere. This relation explains to a considerable part the fact that on mountains the atmospheric temperature is lower than on lowlands, in spite of the enhanced sunlight intensity. Thereto, the so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon-dioxide do not have any influence.”


“While a theoretical calculation of such an absorption coefficient was not feasible, at least a principal explanation may be given: There is no good reason to assume that absorbed IR-radiation will be entirely transformed into heat. Instead, it is conceivable that a part of it is re-emitted, i.e. to say in all directions, before having induced a temperature enhancement.”


“This approach contradicts in many ways the conventional greenhouse theory: Firstly, the boundary processes at the Earth surface and at the lowest layer of the atmosphere are predominant, while the conventional greenhouse theory regards the whole atmosphere; and secondly—even more crucial—the radiation budget is solely determined by the air conditions of the atmosphere such as pressure and temperature while so-called ‘greenhouse gases’ such as carbon-dioxide do not have the slightest influence on the climate. Besides, the atmosphere cannot really be compared to a greenhouse, not least due to the absence of a glass-roof which absorbs IR-radiation, and which inhibits considerable air convection.”



Laubereau and Iglev, 2018


“Using a simple 1-dimensional model the global warming of the surface is computed that is generated by the increase of GHG and the albedo change. A modest effect by the GHG of 0.08 K is calculated for the period 1880 to 1955 with a further increase by 0.18 K for 1955 to 2015. A larger contribution of 0.55 ± 0.05 K is estimated for the melting of polar sea ice (MSI) in the latter period, i.e. it notably exceeds that of the GHG and may be compared with the observed global temperature rise of 1.0 ± 0.1 K during the past 60 years.”


“In conclusion we wish to say that we have performed a study of the infrared properties of carbon dioxide, methane, dinitrogen-oxide and water to estimate their contribution to the global warming in 1880 – 2015. Our results suggest that the IR properties of the CO2 are responsible for ~ 20% of the mean temperature increase of the surface [during 1880-2015] and notably less for CH4 and N2O.”



Liu and Chen, 2018


“CO2 and temperature records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and other observation stations show that the correlation between CO2 and temperature is not significant. These stations are located away from big cities, and in various latitudes and hemispheres. But the correlation is significant in global mean data. Over the last five decades, CO2 has grown at an accelerating rate with no corresponding rise in temperature in the stations. This discrepancy indicates that CO2 probably is not the driving force of temperature change globally but only locally(mainly in big cities). We suggest that the Earth’s atmospheric concentration of CO2 is too low to drive global temperature change.”


“Our empirical perception of the global warming record is due to the urban heat island effect: temperature rises in areas with rising population density and rising industrial activity. This effect mainly occurs in the areas with high population and intense human activities, and is not representative of global warming. Regions far from cities, such as the Mauna Loa highland, show no evident warming trend. The global monthly mean temperature calculated by record data, widely used by academic researchers, shows R~2=0.765, a high degree of correlation with CO2. However, the R~2 shows much less significance (mean R~2=0.024) if calculated by each record for 188 selected stations over the world. This test suggests that the inflated high correlation between CO2 and temperature (mean R~2=0.765-0.024=0.741) used in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was very likely produced during data correction and processing. This untrue global monthly mean temperature has created a picture: human emission drives global warming.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate modeler Jochem Marotzke: more time to decarbonize, earlier climate models were too sensitive 
=========================================================
Correction (12 November 2018): Dr. Lüning writes that he had to modify his post on Marotzke a bit. “Marotzke did not mean CO2 climate sensitivity but that more CO2 is buffered, adding less to the atmosphere.” However, the goalposts still have been moved back and we still get 10 more years. 
==========================================================
Hat-tip: Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
On October 5, 2018, German national weekly Spiegel here presented a noteworthy interview with Germany’s top climate modeler, Jochem Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.

Top German climate modeler, Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Image: Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.
Spiegel wrote in its sub headline:

Unexpected extra time in the climate scenario: ‘Our reprieve has been extended by about ten years’ Physicist and climate researcher Jochem Marotzke explains why humanity has more time to stop global warming than previously thought.”

Or in other words, German skeptics Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt write at their Die kalte Sonne blog, “the sensitivity of CO2 was obviously overestimated.”
Yes, the climate goalposts just got moved back once again.
Earlier skeptic claims of overly sensitive models now spot on
More than 6 years ago in 2012, Lüning and Vahrenholt had already pointed out the problem of over-sensitive models in their book “Die kalte Sonne” – a claim that Marotzke back then said was “completely outlandish”.
Naturally today Lüning and Vahrenholt find themselves somewhat vindicated, and are confident more vindication is on the way as the reality of climate change becomes increasingly known.
We can emit “at least twice as much”
In the Spiegel interview, conducted editor Olaf Stamp, Marotzke was asked about how much CO2 we could still add to the atmosphere:
MAROTZKE: […] According to the latest climate scenarios, the amount of CO2 that we may emit is far greater than previously assumed – a fundamental point.
SPIEGEL: So we’ve been given amore time to reduce CO2 emissions?

MAROTZKE: Exactly. That’s what today’s improved models show. Our remaining CO2 budget for the 1.5°C target is in fact at least twice as much as previously thought: almost 1 trillion tonnes. Thus our reprieve has been extended about 10 years. Of course, it makes a huge difference if we have to bring the emissions of greenhouse gases down to zero in 15 years or 25 years. I assume that this will be the key message in the special report.”
And, according to Marotzke:
Our earlier models are too sensitive in one crucial place […]”
Here the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute for Meteorology director is talking about CO2 climate sensitivity. And Lüning and Vahrenholt write: ” And when Marotzke says this, then it has real weight.”
IPCC Report politicized, “long deviated from the scientific basis”
In the Spiegel interview, which took place three days before the IPCC report was released, Marotzke suspected that the 1.5-degree report of the IPCC was to play down the danger of climate change. But when the report came out, it conveyed the opposite, namely worsened climate warnings. 
This, according to Lüning and Vahrenholt, “is an indication that it is more a political report than a scientific account. Apparently the IPCC report authors, handpicked by politics, have already long deviated from the scientific basis.” 
1.5°C target ” came as a surprise to us climatologists”
When asked by Spiegel why the 1.5°C target was used instead of 2°C:
SPIEGEL: Why was the limit lowered from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees? 
MAROTZKE: That came as a surprise to us climatologists as well. Especially the West Pacific island states insisted on 1.5 degrees at the Paris negotiations because they would be threatened by the rise of the sea level already at 2 degrees. However in most parts of the world, especially in Europe, we do not expect much difference between a 1.5-degree world and a 2-degree world.”
Politics overruling science
“Once again, political motives were more important than science,” Lüning and Vahrenholt write in response to Marotzke’s comments. 
“Curiously enough, the Pacific Islanders also ignore the fact that they live on growing coral islands, which have already withstood much stronger sea-level rise rates in the transition from the last ice age to today’s interglacial. One has to assume that, above all, this should accelerate the path to the international coffers for climate compensation payments,” say skeptics Lüning and Vahrenholt. 
The whole Spiegel interview is behind a paywall at spiegel.de.
Rejects claims of tipping points taking place
Marotzke also explained that signs of the alleged tipping points coming from the Potsdam Institute were rather weak. He also flat out rejected the tipping points of a stalling Gulf Stream and melting West Antarctic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA wave of media hysteria has been unleashed by the recent hot and dry “Sahara” weather Europe has seen over the past few weeks. Cries to shut down the coal power plants and to adopt vegan diets have reached peak volume!
ARD Fake News: “CO2 causing lung disease”
The neurosis has gotten so bad, that flagship German media have been reporting new breath-taking claims.
For example Germany’s version of the BBC ARD German public television, here claimed that CO2 is not only “killing the climate”, but is also even “causes lung disease”!
NBC’s Al Roker: Warming now causing less hurricanes!
In the US, NBC meteorologist Al Roker here did have some good news: Global warming is now causing less hurricanes (and not more): The melting Arctic ice is cooling the Atlantic, which works against the formation of hurricanes, he claimed.
Unfortunately that “information” from Mr. Roker has turned out to be really fake. Expert meteorologist Dr. Ryan Maue even called Roker’s outlandish claim “cringeworthy”.
“Not heat problem, rather hysteria problem”
But among the cacophony of hysteria emanating from the global fake news construct, there have been a few remaining voices of sanity – fortunately.
For example journalist/lead commentator Torsten Krauel of Germany’s flag ship national daily Die Welt here wrote an opinion piece titled: “Germany doesn’t have a heat problem, rather it has a hysteria problem.
In the opinion piece Krauel writes:

There have been many hot summers, as well as rainy cool ones. Germany does not have a heat problem, and a look at the past shows this.”
Krauel then reminds the amnesia-prone German readers of the hot spells of the 1990s, or 2006, 1983, 1975, 1963 and 1958 as examples, where periods of heat and/or extreme drought also occurred.
Indeed according to Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann, July 2006 was much warmer than July 2018, by 2°C.
Going vegan our only hope
Die Welt’s Krauel adds with sarcasm:
But over 2018 in some places they complain like end-of world preachers. It is the largest anomaly since records have been kept. Water will be in short supply, Sea level is rising. Become a vegan, otherwise it will continue like this.”
Cold front erases the hysteria
In the meantime, a cold front has passed through the continent, thus dislodging the blocking high behind the unusually summerlike weather which many had been enjoying.
Central European temperatures today as of 1 p.m. ranged only from the low sixties to low seventies Fahrenheit.

It won’t be long before we start hearing complaints about all the cool and damp weather and longings for summer.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe weather models are all now pointing to wintry weather pushing into Europe next week, after a year of near record warm temperatures. Is a cold winter in store?
German skeptic weather and climate blogger Schneefan (Snow Fan) here writes that the winter most likely will be starting early this year, but it remains a question if the colder, more wintery conditions will persist throughout the winter.
The current low solar activity favors it will, as studies show Europe’s winters turn harsher when solar activity is quiet. Over the past few days, the models have been in agreement in showing that cold wintry weather is approaching in the days ahead.
Schneefan writes that the big 3 weather models ECMWF (Europe), GFS (USA) and GEM (Canada) have all been projecting the same development:

Shown above are the prognoses dated 10 November, 2018, from ECMWF (Europe), GFS (USA) and GEM (Canada) for the 20th of November. Source: Wetterzentrale
Yesterday the three models forecast the following for November 19:

The stratospheric models from ECMWF und GFS also point to an early wintery weather pattern change, with a large trough extending over the entire Mediterranean and an extensive high over Scandinavia and Northern Russia:

Comparison of the ECMWF (150 hPa, 14 km altitude) and GFS (100 hPa, about 16 km altitude) prognoses November 20. This unusual large weather pattern signifies a change in the wind patterns and favor cold Russian air moving over Europe . If the models are right, it would mean an early start for winter in Europe. Source: ECMWF and GFS.
WO/GFS already foresees frost for Eastern Europe this weekend:

Snow is also forecast to spread across large regions of eastern Europe early next week:



Large parts of Germany and Europe could see snow cover at the end of November:

Schneefan writes that the conditions could be similar to those seen in the winters of 2005/06 and 2010/11. One reason, Schneefan writes:
We now find ourselves in a multiple-year solar minimum of weak solar cycles that is the weakest in the last  200 years.
Just recently the GFS06 showing a northern position (Greenland/Atlantic blocking) and further massive winter invasions from the north on November 29, 2018.

So while Europe may be enjoying agreeable mild weather for now, models show that it may very well end abruptly. Preparations for winter should be done over the coming days.
Global warming eliminating snow and ice remains a myth. Soon expect to hear warmist scientists claim the cold is due to the warming causing polar vortices. Don’t buy the nonsense. It’s BS science.
The truth is that this is just winter as usual, and the climate has not really changed that much.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDaniel Wetzel at German national daily Die Welt here recently commented that limiting the warming to 1.5°C warming is utopian. That’s of course, assuming the man-made global warming theory is correct to begin with.
According Wetzel, time theoretically ran out long ago.
Wetzel wrote that despite all the controversy surrounding the IPCC report, one thing is clear: “It’s going to take trillions for the 1.5°C target . And without many veggie days, it’s not going to happen.”
The green urgency for a state of emergency
Even before the report was released to the public, environmentalists and climate activists had already made up their minds that humanity had one last chance to avert calamity. Profound wide-scale action would need to be taken. Green politicians and environmental activists are now demanding a declaration of a state of emergency, it seems. Theoretically however, the window in fact closed weeks ago.
Misrepresenting the report

For Germany, green-colored or shaded politicians and activists said the report confirms that Germany must exit coal power by 2025 at the latest. But Wetzel comments that many special interests are framing the report as something that it really isn’t:


Every lobbyist is taking out of the UN climate report what what appeals to them, and leave everything else aside.”
Clock stuck at 5 to 12, in fact ran out weeks ago

Wetzel comments that the urgent claims made by the Greens that there is still a small window of opportunity is “surprising” because according to the Mercator Research Institute’s (MCC) “CO2 countdown clock“, time already ran out 30 days ago even for the mid range scenarios, meaning there wasn’t supposed to any more CO2 emissions at all. But Wetzel writes:
In the latest climate report, suddenly there’s 300 gigatonnes more. […] Indeed on in this manner does the world gain 7.5 years time for CO2 reductions, says Oliver Geden, a lead author for the next UN report.”
He cites Chapter C1.4, footnote no. 14 of the report.
A TRILLION dollars a year
According to Wetzel, the UN report also notes that between 900 billion and 1.8 trillion dollars would need to be invested every year from 2015 – 2050 to revamp the global energy system. This is a figure that even the richest nations are going run from.
Currently Germany’s Energiewende alone is costing Germany 34 billion euros annually. Worse, there’s been no CO2 reduction in Germany in close to a decade. That’s some 300 billion euros for zero result. Wetzel adds that Germany has already reached its threshold of financial pain as electricity prices have soared to among the highest worldwide.
Wetzel points out severe “limitations in nutrition are needed”
The Die Welt economics journalist also writes that the German Greens forget to tell the public that it would be necessary to “commit some 8 million square kilometers of agricultural area to growing energy plants in order to reach the 1.5°C warming target.”
Moreover reaching the target would also require going much more without meat, whose production is energy and CO2 intensive. Overall, Wetzel writes, reaching the 1.5°C target “collides with the fight against poverty and hunger” and , if the theory is true, there’s no chance of reaching the 1.5°C target.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCNN and the Guardian just reported on a new study suggesting meat is bad for human health (even though humans and their ancestors have been eating and thriving on it for some 3 million years).
The authors also suggest that the healthy alternative is the vegan diet!
Meat tax “could save 220,000 lives per year”?
The team of scientists led by Dr. Marco Springmann who authored the new study published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE claim that a global meat tax “could save 220,000 lives and cut health care bills by $41 billion” a year.
The study’s authors assert that meat consumption increases risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, and is even “carcinogenic when eaten in processed forms, including sausages, bacon and beef jerky” and thus comparable to “cigarettes and alcohol”.


Dr. Marco Springmann is from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University.
Springmann also claims: “Consuming red and processed meat not only affects your health but also the economy at large” due to “illness and care for family members who suffer with chronic disease.”
“Based on weak epidemiology”…”literally fake science”
However, since the paper was published, there’s been a hailstorm of criticism.
For example science journalist and the author of Big Fat Surprise, Nina Teicholz, tweeted that the results and recommendations made by Springmann are based on lousy science and “should never be used as a foundation for policy.”. At Twitter she wrote:


This is all based on weak epidemiology, the kind of science meant to generate hypotheses, not test them. This is, literally, fake science that should never be used as a foundation for policy. @cnn reporter should know better https://t.co/GATSRaluOk

Lead author a vegan and climate activist!
Not only is the science dubious, but it turns out that the lead author of the paper itself is a vegan, and has also fallen for the junk science behind climate change!
Reader Simon Dwinder discovered the link:

""In his own case, it seemed a no-brainer to become a vegan ten years ago, when he realised that it is demonstrably healthier and better for the planet""https://t.co/9jpWWS4Lzd
— Simon Dwinder #StandUp4Brexit (@Sidwinder75) November 8, 2018

And (leftist) reader tlcoles November 8, 2018 added:


So the CNN article should have read “Ateam of researchers led by Dr. Marco Springmann, a vegan at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University, produces science to declare meat bad…again.” 😂

The meaty, high-(good)fat diet worked fantastically for me
Personally 5 years ago I made the switch to the high fat, low junk-carb diet, eating plenty of butter, eggs, meat, nuts, cheese etc. and wound up losing 20 pounds and seeing my health return with full power. I no longer have to take any prescription medicines at all.
Vegan diet harbors huge health risks
Moreover, anyone doing the least amount of research will quickly discover that the vegan diet in many cases is a slow and tortuous suicide. Just ask KasumiKriss, who stopped being a vegan after four years and saw her health improve dramatically.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently we’ve been hearing about how cold it’s been over much of North America, for example how Houston saw its earliest snowfall on record!
Well, it appears that the early wintry conditions are getting set to take even stronger hold over the Northern Hemisphere.
Yesterday at Weatherbell’s Daily Update, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi showed how some 90% of North America has been well below normal temperature-wise so far this month:

In Europe, the continent has experienced a very warm summer and fall so far, but that is about to change rather dramatically — should the latest computer model generated weather forecasts pan out, and which they are expected to do.
Snow is forecast to cover much of the US and all of Canada by early next month:

Russian beast from the east
Joe says at the Daily Summary that Europe should expect “brutal cold” at the end of the current month. At the end of the video he says:
“Boy, we’ve got some interesting things going on in Europe. […] Wicked cold coming into Europe.”

Also Japanese skeptic blogger Kirye at Twitter sent me chart showing Arctic sea ice volume is back up to normal after having been a bit below normal over the past couple of months.

Source: Kirye.
Once again expect another rollout of the scientifically bogus explanation of a Arctic-warming-induced perturbed jet stream causing all the cold. Just keep in mind this is barely a hypothesis that has no data to back it up and that it mostly relies on phony models created by climate activists.
Although the globe may have warmed about half a degree, much of the Northern Hemisphere land mass will continue to see cold snows winters like it did 50 years ago. The earlier idiotic alarmist predictions are proving to be merely fantasy visions of hysterical minds.

The 15 sites are Abashiri, Nemuro, Suttsu, Yamagata, Ishinomaki, Fushiki, Iida, Choshi, Sakai, Hamada, Hikone, Miyazaki, Tadotsu, Naze and Ishigakijima. Here’s a table of these stations from NASA:

NASA is using only 7 of these stations (marked). Many of these 15 stations used by the JMA have a high BI value, meaning they are heavily impacted by urbanization. 
An earlier document issued by the JMA stated that the agency had used 17 stations, see Table 1.2.3. Today they are using 15.
JMA selection criteria: “relatively small” urbanization influence 
The JMA says the criteria for selecting the 15 weather observation sites are: they have a long observation period and the influence of urbanization is “relatively small” and “not biased by a particular region”.
What follows is a location plot of the 15 JMA observation stations scattered across Japan:

How “relatively small” is the urbanization really?
To find out more about the siting quality of the stations, Kirye used Google Earth to locate the stations.
What follows are Google Earth photos of their location. You will see that the JMA’s description “relative small” influence of urbanization is quite an understatement.
It’s urban warming, and not global warming!
Many stations are in fact dubiously surrounded by massively heat-absorbing structures. Keep in mind the pinpoint location shown could be off by some meters.

Abashiri is in the middle of buildings and streets.
 

Choshi is also found in a densely built up area, which would tend to really heat up in the summer.
 

Fushiki observation station is somewhat better sited, with more green vegetation in the area, yet much temperature distorting paved surfaces are nearby.
 

Hamada station is also becoming increasingly choked off by urbanization.
 

Hikone is right in the middle asphalt and buildings. We can only wonder how much all the air conditioners around are heating up temperature readings in the summertime? This is urban warming, and not global warming!

Iida station. Wow! Hardly any green vegetation in sight, so the area must really heat up in the summertime sun, and keep things warm late into the evenings.
 

Miyazaki station. Japan loves concrete and asphalt. So little room for vegetation. Expect the green fields to go in the years ahead.
 

Ishinomaki station. Everywhere heat-absorbing buildings and asphalt streets that boost the readings.
 

Naze. NASA assigns it a BI of 0, meaning as rural as could be. Maybe the reason for this is because Naze is on an island in the middle of the ocean. But here we see the station is in the middle of a city.
 

Nemuro station is also surrounded by buildings, concrete, steel and asphalt. Perhaps the Google Earth marker is not so exact and so the station is in the field to the right. Still, lots buildings and hot asphalt around.
 

Sakai station has some green areas around it, but still great urban influences at work.
 

Suttsu, only the second station considered by NASA to be “rural” is so only on one side! If the wind blows from the forest to the west, then the readings will be more accurate.
 

Tadotsu is a terribly sited stations, due to obvious reasons. The whole place is a giant heat sink!
 

Yamagata, the last of the 15 stations JMA uses, is also completely surrounded by heat absorbing asphalt, concrete, steel and buildings.
What can we conclude?
Little wonder that global temps shot up just after 1990 when NASA stopped using so many stations worldwide, and seemed to focus more on those sited in urban environments.
Arguably the JMA’s claim of a “relatively small” influence from urbanization is an understatement of multiple degrees.

Recently German business daily Handelsblatt here reported that despite the country adding more wind energy capacity, “the latest figures show that only a little wind power is available at any time.”
According to the German BWE wind energy group, 29,900 wind turbines are currently operating in the country with a total capcity of 56,000 megawatts. Wind energy makes up 18.8% of the country’s power supply.
Glaring weaknesses
But the Handelsblatt reports there are “glaring weaknesses” and that wind turbines cannot be relied on to deliver steady power when it’s needed.
According to Oliver Then, Managing Director of the VGB PowerTech Association, citing recent research results which the Handelsblatt has obtained: “The actual production figures show that the readily available wind power capacity in Germany is less than one percent of installed capacity.”
Back up absolutely necessary
According to the Handelsblatt, VGB PowerTech evaluated 2016 data from a number of European countries, and reports that the message is clear:

Even if the expansion of wind power progresses rapidly, there will always have to be back-up capacity, for example in the form of fossil power plants.” 
VGB Director Oliver Then says that as more and more green energies get fed in, the less gas and fossil fuels plants operate, and thus making them no longer profitable. Yet they remain absolutely essential to keep the grid stable.
Can rely on neighboring countries?
Proponents of green energies who support a rapid fossil fuel phaseout insist that it can be done, and that Germany would only need to rely increasingly on a power supply from neighboring countries. When the wind is not blowing in Germany, power could be imported from another country where the wind is blowing.
But VGB Director Oliver Then says the data do not support this claim in any way, adding, “Power production is strongly synchronous over great distances.”
This means that if wind lacks in Germany, it often lacks in Poland as well and so neighbors cannot be relied on to provide electricity.
Pump storage not feasible
Pump storage as a way to store energy is also not feasible says Then, saying it would need to be increased 1000 fold, which would entail enormous costs. Then notes that periods of no wind extending two weeks are not uncommon in Germany.

According to the paper’s abstract, a newly developed dataset containing daily precipitation in China at 0.5° intervals of longitude and latitude over the period 1961 to 2011 was statistically analyzed.
The authors found “the probability of rainy days has decreased over time for over 90% the surface area of China, and that the extreme precipitation and annual precipitation have decreased for most of the area in China.”
The results contradict the often made alarmist claim of more frequent and extreme weather events due to global warming.
Australia: “no trend in one day precipitation extremes”
In a recent paper titled “Variability and long-term change in Australian temperature and precipitation extremes“, the authors found that although in Australia minimum temperatures have increased, but maximum temperatures not so much, there was no trend in one day precipitation extremes.
The authors summarized in the paper’s abstract:

Daily precipitation extremes rarely exhibit long-term change over the century but are strongly modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The relative importance of long-term change and climate variability therefore depends on the variable or index.
We conclude that in assessing the likelihood of climate hazards, one needs to consider the modulation of climate extremes due to both long-term change and climate variability. Our findings imply that when planning for adaptation, different emphasis needs to be given to changing temperature and precipitation extremes.”

Share this...FacebookTwitter40-year veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at WeatherBell’s Saturday Summary shows how the Earth’s surface has cooled dramatically over the past three years and that Arctic sea ice is piling up.
Hurricane threat to East Coast due to natural factors
First at his most recent Saturday Summary, the 40-year meteorologist first warns that in-close developing hurricanes of the sort seen in the 1930s are a risk to the US East Coast this year, due the current Atlantic temperature pattern. The reason has nothing to do with CO2 in the atmosphere, but because of natural sea surface temperature cycles.
Sea surface temperatures see “pretty dramatic turnaround”
Next Joe Bastardi illustrates the stark sea surface cooling the globe has seen over the recent years. The following two charts show the “pretty dramatic” cooling that has occurred over the past three years, 2015 vs 2018:

Cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary.
The two images above show the surface temperatures of the globe for the years 2015 – 2018. Note the profound cooling that has taken place from 2015 to 2018.
Bastardi calls it “a pretty big flip” and “a pretty dramatic turnaround”.
Arctic turns frigid
As sea surface temperatures around Greenland and in the Arctic are currently below normal, they are having an impact on Arctic surface temperatures this summer.
Joe Bastardi notes that according to the Danish DMI, Arctic temperature has been below normal over the entire summer:

Moreover, Arctic mid-summer temperatures, north of 80°N latitude, have dipped to near freezing over the past days. This is likely in large part linked to the cold North Atlantic sea surface temperatures we’ve been witnessing. All this suggests ocean cycles, and not CO2, are the real Arctic drivers.
Snow and ice climbing past decade
The cold polar temperatures are naturally having an impact on Arctic snow and ice.

Japanese blogger Kirye tweeted here that Arctic sea ice volume is currently at the 4th highest level since 2003, thus defying the dire alarmist predictions of Arctic sea ice disappearing by now.

Arctic sea ice volume (m3) has eased off from third place and is now at the 4th highest level since 2003, and showing an upward recovering trend over the past decade. Chart: Kirye.
Also at the 11:50 mark of his Saturday Summary video, Joe shows that Arctic sea ice extent is well above the levels seen over the previous years.
Greenland gets buried in snow
According to Kirye here, warming and melting have also been AWOL in Greenland, which has been seeing a dramatic snow and ice mass balance increase:

Chart: DMI.
“Total nonsense” concerning Thailand monsoons
In his Saturday Summary, Joe Bastardi also sharply criticized the climate ambulance chasing we’ve witnessed from hysterical climate alarmists, who are desperately grasping at any straw they can find to keep the climate panic on life-support.
It was recently claimed that the group of Thailand teenagers and their coach got trapped in a cave due to monsoon rains which were induced by global warming!
But Joe Bastardi presents a chart showing that this year’s monsoon activity in Thailand is completely within the range of natural variability:

Chart: WeatherBell Saturday Summary.
Bastardi calls the claim the kids got trapped because of climate change “total nonsense”, and points out that the monsoons over Thailand over the past five years have been normal to even below normal!

Since the global warming scare started some 30 years ago, Japan’s winters in fact have have not been warming – but rather many areas show the opposite is happening: cooling.
January in Japan no warming in over 30 years
For Japan as a whole, the entire country has not seen any rise in January mean temperature over the past 30 years, according to data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA):

As the chart above shows, if anything, Japan mean January temperature has been falling a bit, thus contrdicting the warming claims of climate alarmists.
Cooling Kyoto
January in Kyoto has been cooling over the past 30 years, as the following chart shows, even as atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen from about 350 ppm back in 1985 to over 410 ppm today:

No trend at Naze in 33 years
The same is true for the south Japan station of Naze:

Naze has seen slight January cooling over the 33 years – not warming!
Wintry Hokkaido stays that way
In northern Japan, the month of January has also gotten slightly colder over the past 30 years, as shown by measurements taken at the Suttsu station in Hokkaido:

Overall, January today in Suttsu is at about the same level as it was more than 100 years ago.
Same is true at Okinawa
Moving far south to the Nago station in Okinawa, here as well we see that January mean tenmperatures have been cooling, and not warming like climate activists insisted it would.
Japan refuses to cooperate with the global warming “science”:

By now many people should be awaiting an explanation as to why the trend has behaved the opposite of what has been predicted for decades by CO2 global warming scientists.
Cooling near Nagasaki
The trend for January at the Sasebo station near Nagasaki over the past 32 years has also seen a steady linear decline:

How can anyone in the Japanese media be speaking about rapid warming over the recent years? Much of the climate news in Japan are of poor quality, unfortunately, as they continue to make people believe it’s warming when it is in fact not.
Japan’s winters have seen no trend 
Okay, the charts show trends for the month of January, the dead of winter. So what about the complete winter in Japan from December through February? Here as well we see no warming at all across Japan:

The untampered data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows the Japan’s winters have not warmed at all in over three decades.
Typhoons have also become less frequent
In general many other factors have not cooperated with the many predictions made by global warming scientists. One important example is typhoons, which we were told would become more frequent and intense. But here’s the typhoon data from the JMA:

Also there’s been no real trend in the number of typhoon landfalls hitting Japan.
In summary, lots of hype about warming in Japan, yet the data haven’t shown it in over 3 decades.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are large regions of the globe where observations indicate there has been no warming (even cooling) during the last decades to century. Climate models rooted in the assumption that fossil fuel emissions drive dangerous warming dismiss these modeling failures and project temperature increases of 3° – 10°C by 2100 for these same regions anyway. 

Four decades of Southern Ocean cooling
After warming from the 1940s to the mid-1970s, the Southern Ocean has been cooling since the late-1970s, which has consequently resulted in an increase in sea ice extent (Fan et al., 2014; Purich et al., 2018; Latif et al., 2017; Turney et al., 2017 ).
In their paper entitled “Natural variability of Southern Ocean convection as a driver of observed climate trends”, Zhang et al. (2019) suggest that the Southern Ocean cooling was driven by natural processes.
Zhang et al., 2019
“Observed Southern Ocean surface cooling and sea-ice expansion over the past several decades are inconsistent with many historical simulations from climate models. Here we show that natural multidecadal variability involving Southern Ocean convection may have contributed strongly to the observed temperature and sea-ice trends.”

Climate models, in contrast, had projected a rapid warming and significant decreases in sea ice extent during the last few decades.

The East-Central U.S. has been cooling (about -0.6°C) since the 1950s
Partridge et al., 2018
“We present a novel approach to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of regional cooling across the eastern U.S. (commonly called the U.S. warming hole), by defining a spatially explicit boundary around the region of most persistent cooling. The warming hole emerges after a regime shift in 1958 where annual maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures decreased by 0.46°C and 0.83°C respectively.”

Alter et al., 2017
“From 1910- 1949 (pre-agricultural development, pre-DEV) to 1970-2009 (full agricultural development, full-DEV), the central United States experienced large-scale increases in rainfall of up to 35% and decreases in surface air temperature of up to 1°C during the boreal summer months of July and August … which conflicts with expectations from climate change projections for the end of the 21st century (i.e., warming and decreasing rainfall) (Melillo et al., 2014).”

Climate models project 3°C – 10°C warming in the Midwest (U.S.) by 2100
Even though climate models failed to simulate the last 50 to 100 years of temperatures for this region, hindcasting a dramatic warming instead of the observed cooling, the projections for 2100 are still predicated on CO2 emission scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) as the determinant of regional surface temperatures.  Consequently, the regional models project a warming of 3°C – 10°C over the next 80 years.
Hamlet et al., 2019
“For the two most widely used greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 (Moss et al. 2008) (representing “medium” and “high” twenty-first century greenhouse gas concentration trajectories respectively), the Midwestern United States is projected to experience profound changes in climate by 2100, especially for (T). Projections for annual mean T over the Midwestern United States from 31 global climate models (GCMs) for the RCP8.5 scenario show an ensemble mean increase in T of about 6.5 °C (11.7 °F) by 2100 relative to the historical 1971–2000 baseline (Fig. S1) (Byun and Hamlet 2018). The projected change in the annual ensemble mean T for RCP4.5 over the Midwestern United States is about 3.3 °C (5.9 °F) by 2100 relative to the 1971–2000 baseline. The upper tail of the annual mean T distribution, represented by the 97.5th percentile of the 31 GCM projections for RCP8.5 (i.e., a “worst-case” scenario), is nearly 10 °C (18 °F) warmer than the historical baseline by 2100.”

Climate models project 3°C warming in the North Atlantic by 2100

Gervais et al., 2018
“Recent studies have documented the development of a warming deficit in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) both in observations of the current climate (Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Drijfhout et al. 2012) and in future climate simulations (Drijfhout et al. 2012; Marshall et al. 2015; Woollings et al. 2012). This “North Atlantic warming hole” (NAWH) is characterized in the observed record as a region south of Greenland with negative trends in SSTs of 0.8 K century-1 (Rahmstorf et al. 2015). In fully coupled global climate model (GCM) future simulations, the NAWH is seen as a significant deficit in warming within the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (Marshall et al. 2015; Winton et al. 2013; Gervais et al. 2016).  This local reduction in future warming is communicated to the overlying atmosphere and may impact atmospheric circulation (Gervais et al. 2016), including the North Atlantic storm track (Woollings et al. 2012).”

Hansen (2013): CO2 emissions will cause 20°C of global warming by ~2130
Back in 1989, Dr. James Hansen, the former head of NASA, predicted that New York City’s West Side Highway would be underwater within 20 years due to rapid global warming and the consequent rising sea levels.
A glance at a 2018 image of the West Side Highway  indicates that it is still very much above water, no lower than its position in 1936.
A few decades later (2012), Hansen was the lead author of a paper published by The Royal Society (2013) that indicated ever-growing fossil fuel emissions would lead to a nearly five-fold rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (to 1,400 ppm) within 118 years.
He then projected this CO2 increase and presumed 9 W m-2 forcing would cause a global surface temperature warming of 20°C by about 2130, with 30°C warming at the poles.

Image Source: Hansen et al., 2013
Hansen et al., 2013
“Let us now verify that our assumed fossil fuel climate forcing of 9 W m−2 is feasible. If we assume that fossil fuel emissions increase by 3% per year, typical of the past decade and of the entire period since 1950, cumulative fossil fuel emissions will reach 10 000 Gt C in 118 years [2012 + 118 years = ~2130 C.E.] … [T]he fossil fuel source required to yield a 9 W m−2 forcing may be closer to 5000 Gt C, rather than 10 000 Gt C.”
“9 W m−2 forcing requires approximately 4.8×CO2 [1400 ppm] … Our calculated global warming in this case is 16°C, with warming at the poles approximately 30°C. Calculated warming over land areas averages approximately 20°C. … Such temperatures would eliminate grain production in almost all agricultural regions in the world. Increased stratospheric water vapour would diminish the stratospheric ozone layer. More ominously, global warming of that magnitude would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans.”
“Given the 20°C warming we find with 4.8×CO2 [1400 ppm], it is clear that such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 amount required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than 4.8×CO2 [1400 ppm].”
“Are there sufficient fossil fuel reserves to yield 5000–10 000 Gt C? Recent updates of potential reserves, including unconventional fossil fuels (such as tar sands, tar shale and hydrofracking-derived shale gas) in addition to conventional oil, gas and coal, suggest that 5×CO2 (1400 ppm) is indeed feasible.”
Given the documented modeled forecast failures and lack of extreme or dangerous warming in recent decades, is there good reason to assume that Hansen’s prediction of a 20°C warming over the next 110 years will be realized?
At what point do modeling failures lead to a reconsideration of the forcing mechanisms?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe peer-reviewed scientific literature robustly affirms that land-falling hurricane frequencies and intensities have remained steady or declined in recent decades.  So have droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.  But the editorial board of The Washington Post spurns this scientific evidence and inexplicably blames politicians and “those who deny” climate change for landfalling hurricanes and the associated damage. 
Image Source: The Washington Post 11/09/2018
It is well documented in the scientific literature that a cooler climate is associated with more weather extremes and hurricane activity, whereas a warmer climate leads to a reduction in weather extremes and hurricane activity.

“Recent review papers reported that many high-resolution global climate models consistently projected a reduction of global tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in a future warmer climate.“ (Sugi et al., 2015)
“Our work illustrates a major constraint on the large-scale global atmospheric engine: As the climate warms, the system may be unable to increase its total entropy production enough to offset the moistening inefficiencies associated with phase transitions. This suggests thatin a future climate, the global atmospheric circulation might comprise highly energetic storms due to explosive latent heat release, but in such a case, the constraint on work output identified here will result in fewer numbers of such [highly energetic storm] events. … On a warming Earth, the increase in perceptible water has been identified as a reason for the tropical overturning to slow down,  and studies over a wide range of climates suggest that global atmospheric motions are reduced in extremely warm climates.“  (Laliberté et al., 2015)
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America.” (Chang et al., 2016)
“The impact of climate change is seen in slightly decreased intensities in landfalling cyclones.” (Perrie et al., 2010)

The Washington Post editorial board has apparently decided that contrarian scientific evidence is subservient to their political aims.
This way they can justify blaming out-of-favor politicians and those who “deny” climate change for the devastating consequences of an impending landfalling hurricane.
Below are several scientific papers published within the last year that do not seem to support the Post’s angle that says we can reduce hurricane landfall frequencies if only we can agree to believe, rather than deny, that humans are responsible.

“Downward Trend Since 1950” In Landfalling Hurricane Frequency/Intensity

Truchelut and Staeling, 2018 
“The extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season concluded an extended period of quiescent continental United States tropical cyclone landfall activity that began in 2006, commonly referred to as the landfall drought. We introduce an extended climatology of U.S. tropical cyclone activity based on accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) and use this data set to investigate variability and trends in landfall activity. The [hurricane landfall] drought years between 2006 and 2016 recorded an average value of total annual ACE [accumulated cyclone energy] over the U.S. that was less than 60% of the 1900–2017 average.”
“Scaling this landfall activity metric by basin-wide activity reveals a statistically significant downward trend since 1950, with the percentage of total Atlantic ACE expended over the continental U.S. at a series minimum during the recent drought period.”

Klotzbach et al., 2018
“Continental United States (CONUS) hurricane-related inflation-adjusted damage has increased significantly since 1900. However, since 1900 neither observed CONUS [Continental United States] landfalling hurricane frequency nor intensity show significant trends, including the devastating 2017 season.”


Zhang et al., 2018     
“Over the 1997–2014 period, the mean frequency of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones (TCs) was markedly lower (~18%) than the period 1980–1996. Here we show that these changes were driven by an intensification of the vertical wind shear in the southeastern/eastern WNP tied to the changes in the Walker circulation, which arose primarily in response to the enhanced sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the North Atlantic, while the SST anomalies associated with the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the tropical Pacific and the anthropogenic forcing play only secondary roles.”

Zhao et al., 2018
“A vigorous debate has currently focused on the relationship between increasing TC [tropical cyclone] activity and increasing SST [sea surface temperatures] (Knutson et al. 2010). … [O]ver the WNP [Western North Pacific] basin,a significant decrease of TCF [tropical cyclone frequency] has been observed since 1998 (Liu and Chan 2013; Lin and Chan 2015; Zhao and Wang 2016). Global TCF [tropical cyclone frequency] has showed a similar reduction since the late 1990s (Maue 2011). Change of TCF over the past few decades does not appear to be consistent with changes in local SST. Observational analyses further pointed out that there is no significant correlation between the TCF [tropical cyclone frequency] and local SST [sea surface temperatures] over the WNP  [Western North Pacific] basin (Chan 2006; Yeh et al. 2010).”


Heller, 2017
“The hurricane analysis conducted by Burn and Palmer (2015) determined that hurricane activity was subdued during the [warm] Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (~900-1350 CE) and became more produced during the [cold] Little Ice Age (LIA) (~1450-1850 CE), followed by a period of variability occurred between ~1850 and ~1900 before entering another subdued state during the industrial period (~1950-2000 CE). In general, the results of this study corroborate these findings.”
“[W]hile hurricane activity was greater during the LIA, it also had more frequent periods of drought compared to the MCA (Burn and Palmer 2014), suggesting that climate fluctuations were more pronounced in the LIA compared to the MCA. The changes in the diatom distribution and fluctuations in chl-a recorded in this study starting around 1350 also indicate that variations in climate have become more distinct during the LIA and from ~1850-1900. … [C]limate variability has increased following the onset of the Little Ice Age (~1450-1850 CE), however it is difficult to distinguish the impacts of recent anthropogenic climate warming on hurricane activity from those of natural Atlantic climate regimes, such as ENSO.”

Wellford et al., 2017
“Since the late 1800s, in contrast to much of the Southeastern USA, the Georgia coast has experienced infrequent hurricane landfalls, particularly in recent decades. As a result, coastal storm preparedness complacency appears to be rampant along the Georgia coastline. Both local and state governments were unprepared for shadow evacuation during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The study described here includes an examination of temporal and spatial trends in hurricane landfall along the Georgia coast from 1750 to 2012. Since 1750, 18 of the 24 recorded hurricanes that made landfall along the Georgia coast occurred between 1801 and 1900, yet the hurricane intensities have declined since 1851.”

No Increasing Trend In Drought/Flood Frequency, Severity

Guo et al., 2018
“In drought-prone regions like Central Asia, drought monitoring studies are paramount to provide valuable information for drought risk mitigation. In this paper, the spatiotemporal drought characteristics in Central Asia are analyzed from 1966 to 2015 using the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Central Asia showed an overall wetting trend with a switch to drying trend since 2003.”

“The main objective of this paper is to detect the evidence of statistically significant flood trends across Europe using a high spatial resolution dataset. … Anticipated changes in flood frequency and magnitude due to enhanced greenhouse forcing are not generally evident at this time over large portions of the United States for several different measures of flood flows. … Thus, similarly to the main findings of Archfield et al. (2016) for the US, the picture of flood change in Europe is strongly heterogeneous and no general statements about uniform trends across the entire continent can be made.”

Zheng et al., 2018     
“For the extreme drought and flood events in total, more frequent of them occurred in the 1770s and 1790s, 1870s–1880s, 1900s–1920s and 1960s, among which the 1790s witnessed the highest frequency of extreme drought and flood events totally.”


Schedel, Jr. and Schedel, 2018    
“Flood events on the U.S. East Coast are not more severe or frequent than in the past. However, because of sea-level rise, these events are starting from a higher baseline height. Thus, the same severity of a flood event today reaches a greater absolute height than an identical flood would have reached 50 or 100 years ago.Based on current data, the good news is that the apparent worsening of flood events is due to a single, primary cause: sea level rise. Flood events are not getting stronger or occurring more frequently than in the past. They are instead starting from a higher point, allowing them to reach higher levels more often. The bad news is that sea-level rise will be a fact of life for many years into the future. Communities need to start now to make informed plans and decisions about how best to adapt.”


Valdés-Manzanilla, 2018
“This study presents a chronology of historical and measured flood events in the Papaloapan River basin of Mexico during 450 years. Twenty-eight historical floods were recorded during the period 1550–1948 [7 per century] on this river and one flood event (1969) in the instrumental era (1949–2000) [2 per century], of which 14 were extraordinary floods and only 15 were catastrophic ones. There were several flood-rich decades during 1860–1870, 1880–1890, 1920–1930 and 1940–1950. Wavelet analysis found a significant flooding periodicity of 58 years. The wavelet coherence analysis found that flooding had an in-phase relationship with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and also with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.”

Dobrovolný et al., 2018
“The new MJJ precipitation reconstruction is restricted to inter-annual and inter-decadal variability, which is in line with our understanding of natural precipitation variability. Reconstruction reveals two long periods of low precipitation variability, in the 13th–14th centuries and 1630s–1850s. It also demonstrates that precipitation anomalies of larger amplitude and longer duration occurred in the earlier part of the last millennium than those found in the instrumental period. Negative trends in soil moisture content and gradual changes in annual precipitation distribution leading to higher extremity of precipitation regime may be responsible for the lower sensitivity of oaks to precipitation after the 1980s. The new reconstruction does not indicate any exceptional recent decline in MJJ precipitation.”


Extreme, Unstable Weather Decreases With Warming

Zou et al., 2018
“The Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of the world’s most sensitive areas to climate change, became significantly warmer during recent decades. Since 1960 (1980), storm (hail) days have been decreasing by 6.2%/decade (18.3%/decade) in the region.”
“Based on 53‐year continuous weather records at 48 TP stations and reanalysis data, we show here for the first time that the consistent decline of storm days is strongly related to a drier midtroposphere since 1960. Further analysis demonstrated that fewer hail days are driven by an elevation of the melting level (thermodynamically) and a weaker wind shear (dynamically) in a warming climate. These results imply that less storm and hail may occur over TP when climate warms.”

Zhang et al., 2017
“Based on continuous and coherent severe weather reports from over 500 manned stations, for the first time, this study shows a significant decreasing trend in severe weather occurrence across China during the past five decades. The total number of severe weather days that have either thunderstorm, hail and/or damaging wind decrease about 50% from 1961 to 2010. It is further shown that the reduction in severe weather occurrences correlates strongly with the weakening of East Asian summer monsoon which is the primary source of moisture and dynamic forcing conducive for warm-season severe weather over China.”

Chen et al., 2017
“Results indicate that the midlatitude summer cyclone activity over East Asia exhibits decadal changes in the period of 1979–2013 and is significantly weakened after early 1990s. …  Moreover, there is a close linkage between the weakening of cyclonic activity after the early 1990s and the nonuniform surface warming of the Eurasian continent.”
“Significant warming to the west of Mongolia tends to weaken the north–south temperature gradient and the atmospheric baroclinicity to its south and eventually can lead to weakening of the midlatitude cyclone activity over East Asia.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the first 9½ months of 2018,  368 scientific papers have been published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise serve to question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and mainstream media sources.

These 368 new papers affirm the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes, emphasizing that climate science is not settled.
More specifically, the papers in this compilation support these four main skeptical positions — categorized here as N(1) – N(4) — which question climate alarm.
N(1) Natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined.
N(2) The warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability.
N(3) The computer climate models are neither reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system.
N(4) Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).

In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%.
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences.
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“.
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
To reiterate, the 368 papers compiled in 2018 thus far support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that.   In other words, it is not accurate to claim these papers prove that anthropogenic global warming (AGW) positions are invalid, or that AGW claims have now been “debunked”.

Non-Hockey Sticks: A Few Thousand Years Ago It Was 1-3°C Warmer Than Today
Papadomanolaki et al., 2018  (Baltic Sea)  A large fraction of the Baltic Proper became hypoxic again between 1.4 and 0.7 ka BP, during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), when mean air temperatures were 0.9–1.4 °C higher than temperatures recorded in the period 1961–1990 (e.g. Mann et al., 2009; Jilbert and Slomp, 2013).
Leonard et al., 2018  (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)  Coral derived sea surface temperature (SST-Sr/Ca) reconstructions demonstrate conditions ∼1 ◦C warmer than present at ∼6200 (recalibrated 14C) and 4700 yr BP, with a suggested increase in salinity range (δ18O) associated with amplified seasonal flood events, suggestive of La Niña (Gagan et al., 1998; Roche et al., 2014).
Suvorov and Kitov, 2018  (Eastern Sayan, Siberia)  The authors examined the variability of activity of modern glaciation and variation of natural conditions of the periglacial zone on climate and on dendrochronological data. Results of larch and Siberian stone pine growth data were revealed at the higher border of forest communities. …  It is believed that the temperature could be 3.5 °C warmer at the Holocene optimum than at the present time (Vaganov and Shiyatov 2005). … Since 2000, there has been growth of trees instability associated with a decrease in average monthly summer temperatures. …  Since the beginning of 2000, decrease in summer temperatures was marked.
Lozhkin et al., 2018  (East Siberia)  The postglacial occurrence of relatively warm/dry and warm/wet intervals is consistent with results of a regional climate‐model simulation that indicates warmer than present temperatures and decreased effective moisture at 11 000 cal. a BP and persistence of warm conditions but with greater moisture and longer growing season at 6000 cal. a BP.
Smith, 2018  (Greenland Ice Sheet)     To project how much sea level will rise in response to ongoing climate warming, one of the things we need to know is how sensitive the rate of Greenland Ice Sheet melting is to rising temperatures. McFarlin et al. present results from a set of sediment cores from a small nonglacial lake in the highlands of northwest Greenland, which contain deposits from the Holocene and the Last Interglacial (LIG). They found midge assemblages indicating peak July temperatures that were 4.0° to 7.0°C warmer than modern temperatures during the early Holocene and at least 5.5° to 8.5°C warmer during the LIG. This perspective of extreme warming suggests that even larger changes than predicted for this region over the —–coming century may be in store.
Kullman, 2018  (Scandes, Northern Sweden)     The present paper reports results from an extensive project aiming at improved understanding of postglacial subalpine/alpine vegetation, treeline, glacier and climate history in the Scandes of northern Sweden. The main methodology is analyses of mega fossil tree remnants, i.e. trunks, roots and cones, recently exposed at the fringe of receding glaciers and snow/ice patches. This approach has a spatial resolution and accuracy, which exceeds any other option for tree cover reconstruction in high-altitude mountain landscapes. …  All recovered tree specimens originate from exceptionally high elevations, about 600-700 m atop of modern treeline positions. … Conservatively drawing on the latter figure and a summer temperature lapse rate of 0.6 °C per 100 m elevation (Laaksonen 1976), could a priori mean that, summer temperatures were at least 4.2 °C warmer than present around 9500 year before present. However, glacio-isostatic land uplift by at least 100 m since that time (Möller 1987; Påsse & Anderson 2005) implies that this figure has to be reduced to 3.6 °C higher than present-day levels, i.e. first decades of the 21st century. Evidently, this was the warmth peak of the Holocene, hitherto. This inference concurs with paleoclimatic reconstructions from Europe and Greenland (Korhola et al. 2002; Bigler et al. 2003; Paus 2013; Luoto et al. 2014; Väliranta et al. 2015).
Borisova, 2018  (central East European Plain)     Paleobotanical assemblages from peat, lake, and archaeological deposits reveal that during the Middle Holocene (MH; ca. 9.0 to 4.7 kyr BP), the central East European Plain was occupied by highly productive and diverse mixed-oak forests, along with mire, meadow, and riverine communities. Climatic reconstructions based on modern analogues of fossil pollen and plant macrofossil assemblages indicate that throughout the MH [Middle Holocene] mean annual precipitation was at near present levels (~600 mm) and July temperatures were similar to those of today (~17°C). However, differences in the Fossil Floras (FFs) suggest changes in winter conditions though the MH [Middle Holocene, 9.0 to 4.7 kyr BP], with January temperatures higher than the present-day value of -10°C by 2°C in the Early Atlantic, 6°C in the Middle Atlantic, and 3°C in the Late Atlantic-Early Subboreal. The annual frost-free period was 15 days longer than today in the Early Atlantic, about one month longer in the Late Atlantic, and became close to present by the beginning of the Subboreal. The combination of warm winters with diverse and productive vegetation communities provided an environment that was more hospitable than that of today for Late Mesolithic and Neolithic societies.
McFarlin et al., 2018    (Greenland)  Early Holocene peak warmth has been quantified at only a few sites, and terrestrial sedimentary records of prior interglacials are exceptionally rare due to glacial erosion during the last glacial period. Here, we discuss findings from a lacustrine archive that records both the Holocene and the Last Interglacial (LIG) from Greenland, allowing for direct comparison between two interglacials. Sedimentary chironomid assemblages indicate peak July temperatures [Greenland] 4.0 to 7.0 °C warmer than modern during the Early Holocene maximum [10,000 to 8,000 years ago] in summer insolation. Chaoborus and chironomids in LIG sediments indicate July temperatures at least 5.5 to 8.5 °C warmer than modern.
Bartels et al., 2018  (North Atlantic Region)     During summer, AW [Atlantic Water] rises up to waterdepths as shallow as ~55 m. … Summer surface temperatures [1955-2012] range between up to 3°C at the northern mouth and <-1.5 °C at the southern mouth of the Hinlopen Strait, while winter surface temperatures vary between 0.5 and <~1.5°C (averaged, 1955–2012; Locarnini et al. 2013). … Increased summer insolation probably amplified the surface melting of the glaciers resulting in enhanced meltwater production and in a very high accumulation of finegrained sediments within the fjord […].  In addition, during the mild early Holocene conditions, summer sea-surface temperatures probably reaching 8–10°C [~5 – 9.5°C warmer than 1955-2012] (indicated by M. edulis findings as discussed in Hansen et al. 2011) may have contributed to reducing the number of glaciers that entered the fjord directly as tidewater glaciers and thus causing a diminished IRD input. These comparably warm surface temperatures most likely resulted in a reduced sea ice cover during summer, which is also reflected in the sea-ice biomarker data exhibiting lowest IP25 values during the early Holocene. … [G]lacier advances are most likely caused by atmospheric cooling as indicated, e.g. by d18O values from the Greenland NGRIP ice-core (Rasmussen et al.  2014a), by data from peats and permafrost soils on Spitsbergen (e.g. Humlum et al. 2003; Humlum 2005; Jaworski 2016), and by evidence that solar activity reduced around 2.7 ka, contributing to a cooling in both hemispheres (van Geel et al. 1999, 2000). … In lake sediments from northwestern Spitsbergen a temperature drop of ~6°C is recorded between c. 7.8 and c. 7 ka [-0.8°C per century], which has been connected to a stronger influence of Arctic Water and expanding sea ice (van der Bilt et al. 2018).
Street-Perrot et al., 2018  (Estonia)     Estimates of summer temperatures in Estonia based on rapidly responding proxies such as aquatic macrofossils (Valiranta et al., 2015) and chironomids (Heiri et al., 2014) suggest conditions 2 °C warmer than today during the early Holocene.
Pozachenuk, 2018 (Western Russia)  Mass peat accumulation in the territory of Vyatka region began only in the first half of the Atlantic Holocene period. The maximum warming corresponds to the second half of at (climatic optimum Holocene), when the average temperatures of January and July exceeded modern 2-3˚C. at this time in the region formed coniferous-broad-leaved forests of complex composition, with a slight presence of broad-leaved species (Qercus, Tilia, Ulmus) and Corulus. Siberian element of flora-fir on the territory of Vyatka region appeared only in the Subatlantic period of Holocene, most likely due to climatic conditions.
Kolaczek et al., 2018 (Southeastern Poland)    The reconstruction of the mean July temperature based on Chironomidae revealed the exceptionally high rate of warming during the period of ca. 11,490–11,460 cal. BP (at least 1 °C per decade) up to values > 2 °C than modern ones. … Between ca. 11,490 and 11,460 cal. BP, the strongest warming trend in the Early Holocene MJT was registered, that is from 15 to 20.7°C (0.19°C yr1, 1.9°C/decade). Then, ca. 11,450 cal. BP, the temperature decreased to 18.3°C and up to ca. 10,560 cal. BP MJT fluctuated between 17  and 19°C. The climate of the area [today] is classified as cold temperate with mean annual air temperature of 8.2°C  and mean annual precipitation 620 mm. A mean temperature of the warmest month, i.e. July, is +18.2°C [today], whereas a mean temperature of the coldest month, i.e. January, is -3.6°C.
Ruskeeniemi et al., 2018  (Greenland Ice Sheet)     Towards the Holocene Climatic Optimum, temperatures steadily increased and were 2.5°C higher than at present during 8000-5000 cal years BP. It is suggested that the GrIS started to re-advance after 4400 cal years BP due to cooling, with 0.5°C lower temperatures than at present around 2000 years BP. Within the LIA, Dahl-Jensen et al. (1998) identified two cold periods at 1550 AD and 1850 AD, with temperatures respectively 0.5°C and 0.7°C below the present values. At around 1930 AD, the temperatures reached a maximum and have slightly decreased thereafter.
The CO2 Greenhouse Effect: Climate Driver?
Davis et al., 2018     [T]he contemporary global warming increase of ~0.8 °C recorded since 1850 has been attributed widely to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Recent research has shown, however, that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been decoupled from global temperature for the last 425 million years [Davis, 2017] owing to well-established diminishing returns in marginal radiative forcing (ΔRF) as atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. Marginal forcing of temperature from increasing CO2 emissions declined by half from 1850 to 1980, and by nearly two-thirds from 1850 to 1999 [Davis, 2017]. Changes in atmospheric CO2 therefore affect global temperature weakly at most. The anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis has been embraced partly because “…there is no convincing alternative explanation…” [USGCRP, 2017] (p. 12). …  The ACO [Antarctic Centennial Oscillation] provides a possible [natural] alternative explanation in the form of a natural climate cycle that arises in Antarctica, propagates northward to influence global temperature, and peaks on a predictable centennial timetable. … The period and amplitude of ACOs oscillate in phase with glacial cycles and related surface insolation associated with planetary orbital forces. We conclude that the ACO: encompasses at least the EAP; is the proximate source of D-O oscillations in the Northern Hemisphere; therefore affects global temperature; propagates with increased velocity as temperature increases; doubled in intensity over geologic time; is modulated by global temperature variations associated with planetary orbital cycles; and is the probable paleoclimate precursor of the contemporary Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). Properties of the ACO/AAO are capable of explaining the current global warming signal.
Smirnov, 2018     From this, it follows for the change of the global temperature as a result at doubling of the concentration of atmospheric CO2 molecules [is] ∆T = (0.4 ± 0.1) K, where the error accounts for the accuracy of used values, whereas the result depends on processes included in the above scheme. Indeed, we assume the atmospheric and Earth’s albedo, as well as another interaction of solar radiation with the atmosphere and Earth, to be unvaried in the course of the change of the concentration of CO2 molecules, and also the content of atmospheric water is conserved. Because anthropogenic fluxes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulted from combustion of fossil fuels is about 5% [Kaufman, 2007], the contribution of the human activity to ECS (the temperature change as a result of doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide amount) is ∆T = 0.02 K, i.e. injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuels is not important for the greenhouse effect.
Fleming, 2018     This manuscript will review the essence of the role of  CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. The logic of  CO2 involvement in changing the climate will be investigated from every perspective: reviewing the historical data record, examining in further detail the twentieth-century data record, and evaluating the radiation role of  CO2 in the atmosphere—calculating and integrating the Schwarzschild radiation equation with a full complement of  CO2 absorption coeﬃcients. A review of the new theory of climate change—due to the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld interacting with cosmic rays, is provided. The application of this new theory is applied to climate-change events within the latter part of the Earth’s interglacial period. … The results of this review point to the extreme value of  CO2 to all life forms, but no role of  CO2 in any signiﬁcant change of the Earth’s climate. … The results of this review point to the extreme value of  CO2 to all life forms, but no role of  CO2 in any significant change of the Earth’s climate. … Many believe and/or support the notion that the Earth’s atmosphere is a “greenhouse” with CO2 as the primary “greenhouse” gas warming Earth. That this concept seems acceptable is understandable—the modern heating of the Earth’s atmosphere began at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850. The industrial revolution took hold about the same time. It would be natural to believe that these two events could be the reason for the rise in temperature. There is now a much clearer picture of an alternative reason for why the Earth’s surface temperature has risen since 1850. … There is no correlation of CO2 with temperature in any historical data set that was reviewed. The climate-change cooling over the 1940–1975 time period of the Modern Warming period was shown to be influenced by a combination of solar factors. The cause of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age climate changes was the solar magnetic field and cosmic ray connection. When the solar magnetic field is strong, it acts as a barrier to cosmic rays entering the Earth’s atmosphere, clouds decrease and the Earth warms. Conversely when the solar magnetic field is weak, there is no barrier to cosmic rays—they greatly increase large areas of low-level clouds, increasing the Earth’s albedo and the planet cools. The factors that affect these climate changes were reviewed in “Solar magnetic field/cosmic ray factors affecting climate change” section. The calculations of “H2O and CO2 in the radiation package” section revealed that there is no net impact of CO2 on the net heating of the atmosphere. The received heat is simply redistributed within the atmospheric column. This result is consistent and explains the lack of CO2 correlations with observations in the past. The current Modern Warming will continue until the solar magnetic field decreases in strength. If one adds the 350-year cycle from the McCracken result to the center of the Maunder Minimum which was centered in 1680, one would have a Grand Minimum centered in the year 2030.
Holmes, 2018     In short, there is unlikely to be any significant net warming from the greenhouse effect on any planetary body in the parts of atmospheres which are >10kPa. Instead, it is proposed that the residual temperature difference between the effective temperature and the measured near-surface temperature, is a thermal enhancement caused by gravitationally-induced adiabatic auto compression, powered by convection. A new null hypothesis of global warming or climate change is therefore proposed and argued for; one which does not include any anomalous or net warming from greenhouse gases in the tropospheric atmospheres of any planetary body. … A decline of 6% in lower tropospheric tropical cloud cover (15°N–15°S) occurred 1984 – 2000 according to the international satellite cloud climatology project’s data [29]. These years are contained well with the 1975-2000 period of warming, and an observed 0.4°C rise in global temperatures occurred over the same period. Scatter diagrams [55] of low cloud cover vs global surface air temperatures indicate that a 1% fall in low clouds equates to a 0.07°C rise in surface air temperatures – hence this change in cloudiness accounts for the entire observed rise in global temperatures during the 1975-2000 period, leaving no room for any effect from growing greenhouse gases.
Ollila, 2018         The temperature effects of the water and CO2 are based on spectral analysis calculations, which show that water is 11.8 times stronger a GH gas than CO2 in the present climate. … There are essential features in the long-term trends of temperature and TPW [total precipitable water], which are calculated and depicted as mean values 11 years running. The temperature has increased about 0.4°C since 1979 and has now paused at this level. The long-term trend of TPW effects shows that it has slightly decreased during the temperature-increasing period from 1979 to 2000. This means that the absolute water amount in the atmosphere does not follow the temperature increase, but is practically constant, reacting only very slightly to the long-term trends of temperature changes. The assumption that relative humidity is constant and that it amplifies the GH gas changes over the longer periods by doubling the warming effects finds no grounds based on the behavior of the TWP [total precipitable water] trend. The positive water feedback exists only during the short-term ENSO events (≤4 years). … The validity of the IPCC model can be tested against the observed temperature. It turns out that the IPCC-calculated temperature increase for 2016 is 1.27°C, which is 49 per cent higher than the observed 0.85°C. This validity test means that the IPCC climate forcing model using the radiative forcing value of CO2 is too sensitive for CO2 increase, and the CS [climate sensitivity] parameter, including the positive water feedback doubling the GH gas effects, does not exist. … The CO2 emissions from 2000 onward represent about one-third of the total emissions since 1750, but the temperature has not increased, and it has paused at the present level. This is worthy proof that the IPCC’s climate model has overestimated human-induced causes and has probably underestimated natural causes like the sun’s activity changes, considering the historical temperatures during the past 2000 years. … The RF [radiative forcing] value for the CO2 concentration of 560 ppm is 2.16 Wm−2 according to equation (3), which is 42 per cent smaller than 3.7 Wm−2 used by the IPCC. The same study of Ollila (2014) shows that the CS [climate sensitivity] parameter λ is 0.27 K/(Wm−2), which means that there is no water feedback. Using this λ value, equation (3) gives a TCS [transient climate sensitivity] value of 0.6°C only. This same result is also reported by Harde (2014) using the spectral analysis method. …There are both theoretical- and measurement-based studies showing results that can be explained only by the fact that there is no positive water feedback. This result reduces the CS [climate sensitivity] by 50 per cent. Some research studies show that the RF [radiative forcing] value of carbon dioxide is considerably smaller than the commonly used RF value, according to the equation of Myhre et al. (1998). Because of these two causes, the critical studies show a TCS [transient climate sensitivity] of about 0.6°C instead of 1.9°C by the IPCC, a 200 per cent difference.
Liu and Chen, 2018     CO2 and temperature records at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and other observation stations show that the correlation between CO2 and temperature is not significant. These stations are located away from big cities, and in various latitudes and hemispheres. But the correlation is significant in global mean data. Over the last five decades, CO2 has grown at an accelerating rate with no corresponding rise in temperature in the stations. This discrepancy indicates that CO2 probably is not the driving force of temperature change globally but only locally(mainly in big cities). We suggest that the Earth’s atmospheric concentration of CO2 is too low to drive global temperature change. Our empirical perception of the global warming record is due to the urban heat island effect: temperature rises in areas with rising population density and rising industrial activity. This effect mainly occurs in the areas with high population and intense human activities, and is not representative of global warming. Regions far from cities, such as the Mauna Loa highland, show no evident warming trend. The global monthly mean temperature calculated by record data, widely used by academic researchers, shows R~2=0.765, a high degree of correlation with CO2. However, the R~2 shows much less significance (mean R~2=0.024) if calculated by each record for 188 selected stations over the world. This test suggests that the inflated high correlation between CO2 and temperature(mean R~2=0.765-0.024=0.741) used in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) was very likely produced during data correction and processing. This untrue global monthly mean temperature has created a picture: human emission drives global warming.
Laubereau and Iglev, 2018     Using a simple 1-dimensional model the global warming of the surface is computed that is generated by the increase of GHG and the albedo change. A modest effect by the GHG of 0.08 K is calculated for the period 1880 to 1955 with a further increase by 0.18 K for 1955 to 2015. A larger contribution of 0.55 ± 0.05 K is estimated for the melting of polar sea ice (MSI) in the latter period, i.e. it notably exceeds that of the GHG and may be compared with the observed global temperature rise of 1.0 ± 0.1 K during the past 60 years. … In conclusion we wish to say that we have performed a study of the infrared properties of carbon dioxide, methane, dinitrogen-oxide and water to estimate their contribution to the global warming in 1880 – 2015. Our results suggest that the IR properties of the CO2 are responsible for ~ 20% of the mean temperature increase of the surface and notably less for CH4 and N2O.

Venter et al., 2018      “Over the past three decades, 7.5 million km2 (55%) of non-forest biomes in sub-Saharan Africa underwent significant net gains in woody plant cover. This is more than triple the 2.2 million km2 (16%) significant decrease in woody plant cover, confirming local-scale studies indicating increases in WPE [woody plant encroachment] over the last century. … These results confirm global greening trends, thereby bringing into question widely held theories about declining terrestrial carbon balances and desert expansion.”
Munier et al., 2018     “On average, all vegetation types have experienced greening over the last two decades at rates ranging from 0.026 m2m−2yr−1 for winter crops to 0.042 m2m−2yr−1 for coniferous forests. Coniferous forests are mainly greening in temperate regions and show the largest area affected by high positive trends. By contrast, grasslands are greening at a moderate average rate, but since they cover almost half of the total vegetated area, the grassland area affected by high trend values is greater than for any other vegetation type but coniferous forests. … In the tropical zone, evergreen forests and grasslands are rapidly greening (see Table 4), which seems to be related to rising CO2 in the atmosphere [Zhu et al., 2016]. On the contrary, in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere where coniferous forests are dominating, Zhu, Z. et al. [2016] suggested that changes in the vegetation dynamics are mainly driven by climate change.”
Brandt et al., 2017     “Here we used a passive microwave Earth observation data set to document two different trends in land area with woody cover for 1992–2011: 36% of the land area (6,870,000 km2) had an increase in woody cover largely in drylands, and 11% had a decrease (2,150,000 km2), mostly in humid zones. Increases in woody cover were associated with low population growth, and were driven by increases in CO2 in the humid zones and by increases in precipitation in drylands, whereas decreases in woody cover were associated with high population growth.”
Bastin et al., 2017     “We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our estimate is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before. This increases current estimates of global forest cover by at least 9%.”

Question
If termite populations and soil-terrain area have been rapidly
growing in recent decades, and these sources emit 2 and 9 times
more CO2 into the atmosphere than humans do via fossil fuel
combustion respectively, why is it assumed that an increase in
human CO2 emission is 100% responsible for the increase in
atmospheric CO2 concentration?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany has seriously overestimated how much its neighboring countries are able to help out in the event wind and solar energy fail to deliver, thus putting it’s power supply at risk.
One of Germany’s strategies for making its energy supply renewable is to rely on its neighbors to step up when green energies fail to deliver.
As the country adds more volatile wind and solar energy to the grid, Germany hopes that neighboring countries will cooperate in helping to stabilize the power grid in the event the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine — especially after the country shuts down its remaining nuclear power plants and starts to shut down old coal plants. Nuclear and coal power make up the lion’s share of Germany’s stable baseload power supply.
“A dangerous miscalculation”
However, it appears German officials have made a major miscalculation: citing a recent study, journalist Daniel Wetzel at Die Welt writes: “Europe cannot bail out the German power supply. This is so because “hardly a neighboring country has any remaining extra power plant capacity.” The Die Welt economics journalist then calls the German strategy “a dangerous miscalculation.”
In 2014 the German Ministry of Economics assumed the country could rely on 60 gigawatts of over-capacity in related adjacent markets in Europe, but it turns out that the figure was overstated by a factor of 3 to 4. Consequently on windless and sunless days, Germany could end up missing considerable amounts of power.
Wetzel writes:

As a result, soon all over Europe power stations with ‘secured power’ that can produce independently of current wind and sun conditions will be missing.”
He also adds that as every European country strives to add more wind and solar capacity, more of their baseload capacity plants are being shut down as well, which only makes the situation increasingly worse when sun and wind do not show up. The point is rapidly coming where there will not be sufficient baseload capacity to keep the grid stable.
One solution, Wetzel suggests, would be to install gas-fired power generators so that they could be fired up in times of low wind and solar output: “However, new gas-fired plants are being built nowhere because refinancing under the conditions of the Energiewende appears as being too risky,” Wetzel reports.
In a nutshell, as Europe expands its wind and solar capacity, more baseload capacity will be needed. But instead of adding it, Europe is reducing it, and thus making the supply and grid stability worse.
As for Germany, it is increasingly dawning on politicians that designing energy infrastructure is best left technical and electrical engineering experts, and not to climate -catastrophe obsessed politicians and green activists who seem to think such complex systems can be built up ad hoc as you go.
The price of this slipshod politicized approach could wind up being very painful in the midterm future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists have determined that today’s Arctic sea ice concentrations are still much higher than they have been for most of the last several thousand years, undermining claims that modern era Arctic sea ice changes are remarkable, unusual, or unprecedented. 

Source: Kolling et al., 2018
In the graphical illustration of Late Holocene West Greenland sea ice changes shown above, Kolling and colleagues (2018) indicate that both present-day and Little Ice Age era (~1300s to 1800s AD) sea ice does not melt until May.(Fig. 6a).
During most of the last 2,200 years — especially during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Roman Warm Period (RWP) — spring sea ice melted in March, two months earlier than today (Fig. 6b).
The authors attribute the lower-than-today sea ice concentrations and warmer temperatures during the MWP and RWP to a “self-amplifiying system” involving variations in solar activity and the AMO.  Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are not mentioned in the paper as a factor influencing sea ice changes.
“The period between 2.2 and 1.2 kyr BP, with lower than modern sea ice conditions in Disko Bugt (Fig. 6b), coincides with generally warm conditions over the Greenland Ice Sheet.”
“A self-amplifying system may have caused the environmental changes observed in Disko Bugt area as follows: solar triggered Arctic sea ice melt [Ruzmaikin et al., 2004] increases freshwater supply towards the North Atlantic causing a reduction in sub-polar gyre activity and AMO [Holland et al., 2001, Schmith et al., 2003] as described by Sha et al. [2016].”
Consistent with other reconstructions for the region (Kryk et al., 2017; Durantou et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2017; Perner et al., 2018), proxy evidence shows that current sea ice conditions are only modestly different than the indicated conditions during the past few centuries.


Source: Kryk et al., 2017; Durantou et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2017; Perner et al., 2018
The lack of any unusual or remarkable change in sea ice conditions during the modern era relative to the past suggests there is a lack of conspicuous connection between rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the Arctic climate.

Kolling et al., 2018
New insights into sea ice changes over the
past 2.2 kyr in Disko Bugt, West Greenland
“Our biomarker record indicates that Disko Bugt [West Greenland] experienced a gradual expansion of seasonal sea ice during the last 2.2 kyr. Maximum sea ice extent was reached during the Little Ice Age around 0.2 kyr BP. Superimposed on this longer term trend, we find short-term oscillations in open water primary production and terrigenous input, which may be related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and solar activity changes as potential climatic trigger mechanisms.
“The period between 2.2 and 1.2 kyr BP, with lower than modern sea ice conditions in Disko Bugt (Fig. 6b), coincides with generally warm conditions over the Greenland Ice Sheet.”
“Overall, IP25 concentrations remained relatively low and constant until 1.2 kyr BP, followed by a gradual increase (Fig. 3e). The lowest [sea ice] concentrations, around 0.06 µg/gTOC, are observed in the lowermost core section from 2.2 to 1.5 kyr BP (Fig. 3e).”
“During the last 0.1 kyr, all biomarker concentrations showed an increase, brassicasterol and HBI III reach maximum values in the uppermost sample (80 µg/gTOC and 1.8 µg/gTOC, respectively; Fig. 3b, d).”

Source: Kolling et al., 2018
“[During the Little Ice Age (0.7–0.2 kyr BP)] our biomarker record supports harsher sea ice conditions, possibly similar to conditions as observed today (Fig. 6b), indicated by strong increased in IP25 concentration and the PDIP25 index (Fig. 4c, d).”

Source: Kolling et al., 2018
“AMO variability has been linked to solar activity changes [Knudsen et al., 2011]. Changes in incoming radiation may influence sea ice extent and the Greenland Ice Sheet behaviour [Ruzmaikin et al., 2004] and consequently affect the freshwater discharge/inflow [Schmith et al., 2003] and nutrient availability to the area. A self-amplifying system may have caused the environmental changes observed in Disko Bugt area as follows: solar triggered Arctic sea ice melt [Ruzmaikin et al., 2004] increases freshwater supply towards the North Atlantic causing a reduction in sub-polar gyre activity and AMO [Holland et al., 2001, Schmith et al., 2003] as described by Sha et al. [2016]. This may in turn cause distinct changes in WGC composition and meltwater supply from the Greenland Ice Sheet that affects phytoplankton blooms in West Greenland.”
“We find that the Disko Bugt area was influenced by seasonal sea ice over the last 2.2 kyr BP. The overall sea ice trend indicates a development from a reduced sea ice cover during early spring, with sea ice algae productivity hampered by light availability to a gradual extend of the sea ice season from 1.2 kyr BP onwards. This change in sea ice extend is parallel to decreasing Northern Hemisphere atmospheric temperatures and culminates in the Little Ice Age around 0.2 kyr. We assume that modern conditions, with sea ice present until late spring and the presence of a stable ice edge at Disko Bugt, established around that time [~200 years ago].”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here posted a video of excerpts of a German Parliamentary hearing on climate change in the German Federal Parliament featuring Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) scientist Anders Levermann and atmospheric physicist Prof. Nir Shaviv of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
The hearing was to look into the controversy of climate change, with the AfD opposition party casting doubt on the German government’s long-held alarmist position.
In total the hearing lasted some 2 hours, but EIKE has fortunately provided a condensed 16-minute version featuring the main points.

As expected Levermann of the alarmist and activist PIK claimed that the physics of global warming were “rock solid” and that a doubling of CO2 would undoubtedly lead to 3°C of warming. He tried to claim the science was settled.
No proof…dubious hockey stick
At the 1:40 mark, Shaviv responded by saying there was “no scientific proof that showed CO2 has a large impact on climate” and that the arguments used by the IPCC to claim otherwise “are faulty”.
He says we know today that the hockey stick chart was “dubious science”.
IPCC ignores the sun
Shaviv also told the members of the German Parliament that the IPCC refuses to acknowledge the sun’s powerful role on driving climate and sea level rise rate. “The sun has contributed to more than half the warming.”
At the 3:40 mark Shaviv states that CO2 climate sensitivity is in fact only 1 – 1.5°C for a doubling of CO2, far less than the figure suggested by the PIK’s Levermann.
Models are faulty
Levermann then bluntly responded (5:05) with an insult, calling Shaviv’s non-alarmist claims “nonsense”.
But Shaviv fired back (6:10), reminding that there’s much scientific literature supporting the sun is a major driver and that the IPCC climate models are faulty and lopsided.
At the 7-minute mark Levermann claims the global temperature rose 0.2°C over the past 2 decades “in just a short” time, but not mentioning the natural oceanic El Nino event being at play. He then claimed they had already refuted all the points made by skeptics.

From 15.0°C in 1850 to 14.8 today?
An interesting moment came at the 8-minute mark when one Parliamentarian asked Levermann which pre-industrial reference temperature the IPCC was working with. Parliamentarian Dr. Kraft asked Levermann what exactly was the global temperature before industrialization some 150 years ago. According to Levermann, it was “in the area of 15°C”, thus implying today’s global temperature is over 16°C. At this point Parliamentarian Hilse (8:40) noted that “the WMO, NASA and the NOAA gave 14.8°C as the global mean temperature in 2016”. According to Parliamentarian Hilse:
So, Herr Levermann, if what you say is right, then it means the temperature has fallen 0.2°C.”
Levermann then told the Parliamentarians that the fact that CO2 causes warming was as sure as gravity making objects fall, and called everything said by Shaviv “all shit” (9:30).
CO2 sensitivity rapidly declining
At the 9:50 mark Levermann clarifies that a doubling of CO2 itself leads to only 1.1°C of warming, but that the added warming will result from the water vapor feedback. He insists there is little uncertainty here. Yet EIKE points out at the 10:35 mark that the IPCC range in fact contains a high degree of uncertainty: 1.5° C to 4.5°C and that there is nothing certain about the science at all.
Recently scientists have been walking back CO2’s warming effect, EIKE shows:

EIKE presents the above chart to show how leading scientists have been ratcheting down their estimates of CO2 climate sensitivity over the years, which today is well below Levermann’s claims of 3.0°C for a doubling. Image cropped at 13:12.
Strangely at the 11:15 mark, the PIK scientist claims that the CO2 molecule is V-shaped. Yet, it is known that it is a straight molecule (11:50).
Shaviv: “No proof that large CO2 changes lead to large temperature changes”
In the end Shaviv disputes Levermann’s claim that the science is “rock solid”, noting that the models neglect factors such as clouds and that there are a number of studies showing that CO2’s impact on temperature is far more modest.
Shaviv summarizes:
There’s no proof that large changes in CO2 would lead to large temperature changes.”
Overall, EIKE called the debate before the Parliamentary Committee a “debacle for the climate alarmists”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a new paper, scientists document another long-term cooling trend, this time in the North Atlantic’s sea surface temperatures.  Characterized as yet another stubborn “warming hole” in the anthropogenic “global” warming (AGW) narrative, the cooling trend amounts to “0.8 K century-1” and does not follow expectations outlined in models of  global-scale warming.

The portrayal of a globally-synchronous warming of the Earth with only small pockets of “warming hole” anomalies  is not supported by local and regional data reported in scientific papers.
In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, scientists (Kretschmer et al., 2018) have identified other “warming holes” in the temperature data for the 1990-2015 period.  About 80% of the contiguous U.S., Europe and much of Asia, including parts of the Arctic (Eastern Siberia), cooled during the 1990-2015 period, as shown here.
In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctica has not warmed in the last 38 years.   And according to Purich et al., 2018, most of the Southern Ocean has been cooling since the late 1970s as well (as shown here).
There are not tiny, isolated holes of cooling in an otherwise uniformly-warming world.  These are gaping expanses of cooling…or non-warming.
Yes, some regions of the globe have been warming.  Some regions have been cooling.  And some regions remain trendless.
But in recent decades, the warming has not been global in scope.

Gervais et al., 2018
Mechanisms Governing the Development of the North Atlantic
Warming Hole in the CESM-LE Future Climate Simulations
“Recent studies have documented the development of a warming deficit in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) both in observations of the current climate (Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Drijfhout et al. 2012) and in future climate simulations (Drijfhout et al. 2012; Marshall et al. 2015; Woollings et al. 2012). This ‘North Atlantic warming hole’ (NAWH) is characterized in the observed record as a region south of Greenland with negative trends in SSTs of 0.8 K century-1 (Rahmstorf et al. 2015). In fully coupled global climate model (GCM) future simulations, the NAWH is seen as a significant deficit in warming within the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (Marshall et al. 2015; Winton et al. 2013; Gervais et al. 2016).  This local reduction in future warming is communicated to the overlying atmosphere and may impact atmospheric circulation (Gervais et al. 2016), including the North Atlantic storm track (Woollings et al. 2012).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecent research has emphasized that “critical mysteries remain” in our ability to quantify or even understand carbon cycle processes as they relate to Earth’s water bodies.  Observational constraints prevent the detection of an anthropogenic signal in ocean carbon uptake trends on decadal timescales (McKinley et al., 2017).  Many new papers even contradict the IPCC-endorsed conclusion that the oceans are a net sink for CO2 emission rather than a net natural source.  
The “We Had No Idea” Terrestrial Carbon Cycle
Since the mid-1980s, the Earth’s coasts and land area have been expanding (Donchyts et al., 2016), meaning there is more land mass above sea level today than there was three decades ago.  Sea level rise has not been rapid enough to keep pace with the natural shifts in Earth’s geological processes.
Net growth in global land and soil area could significantly affect the Earth’s carbon budget, especially since “Earth’s soil is releasing roughly nine times more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than all human activities combined” (Carey et al., 2017).
Scientists frequently “discover” terrestrial locations that are new, unaccounted for sources of natural CO2 emission that “we had no idea” about.  They also routinely “discover” terrestrial surfaces that are deemed new CO2 net sinks that they never knew existed (Bastin et al., 2017).
Furthermore, scientists acknowledge that “the heterogeneous and sparsely measured terrestrial biosphere cannot be directly measured” (McKinley et al., 2017).
With new carbon sources and sinks “discovered” on a routine basis, as well as the very limited availability of direct measurements, why should there be any confidence that our land area carbon budget estimates are reliable?
Earth’s Water Bodies: “A Mechanistic Understanding of Carbon Sink Variability Requires Substantial Additional Elucidation”
Scientists have recently acknowledged that “critical mysteries remain” in ocean carbon uptake processes such that we lack a “detailed, quantitative, and mechanistic understanding of how the ocean carbon sink works” (McKinley et al., 2017).
Observational constraints do not even allow us to confirm that the alleged ocean carbon sink has been growing in recent decades due to anthropogenic emissions.

McKinley et al., 2017
“That the growth of the partial pressure of CO2 gas in the atmosphere ( pCO2 atm) drives a growing oceanic sink is consistent with our basic understanding that, as the globally averaged atmosphere-to-ocean pCO2 gradient increases, carbon accumulation in the ocean will occur at an increasing rate. This behavior has been illustrated clearly with models forced with only historically observed increases in pCO2 atm and no climate variability or change (Graven et al. 2012, Ciais et al. 2013). Nonetheless, critical mysteries remain and weigh heavily on our ability to quantify relationships between the perturbed global carbon cycle and climate change.”
“The current inability to accurately quantify the mean CO2 sink regionally or locally also suggests that present-day observational constraints are inadequate to support a detailed, quantitative, and mechanistic understanding of how the ocean carbon sink works and how it is responding to intensifying climate change. This lack of mechanistic understanding implies that our ability to model (Roy et al. 2011, Ciais et al. 2013, Frolicher et al. 2015, Randerson et al. 2015), and thus to project the future ocean carbon sink, including feedbacks caused by warming and other climate change, is seriously limited.”
“First, substantial uncertainty remains on the mean sink (∼30% of the total flux). Formally, the quantitative estimate of the 1980–1989 sink (−2.0 ± 0.7 Pg C y−1) is not statistically distinguishable from that for 2000–2009 (−2.3 ± 0.7 Pg C y−1). Reducing this uncertainty is absolutely critical to global partitioning of anthropogenic carbon sources and sinks. Each year, the Global Carbon Project (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org) estimates global sources and sinks of carbon, but because the heterogeneous and sparsely measured terrestrial biosphere cannot be directly measured, its flux is estimated by difference from estimated anthropogenic sources and the ocean sink (Le Quer´ e et al. 2015). In these budgets, land use change uncertainty is at least 50% of the mean flux, and uncertainty is growing for emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture (Ciais et al. 2013). Reduction in ocean sink uncertainty could therefore help to compensate from a global budgeting perspective.”
“The sum of the available evidence indicates that variability in the ocean carbon sink is significant and is driven primarily by physical processes of upwelling, convection, and advection. Despite evidence for a growing sink when globally integrated (Khatiwala et al. 2009, 2013; Ciais et al. 2013; DeVries 2014), this variability, combined with sparse sampling, means that it is not yet possible to directly confirm from surface observations that long-term growth in the oceanic sink is occurring.”
“Globally integrated variability fluctuates with ENSO. Yet, at regional scales outside the equatorial Pacific, these modes tend to explain less than 20% of the large-scale variance in pCO2 ocean and CO2 flux (McKinley et al. 2004, 2006; Breeden & McKinley 2016), indicating that much variance remains undescribed. Consistent with the limited amount of variance explained, the mechanistic connections of these modes are not well understood, except in the equatorial Pacific with ENSO. In the North Atlantic, a variety of studies have suggested a connection of the NAO and AMO to pCO2 ocean and CO2 fluxes, but whether these changes occur through convection or advection remains an open question. In the Southern Ocean, the SAM has been linked to pCO2 ocean and CO2 fluxes through impacts on wind-driven ventilation and subduction; however, since the mid-2000s, the clear relationship to SAM has substantially weakened (Fay & McKinley 2013, Landschutzer et al. 2015). In the North Pacific, the relative influence of the PDO ¨ as opposed to ENSO requires further study. Particularly as observations in the high latitudes have become more abundant, evidence has grown that climate modes do not adequately explain carbon cycle variability and that mechanistic understanding of carbon sink variability requires substantial additional elucidation.”
“[T]his CESM-LE analysis further illustrates that variability in CO2 flux is large and sufficient to prevent detection of anthropogenic trends in ocean carbon uptake on decadal timescales.”

Observational analysis has indicated that water bodies release more of their stored CO2 as they warm and retain more of their stored CO2 as they cool.
This has been borne out in Mauna Loa CO2 records as they relate to a “warm water year” versus a “cold water year”.

Flohn (1982).
“The recent increase of the CO2-content of air varies distinctly from year to year, rather independent from the irregular annual increase of global CO2-production from fossil fuel and cement, which has since 1973 decreased from about 4.5 percent to 2.25 percent per year (Rotty 1981). … Indeed the cool upwelling water is not only rich in (anorganic) CO2 but also in nutrients and organisms. (algae) which consume much atmospheric CO2 in organic form, thus reducing the increase in atmospehreic CO2. Conversely the warm water of tropical oceans, with SST near 27°C, is barren, thus leading to a reduction of CO2 uptake by the ocean and greater increase of the CO2. … A crude estimate of these differences is demonstrated by the fact that during the period 1958-1974, the average CO2-increase within five selective years with prevailing cool water only 0.57 ppm/a, while during five years with prevailing warm water it was 1.11 ppm/a.  Thus in a a warm water year, more than one Gt (1015 g) carbon is additionally injected into the atmosphere, in comparison to a cold water year.”

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has nonetheless claimed the oceans are a net carbon sink  rather than a net source.
Recent research analysis has challenged this conclusion, including several new (2018) published papers.
Astor et al. (2013), for example, found that 72% of the attribution for the increase in CO2 emission for the studied region arose from warming sea temperatures, and thus they concluded “the ocean is primarily a source of CO2 to the atmosphere”.
A Partial List Of Papers Indicating Earth’s Water Bodies Are A Net Source Of CO2
Below is a very non-comprehensive compilation of 12 recently-published papers that challenge the IPCC conclusion that the oceans function as a net sink for CO2.
This list would appear to support the conclusion that “critical mysteries remain” in our ability to quantify or even understand carbon cycle processes as they relate to Earth’s water bodies.

Astor et al., 2013
“Based on these observations, 72% of the increase in fCO2 sea in Cariaco Basin between 1996 and 2008 can be attributed to an increasing temperature trend of surface waters, making this the primary factor controlling fugacity at this location. … An increase/decrease of 1°C is usually followed by an increase/decrease of 16–20 matm of fCO2sea. Thus, the SST increase of 1.3°C between 1996 and 2008 accounted for 16 matm increase in fCO2sea explaining around 72% of the fCO2sea observed variation. This suggests that the changes measured in fCO2 sea were primarily the result of surface-ocean warming in Cariaco Basin. … These observations confirm that this area is a consistent source of CO2 to the atmosphere. The main process controlling the long-term changes in surface fCO2sea at CARIACO was temperature, with net community production playing a secondary role. … At the CARIACO site, the ocean is primarily a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, except during strong upwelling events.”

Ikawa et al., 2013
“We estimated that the coastal area off Bodega Bay was likely an overall source of CO2 to the atmosphere based on the following conclusions: (1) the overall CO2 flux estimated from both eddy covariance and pCO2 measurements showed a source of CO2; (2) although the relaxation period during the 2008 measurements were favorable to CO2 uptake, CO2 flux during this period was still a slight source; (3) salinity and SST were found to be good predictors of the CO2 flux for both eddy covariance and pCO2 measurements, and 99% of the historical SST and salinity data available between 1988 and 2011 fell within the range of our observations in May–June 2007, August–September 2008 and November 2010–July~2011, which indicates that our data set was representative of the annual variations in the sea state. Based on the developed relationship between pCO2, SST and salinity, the study area between 1988 and 2011 was estimated to be an annual source of CO2 of ~ 35 mol C m−2 yr−1. The peak monthly CO2 flux of ~ 7 mol C m−2 month−1 accounted for almost 30% of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface mixed layer.”

Levy et al., 2013
“Although they are key components of the surface ocean carbon budget, physical processes inducing carbon fluxes across the mixed-layer base, i.e. subduction and obduction, have received much less attention than biological processes. Using a global model analysis of the pre-industrial ocean, physical carbon fluxes are quantified and compared to the other carbon fluxes through the surface mixed-layer, i.e. air-sea CO2 gas exchange and sedimentation of biogenic material. Model-based carbon obduction and subduction are evaluated against independent data-based estimates to the extent that was possible. We find that physical fluxes of DIC [Dissolved Inorganic Carbon] are two orders of magnitude larger than the other carbon fluxes and vary over the globe at smaller spatial scale. At temperate latitudes, the subduction of DIC and to a much lesser extent (<10%) the sinking of particles maintain CO2 undersaturation, whereas DIC is obducted back to the surface in the tropical band (75%) and Southern Ocean (25%). At the global scale, these two large counterbalancing fluxes of DIC [Dissolved Inorganic Carbon] amount to +275.5 PgC y−1 for the supply by obduction and -264.5 PgC y−1 for the removal by subduction [net +11.0 PgC y−1] which is ∼ 3 to 5 times larger than previous estimates.”

Reimer et al., 2013
“The study of air-sea CO2 fluxes (FCO2) in the coastal region is needed to better understand the processes which influence the direction and magnitude of FCO2 and to constrain the global carbon budget. The near-shore region was a weak annual net source of CO2 to the atmosphere (0.043 mol CO2 m-2 y-1); where 91% of the outgassed FCO2 was contributed during the upwelling season.”

Rutherford et al., 2016
“Continental shelves account for a large proportion of global primary production, and potentially a disproportionate fraction of the carbon dioxide (CO2) flux between atmosphere and ocean. The continental shelf pump hypothesis proposes that continental shelves at high latitudes act as net sinks of atmospheric CO2. However, direct measurements on the Scotian Shelf, off eastern Canada, indicate that this shelf region acts as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere.”

Brown et al., 2015
“Complex oceanic circulation and air–sea interaction make the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETPO) a highly variable source of CO2 to the atmosphere. … Inter-annual variability was observed within the region, with the location of the western extent of the freshpool moving westwards considerably between 2010 and 2014. Previous work within this region suggest that changes in thermocline depth related to ENSO are likely to influence pCO2 within this region. The region is a net contributor to atmospheric CO2, with average sea to air fluxes (over the four years of observations) of 1.6 mmolm−2d−1, with all regions of the ETPO outgassing year-round, except the rainfall diluted Gulf of Panama/Freshpool region.”

Xue et al., 2012
“Air–sea CO2 flux computations indicated that the NYS acted as a net CO2 source with respect to the atmosphere in each season, annually releasing 0.63 ± 0.10 mol C m− 2 to the atmosphere. In combination with the CO2 efflux rate (1.68 ± 0.33 mol C m− 2 yr− 1) reported in the southern Yellow Sea (SYS), we estimate that the entire Yellow Sea, including both the NYS and the SYS, was a net CO2 source at a rate of ~ 1.49 mol C m− 2 yr− 1, annually releasing ~ 6.78 Tg C to the atmosphere (1 Tg = 1012 g).”

Sisma-Ventura et al., 2017
“Seasonal pCO2 variability was studied in the Southeast Levantine (SE-Levantine) during 2009–2015 with the aim of quantifying air–sea CO2 fluxes in this ultra-oligotrophic, warm and highly evaporative marginal sea. Mixed layer pCO2 varied significantly between 560 ± 9.0 μatm in August (summer) and 350 ± 8.7 μatm in March (winter). Comparison of pCO2 to Sea Surface Temperature (SST) yielded a strong positive correlation (n = 135, r 2 = 0.94), suggesting that the seasonal variations are the result of a thermodynamic effect on the carbonate system in seawater. Using the coupling between pCO2 and SST, we calculated the mean monthly values and the air-sea fluxes in this region. These calculations indicated that this region is a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere over an annual cycle, with an average flux of 845 ± 270 mmol C m2 y−1 (~0.98 Tg C y−1 ).”

Biswas et al., 2018
“The era of global warming and increased emission of greenhouse gases can be marked by the beginning of the industrial age. It is also true that under several conditions, natural ecosystems can be equally responsible for CO2 emission like any other anthropogenic activities which continuously release heat-trapping gases in the process of development. … East Kolkata Wetland (EKW) is an urban or peri-urban wetland located on the outskirts of the Kolkata City which performs multi-facet activities, carbon sink being one of them. The raw waste from the city is naturally treated in this wetland system, however, the aquaculture ponds situated in these wetlands which make use of this waste water for fishery is rarely studied. The present study aims to see whether the aquaculture ponds of EKW complex are acting as a source or a sink. Airwater carbon dioxide (CO2) flux was estimated for three consecutive seasons in a year and it was found that the system is acting as a CO2 source in all the three seasons.”

Wang et al., 2018
“We conducted a free‐water mass balance‐based study to address the rate of metabolism and net carbon exchange for the tidal wetland and estuarine portion of the coastal ocean and the uncertainties associated with this approach were assessed. We measured open water diurnal O2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics seasonally in a salt marsh‐estuary in Georgia, U.S.A. with a focus on the marsh‐estuary linkage associated with tidal flooding. We observed that the overall estuarine system was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere and coastal ocean and a net sink for oceanic and atmospheric O2.”

Li et al., 2018
“Our calculated CO2 areal fluxes were in the upper-level magnitude of published data, demonstrating the importance of mountainous rivers and streams as a global greenhouse gas source, and urgency for more detailed studies on CO2 degassing, to address a global data gap for these environments. …  Rivers have been widely reported to be supersaturated in carbon dioxide (CO2) with respect to the atmosphere, and are a net source of atmospheric CO2 (Butman and Raymond, 2011; Raymond et al., 2013).”

Rosentreter et al., 2018
“Although the overall status of mangroves [creeks] is net autotrophic (Alongi, 2002), mangrove sediments and waters have been shown to be a large source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to large organic matter inputs from diverse sources such as the mangrove biomass itself, other terrestrial detritus, nutrients from land, microphytobenthos, phytoplankton and the exchange of organic matter with the open ocean (Lekphet et al., 2005; Borges et al., 2005; Bouillon and Boschker, 2006; Kristensen et al., 2008). … The vast majority of mangrove CO2 gas exchange studies found surrounding waters were supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere, hence, a net source of CO2.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPeople familiar with the chaos that is weather will agree that seasonal forecasts based merely on computer simulations are highly speculative and involve much guesswork. The quality of their output leaves little to be desired.
As much as some of these forecasts may be presented with authoritative tones, in the end they all come with a fine print disclaimer concerning certainty, and so they are nothing one can take to the bank.
The average of a series of WAGs
Even the most powerful super-computers using conventional simulations struggle to predict the weather 10 days out, let alone what an entire a winter will be like in terms of temperature and precipitation. The simulations used by the US weather agencies, for example, simply perform a number of data crunching runs — each using different start conditions — to generate  a set of scenarios (i.e. wild-ass guesses) and then average them out to create an “ensemble”. Under the bottom line, the ensemble is based on a set of wild ass guesses, and so is correspondingly unreliable.
Woefully uncertain
Not surprisingly, Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) also finds that the ensembles leave very little to be desired and point out that the seasonal forecasts issued by weather agencies such as the NOAA are hugely uncertain, and that clearly the computer simulation methodology is in dire need of improvement.
Even farmers seem to have greater success.
So what can be done to improve forecasting performance?
The FAZ writes that a whole new methodology has been developed by German scientists and that this new methodology promises to vastly improve seasonal forecasts. The FAZ writes that earlier this year a study by the University of Hamburg was published in the Geophysical Research Letters. The press release announced: “Possible for the first time: reliable three-month forecasts for European winters“.
80% winter season accuracy

According to the FAZ, oceanographer Dr. Mikhail Dobrynin of the Hamburg University Institute of Oceanography, Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability and his colleagues have developed a method that works with 80% success rate. Instead of solely relying on a super computer crunching data using a variety of start conditions and then averaging them out, Dobrynin says their method relies also on “teleconnections”, i.e. finding “signals amid the chaos“.
The FAZ reports that for winter forecasts, Dr. Dobrynin has identified four factors: “the snow depth in Siberia, Arctic polar vortex, extent of Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic ocean temperature”, which allow “the path of certain air masses going to Europe to be predicted”. The most critical of these is the snow cover over Siberia in fall.

The NAO index is one key factor in seasonal winter forecasts for Europe. Source: Geophysical Research Letters.
The scientists say that conditions in different geographical regions over the Atlantic “can act as a switch that steers winter weather in Europe” and that focusing on how these interact and behave can allow greatly improved forecasting.
According to the conclusion of the study, the method shows vastly improved performance:

For the real forecast test from 2001 to 2017 the prediction skill of the winter NAO is increased from 0.42 for the full ensemble mean to 0.86 for the subsampled ensemble mean. As a result of a better representation of the winter NAO, the prediction skill for the winter surface temperature, total precipitation, and SLP is improved for considerable parts of the NH.”

NOAA forecasts “hardly better” than guessing
The FAZ writes that “without considering teleconnections, winter in Europe has been virtually unpredictable”. 
Dr. Mikhail Dobrynin added that results of forecasts made by the NOAA “were hardly better” than if they had guessed. The new method should thus improve the winter season forecasts considerably. However, he warns that the uncertainty will always exist and we must remain wary of any predictions dealing with seasonal weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) posted a video of prominent German geologist Dr. Stefan Kröpelin, who in a presentation late last year in Munich called the notion of CO2-induced climate tipping points scientifically outlandish.
He also called the prospect of the Sahara spreading into Europe preposterous. 
EIKE recently wrote an article on the presentation and posted the presentation (in German). The article follows in English (headings added):
==========================================
The Green Past of the Sahara
Stefan Kröpelin geographer and geologist who, after his training at the Free University of Berlin, has been working at the Institute for Prehistory and Early History in Cologne since 1995. He is one of the most renowned expedition researchers in the field of “Climate, Cultural, and Landscape Change in Arid Africa,” and is best known for his scientific travels to Sudan and Chad. In his career he has undertaken about 60 expeditions, which have been presented in numerous popular science TV programs.
Sahara once a paradise
In his lecture, Dr. Kröpelin first gave an overview of the Eastern Sahara located in Sudan, Chad, Libya and Egypt. The region is the driest place on planet Earth today. But thanks to natural climate change over the millennia, this has not always been the case. On the contrary: if you think of the Hungarian researcher László Almásy, known from the book and film “The English Patient”, who discovered “swimmers” on cave paintings in Eastern Sahara as early as the 1930s, you know that the area was once a paradise.
Explorer Kröpelin was able to confirm Almásy’s assumptions through his work – and even add an almost unbelievable fact.
Higher temperatures 7500 years ago
The paradisiacal humid conditions in the east of the Sahara prevailed between about 8,500 and 5,300 B.C., i.e. after the last Ice Age and at the beginning of the Neolithic, when higher temperatures led to frequent rainfalls, and thus raised the groundwater level considerably, and allowed surface waters and rich vegetation.
As a result of the gradual drying up of the region over the last 7,000 years, the human inhabitants migrated south to present-day Sudan or later to Egypt, where they founded the Earth’s first advanced culture on the Nile with its fertile floods.

The slow drying out of the Sahara was caused by a successive cooling of the climate, analogous to the formation of savannahs through warming. Interestingly, today’s Sahara desert does not have the dimensions it had during the maximum of the last ice age about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the desert extended hundreds of kilometres further south into today’s Sahel zone.
Lake sediment, cave paintings unlock secrets of the past
How could Dr. Kröpelin reconstruct climate events in North Africa over the millennia? What natural climate indicators does the region offer?
One of the best sources of climate data are the deposits at the bottom of the largest lake in the Sahara, Lake Yoa in the oasis of Ounianga in north-eastern Chad, from which as much water evaporates every day as the city of Cologne consumes every day.
The loss is compensated by the abundant fossil groundwater resources. But it is not only hidden data deep in the ground that are suitable for precisely reconstructing the past of the climate in the last decades – the human settlement of the region and its legacies are also a reliable climate indicator. Particularly impressive in this context are the aforementioned cave paintings, which were able to withstand the sandstorms and the heat surprisingly well. These prehistoric works of art were not made in a short time, but over thousands of years. The depicted objects like the floating people or cattle herds stand for different phases of the colonization.
“Tipping Point” catastrophe theory contradicted

The proven gradualness of climate change at that time contradicts the “Tipping Point” catastrophe theory, which predicts a “climate collapse” with drastic changes in the environment in only one human generation. In fact, Kröpelin’s research shows that climate change in the Sahara has been so slow that people have hardly noticed anything about it during their lifetime.
Stefan Kröpelin also refers in this context to the political use of the current climate catastrophe theory, which is even misused for mass immigration policy.
The exponential increase in the world population over the next 50 years is the real problem facing our civilization.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLong-term data show that Germany’s summers have gotten wetter over the past three decades, thus contradicting widespread media claims to increasing droughts over Central Europe.
Retired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls presents an analysis of Germany’s hot and dry summer this year at The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).
This summer produced a number of blaring headlines which claimed the unusually warm and dry weather was an undeniable sign of things to come. Climate experts warn that summers in Germany will certainly get hotter and droughts will become increasingly common, along with episodes of heavy rainfall accompanied by destructive high water.
According Puls:
Climate alarmists and the compliant media have now predicted hot times and droughts – based a single summer – for the next 100 years and beyond [8]”
No trend towards droughts
However, the veteran meteorologist points out that weather services around the world and even the IPCC have yet to detect any real trends, especially for Central Europe, namely Germany:
Using data from the German DWD national weather service, a plot of summer precipitation in millimeters for Germany was and follows:
&amp;lt;img class=”alignnone size-medium wp-image-48871″ src=”https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Abb.RR_.KÄMPFE-640×384.png” alt=”” width=”640″ height=”384″ /&amp;gt;
Summer precipitation in Germany: June, July andAugust 1881-2018.
For the summer of 2018, it is estimated that Germany will see a mean precipitation of 128 mm, which will be slightly above the 124 mm record low seen way back in 1911. Summer precipitation has in fact been trending upwards over the past 30 years.

The above chart shows that there has been no trend in precipitation for Germany since systematic measurements began in 1881.
Early summer a bit wetter
And when analyzing the data for the period known as early summer (May, June , July), then we see that there has been a slight long term increase in precipitation for Germany since 1881:
&amp;lt;img class=”alignnone size-medium wp-image-48872″ src=”https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Abb.RR_.Puls_-640×452.jpg” alt=”” width=”640″ height=”452″ srcset=”https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Abb.RR_.Puls_-640×452.jpg 640w, https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Abb.RR_.Puls_-768×543.jpg 768w, https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Abb.RR_.Puls_-1024×724.jpg 1024w” sizes=”(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px” /&amp;gt;
May-June-July precipitation in Germany. Chart by Klaus-Eckart Puls.
Klaus-Eckart Puls also cites the IPCC concerning global trends for drought: no trend [10]. According to the the IPCC:
There is low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness“.
This summer Germany’s extreme drought intensity was more regional than national. Southern Germany for example, saw less extreme drought conditions, according to the data from the DWD.
To the south in Austria, the summer was also dry, but was only came in the Top 20 driest, according to the Austrian ZAMG national weather service.
In the Austria-wide evaluation (up to August 29, 2018) there was 20 to 25 percent less precipitation than the long-term average. This puts the result among the 20 driest summers in the since measurements began. […] At the top is undisputedly the summer of 1873 with 32 percent less precipitation than average.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterImpressive Cold Grips As Planet Continues Its Warming Pause
By SnowFan
(Translated/summarized by P Gosselin)
The continuing global cooling and the start of the grand minimum require new targets in climate policy and a complete withdrawal from the previous warming madness.
After a complete failure by the IPCC climate models and the crazy assignment of CO2 as a pollutant, scientific reason must once again return to the climate discussion.
Neither did the sea ice in the Arctic disappear in the summer of 2016 as it was often predicted by nutty scientists (even by NASA, who wrote that Arctic summers would be ice-free by 2013), nor have global temperatures risen by an significance over the past 20 years, thus contradicting the projections of IPCC models.

The chart above depicts in orange the range of the IPCC projections for the deviation of global mean temperature since 1990. The mean IPCC projection was +0.75°C of warming. Satellite measurements by UAH and RSS (blue line) show only an increase of 0.34°C. The models have been completely wrong. Source: When will “The Pause” in global temperature return? 
Moreover, the ice mass at both poles and Greenland have grown over the past years. Also the facts surrounding the increasingly cooler Antarctic are presented by a recent study.
An extreme record value of almost -100°C was measured in 2004, but kept quiet in order not to dísturb the quasi religious fairy tale of manmade “global warming”.

This is also one reason why sea level rise has increased less than originally projected and why the 1988 prophesy that all 1196 Maldives islands would sink underwater within 30 years have turned out to be preposterous. Not a single island has gone under!
“Missed It By That Much”
On September 26, 1988, “experts” announced all of the 1196 Maldives islands would be underwater. In 2018 – 30 years later – we see this has ended up being an epic blunder.

Source: Real Climate
In fact, one recent paper found, for example, that the South Sea Tuvalu islands have grown, the shaming climate scientists!
Time for competent and honest institutions
The time has arrived where government offices, authorities, weather services, media headquarters and educational institutes become staffed by educated and independent persons who are able to see the reality in the interrelationships of weather and climate and report them in an unfalsified manner.
It’s the sun, water, clouds, vapor, ice, snow that determined the weather of our planet, and not life-sustaining trace gas CO2, which makes up only 0.04%of our atmosphere.
Anyone who vilifies trace gas CO2 as a pollutant conducts him/herself in a manner that is hostile to life and is thus not suited to be a scientist, teacher, professor, journalist or politician!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe year 2018 could mark the beginning of the end of climate change alarmist reporting.  Projections of catastrophic melting of the ice sheets and sea level rise swallowing up the Earth’s coasts are increasingly undermined by observations. 

Extensive glacier and ice sheet melt resulting in an accelerated sea level rise threatening the world’s population centers living along the coasts is indeed the most legitimate threat posed by a global-scale warming trend.
Alarming sea level rise predictions abound.   Several meters of sea level rise due to catastrophic melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been predicted based on anthropogenic CO2 emissions scenarios.
For example, claims that we shall experience 260 centimeters (2.6 meters) of global sea level rise by 2100 unless we dramatically curtail our fossil fuel consumption have been published by authors like Dr. Michael Mann and Dr. Richard Alley (Garner et al. 2017).  These same authors even suggest seas will rise by 17.5 meters in the next 180 years (Mörner et al., 2018).

Image Source: Mörner et al., 2018
Despite the hackneyed practice of reporting “staggering” ice sheet melt for both Greenland and Antarctica in recent decades, the two polar ice sheets combined to add just 1.5 centimeters to sea level rise between 1958 and 2014 (graph from Frederikse et al., 2018) as global sea levels only rose by “1.5 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 over 1958–2014 (1σ)” or “1.3 ± 0.1 mm yr−1 for the sum of contributors”.
That’s about 7.8 centimeters (3.1 inches) of global sea level change in 56 years.
Even more significantly, satellite observations all across the globe show that the coasts of islands and sandy beaches and continents have not only not been shrinking for the last several decades, they’ve been stable to growing on net.  Along the world’s coasts, there is today more land area above sea level than there was in the mid-1980s (Donchyts et al., 2016), leaving scientists “surprised”.
“We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,” said Dr Baart.  “We’re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.”  (BBC press release for Donchyts et al., 2016)
Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner – a world-renown sea level expert who headed the Department of Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics at Stockholm University – and 3 other co-authors have concluded that sea level rise projections of 2.6 m by 2100 and 17.5 m by 2300 are “deeply flawed” and “not rooted in facts” (Mörner et al., 2018).
What follows is a very abbreviated summary of the dozens of alarmism-quelling papers published in 2018 pertaining to ice sheet melt, sea level rise, and coastal expansion.

Mörner et al., 2018
Estimating Future Sea Level Changes, Assessing Coastal
Hazards, Avoiding Misguiding Exaggerations, and
Recommending Present Coastal Management
“Tide-gauges offer records of the relative changes in sea level. Out of a total of about 2300 stations (PSMSL), “a global set of ~300 tide gauges that serves as the backbone of the global in situ sea level network” in the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS). There is no objective, straightforward solution for estimating a global mean value. The University of Colorado chose 184 global tide-gauge records. Their rate of distribution has a marked peak in the zone from ±0.0 to +2.0 mm/yr with a mean value at +1.14 mm/yr. Because the majority of stations used include a component of regional subsidence and local sediment compaction, the true mean sea level value should be <+1.14 mm/yr. … Satellite altimetry is a new and important tool, which reconstructs the entire ocean surface changes. But nowhere do the measurements agree with coastal observations. Satellite altimetry exceeds tide-gauge records by about 300%. There have even been accusations of data manipulation [Mörner, 2018].”
“Garner et al. (2017) propose SLR of up to 2.6 m by 2100, 10.5 m by 2200, and 17.5 m by 2300 (Fig. 1). These SLRs are far greater than those that occurred during catastrophic melting of immense ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene, so the question arises, where will all the water come from to produce these very large SLRs? Melting of small, temperate, alpine glaciers wouldn’t produce anywhere near the SLRs projected by Garner et al., so the only possible sources of water are the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. The projections of Garner et al. of SLR of 7–8 m per century would require about seven times the end of the Pleistocene SLR when immense ice sheets were collapsing under warming of up to 20 °F in less than a century. To get these huge SLRs would require melting of an immense amount of ice from the Antarctic ice sheet. The average winter temperature in Antarctica is about –55 °F and temperatures have reached as low as 135 °F, so any significant melting of the Antarctic ice sheet would require 55° + 32° = 87 °F of warming just to get to the freezing point plus another 10 degrees or so to melt much ice. So Antarctica would have to warm up by 90–100 °F to melt enough ice to substantially raise sea level.”
“Hazard prediction is important, but the essence of science is the testing of predictions by comparison with observational facts. Without that validation, predictions are really just idle speculations. The future sea level values given by Garner et al. [2017] are deeply flawed and therefore misleading for coastal planning. They must be rejected as nonsense. Sea level research has its own well established means of recording past and present sea level changes and from those data to estimate likely sea level changes in the future. There are also physical frames to consider, some of which are absolute and must not be violated. … [T]he values given by Garner et al. [2017] violate not only physical laws but also accepted scientific knowledge of glaciology. Therefore, their values must not be considered in coastal planning. We also question the reviewing process.”
“Is Greenland warming and the ice sheet melting away? Chylek et al. [2004] analyzed temperature histories of coastal stations in southern and central Greenland having almost uninterrupted temperature records between 1950 and 2000 and found that coastal Greenland’s peak temperatures occurred between 1930 and 1940, after which subsequent decrease in temperature was so substantial and sustained that current coastal temperatures “are about 1°C below their 1940 values.” At the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2.2 °C per decade since the beginning of measurements in 1987. Two weather stations, Godthab Nuu and Angmagssalik, on opposite coasts of Greenland, have the longest records, dating back more than a century. Both show similar annual temperature patterns–strong warming in the 1920 and 1930s followed by cooling from 1950 to 1980 and warming from 1980 to 2005. The significance of these recent temperature records is that they show that temperatures in the past several decades have not exceeded those of the 1930s and Greenland temperatures have fluctuated normally in step with global temperatures changes [Easterbrook, 2016].”
“Satellite and surface temperature records and sea surface temperatures show that both the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are cooling, not warming. Satellite and surface temperature measurements show that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is cooling, not warming, and glacial ice is increasing, not melting. Satellite and surface temperature measurements of the southern polar area show no warming over the past 37 years. Growth of the Antarctic ice sheets means sea level rise is not being caused by melting of polar ice and, in fact, is slightly lowering the rate of rise. Satellite Antarctic temperature records show 0.02 °C/decade cooling since 1979. The Southern Ocean around Antarctica has been getting sharply colder since 2006. Antarctic sea ice is increasing, reaching all-time highs. Surface temperatures at 13 stations show the Antarctic Peninsula has been sharply cooling since 2000. This indicates that the hypothetical “enhanced Antarctic Ice Sheet contribution” of Garner et al. [2017] is a serious mistake (Fig. 1) not anchored in facts.”



2. Ice melt from Greenland, Antarctica added just 1.5 cm to sea levels since 1958 
“For the first time, it is shown that for most basins the reconstructed sea level trend and acceleration can be explained by the sum of contributors, as well as a large part of the decadal variability. The global-mean sea level reconstruction shows a trend of 1.5 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 over 1958–2014 (1σ), compared to 1.3 ± 0.1 mm yr−1for the sum of contributors.” (Frederikse et al.,2018)

3. Ice mass gains in the rapidly-cooling Antarctic Peninsula since 2009  
“Two small glaciers on James Ross Island, the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, experienced surface mass gain between 2009 and 2015 as revealed by field measurements. A positive cumulative surface mass balance of 0.57 ± 0.67 and 0.11 ± 0.37 m w.e. was observed during the 2009–2015 period on Whisky Glacier and Davies Dome, respectively. …  Ambrožová and Láska (2016) reported a significant decrease (0.03–0.15°C a−1 [-0.3 to -1.5°C per decade]) in the temperature along the AP [Antarctic Peninsula] over the 2005–15 period with the most prominent cooling at the Bibby Hill station on JRI [James Ross Island]. … The cumulative mass gain of the glaciers around the northern AP [Antarctic Peninsula] indicates a regional change from a predominantly negative surface mass balance in the first decade of the 21st century to a positive balance over the 2009–15 period. The change in the glacier mass balance follows a significant decrease in the warming rates reported from the northern AP [Antarctic Peninsula] since the end of the 20th century. The mass gain is also consistent with the regional trend of climate cooling on the eastern side of the AP [Antarctic Peninsula].”   (Engel et al., 2018)

4. Collapse of Larsen C glaciers would add 0.25 to 0.42 of a cm to sea levels
“Here we apply numerical ice-sheet models of varying complexity to show that the centennial sea-level commitment of Larsen C embayment glaciers following immediate shelf collapse is low ( < 2.5 mm to 2100,  < 4.2 mm to 2300) [0.25 to 0.42 of a cm added to sea levels by 2100/2300 with Larsen C collapse]. Despite its large size, Larsen C does not provide strong buttressing forces to upstream basins and its collapse does not result in large additional discharge from its tributary glaciers in any of our model scenarios. In contrast, the response of inland glaciers to a collapse of the George VI Ice Shelf may add up to 8mm to global sea levels by 2100 and 22mm by 2300 [0.8 cm to 2.2 cm] due in part to the mechanism of marine ice sheet instability. Our results demonstrate the varying and relative importance to sea level of the large Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves considered to present a risk of collapse.” (Schannwell et al., 2018)
5. East Antarctica is gaining mass – it takes “millions of years” for “even partial retreat” 
“The East Antarctic ice sheet may be gaining mass in the current, warming climate. The palaeoclimate record shows, however, that it has retreated during previous episodes of prolonged warmth. … In terms of immediate sea-level rise, it is reassuring that it seems to require prolonged periods of lasting hundreds of thousands to millions of years to induce even partial retreat.” (Nature Geoscience, 2018)
6. No glacier-melt trend for Antarctica’s largest sea level rise contributor in 70 years
“Pine Island Glacier is the largest current Antarctic contributor to sea level rise. Its ice loss has substantially increased over the last 25 years through thinning, acceleration and grounding line retreat. However, the calving line positions of the stabilizing ice shelf did not show any trend within the observational record (last 70 years) until calving in 2015 led to unprecedented retreat and changed alignment of the calving front. … Despite the thinning and flow acceleration of PIG [Pine Island Glacier], and sustained, rapid thinning of the ice shelf over at least the past 25 years the position of the ice front had not shown any clear trend over 68 years of observations prior to 2015 (Bindschadler, 2002;MacGregor et al., 2012;Rignot, 2002).”  (Arndt et al., 2018)
7. East Antarctica gaining mass…projections due to ice sheet melt “overestimated”
“East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) mass balance is largely driven by snowfall. Recently, increased snowfall in Queen Maud Land led to years of EAIS mass gain. It is difficult to determine whether these years of enhanced snowfall are anomalous or part of a longer-term trend, reducing our ability to assess the mitigating impact of snowfall on sea-level rise. We determine that the recent snowfall increases in western Queen Maud Land (QML) are part of a long-term trend (+5.2±3.7% decade-1) and are unprecedented over the past two millennia. Warming between 1998 and 2016 is significant and rapid (+1.1±0.7 °C decade-1). Using these observations, we determine that the current accumulation and temperature increases in QML from an ensemble of global climate simulations are too low, which suggests that projections of the QML [Queen Maud Land] contribution to sea-level rise are potentially overestimated with a reduced mitigating impact of enhanced snowfall in a warming world.”  (Medley et al., 2018)
8. Globally, 73.1% of island coasts are stable, 15.5% are growing, and 11.4% are shrinking 
“This review first confirms that over the past decades to century, atoll islands exhibited no widespread sign of physical destabilization by sea-level rise. The global sample considered in this paper, which includes 30 atolls and 709 islands, reveals that atolls did not lose land area, and that 73.1% of islands were stable in land area, including most settled islands, while 15.5% of islands increased and 11.4% decreased in size. Atoll and island areal stability can therefore be considered as a global trend. Importantly, islands located in ocean regions affected by rapid sea-level rise showed neither contraction nor marked shoreline retreat, which indicates that they may not be affected yet by the presumably negative, that is, erosive, impact of sea-level rise. .. These results show that atoll and island areal stability is a global trend, whatever the rate of sea-level rise. Tuvaluan atolls affected by rapid sea-level rise (5.1 mm/yr; Becker et al., 2012) did not exhibit a distinct behavior compared to atolls located in areas showing lower sea-level rise rates, for example, the Federated States of Micronesia or Tuamotu atolls.”  (Duvat et al., 2018)
9. Since 1984, 48% of the globe’s shorelines have been stable, 28% are growing, and 24% are shrinking
“The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984–2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24% of the world’s sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28% are accreting and 48% are stable. …. Erosion rates exceed 5 m/yr along 4% of the sandy shoreline and are greater than 10 m/yr for 2% of the global sandy shoreline. On the other hand, about 8% of the world’s sandy beaches experience significant accretion (>3 m/yr), while 6% (3%) are accreting more than 5 m/yr (10 m/yr). … Taking a continental perspective, Australia and Africa are the only continents for which net erosion (−0.20 m/yr and −0.07 m/yr respectively) is found, with all other continents showing net accretion.”  (Luijendijk et al., 2018)

10. “Despite sea-level rise” there has been a “land area increase in eight of nine atolls” since 1971
“We specifically examine spatial differences in island behaviour, of all 101 islands in Tuvalu, over the past four decades (1971–2014), a period in which local sea level has risen at twice the global average (Supplementary Note 2). Surprisingly, we show that all islands have changed and that the dominant mode of change has been island expansion, which has increased the land area of the nation. … Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average [<2 mm/yr-1] (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm.yr−1). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls.”  (Kench et al., 2018)

11. Bangladesh coastal land area has expanded by 7.9 km2 per year during 1985-2015
“This paper draws upon the application of GIS and remote sensing techniques to investigate the dynamic nature and management aspects of land in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. … This research reveals that the rate of accretion [coastal land growth] in the study area is slightly higher than the rate of erosion. Overall land dynamics indicate a net gain of 237 km2 (7.9 km2annual average) of land in the area for the whole period from 1985 to 2015.”  (Ahmed et al., 2018)
12. 54% of ‘vulnerable’ SW Pacific Islands studied had shorelines that expanded from 2005-2015
“Summary: Atoll islands are low-lying accumulations of reef-derived sediment that provide the only habitable land in Tuvalu, and are considered vulnerable to the myriad possible impacts of climate change, especially sea-level rise. This study examines the shoreline change of twenty-eight islands in Funafuti Atoll between 2005 and 2015 … Most of the islands remained stable, experiencing slight accretion or erosion or a combination of both over time. The total net land area of the islands increased by 1.55 ha (0.55%) between 2005 and 2010, and it has decreased by 1.90 ha (0.68%) between 2010 and 2015, resulting in a net decrease by 0.35 ha (0.13%). … Results indicate a 0.13% (0.35 ha) decrease in net island area over the study time period, with 13 islands decreasing in area and 15 islands increasing in area.  Substantial decreases in island area occurred on the islands of Fuagea, Tefala and Vasafua, which coincides with the timing of Cyclone Pam in March, 2015.”  (Hisabayashi et al., 2018 )

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo keep informed on how the Atlantic hurricane season is developing, I find that hurricane expert Philip Klotzbach of the Colorado State University does a good job at that at Twitter.
A warmer planet does not mean more hurricanes
As the peak of the hurricane season approaches (September) he recently tweeted below average activity was forecast for the next two weeks:

Below-average Atlantic #hurricane activity predicted for the next two weeks (August 16-29) by @ColoradoStateU forecast team:https://t.co/xXojKUE6xE pic.twitter.com/DorPmJkoXC
— Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) August 16, 2018

That’s good news, especially in light of the fact that global warming experts, who seem not to understand how hurricanes develop, warned that these Atlantic cyclones would keep getting more frequent and stronger. Data suggest this has been hardly the case.
Detrimental wind shear, cool sea surface temperatures
So what’s been keeping the lid on hurricanes in the tropical Atlantic development zone this year?
Klotzbach mainly points to two 2 factors: sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and vertical wind shear. A couple of days ago he tweeted that wind shear in the region has been “above average” and that this tends to “reduce hurricane activity”:

Latest output from the Climate Forecast System model calls for above-average vertical wind shear in the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic in September – the climatological peak of the Atlantic #hurricane season.  Strong shear reduces hurricane activity. @TropicalTidbits pic.twitter.com/sBt9mAmGIh
— Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) August 14, 2018

Here Klotzbach even tweeted that vertical wind shear was “detrimental for hurricane formation.”
Shear 5th strongest since 1980

On August 10, the Colorado State University hurricane expert tweeted that wind shear had been at the 5th strongest in close to 40 years:

30-day-averaged shear in the Caribbean (10-20°N, 90-60°W) is the 5th strongest on record (since 1980).  Since 1980, the only years with stronger shear from July 10 – August 8 were: 1986, 1987, 1997 and 2015.  All of these were below-average Atlantic #hurricane seasons. pic.twitter.com/hm4bIdgVWK
— Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) August 10, 2018

Mid August Tropical Atlantic surface temps cool
Although the tropical Atlantic surface has warmed up a bit, sea surface temperatures still remain cool there, which, according to Klotzbach, “for mid August are the coldest since 1994” and thus tend to suppress hurricane formation:

While there has been some recent anomalous warming, tropical Atlantic (10-20°N, 60-20°W) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are still the coldest for mid August since 1994.  Cooler tropical Atlantic SSTs tend to suppress #hurricane formation. pic.twitter.com/6KJJgDtfjG
— Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) August 13, 2018

Unfavorable peak season hurricane formation conditions 
Klotzbach sums up the forecast for the upcoming peak season in his tweet accompanying the first diagram above.
Latest output from the Climate Forecast System model calls for above-average vertical wind shear in the Caribbean and tropical Atlantic in September – the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Strong shear reduces hurricane activity.”
Good news. But when it comes to weather, things can turn on a dime.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMojib Latif: three statements, three times totally off the mark
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
At the end of the year, it’s usual to take a look back. That’s what we wish to do at this blog.
Leading German climate scientist Mojib Latif made three historical statements in 2012 that are worth remembering. How much truth was there in his statements of that time?
STATEMENT 1:
Mojib Latif on December 4, 2012 in the talkshow “Pelzig hält sich”:
I want to say one thing again. I would be glad if it were the sun. Then we really could do nothing. Yes. But it is not that. If you look at the sun’s radiation, the sun has been weaker for 50 years. And how is a weakening sun supposed to cause massive warming?”
False. The sun has actually become stronger in the last 50 years when one considers the total solar irradiance (TSI – white curve in the diagram), which also includes cosmic rays and the solar magnetic field.

Figure: Development of solar activity over the past 400 years. White curve shows total solar irradiance (TSI), yellow peaks mark sunspots. Source:    PAGES2K website, downloaded in 2016.
———–
STATEMENT 2:
Mojib Latif on December 4, 2012, in the talkshow “Pelzig hält sich“:
Yes, you can quantify everything. That is, of course, a plain lie if it is claimed that we do not take the sun into account. There is no climate model that does not take the sun into account. I do not think we are fools. This somehow gives the impression that we are the biggest idiots of all time. It’s not like that.”
False, Mr. Latif. A look at the radiation drive in the 5th IPCC Climate Report is enough to see that the sun plays almost no role in the models. CO2: 1.68 W/m2, sun: 0.05 W/m2. The sun is made practically as a non-factor in this.

Figure: Radiation as a driver among the individual climate factors according to the 5th IPCC report. The sun plays practically no role in the IPCC.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




STATEMENT 3:
Mojib Latif in an interview with the Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung (NOZ) on September 12, 2012:
NOZ: Mr. Latif, does the sun more likely to contribute to global warming or the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, CO2?
LATIF: It’s a mix of both. It is clear that man has been responsible for more than half of the rise in temperature since the beginning of industrialization.”
Just before that in the Austrian daily Austrian daily ‘Die Presse‘ (DP) on February 9, 2012, he said the following:
DIE PRESSE: Back to the previous warming, 0.8 degrees for 100 years. For [Fritz] Vahrenholt, half comes from the sun. And at the IPCC everything comes from CO2?
LATIF: No, the IPCC never said that. It is very careful and says that about half of the warming is anthropogenic.
DIE PRESSE: Then it says the same as Vahrenholt?
LATIF: Yes, that’s what drives me crazy: An exaggerated threat is built up and then torn up with great relish.”
Again Latif is wrong. Here it’s enough to just look at the Special report of the IPCC concerning the 1.5°C target:
Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, the observed mean global surface temperature in the decade 2006-2015 was 0.87 °C (probably between 0.75 °C and 0.99 °C) higher than the average for the period 1850-1900 (very high confidence).
Estimated anthropogenic global warming is consistent with the extent of observed warming within ±20% (likely range).”
In other words: According to the IPCC, the total warming observed over the last 150 years is anthropogenic.
———–
Three Latif statements, three times over the line.
Is Latif’s criticism of the Die kalte Sonne book still valid under these circumstances? We would like to talk to Mojib Latif about it personally. After his earlier refusal, is he now perhaps ready for discussion? We hope for good climatic developments in 2019.
We wish all Die kalte Sonne blog readers – and of course Mr. Latif – a Happy New Year!

Guest post by Kirye in Tokyo
An analysis of the rural-sited Japanese weather stations used by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows there’s been no warming at all over the the past 2 decades or more.
Strangely many of these stations, which are practically unimpacted by data-corruptive urban sprawl, are no longer used by NASA.
For example, NASA quit using the rural Fukaura station back in 1990. Up to that point Fukaura was cooling notably. What follows is the NASA chart for Fukaura:

Fukaura showed cooling before NASA dropped the station in 1990. Image: NASA
The same, for example, is true for Nikko.
NASA dropped rural Japanese stations
What follows below is a list of the rural stations I examined, which have a Brightness Index (BI) of 10 or less. The far right column shows the period they were used by NASA.

Source: NASA.
My earlier enquiries about stations sent to NASA via the Internet went without any answer. Perhaps they don’t reply to foreign requests. I don’t know.
The next chart below is the geographical plot of these rural sited stations. As you see they are all well scattered across the country:

Google Earth map showing location of the rural stations.
JMA data in fact show no warming
What follows below are temperature charts for each station, using the data from the JMA, arranged in more or less alphabetical order. On some charts I plotted more than one station.
Over 90% of rural stations show cooling or no trend
Of the 24 stations plotted, 22 show no change or some modest cooling over the past two or more decades – that’s more than 90%. Only two stations show some warming, but only a very modest amount.

Japan shows no warming over past 2 decades
What follows next is the chart for all of Japan for the last 20 years, using data from the JMA:

As the chart above shows, using JMA data, the whole country of Japan shows no warming over the past two decades.
Urban environment
Tony Heller at Real Science here shows the environment that many Japanese weather stations – like the ones NASA use – find themselves having to deal with. 
But as the temperature chart for all of Japan mentioned above shows, even the urban heat island effect still is unable to produce warming over the past 20 years. Without the cities one could rightfully argue there would be a cooling trend.

Hit-tip: a reader from Switzerland
Little wonder!
Here’s what wind energy opposition organization Linth Gegenwind (Linth Headwind) shows what the otherwise idyllic Swiss landscape would end looking like by 2040 if the projects went ahead.






An artist’s depiction of what the Linth region would look like by 2040 if proposed wind projects were approved. Sanity appears to have returned. Image: Linth Gegenwind.
Wind energy is losing its luster for many reasons, but among them is the obvious industrial blight to the landscape they cause.
Wind turbines in Bilten rejected
In the latest step to protect the landscape from industrialization, Swiss SRF public broadcasting here reported on November 6 that the up to 5 controversial wind turbines, which had been planned to be erected in the middle of a “densely residential area”, were rejected on the grounds they would lead to “landscape blighting”.

The SRF quotes local Glarner government councilman Kaspar Becker:
We have come to the conclusion that it is not necessarily clever to pursue such things in densely populated areas.”
In response, wind energy opposition site Linth Gegenwind writes: “Common sense has prevailed!”
Honegg-Oberfeld wind park flat out rejected
Also recently the Swiss online appenzell24.ch has reported that the proposed Honegg-Oberfeld wind park was outright rejected.
On November 6, 2018, Appenzell24 wrote the local commission decided against the Honegg-Oberfeld district as a wind power location. Thus no wind farm can be built there.
On this, wind energy protest organization Linth Gegenwind writes at its website:
The reason is, above all, protection of the landscape. During the consultation process there were 60 in favor and 500 against the planned wind farm. Opponents also include Appenzell Ausserrhoden, St. Gallen, the state of Vorarlberg and the community presidents’ conference Ausserrhoden.”
According to the Appenzell24.ch, the 5 wind turbines with a hub height of 135 meters, would have resulted in “massive disadvantages for the landscape’s appearance”, according to opponents.

Data source. Danish Meteorological Institute. Chart source: Kirye.
Today, there’s not a climate ambulance chaser to be found in the Arctic. Some ten years ago, a number of leading experts predicted the summertime Arctic would be ice free by now. Boy, did they goof!
Here’s a chart by Kirye showing a year-by-year plot:

Note that over the past decade the trend has been steady, even somewhat upward.
Once reason Arctic ice is expanding is likely in part due to the cold Atlantic, especially the North Atlantic.

AMM second lowest since 1948
Hurricane expert Philip Klotzbach at Twitter presents a chart showing the standardized AMM for the past July: it shows this year to be rather astonishing:

AMM Index 2nd lowest since 1948. Chart: Philip Klotzbach.
Klotzbach writes:
This July’s Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) index value was the 2nd lowest July value on record (since 1948), trailing only 1972. A negative AMM tends to be associated with colder tropical N Atlantic SSTs, higher sea level pressures and less active Atlantic #hurricane seasons.”

Record low relative tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures
Moreover, days ago Klotzbach also presented another chart depicting July, 2018, relative sea surface temperatures for the Tropical Atlantic (10°N – 25°N):

Chart: Philip Klotzbach.
As the chart shows, in July they reached a record low since measurements began in 1948. In fact there’s never been such a steep drop over an 8-year period.
The cold temperatures will serve to significantly dampen hurricane activity this year, Klotzbach points out.
Michael Mann hyperventilating, expert hints
Lately there’s also been quite a bit of (hysterical, climate-ambulance chasing) talk about the regional heat waves and “extreme” weather that have hit parts of the northern hemisphere. Obviously they’ve been ignoring the huge cold developments at places they used to like focusing on.
At PBS activist/alarmist scientist Michael Mann attributes it to manmade climate change. However, expert meteorologist Dr. Ryan Maue differs, tweeting here that the factor behind it all hasn’t been behaving unusual at all:
Interesting, climate scientist Michael Mann attributes the last month of extreme weather to a “slow”, “more wild” and “undulating” jet stream. But that’s typical of “summer” in Northern Hemisphere regardless of climate change.
Maue explains:
Typically this jet stream theory is related to Arctic changes e.g. sea ice depletion. Mixed answers from empirical & modeling studies. This direct causal link from climate change to the actual behavior of jet stream in a given month seems beyond our attribution capabilities.”
And:
However, this thinking is consistent w/null hypothesis that climate change impacts [affects, causes, intensifies] all extreme weather events [always]. These jet stream “slow downs” or blocking events are actually poorly understood features of the climate system.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo one understands the causes of weather better than highly experienced meteorologists. And so when it comes to questions about extreme weather events, there is no one better to ask than prominent Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann (or Joe Bastardi in the US).
Yesterday at Twitter the veteran, high-profile Swiss meteorologist Kachelmann tweeted about an interview he had given with Austrian online magazine profil.at on the topic of extreme weather in Europe, and how the interview was withdrawn before publication.
Low-blow, dirty media
The main reason behind the withdrawal was Mr. Kachelmann taking issue with what he viewed as low-blow journalism by profil.at, who in the introduction needlessly brought up the phony rape charges lodged against Kachelmann 8 years ago by a scornful ex-girlfriend.
Though the former German flagship ARD television meteorologist was cleared of the charges and got through the legal ordeal, his reputation tragically did not survive the media feeding frenzy and gutter journalism.
To make a long story short, Kachelmann yesterday simply posted a draft of the unpublished profil.at interview at Twitter, before later taking it down.
But I managed to read it and so now report on its content.
Click-hungry sites hyping weather extremes 
In the interview, Profil.at questioned Kachelmann about the warmer European springs, weather extremes, serious scientists, and other issues.
On the subject of the recent warmer springs and more severe thunderstorm activity, Kachelmann responded that it has gotten warmer, but that the alleged higher frequency and intensity of extreme weather events has more to do with hype coming from places like Facebook and click-hungry Internet sites.

Not linked to climate change
Kachelmann added it’s normal for large weather patterns “to act up” and that it “has nothing to do with climate change”.
However he does attribute the warmer temperatures and higher humidity to climate change and that it is “statistically significant”, but then reminds that the statistics for weather extremes have yet to be shown as being significant.
“Completely senseless tweets from Greenpeace”
When asked about climate denialism and why people like Donald Trump get votes with climate change denialism, the Swiss meteorologist says: “There’s a lack of scientific knowledge on both sides.”
Next he cited examples from on social media:
Over the last weeks I’ve seen so many completely senseless tweets from Greenpeace and green politicians, who wish to blame without any doubt the daily weather on climate change, often with fake statistics, and so climate deniers are not alone. Serious scientists are working quietly between the embarrassing megaphones on both sides.”
Blame measurement instruments?
As an example of just how absurd the media can be, in the interview profil.at unwittingly displayed a remarkable ignorance of climate (which all-too often prevails among the climate-ambulance-chasing-media) in posing the question: “Are there reliable instruments today that would allow us to determine if a weather event can be attributed to climate change, or indeed to the weather pattern at hand?”
Blaming weather on climate change “idiocy”
Kachelman answers by telling profil.at that weather events unfortunately don’t come with a certificate of origin, and any claim that they do needs to be viewed as “unscientific idiocy”.

20th century “uptick” from Marcott et al., 2013, RealClimate.org  
Almost immediately after it was introduced to the public, the lead author of Marcott et al. (2013) squelched the narrative that said the hockey-stick-shaped reconstruction he and his colleagues produced is a robust representation of modern global-scale temperature changes.
In an interview with Marcott published by RealClimate.org, it was acknowledged that the “uptick” does not represent a global-scale reconstruction, as it is based on only a few proxy records and lacks statistical significance. 

Despite this admitted lack of supporting evidence for the 20th century’s “uptick”, the Marcott et al. (2013) “hockey stick”-shaped graph has nonetheless been unskeptically cited by other authors nearly 700 times. 
Marcott’s compilation of 73 reconstructions
The same “73 globally distributed” proxy temperature records used to manufacture the Marcott et al. (2013) “hockey stick”-shaped graph above were featured two years earlier in Shaun Marcott’s Oregon State University doctoral dissertation.  
Marcott, 2011  “Late Pleistocene and Holocene Glacier and Climate Change”
One may view the graphical representations of all 73 proxy temperature records used for the 2013 “uptick” on pages 200-203 of Marcott’s 2011 paper (above link, about three-fourths of the way down). 
Interestingly, a majority of the graphs do not have temperatures extending to the right Y axis, indicating that most of the 73 proxy records do not encompass the modern era and preclude analysis of the relative temperature differences between the past and present.
In fact, just 32 of the 73 graphs have overall trend lines that extend to “0 yrs BP” in the Marcott dissertation paper.  The rest end somewhere in the Late Holocene (or earlier).  The 32 reconstructions that do extend all the way to the right Y axis are shown below.


Same data, contradictory results 
As even a cursory glance at the 32 reconstructions illustrates, Marcott’s 2011 paper showed no 20th century temperature “uptick” after a modest overall Holocene cooling trend.
A compilation of all 73 Holocene temperature trends for the past 11,300 years is presented in one compressed graph on page 204.  Notice that the large amplitude of variations involving temperature changes of several degrees Celsius shown in the proxy reconstructions has been replaced by much smaller variable ranges (tenths of a degree). 

In contrast, the 2013 paper — utilizing the very same 73 temperature reconstructions — depicts the explosive temperature rise during modern times popularized by climate activists. 

This glaring contradiction between Marcott’s 2011 and 2013 papers was pointed out by Professor Paul Matthews in a comment published by the journal Science.

Image Source: Science
Marcott’s selected reconstructions indicate 2°C warmer temps during the Early- to Mid-Holocene
Interestingly, the temperature reconstructions Marcott used to produce both his 2011 Ph.D thesis and his 2013 Science paper show that (a) Early- to Mid-Holocene temperatures were, on average, more than 2°C warmer than today, and (b) they varied throughout the Holocene by multiple degrees Celsius instead of by just the tenths-of-a-degree shown in both the 2011 and 2013 papers. 
Of the 32 reconstructions extending to the Y axis in Marcott’s papers, 25 clearly define the modern or present temperature relative to the past.  The other 7 did not have modern or present temperature values that were clearly defined in the body of the paper.   In the 25 reconstructions that did allow comparison, the compiled peak Holocene temperatures were determined to be 2.3°C warmer than today on average. 
This result wholly contradicts the claims of Marcott’s 2013 paper.
Examples of the warmer-than-today records
Perhaps Marcott did not look closely enough at the content of each paper he referenced.  Had he done so, he may have noticed that Rodrigues et al., 2009 indicate the “at present” temperature in the Iberian region is 15°C, which is about 1°C colder than it was during the Little Ice Age (16°C) and 4°C colder than the peak Holocene temperature. 

Isono et al. (2009) report that the “present” temperature is 16.7°C, but the peak Holocene temperature was 21.4°C, meaning that North Pacific temperatures were approaching 5°C warmer about 7,000 or 8,000 years ago.

Even a graph that initially appears to support a sharp rise in temperature during modern times (an “uptick”) like Nielsen et al. (2010) actually asserts the Holocene peak was  4°C warmer than the modern average in the body of the paper itself.

As mentioned, some graphs are identified as not clearly defining the modern temperature values.  However, as Bendle and Rosell-Mele, 2007 point out, the amplitude of past temperature changes could reach as high as 10°C within a matter of centuries.  This would appear to contradict the contention that Holocene temperature variability was much less pronounced (a few tenths of a degree spanning millennia).

Of note, none of the reconstructions analyzed support the contention that modern temperatures are unusually high or unprecedented.  
If the paleoclimate evidence doesn’t support a recent pronounced “uptick”, where does it come from?
To summarize, the proxy evidence from the peer-reviewed scientific papers that Marcott derived his global temperature data set compilation wholly contradicts Marcott’s apparent attempt to construct a Mann-like Holocene-length “hockey stick” temperature record.  
Marcott himself has acknowledged that the 20th century “uptick” is based on only “a few” reconstructions that are neither globally representative or statistically robust.  This begs the questions:
1. What data set is used to justify the depiction of a pronounced temperature “uptick”? 
2. Has the “uptick” been fabricated?
3. On what basis did the journal Science publish the 2013 version of a paper that is contradicted by an earlier work by the same author? 
The list of Marcott’s graphs
Below is the table of contents for the 32 referenced reconstructions extending to the right Y axis.  The warmer-than-now temperature value is emboldened on the right.  This list is followed by the pictorial representations of the Marcott-selected reconstructions and excerpts from the papers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate skeptic Snowfan here reports that Germany’s DWD National Weather Service has been caught deliberately spreading climate alarmism ahead of the COP24 using “fake news” in its press release of December 3, 2018, where it announced:
2018 could be the warmest and driest year since 1881.“
Snowfan replied on December 9th that 2018 could not be “the driest year” because the German Weather Service knew plenty of precipitation was in the pipeline for December, 2018.
As Snowfan shows, the old record of 555.1 mm/m² of mean precipitation across Germany was set way back in 1959, (see chart below).

Germany’s mean annual precipitation since 1881. The green line shows how Germany’s mean precipitation has increased over the past decades. The 1981-2010 mean is close to 820 liters/sq m.
By the end of November 2018, an average amount of 482.3 mm/m² of precipitation had fallen in 2018 through November. As of December 8, 2018, an average of about 518 mm had fallen across the country.
Then on the 11th of December, Snowfan noted that the GFS forecast for precipitation in Germany up to Christmas day showed yet more rain on the way:

Defying the the GFS forecasts, the DWD went ahead and “expected” less than 30 liters/sqm of precipitation to fall across Germany by the end of the month. The purposely very low expectation of course allowed DWD to issue an alarmist press release warning that 2018 could set an all-time record for the driest year ever.
On December 11, Snowfan pointed out that this was not going to happen, and called the DWD claims “ridiculous nonsense”, adding:

1. The year 2018 in Germany cannot be the driest year since 1881, the positive linear trend of precipitation in Germany since 1881 (green line in the DWD graph above) will remain.
2. In the last week of the completely senseless 24th World Climate Change Conference (COP24) in Poland’s largest coal mining district in Katowice, December 2-14, snow will fall heavily over the last week to cool the overheated climate brains.”
Today Snowfan writes that as of December 16, 2018, already about 81% of December’s mean precipitation has fallen so far.
On the DWD’s panic forecast of possibly the driest year on record issued on December 3, before COP24, Snowfan concludes:
There was no basis for it, there is none, and there isn’t going to be any ‘DWD 2018 driest year since since recordings began in 1881!'”
Currently only 15 l/m² are missing until the end of the month. According to a very recent outlook by the GFS, plenty more rain is forecast for Germany for the rest of December:

1959 was the record driest year ever, and will remain Germany’s record driest year until further notice – no matter what the DWD may insist.
Snowfan adds:
The DWD thus knew before the December 3, 2018 press release of the climate fairy tale of the driest year ever, and that there would be more heavy rainfall in Germany by the end of the year.
Could one call a deliberate climate false story a climate lie? Does the DWD German Weather Service, with an annual budget of about 347 million euros in 2018, have the state contract to organize climate alarm by repeatedly deliberately spreading climate lies?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt is often claimed that modern day sea ice changes are “unprecedented”, alarming, and well outside the range of natural variability.  Yet scientists are increasingly finding that biomarker proxies used to reconstruct both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice conditions since the Early Holocene reveal that today’s sea ice changes are not only not unusual, there is more extensive Arctic and Antarctic sea ice during recent decades than there has been for nearly all of the last 10,000 years.

Antarctic Sea Ice Extent
In the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, the sea surface temperatures have been cooling since 1979.

Image Source: Jones et al., 2016

Image Source: Fan et al., 2014
Purich et al., 2018     “Observed Southern Ocean changes over recent decades include a surface freshening (Durack and Wijffels 2010; Durack et al. 2012; de Lavergne et al. 2014), surface cooling (Fan et al. 2014; Marshall et al. 2014; Armour et al. 2016; Purich et al. 2016a) and circumpolar increase in Antarctic sea ice (Cavalieri and Parkinson 2008; Comiso and Nishio 2008; Parkinson and Cavalieri 2012).”

Image Source: Purich et al., 2018
The decline in Southern Ocean temperatures has coincided with an increase in Antarctic sea extent since 1979.

Image Source: Jones et al., 2016
Comiso et al., 2017     “The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate models. After a record high extent in 2012 the extent was even higher in 2014 when the magnitude exceeded 20 × 106 km2 for the first time during the satellite era. … [T]he trend in sea ice cover is strongly influenced by the trend in surface temperature [cooling].”

Image Source: Comiso et al., 2017
In contrast to the post-1970s cooling and sea ice advance, Antarctica warmed and sea ice declined during the 1950s to 1980s.
Antarctica warming rapidly, 1950s-1980s
IPCC (2001):    “Another analysis of a 21-station data set from Antarctica by Comiso (1999) found a warming trend equivalent to 1.25°C per century for a 45-year record beginning in the 1950s but a slight cooling trend from 1979 to 1998. The slight cooling trend for this later 20-year period also was confirmed via analysis of surface temperatures over the whole continent, as inferred from satellite data.”
Fan et al., 2014:  “[S]ea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures decreased during 1979–2011, consistent with the expansion of Antarctic sea ice. In contrast, the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica warmed during 1950–1978.”
Declining Antarctic sea ice concentrations, 1950s-1980s
Sinclair et al., 2014     “We present the first proxy record of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, from a 130 year coastal ice-core record. High-resolution deuterium excess data show prevailing stable SIA [sea ice area] from the 1880s until the 1950s, a 2–5% reduction from the mid-1950s to the early-1990s, and a 5% increase after 1993.”
Miles et al., 2013     “Despite large fluctuations between glaciers—linked to their size—three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010.  … Indeed, several studies report increasing sea-ice concentrations in the study region from approximately 1980 to 2010, which is consistent with the predominance of glacier advance since 1990, when above-average sea-ice and fast-ice concentrations could have suppressed calving by increasing back-pressure on glacier termini. In contrast, reduced sea ice concentrations from the 1950s to the mid 1970s are consistent with glacier retreat during the 1960s and 1970s, when air temperatures were also increasing along the Pacific coast.”
Antarctic sea ice conditions were similar to today’s during 1897-1917.
Edinburgh and Day, 2016     “In stark contrast to the sharp decline in Arctic sea ice, there has been a steady increase in ice extent around Antarctica during the last three decades, especially in the Weddell and Ross seas. In general, climate models do not to capture this trend … This comparison shows that the summer sea ice edge was between 1.0 and 1.7° further north in the Weddell Sea during this period but that ice conditions were surprisingly comparable to the present day [during 1897-1917] in other sectors.”
(press release)     “We know that sea ice in the Antarctic has increased slightly over the past 30 years, since satellite observations began. Scientists have been grappling to understand this trend in the context of global warming, but these new findings suggest it may not be anything new. … The new study published in The Cryosphere is the first to shed light on sea ice extent in the period prior to the 1930s, and suggests the [sea ice] levels in the early 1900s were in fact similar to today“
New paper finds Antarctic (Peninsula) sea ice more extensive today than possibly any time in the last 10,000 years.
Belt, 2018     “Exceptionally, Massé et al. (2011) observed a general decline in sedimentary IPSO25 concentration in a short offshore transect from East Antarctica; a trend shown subsequently to be quite general for various other Antarctic regions (Belt et al., 2016). In the latter study, it was suggested that the origin of this trend might be found in the preferred habitat of the known source of IPSO25 (B. adeliensis), which has a tendency to proliferate in platelet ice, found most commonly in near-shore locations covered by fast ice (Medlin, 1990). As such, it was hypothesised that higher concentrations of IPSO25 might be found in locations proximal to ice shelves, since their basal melt acts as the major driver for platelet ice formation (Jefferies et al., 1993). Re-examination of some palaeo sea ice records based on IPSO25 added further credibility to this suggestion (Fig. 6), and Smik et al. (2016a) also identified highest concentrations of IPSO25 in near-shore surface waters soon after spring sea ice melt.”


Arctic Sea Ice Extent
“Extensive modern sea ice conditions” during spring (80% concentrations), but “consistently low” and “marginal” (<10%) sea ice conditions from 10,500 to 1,500 years before present.
Köseoğlu et al., 2018     “The core 70 site is characterised by extensive modern sea ice conditions (≈80% SpSIC [Spring Sea Ice Concentration]) and the downcore record represents a gradual evolution of sea ice cover in the northern Barents Sea from ice-free conditions during the early Holocene to prolonged seasonal sea ice presence prevalent in the region today. The primarily insolation-controlled southward expansion of sea ice cover previously inferred for the core site throughout the Holocene (Belt et al., 2015; Berben et al., 2017) is reflected in the CT model assessment. Consistent with the onset of the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the resulting proximity of the annual maximum sea ice edge to the core site between ca. 9.5–8.5 cal kyr BP evident from low PIIIIP25-derived SpSIC (ca. 5–15%), the CT model predicts mostly marginal sea ice conditions during this interval. … From ca. 10.0–1.5 cal kyr BP, ice-free conditions characterised the core 11 site, as evidenced by consistently low SpSIC (ca. <10%) and marginal sea ice conditions predicted by the CT model, and further supported by an enhancement of AW [Arctic Water] inflow to the core site from ca. 9.8 cal kyr BP (Groot et al., 2014).”

“Lower than modern” sea ice conditions between 2,200 and 1,200 years before present.  Little Ice Age sea ice conditions “possible similar to conditions as observed today”.
Kolling et al., 2018     “Our biomarker record indicates that Disko Bugt [West Greenland] experienced a gradual expansion of seasonal sea ice during the last 2.2 kyr. Maximum sea ice extent was reached during the Little Ice Age around 0.2 kyr BP. Superimposed on this longer term trend, we find short-term oscillations in open water primary production and terrigenous input, which may be related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and solar activity changes as potential climatic trigger mechanisms.  The period between 2.2 and 1.2 kyr BP, with lower than modern sea ice conditions in Disko Bugt (Fig. 6b), coincides with generally warm conditions over the Greenland Ice Sheet.”
“During the last 0.1 kyr, all biomarker concentrations showed an increase, brassicasterol and HBI III reach maximum values in the uppermost sample (80 µg/gTOC and 1.8 µg/gTOC, respectively; Fig. 3b, d).
“[During the Little Ice Age (0.7–0.2 kyr BP)] our biomarker record supports harsher sea ice conditions, possibly similar to conditions as observed today (Fig. 6b), indicated by strong increased in IP25 concentration and the PDIP25 index (Fig. 4c, d). …  A self-amplifying system may have caused the environmental changes observed in Disko Bugt area as follows: solar triggered Arctic sea ice melt [Ruzmaikin et al., 2004] increases freshwater supply towards the North Atlantic causing a reduction in sub-polar gyre activity and AMO [Holland et al., 2001, Schmith et al., 2003] as described by Sha et al. [2016]. This may in turn cause distinct changes in WGC composition and meltwater supply from the Greenland Ice Sheet that affects phytoplankton blooms in West Greenland.
“We find that the Disko Bugt area was influenced by seasonal sea ice over the last 2.2 kyr BP. The overall sea ice trend indicates a development from a reduced sea ice cover during early spring, with sea ice algae productivity hampered by light availability to a gradual extend of the sea ice season from 1.2 kyr BP onwards. This change in sea ice extend is parallel to decreasing Northern Hemisphere atmospheric temperatures and culminates in the Little Ice Age around 0.2 kyr. We assume that modern conditions, with sea ice present until late spring and the presence of a stable ice edge at Disko Bugt, established around that time [~200 years ago].”

Nothing unusual or unprecedented: ‘Internal variability’ or natural cycles responsible for half of the Arctic sea ice loss since 1979.
Yu and Zhong, 2018    “The underlying physical mechanisms for the Arctic warming and accelerated sea ice retreat are not fully understood. In this study, we apply a relatively novel statistical method called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to examine the trend and variability of autumn Arctic sea ice in the past three decades and their relationships to large-scale atmospheric circulation changes. Our results show that the anomalous autumn the Arctic Dipole (AD) (Node 1) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) (Node 9) could explain in a statistical sense as much as 50% of autumn sea ice decline between 1979 and 2016. The Arctic atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with anomalous sea surface temperature patterns over the North Pacific and North Atlantic influence Arctic sea ice primarily through anomalous temperature and water vapour advection and associated radiative feedback. … We investigate the potential mechanisms for the autumn arctic sea ice decline for the period 1979-2016 using the SOM method. Our results show that more than half of the autumn Arctic sea ice loss may be associated with the changes in the temperature and water vapour transport and the associated water vapour radiation feedback resulting from anomalous atmospheric circulations linked to SST anomalies over the North Pacific and North Atlantic. …  [T]he results here help advance the knowledge about the relatively large contributions from the decadal-scale natural climate variability to Arctic climate change…”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlorence shows that atmospheric water vapor dwarfs human emissions of trace gas CO2.
To put some perspective on the scale of water vapor and trace gas CO2 in our atmosphere, let’s compare the two in terms of rainfall from Hurricane Florence alone over the Carolinas and surrounding area.
Surely with man’s fossil fuel profligacy, the emitted CO2 must by far outweigh the water vapor associated with a single storm.
18 trillion gallons of rain
According to hurricane expert Dr. Ryan Maue, some 18 trillion gallons of water vapor could fall as rain from Hurricane Florence over the Carolinas’ region:

Forecast for total rainfall during next 7-days (data from @NWSOPC) is still roughly 10 trillion gallons for North Carolina.
Add in adjacent states that will also be impacted by #Florence gets up to about 18 Trillion total. pic.twitter.com/hpfHeJLA6o

To better imagine the scale of this, that’s roughly 2400 one-gallon milk jugs for every man, woman and child on the planet.
70 billion metric tonnes
18 trillion gallons is roughly 70 trillion kg of water mass, which is 70 billion metric tonnes of water vapor in the atmosphere which will end up getting dumped on a few states over a few days by Florence.
Double the weight of human CO2 emissions in one year
How does this compare to human CO2 emissions into the atmosphere?
Globally and ANNUALLY, man emits about 36 billion metric tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. That means the water vapor falling as rain over the Carolinas’ region from Florence is double the weight of CO2 man emits into the atmosphere in an entire YEAR.
Human CO2 amounts pales in comparison to the daily global water vapor variations the planet sees. Clearly water vapor dwarfs CO2 in the atmosphere. Claiming that CO2 is the main driver is as silly as claiming President Trump is complicit in creating Florence.

Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann. Photo source: https://weather.us/
Yesterday here I reported how veteran Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann, 59, called the blaming of single weather events on climate change “complete idiocy”.
The quality of weather reporting and information, and the overall knowledge of natural sciences, have gotten so bad in Germany, according to Kachelmann, that he felt compelled to comment at the online Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung (HAZ). He wrote (link added by author):
 In matters concerning natural sciences, a collective educational precariat rules.”
Meaning: when it comes to knowledge of natural sciences, and especially meteorology, Germany is in trouble, and the citizens are being terribly disinformed.
Excessive, click-baiting media hype
One of the major reasons behind the destructive development, according to Kachelmann, is all the “nonsense” that gets reported by the media concerning the weather.
One example is the often-made claim today that severe thunderstorms or heavy downpours are linked to “climate change”. What in the past used to be just called a storm or bad weather, now gets recorded by countless mobile devices and sent to some studio, where it is hyped and sold as a 100-year event of Biblical proportions.
“Anarchy” ruling day-to-day weather reports
Kachelmann comments how today one often finds weather tips in the German media, e.g. for golfers and mountaineers, but which are in fact “complete idiocy”. Much of the nonsense, the Swiss meteorologist believes, is driven by the media’s insatiable appetite for clicks. “There’s anarchy in the weather report,” Kachelmann writes.

Today every north wind in the wintertime gets dubbed the “Siberian whip!” or every warm summer breeze from the south now gets labelled as a “Saharan heat wave!”, he describes.
Meteorology has become a hoard of anarchy
Kachelmann’s observations are spot on. But we could add that the rush to crank out sensational headlines is not limited to tabloids, but also flagship media outlets and once renowned weather and climatological institutes, who are now getting into the click-baiting, attention-seeking extreme weather frenzy.
For example “renowned” institutes are increasingly linking foul weather to climate change, and warn things are only going to get worse! “We’re toast!” the AP once warned, citing serious scientists.
“80 to 90% false information” …”or made up”
In Kachelmann’s view the field of meteorology has deteriorated so much that he comments at HAZ:
It’s truly a drama: Today 80 to 90 percent of the weather stories in the German online media are false information or often freely made-up nonsense. My science has become a hoard of anarchy.”
He adds:
The absence of knowledge about nature allows every nonsense to be printed — in order to generate clicks — yet not be recognized as such.”
So why has the German citizenry become so weather-disinformed?
Kachmann points to the educational system, where children are allowed to bypass natural science classes at schools. He comments at HAZ:
It is breathtaking what only a few decades and the allowance to skip school subjects can do to a country that, at least in folksongs, was long familiar with storms.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterRapid sea level rise was supposed
to shrink Earth’s coasts. It hasn’t.

Image Source: Mörner, 2018
“Over the past decades, atoll islands exhibited no widespread sign of physical destabilization in the face of sea-level rise. 88.6% of islands were either stable or increased in area, while only 11.4% contracted. It is noteworthy that no island larger than 10 ha decreased in size. These results show that atoll and island areal stability is a global trend, whatever the rate of sea-level rise.”- Duvat, 2019

Image Sources: Donchyts et al., 2016 and BBC (press release)
I. Despite sea level rise, “the coasts are growing all over the world”
Sea levels aren’t rising fast enough to deleteriously affect coastal areas on a net global scale.
Satellite observations indicate there has been 13,565 km2 of net growth in land area across the globe’s coasts between 1985-2015.
In other words, the Earth’s coasts gained more land area than were lost to rising sea levels.
“Earth’s surface gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years, including 20,135 km2 of water and 33,700 km2 of land in coastal areas.” (Donchyts et al., 2016)
As a visual example, Ahmed et al. (2018) find that Bangladesh’s coastal land area grew by 7.9 km2 per year during 1985-2015.
“This paper draws upon the application of GIS and remote sensing techniques to investigate the dynamic nature and management aspects of land in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. … This research reveals that the rate of accretion [coastal land growth] in the study area is slightly higher than the rate of erosion. Overall land dynamics indicate a net gain of 237 km2 (7.9 km2annual average) of land in the area for the whole period from 1985 to 2015.”  (Ahmed et al., 2018)

II. Even with ~4 mm yr−1 local sea level rise, Pacific islands grew in size during 1971-2014
Between 1958-2014, the globe’s sea levels rose at a rate of about 1.4 mm yr−1 , or 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) per century (Frederikse et al., 2018).
Ice melt from Greenland and Antarctica contributed a grand total of 1.5 cm of the 7.9 cm (3.1 inches) of sea level rise during those 56 years.
“The global-mean sea level reconstruction shows a trend of 1.5 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 over 1958–2014 (1σ), compared to 1.3 ± 0.1 mm yr−1 for the sum of contributors.” (Frederikse et al., 2018)
However, there are regions of the world where sea levels are rising at rates two or three times the global average.  Tuvalu, representing over 100 islands located in the central west Pacific, has  undergone “twice the global average” rate of sea level rise (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm yr−1) since the 1970s.
It would be expected that such high rates of local sea level change would result in shrinking island coasts and overall land area during this period.
But the opposite has occurred.  There has been a net increase in the coastal land area of Tuvalu between 1971-2014 in 8 of 9 atolls.
“We specifically examine spatial differences in island behaviour, of all 101 islands in Tuvalu, over the past four decades (1971–2014), a period in which local sea level has risen at twice the global average. Surprisingly, we show that all islands have changed and that the dominant mode of change has been island expansion, which has increased the land area of the nation.”
“Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm yr−1). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls.” (Kench et al., 2018)
III. The stability or coastal net growth of islands in recent decades to century “is a global trend”
Coastal stability and expansion for atoll and island land area is not just a regional trend, but a global one.
A comprehensive (709 islands) review of coastal changes that have been observed in the last decades to century (Duvat, 2019) reveals that no atoll island destabilization has occurred due to the effects of rising sea levels.
In fact, 88.6% of the globe’s islands have coasts that are either stable or expanding in size.
Further, not a single island larger than 10 hectares [1 ha = 10,000 square m, or 2.5 acres] has decreased in size in recent decades.

None of these observed trends affirm the popularized claim that modern sea level rise is currently threatening the globe’s coasts.

Duvat, 2019
A global assessment of atoll island
planform changes over the past decades

Image Source: Duvat, 2019
“This review first confirms that over the past decades to century, atoll islands exhibited no widespread sign of physical destabilization by sea level rise. The global sample considered in this paper, which includes 30 atolls and 709 islands, reveals that atolls did not lose land area, and that 73.1% of islands were stable in land area, including most settled islands, while 15.5% of islands increased and 11.4% decreased in size. Atoll and island areal stability can therefore be considered as a global trend.”
“Importantly, islands located in ocean regions affected by rapid sea-level rise showed neither contraction nor marked shoreline retreat, which indicates that they may not be affected yet by the presumably negative, that is, erosive, impact of sea-level rise.”
“It is noteworthy that no island larger than 10 ha decreased in size, making this value a relevant threshold to define atoll island areal stability.”
“[A]mong the 27 islands having a land area lying between 100 and 200 ha (9 in French Polynesia, 6 in the Marshall Islands, 6 in Kiribati, 5 in Tuvalu and 1 in the Federated States of Micronesia), only 3 increased in area, while 24 were stable.”
“The great majority of Pacific islands showed positional stability, as illustrated by the Tuamotu atolls, where 85–100% of islands were stable, depending on atolls (Duvat & Pillet, 2017; Duvat, Salvat, et al., 2017).”
“Importantly, the reanalysis of available data on atoll island planform change indicates that over the past decades to century, no island larger than 10 ha and only 4 out of the 334 islands larger than 5 ha (i.e., 1.2%) underwent a reduction in size.”

IV. Sea level rise is not the coastal threat that natural geological processes are
Rapid sea level rise rates due to global warming are not the threat to coastal communities and wildlife that they have often been claimed to be.  What is?  Natural geological/crustal changes, or vertical land movement.
Tied to the Earth’s gravitational attraction and shifting plates, geologic subsidence (land sinking) or uplift (land rising) processes are far more of a determinant of coastal structure and positioning than the rather small (by comparison) seawater volume changes in the world’s ocean basins.  This is why sea level rise (or fall) rates are local, not global, as they vary quite dramatically across the world.
Along the coast of Juneau, Alaska, for example, the land surface has been rapidly rising due to gravitational uplift for many decades.  Consequently, relative sea levels are plummeting in this region at a rate of over -13 mm yr−1 (minus-5 inches per decade) according to NOAA.

The opposite is occurring along the U.S. Gulf coast (Grand Isle, Louisiana), where the land area is sinking and thus sea levels are rising at a rate of over +9 mm yr−1.

Scientists have concluded that “sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling the shoreline changes” in regions where sea levels are rapidly rising (Testut et al., 2016).   Even localized rates of sea level rise as high as 5 mm yr−1 are not rapid enough to overcome the much more pronounced geologic changes (accretion and uplift).
“We show that Grande Glorieuse Island has increased in area by 7.5 ha between 1989 and 2003, predominantly as a result of shoreline accretion [growth]: accretion occurred over 47% of shoreline length, whereas 26% was stable and 28% was eroded. Topographic transects and field observations show that the accretion is due to sediment transfer from the reef outer slopes to the reef flat and then to the beach. This accretion occurred in a context of sea level rise: sea level has risen by about 6 cm in the last twenty years and the island height is probably stable or very slowly subsiding. This island expansion during a period of rising sea level demonstrates that sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling the shoreline changes. This paper highlights the key role of non-climate factors in changes in island area, especially sediment availability and transport.”  (Testut et al., 2016)
V. Vertical motions of the Earth’s crust exert “dominant control” over relative sea level
Along the eastern coast of the U.S., Piecuch and colleagues (2018) find that the “dominant control” over the disparate rates of sea level rise during the modern era has been exerted by “vertical motions of the Earth’s crust”, not climate.
“Here we analyse instrumental data and proxy reconstructions using probabilistic methods to show that vertical motions of Earth’s crust exerted the dominant control on regional spatial differences in relative sea-level trends along the US East Coast during 1900–2017, explaining most of the large-scale spatial variance. … Rates of coastal subsidence caused by ongoing relaxation of the peripheral forebulge associated with the last deglaciation are strongest near North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia [locations where the sea level rise rates are highest]. Our results indicate that the majority of large-scale spatial variation in long-term rates of relative sea-level rise on the US East Coast is due to geological processes that will persist at similar rates for centuries. … We note that negative VLM [vertical land motion] reflects subsidence and hence contributes to sea-level rise. Correspondingly, the most negative VLM [vertical land motion] rate (−2.5 ± 0.6 mm yr−1) is likely (P = 0.75) to occur in the states that host the maximum sea-level rise, North Carolina or Virginia, whereas the most positive rate of VLM (0.7 ± 0.8 mm yr−1) is very likely (P = 0.90) to occur in Maine.” (Piecuch et al., 2018)
Pfeffer and colleagues (2017) assessed 849 coastal sites and determined that geophysical processes, or vertical land motion (VLM) trends (ranging from −13 to +16 mm yr−1 ), “have been recognized as a dominant component of the total relative sea-level variations observed at coasts” at locations throughout the globe.
“VLMs contribute actively to the sea-level changes felt by coastal populations, as they can amplify, diminish or counteract the effects of climate-induced signals (e.g. Pfeffer & Allemand 2016). In many cases, for example, Torres Islands (Ballu et al. 2011), western Tropical Pacific (Becker et al. 2012), southern Europe (Woppelmann & Marcos ¨ 2012) or Indian Ocean (Palanisamy et al. 2014), VLMs [vertical land motions] have been recognized as a dominant component of the total relative sea-level variations observed at coasts. … VLMs are estimated at 258 GPS stations and 591 tide gauges, for a total of 849 coastal sites. Trend values range from −13 to +16 mm yr−1 (Fig. 3a). A strong spatial variability in VLM is observed at all scales, including locally, which is evidenced for example by the dense instrumental network in Japan. High rates of crustal uplift are observed at high latitudes, while subsidence of coastal areas is more often observed at medium latitudes (e.g. the East American coast).” (Pfeffer et al., 2017)

VI. Meter-scale sea level rise is “related to geologic events only”, not climate change
In a 2018 paper published in the journal Geoscience Frontiers, geophysicist and tectonics expert Dr. Aftab Khan asserts that “both regional and local sea-level rise and fall in meter-scale is related to the geologic events only and not related to global warming and/or polar ice melt.”
Very high rates of land subsidence and uplift persist today.  Vertical land motions as profound as ±10 to 30 mm yr−1 have been observed by geologists – easily overwhelming even the highest measured relative sea level changes.
The conclusion that rapid and high-amplitude (i.e., meters-per-century) sea level changes occur primarily as a consequence of natural geologic processes effectively leaves no room for global warming and/or polar ice melt to significantly contribute to the alarming meters-per-century sea level rise projected to engulf the Earth’s coasts by the end of the century.
Modeled predictions of multiple meters of sea level rise by 2100 (for example, 2.6 meters of global sea level rise by 2100 according to authors like Dr. Michael Mann and Dr. Richard Alley in Garner et al. 2017) are dismissed as “highly erroneous” by Dr. Khan.
Suggestions of a controlling anthropogenic influence on coastal and shoreline changes — the scariest aspect of climate modeling predictions — may therefore be significantly undermined by real-world scientific observations.

Khan, 2018
Why would sea-level rise for global
warming and polar ice-melt?
“Geophysical shape of the earth is the fundamental component of the global sea level distribution. Global warming and ice-melt, although a reality, would not contribute to sea-level rise. Gravitational attraction of the earth plays a dominant role against sea level rise.”
“Geological processes are responsible of two types of major movements of the crustal block viz., uplift and subsidence. Hence, the relation of sea level and crustal motion is attributed to sea level drops when there is an uplift while it rises when there is subsidence.”
“Snay et al. (2016) have found large residual vertical velocities [land uplift], some with values exceeding 30 mm/yr, in southeastern Alaska. The uplift occurring here is due to present-day melting of glaciers and ice fields formed during the Little Ice Age glacial advance that occurred between 1550 A.D. and 1850 A.D.”
“Johansson et al. (2002) conducted research on a project BIFROST (Baseline Inferences for Fennoscandian Rebound Observations, Sea-level, and Tectonics) that combines networks of continuously operating GPS receivers in Sweden and Finland to measure ongoing crustal deformation due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). They have found the maximum observed uplift rate 10 mm/yr for Fennoscandian region analyzing data between August 1993 and May 2000. Sella et al. (2007) and Lidberg et al. (2010) suggested that postglacial rebound continues today albeit very slowly wherein the land beneath the former ice sheets around Hudson Bay and central Scandinavia, is still rising by over a centimeter a year, while those regions which had bulged upwards around the ice sheet are subsiding such as the Baltic states and much of the eastern seaboard of North America.”
“Transgression commences when continental block undergoes subsidence with respect to continental shelf and abyssal plain, while regression occurs when this process is reverse i.e., when continental block is uplifted with respect to continental shelf and abyssal plain. Prograding delta system in low lying areas and other geologic events may cause local/relative sea-level fall as new sedimentary deposition advances as accretion pushing sea further down the coast irrespective of global warming and polar ice-melt.”
“Hence, both regional and local sea-level rise and fall in meter-scale is related to the geologic events only and not related to global warming and/or polar ice melt.”
“Prediction of 4–6.6 ft sea level rise in the next 91 years between 2009 and 2100 is highly erroneous.”

Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is supposed to be trapping heat and thus warming the global temperature.
But when we look at the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) statistics from my home country of Japan, one does not find any such warming over the recent decades.
I looked at the number of so-called cold days in Tokyo, i.e. days on which the thermometer dropped to 0°C and colder. Surprisingly over the past 30 years the trend has been more cold days, and not less:

Data source: JMA
Next I looked at the rural station of Miyama near Kyoto. This station shows a decreasing number of cold days trend since the data there began:

Data source: JMA
However, when we look at the past 34 years, a period when experts said in the late 1980s we’d see great warming, the opposite has in fact occurred:

Data source: JMA
The number of cold days at Miyama has since been on the rise. And if I started the chart at 1989 (30 years), the upward trend would be even more impressive.

Now moving far north to Hokkaido to the station of Suttsu, we also find the trend is the same over the past 30 years: we are seeing more cold days, and not less as we’d expect from a warming planet:

Data source: JMA
Moving to Kochu Prefecture to Murotomisaki station, here as well we find no downward trend for cold days. Cold days are on the rise:

Data source: JMA
Also the station of Tottori has been seeing an upward trend in the number of cold days over the past 30 years:

Data source: JMA.
90% no warming!
Of course over the past 200 years there has been a long term warming as the planet climbed out of the Little Ice Age. But overall over the past 3 decades, Japan has been seeing an increase in cold days. This should not come as a surprise because recently we found out that 90% of all rural sited stations in Japan have shown no warming trend, or even cooling, over the past 20 years.
The data show here has been no warming in Japan, and leaders need to finally acknowledge this.
Obviously natural factors are overwhelming CO2’s (modest) greenhouse effect.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite sea level rise, Tuvalu Islands surface area has grown 3% over the past decades
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The South Sea islands are sinking. Send us money and visas for Australia and USA fast! That’s the underlying message of many media reports on the problem of sea level rise and their effects on the Pacific Coral Islands. Here science simply gets cast aside.
Since coral islands are made up of living organisms that have always lived just below the sea level, the islands “float” like ships on the surface of the ocean. When sea level goes up, so do the corals. This is already something you learn in geography lessons at school.
Paul Kench and his colleagues have now measured the shorelines of all 101 islands of Tuvalu for the last 40 years using satellite imagery. The result: The land area grew by just under 3% during this period, despite a fairly strong regional sea-level rise of 4 mm per year. Here is the abstract of the work that appeared in February 2018 in Nature Communications:
Patterns of island change and persistence offer alternate adaptation pathways for atoll nations
Sea-level rise and climatic change threaten the existence of atoll nations. Inundation and erosion are expected to render islands uninhabitable over the next century, forcing human migration. Here we present analysis of shoreline change in all 101 islands in the Pacific atoll nation of Tuvalu. Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average (~3.90 ± 0.4 mm.yr−1). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls. Island change has lacked uniformity with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. Results challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for habitation over the next century, presenting alternate opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and their dynamics.”

The discussion part of the paper states:
Results challenge existing narratives of island loss showing that island expansion has been the most common physical alteration throughout Tuvalu over the past four decades. Of significance, documented increases in island area over this period have occurred as the sea level has been rising.”

Hat-tip: Kirye.

The paper, authored by a team of researchers led by Japanese physical chemist Dr. Kiminori Itoh, photo right, examined the influence of changes in solar activity (solar wind in particular) on surface temperatures and major oceanic oscillations such as the Arctic Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which have great impacts on regional and global climate.
The researchers feel that the major drivers of the Earth’s climate are more related to the sun and the oceans, and CO2’s role has been exaggerated.
Sun and oceans play great role
The paper cites, for example, Levitus et al., which found multidecadal temperature oscillations with magnitudes as large as 4°C for the Barents Sea at depths of 100–150m and that the timing of the oscillation coincided with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a major factor in the Atlantic Ocean.

IPCC models shoddy, major factors “not adequately represented”
The team of scientists found a clear influence of the solar wind on climate, and thus solar activity “should be considered much more than conventionally believed”.
The authors state, “once its mechanism becomes clearer and incorporated into climate models, it will greatly contribute to policy development.”
“The effectiveness of climate models is greatly reduced when the influence of the sun (and moon) is not adequately represented,” they state in the paper’s conclusion.
Dr. Kimimori Itoh has been a harsh critic of the mainstream, narrow scientific view that trace gas CO2 acts as the main driver behind global climate. He once called it “the worst scientific scandal in history” and that “when people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists.”

Share this...FacebookTwitter[The most notable part of the documentary is the interview with Freeman Dyson, from 1:09:00 – 1:14:00]
In his new documentary “The Uncertainty has Settled“, Dutch filmmaker Marijn Poels focuses on climate science and politics and found that the issue is in fact as controversial and as UNSETTLED as any issue could possibly get.
The science climate change is far from settled and is in fact unsettled.

The production of the film took Poels to a variety of locations from Manhattan to the Austrian Alps.
The first part of the film depicts the plight of farmers in former East Germany (Saxony Anhalt), who are struggling to practice their livelihoods under the heavy burden of German agricultural regulation and market distortion that result from bureaucrats having decided that 0.01% of our atmosphere (man-emitted CO2) is a monumental problem.
That’s the narrative the media and leading politicians keep ramming. But a number of skeptics doubt it, and so Poels investigates if this doubt is just right wind politics or if there is something really behind it.
In the end he finds that the science is fully in dispute.
Belief we can stop climate change “enormously egocentric”
At the 38:00 Poels says that the [alarmist] Potsdam Institute refused to grant him an interview and so he set out for Hamburg to meet with climate scientist Hans von Storch, who is in the warmist camp.
Von Storch confirms that climate change is real, man-made and is a problem that needs to be dealt with seriously. But he adds that the claim that we can “rescue” the climate is “nonsense” and characterizes the claim the individual can play a role on controlling climate as “enormously egocentric”. Later in the film (1:04:45) von Storch says he doesn’t see climate change as a danger, but as “a challenge” that he is not afraid of.
CO2 as a climate driver “complete, delusional nonsense”
Next astrophysicist Piers Corbyn tells Poels that the amount of man-made Co2 in the atmosphere is like a “tiny blob of birdshit” and calls the claim that this is causing the climate to change “complete, delusional nonsense”. Corbyn also believes the globe will see continued cooling until about 2035. He calls the datasets showing warming “frauds”.
Freeman Dyson: 
Climate models “very dangerous game”…”they’re wrong”
Next Poels makes his way to Princeton where he meets with “living legend” Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson, one of the leading skeptic voices on man-made climate change.

Dyson has harsh, critical words for climate science and the models they rely on (1:10:30). He calls the science of climate modeling a “very dangerous game”, adding:
When you work with a computer model for years and years and years – always improving the model – in the end you end up believing it. […] It’s very difficult to remain objective.”
Models “wrong”…”disagree with observations”
On why we should not trust the models, Dyson says flat out: “Because they’re wrong. It’s very simple. They’re wrong.” Dyson says they “disagree with observations”. He then commented on modeling scientists:
Those people don’t look at observations. They are in a world of their own.”
“Scaring the public”
The 93-year old Princeton professor also notes that although the models are “very good tools for understanding climate”, they are a “very bad tool for predicting climate” and that these scientists “live by scaring the public”.
Climate theories are “very confused”
Dyson continues:
Unfortunately the thing has become so political it’s no longer science when you have strong political dogmas, as you say, on both sides.”
Overall Dyson advises that we need to believe the observations and pointed out that “the theories of climate are very confused.”
Herd, tribal mentality
He also told Poels a large sociological part of the problem is that climate scientists have in large part gotten caught in herd and tribal mentality.
It’s still more important to belong to the tribe than to it is to speak the truth.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn direct contrast with CO2-centric climate modeling, extensive paleoclimate evidence affirms that the Holocene climate has been far more variable in the past 12,000 years than during the relatively quiescent period we’ve enjoyed since the mid-19th century. In the absence of CO2 concentration changes or human interference, abrupt global cooling episodes led to agricultural collapse, famines, and the extirpation of ancient civilizations.  These naturally-occurring climate events are likely to recur…and we will be powerless to intervene.

Between 1860 and 2014, CO2 concentrations rose dramatically (from 285 parts per million to 400 ppm), and yet global temperatures have fortunately remained relatively stable, with an overall per-decade change rate of just 0.05°C.

Image Source: Zhu et al., 2017
In contrast to the last 150 years of modest climate change, there was an instance 14,500 years ago in which “Northern Hemisphere temperatures increased by 4–5°C in just a few decades” and a concomitant “12–22 m sea level rise in less than 340 years” (Ivanovic et al., 2017), which is a warming of multiple degrees per decade and a sea level rise amounting to 3.5 to 6.5 meters per century.   This well-documented climate event occurred without CO2 levels fluctuating, indicating that CO2 was not causally involved in this explosive warming or sea level rise.
The 8.2 ka Abrupt Cooling/Warming Event
About 8,200 years ago, there was an abrupt, multiple-degree C cooling and warming episode (the “8.2 ka event”) that was global in scope, and lasted a total of about 150 years, with the amplitude of the cooling and warming phases lasting only decades.  The event was “associated with a total eustatic sea level rise of 0.8–2.2 m [Li et al., 2012; Törnqvist and Hijma, 2012]” (Ahn et al., 2013), indicating that there was far more pronounced climatic changes and sea level rise rates — ~1 meter per century — during this period than the mere 0.05°C per decade change and <0.2 meter of sea level rise that has occurred in the last 150 years.
Kobashi et al., 2007     “A large number of paleoclimatic records over a hemispheric area show a large and abrupt climate change around 8200 years BP. However, the duration and general character of the event have been ambiguous. Here, we provide a precise characterization and timing of the event using methane and nitrogen isotopes in trapped air in an ice core. Climate change in Greenland and at a hemispheric scale was simultaneous (within ~4 years) as supported by climate model results (LeGrande et al., 2006).  The event started around ~8175 years BP, and it took less than 20 years to reach the coldest period, with a magnitude of cooling of ~3.3°C [per decade] in central Greenland.   After 60 years of maximum cold, climate gradually recovered for 70 years to a similar state as before the event [+3.3°C within 70 years]. The total duration of the event was roughly 150 years. … The fall in temperatures that accompanied the 8.2 ka event also corresponded with abrupt migrations of human populations and abandonment of sites ranging from Spain to Greece and in the Middle East (Gonzalez-Samperiz et al., 2009)  ….  Ice cores from Greenland (Alley et al., 1997) and Africa (Thompson et al., 2002) suggest that the 8.2 ka event was global in extent.”
During this period, atmospheric CO2 concentrations effectively stayed the same, with “a small, about 1–2 ppm, increase of atmospheric CO2 during the 8.2 ka event” (Ahn et al., 2013), once again supporting a lack of causal connection between large-scale global warming and cooling and CO2 concentration changes.
Atwood et al., 2017     “The relatively stable climate of the Holocene epoch (11,700 yr BP-present) was punctuated by a period of large and abrupt climate change ca. 8,200 yr BP, when an outburst of glacial meltwater into the Labrador Sea drove large and abrupt climate changes across the globe.  Polar ice and marine records indicate that annual average surface temperatures dropped by 2-6 °C in central Greenland and by 1-3 °C in the North Atlantic Ocean and Europe [within decades]. The associated climate perturbations are generally thought to have persisted for 100-150 years [before temperatures returned to the previous baseline]. … These events stretch our understanding of the dynamical principles that govern the climate system, given the lack of these events in the modern record and the inability of climate models to reproduce such variability.”

Griffiths and Robinson, 2018     “The 8.2 ka BP (8200 cal. BP) event is regarded as the largest abrupt climate change event of the Holocene period (Alley et al., 1997; Alley and Agústsd ottir, 2005 ). It was first identified in the Greenland ice cores (Alley et al., 1997; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2007), but has subsequently been reported in multiple proxies across Europe (Magny et al., 2003; Seppa et al., 2007; Prasad et al., 2009; Zillen and Snowball, 2009; Daley et al., 2011; Giesecke et al., 2011), and throughout the Northern (Morrill and Jacobsen, 2005; Shuman, 2012; Liu et al., 2013; Dixit et al., 2014) and Southern Hemispheres (Morrill and Jacobsen, 2005; Cheng et al., 2009; Bustamante et al., 2016). In the Northern Hemisphere the event has been cited as precipitating a cold period, with a drop in temperature for example of 6 ± 2°C at Summit, Greenland (Alley et al., 1997) and of c. 1.6°C at Hawes Water, northwest England (Lang et al., 2010) that, according to counts of Greenland ice core layers, lasted a total of just over 160 years (Thomas et al., 2007). The event was reportedly caused by a glacier meltwater outburst from Laurentide lakes Agassiz and Ojibway around 8470 cal BP, which reduced deep water formation and caused an abrupt slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Barber et al., 1999). This hypothesis has been supported by work showing two sea-level jumps between 8.5 and 8.25 ka BP (Tornqvist and Hijma, 2012).”
The 4.2 ka Abrupt Cooling/Warming Event
About 4,200 years ago, another abrupt global-scale cooling event occurred that was associated with severe Northern Hemisphere-wide drying period that lasted for centuries.  The accompanying megadroughts and famines wiped out human civilizations that had existed in the same locations  for centuries to millennia.  After about 300 years of enduring cold and drought-stricken climates, “unified Neolithic farming culture completely collapsed” (Fenggui et al., 2010 ).
Like the 8.2 ka event, the 4.2 ka event featured a sudden, decadal-scale drop in surface ocean temperatures of 1-2°C (Guo et al., 2018).  Also like the 8.2 ka event, the 4.2 ka event was not accompanied by changes in CO2 concentrations, again emphasizing the lack of a strong linkage between CO2 fluctuations and large-scale climate changes in the paleoclimate record.
Guo et al., 2018   “The mid-Holocene environmental transition was characterised by global cooling and the abrupt weakening of the Northern Hemisphere monsoon systems. It is generally considered the key driver of the collapse of several mid-Holocene agricultural societies, on a global scale. … The mid-Holocene environmental transition has attracted much attention from climate scientists and archaeologists, especially Holocene event 3 (HE3, ~4.2 ka) [4,2000 years ago],as termed by Bond et al. (1997), because it marks the termination of the Holocene climatic optimum (Perry and Hsu, 2000) and the initiation of the Neoglacial (Solomina et al., 2015). Existing records reveal that ocean surface temperatures decreased by ~1-2°C during HE3 [4.200 years ago] (Bond et al., 1997; deMenocal et al., 2000b), which persisted for ~300-600 years (Cullen et al., 2000; Perry and Hsu, 2000); while a total duration of up to ~1500 years was recorded in the North Atlantic (Bond et al., 1997, 2001). In addition, HE3 was punctuated by a series of geologically-rapid global cooling and/or dry events (Morrill et al., 2003; Marchant and Hooghiemstra, 2004; Booth et al., 2005; Shanahan et al., 2015) which were superimposed on the gradual drying trend of the mid-Holocene (Morrill et al., 2003; Mayewski et al., 2004; Wanner et al., 2008, 2011; Roberts et al., 2011). Associated with HE3 were the collapse of cultures in Pakistan (Staubwasser et al., 2003; Madella and Fuller, 2006; Macdonald, 2011; Giosan et al., 2012; Ponton et al., 2012; Leipe et al., 2014; Menzel et al., 2014; Prasad et al., 2014a), Mesopotamia (Weiss et al., 1993; Cullen et al., 2000; deMenocal, 2001), China (Jin and Liu, 2002; Wu and Liu, 2004; An et al., 2005; Innes et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017) and Egypt (Thompson et al., 2002; Marshall et al., 2011; Phillipps et al., 2012). In high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a peak in detrital carbonate flux on the East Greenland Shelf at 4.7 ka signaled both the beginning of the Neoglacial and a southward expansion of the Arctic sea ice (Jennings et al., 2002). In Europe, a 4.2 ka drought event is recorded by multi-proxy data from a cave flowstone in Italy (Drysdale et al., 2006); diatom assemblages from Montcortes Lake in the Iberian Peninsula indicate that lake levels were lower during a pronounced dry interval from 2360 to 1850 BCE (Scussolini et al., 2011); a decrease in deciduous Quercus and Pinus pinea-type percentages in Southwest Iberia at ~4.2 ka suggests an abrupt shift to dry conditions (Lillios et al., 2016); and a synthesis of records from the Mediterranean reveals an unusually dry interval from 4.5 to 3.9 ka (Mercuri et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2011). Evidence from eastern tropical Africa indicates a shift to drier conditions at ~4.0 ka (Marchant and Hooghiemstra, 2004), although at this time wetter conditions were maintained in West Africa (Russell et al., 2003) and in parts of South America (Marchant and Hooghiemstra, 2004); and magnetic and geochemical data from the Holocene sediments of Lake Tana in northwest Ethiopia confirm that the driest interval occurred at ~4.2 ka (Marshall et al., 2011), which is also identified in the Mount Kilimanjaro ice core (Thompson et al., 2002) and in the Mauritian lowlands (de Boer et al., 2014). In eastern Russia, evidence of a cold spell between 4.5 ka and 3.5 ka is provided by a multi-proxy record from Two-Yurts Lake (Hoff et al., 2015). A severe centennial-scale megadrought in mid-continental North America occurred between 4.1 and 4.3 ka (Booth et al., 2005).”
Xiao et al., 2018     “Researches on the 4.2 ka event and its impact on cultural evolution in China have been encouraged by Hsü’s view (1998) that famines and mass migrations have occurred in the past. In ancient China, these could have resulted from regional droughts related to global cooling. Wu and Liu (2004) synthesized data from paleoclimatic records in eastern China and suggested that the climatic anomaly that occurred ~4.2 ka ago produced a drought in the northand flooding in the south, which was responsible for the collapse of neolithic cultures in the central plain of China during the late third millennium BC. … Fang and Sun (1998) first attributed the interruption of the Laohushan Culture to climatic cooling based on the impacts of ≥10°C cumulative temperature decreases on frost-free period in the lake region and of a temperature drop to agricultural production in areas along the Great Wall during the historical period. This interpretation has been followed by Tian (2000) and Tian and Guo (2004). As stated above, our multi-proxy data imply a decrease in regional precipitation rather than temperature.”
Klus et al., 2017     “Abrupt cold events have been detected in numerous North Atlantic climate records from the Holocene. … Here, we describe two cold events that occurred during an orbitally forced transient Holocene simulation using the Community Climate System Model version 3. Both events occurred during the late Holocene (event 1 referring to 4305-4267 BP [38 years] and event 2 referring to 3046-3018 BP [28 years]) and were characterized by substantial surface cooling (-2.7 and -2.2 °C, respectively [-0.71 °C/per decade and -0.78 °C/decade]) …  …  Northeast of Iceland, however, shows an increase in both SST and SSS, but a decline in sea ice concentration (event 1: warming of 1.6 °C [+0.42 °C/decade], rise of 0.7 PSU, decline of -5 % in sea ice concentration; event 2: warming of 1.9 °C [+0.68 °C/decade], rise of 0.9 PSU, decline of -11 % in sea ice concentration). … The events were triggered by prolonged phases of a positive North Atlantic Oscillation which, through changes in surface winds, caused substantial changes in the sub-polar ocean circulation and associated freshwater transports, resulting in a weakening of the sub-polar gyre. Our results suggest a possible mechanism by which abrupt cold events in the North Atlantic region may be triggered by internal climate variability without the need of an external (e.g. solar or volcanic) forcing.”

1-3°C Decadal-Scale Holocene Surface Cooling/Warming In the North Atlantic
In the subpolar North Atlantic, Holocene sea surface temperatures routinely rose and fell by 1°C to 3°C within a span of decades.
Berner et al., 2008  “Superimposed on general Holocene climate change is high-frequency [North Atlantic] SST [sea surface temperature] variability on the order of 1-3°C [during a ’10- to 50-year time resolution’].”

Modern Ocean Heat Content Changes So Minimal They Are “Below Detection”, While Holocene Ocean Temperature Changes Reached “>2 °C Within 200 Years”
According to Levitus et al. (2012), the global ocean heat content (0-2000 m layer) rose by a total of just 0.09°C during the 55 years between 1955 and 2010.   During the Holocene, temperatures in the 0-1000 m layer rose and/or fell by more than 2°C within 200 years, or 1°C per century.
Bova et al., 2016     “Rapid variations in deep ocean temperature detected in the Holocene … The observational record of deep-ocean variability is short, which makes it difficult to attribute the recent rise in deep ocean temperatures to anthropogenic forcing. Here, we test a new proxy – the oxygen isotopic signature of individual benthic foraminifera – to detect rapid (i.e. monthly to decadal) variations in deep ocean temperature and salinity in the sedimentary record. We apply this technique at 1000 m water depth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific during seven 200-year Holocene intervals. Variability in foraminifer δ18O [water temperature proxy] over the past 200 years is below the detection limit [a change or variability in ocean heat cannot be detected in the past 200 years], but δ18O signatures from two mid-Holocene intervals indicate [natural, unforced] temperature swings >2 °C within 200 years.”
Between 80,000 and 20,000 Years Ago, Temperatures Rose By 10°C And More Within Decades Dozens Of Times
Referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events occurring during the last glacial (~80,000 to 20,000 years ago), global temperatures would rise by multiple degrees within decades about every 1,500 years, each time nearly reaching the modern interglacial’s warmth before gradually cooling back down over the course of centuries.  The amplitude of these explosive warming events reached 10 to 15°C in Greenland.   As usual, CO2 concentrations did not change during these abrupt warming/cooling episodes, as they remained flat and dangerously low at 180 to 190 ppm throughout the last glacial.  Scientists have concluded that  “DO events are part of the natural variability and not externally triggered” (Shao and Ditlevsen, 2016).
Sánchez et al., 2017      “The estimated increases in Greenland atmospheric temperature were 5–16°C [Capron et al., 2010] and the duration of the warming events between 10 to 200 years [Steffensen et al., 2008].”

Lohmann and Ditlevsen, 2018    “During the last glacial period, lasting from approximately 120 to 12 kya BP (thousands of years before present), a large number of abrupt large-scale climate changes have been recorded in Greenland ice cores and other Northern Hemisphere climate proxies. These so-called Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events (Dansgaard et al., 1993) are characterized by an abrupt warming of 10–15 K from cold conditions (stadials) to warmer conditions (interstadials) within a few decades. This is typically followed by gradual cooling, lasting centuries to thousands of years, until a more abrupt jump back to cold conditions is observed. … In conclusion, we show that the long-term variations in DO warming event frequency, often described as millennial climate activity, are consistent with a memory-less stationary random process. From the data at hand we cannot exclude the possibility that the long-term variations occurred by chance. If we however divide a DO cycle into two independent processes governing warming and cooling, this is not true anymore and significant time-varying structure is detected. We thus propose a model that incorporates long-term variations through forcing of the parameters with external climate factors. We find good agreement with the data in a model where the mean duration of interstadial phases of the DO cycle is controlled by global ice volume and the stadial phases by boreal summer insolation.”
Jensen et al., 2017     “The Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial are some of the most prominent climate variations known from the past. Ice cores from Greenland show multiple temperature excursions during the last glacial period as the climate over Greenland alternated between cold stadial (Greenland Stadial, GS), and warmer interstadial (Greenland Interstadial, GI) conditions with a period of roughly 1500 years (Grootes and Stuiver, 1997). Each DO-event is characterised by an initial temperature rise of 10±5 °C toward GI [Greenland Interstadial] conditions in a few decades, a more gradual cooling over the following several hundreds of years, and a relatively rapid temperature drop back to GS at the end of most of the events (Johnsen et al., 1992; Dansgaard et al., 1993; North-Greenland-Ice-Core-project members, 2004; Kindler et al., 2014).DO-events are manifested not only in Greenland, but around the world.”
Hewitt et al., 2016     “Many northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period. These Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) sequences are observed most prominently in Greenland ice cores, although they havea global signature, including an out of phase Antarctic signal. They consist of warming jumps of order 10°C, occurring in typically 40 years, followed generally by a slow cooling (Greenland Interstadial, GI) lasting between a few centuries and a few millennia, and then a final rapid temperature drop into a cold Greenland Stadial (GS) that lasts for a similar period. … [S]teady changes in ice-sheet runoff, driven by the AMOC, lead to a naturally arising oscillator, in which the rapid warmings come about because the Arctic Ocean is starved of freshwater. The changing size of the ice sheets would have affected the magnitude and extent of runoff, and we suggest that this could provide a simple explanation for the absence of the events during interglacials and around the time of glacial maxima.”
Rasmussen et al., 2016  (press release)      “Extreme climate changes in the past Ice core records show that Greenland went through 25 extreme and abrupt climate changes during the last ice age some 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. In less than 50 years the air temperatures over Greenland could increase by 10 to 15 °C. However the warm periods were short; within a few centuries the frigid temperatures of the ice age returned. That kind of climate change would have been catastrophic for us today.  Ice core records from Antarctica also show climate changes in the same period, but they are more gradual, with less severe temperature swings.”
Jensen et al., 2016      “Proxy data suggests a large variability in the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice cover during the Dansgaard Oeschger (DO) events of the last glacial. However, the mechanisms behind these changes are still debated. … Based on our analysis, we suggest that the variability of the subpolar gyre during the analyzed DO event can be explained by internal variability of the climate system alone. Further research is needed to explain whether the lacking amplitude in the Nordic Seas is due to the model deficiencies or if external forcing or some feedback mechanisms could give rise to larger SST variability.”
Agosta and Compagnucci, 2016        “The climate in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) —roughly between 80,000 years before present (B.P.) and 20,000 years B.P., within the last glacial period—is characterized by great instability, with opposing climate transitions including at least six colder Heinrich (H) events and fourteen warmer Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) events. …  During the D-O events, the high-latitude warming occurred abruptly (probably in decades to centuries), reaching temperatures close to interglacial conditions. Even though H and D-O events seemed to have been initiated in the North Atlantic Ocean, they had a global footprint. Global climate anomalies were consistent with a slowdown of AMOC and reduced ocean heat transport into the northern high latitudes.”
Olsen, 2016     “The most frequent abrupt stadial/interstadial changes retained from the marine sediments are known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles, and appear every 1-2 kyr. These cycles are characterized by abrupt short-lived increase in temperatures (10 ± 5°C) followed by gradual cooling preceding the next rapid event. A second millennial scale feature detected in the sediments record is cooling events culminating significant iceberg discharges analogous to Heinrich events. Mechanisms triggering abrupt changes display uncertainties, but leading hypothesis is attributed to modifications in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and deep-water formation initiated by freshwater input.”
Mayewski, 2016       “The demonstration using Greenland ice cores that abrupt shifts in climate, Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events, existed during the last glacial period has had a transformational impact on our understanding of climate change in the naturally forced world. The demonstration that D-O events are globally distributed and that they operated during previous glacial periods has led to extensive research into the relative hemispheric timing and causes of these events. The emergence of civilization during our current interglacial, the Holocene, has been attributed to the “relative climate quiescence” of this period relative to the massive, abrupt shifts in climate that characterized glacial periods in the form of D-O events.”
Bogotá-A et al., 2016       “We reconstructed upper forest line (UFL) positions between ~2000 and ~3400 m elevation and the most abrupt temperature shifts ranged up to 10 °C/100 yr at Terminations II and III. Regional vegetation change is mainly driven by eccentricity (100 kyr) and obliquity (41 kyr) cycles, while changes in local aquatic vegetation show variability in the obliquity and precession (21 kyr) bands. Millennial-scale climate variability reflecting Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) climate cycles in the upper part of the record, continues in this penultimate intergalcial–glacial cycle strongly suggesting that this variability has a persistent character in Pleistocene vegetation and climate dynamics.”
Shao and Ditlevsen, 2016       “The glacial climate is dominated by the strong multi-millennial Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events influencing the long-time correlation. However, by separately analysing the last glacial maximum lacking DO events, here we find the same scaling for that period as for the full glacial period. The unbroken scaling thus indicates that the DO events are part of the natural variability and not externally triggered.”
Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017     “Abrupt changes in climate have occurred in many locations around the globe over the last glacial cycle, with pronounced temperature swings on timescales of decades or less in the North Atlantic. The global pattern of these changes suggests that they reflect variability in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). … In many locations in the Northern Hemisphere, abrupt changes in climate have occurred that span almost the full range of glacial to interglacial conditions, with the transition between climate states occurring in decades or less (Alley & Clark 1999, Voelker 2002). These abrupt climate changes are most clearly recorded in the climate records from glacial ice on Greenland (Andersen et al. 2004) and are referred to as DansgaardOeschger (D-O) events. The warm intervals are referred to as interstadials, and the cold intervals are referred to as stadials. … [T]he prevailing paradigm is that the abrupt climate changes are a result of changes in the northward transport of heat by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (Broecker et al. 1985, Clark et al. 2002, Rahmstorf 2002).”
Climate Modeling Rooted In CO2-Driven Temperature Change Cannot Reproduce This Variability 
In writing about the abrupt, global-scale climate changes during the 8.2 ka event that do not follow modeled expectations of an anthropogenically-driven modern climate, (Atwood et al., 2017) wrote:
“These events stretch our understanding of the dynamical principles that govern the climate system, given the lack of these events in the modern record and the inability of climate models to reproduce such variability.”   
Indeed, considering how profound past climate changes have been in the absence of CO2 fluctuations relative to the modest (0.05°C per decade) temperature changes of the last 150 years with pronounced CO2 rise, there does not appear to be a non-political justification for focusing our attention on CO2 as a driver of climate change.
Another abrupt global cooling event in line with the 8.2 ka or 4.2 ka may be in store for us in the coming decades.  And if it does happen, we will be powerless to stop it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman ZDF public television recently broadcast a report showing how electric cars are a far cry from being what they are all cracked up to be by green activists.

Northern Chilean desert being ruined by widespread lithium mining. Image cropped from ZDF documentary: Die Schattenseiten der E-Mobilität
The report titled: “Batteries in twilight – The dark side of e-mobility” shows how the mining of raw materials needed for producing the massive automobile batteries is highly destructive to the environment. For example, two thirds of the cobalt currently comes from the Congo, where the mining rights have been acquired by China. Other materials needed include manganese, lithium and graphite.
Every electric car battery needs about 20 – 30 kg of lithium.
The mining of the raw materials often takes place in third world countries where workers are forced to work under horrendous conditions and no regard is given to protecting the environment. When it comes to “going green”, it seems everything flies out the window.
Immense water consumption
The report shows that one source of the lithium is the desert of northern Chile. Everyday at the mine shown some 21 million liters of ground water get pumped to the surface, where it evaporates and a sludge with 6% lithium content gets shipped to processing plants. The operations are transforming the Chilean desert landscape into a vast industrial wasteland.
Precious vegetation shriveling up
The Chilean lithium mining operations are pumping out what little precious groundwater that remains and ruining the living basis of the local population. What little vegetation there was to begin with is now dying due to falling water tables. Overall, mining operations are expected to expand four-fold within the next decade and the mining companies profit while the local citizens lose their livelihoods.

Car companies turning a blind eye
The automotive companies, the buyers of the lithium batteries insist that they have strict requirements in the sourcing of their products and make sure it is done in a sustainable way. Obviously they are having little effect.
Congolese slave labor for China
Today’s batteries for e-cars also require approx. 10 – 15 kg of cobalt, where two thirds of which comes from authoritarian Republic of the Congo. The mining rights are owned by Chinese companies. Here as well the benefits of the mining operations do not find their way to the local residents, who are forced live under horrendous conditions.
Privately operated local companies are not allowed, unless the authorities are paid bribes to look the other way. In these rogue operations, work conditions are primitive and extremely dangerous. The ZDF reports that some 20% of Congolese cobalt is extracted in this manner. Profits do not find their way down to the miners.
Child labor
Meanwhile the ground around the mining villages are now perforated with vertical shafts that pose a constant danger to children who risk falling into them. Work conditions for the miners themselves is extremely dangerous. The money they earn is not enough to provide for their families. Children are forced to work and do not go to school.
Chinese companies control most of the lithium supply chain, ZDF reports, and miners are cheated by them. The valuable raw material makes its way to China, where it gets processed for the manufacture electric batteries, according to Dr. Mathias John of Amnesty International. Congolese cobalt likely is contained in the car batteries of German electric cars.
German automakers such as Mercedes insist that they make effort to ensure that their supply chains “exclusively process cobalt from industrial mines that have the proper sustainability standards.”
As electric cars begin to flood global markets, the environmental and social destruction of third world countries where the precious minerals are mined will reach ghastly proportions. The promised green utopia will remain a an illusion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEven though CO2 concentrations hovered well below 300 ppm throughout most of the Holocene, newly published paleoclimate reconstructions affirm that today’s surface temperatures are only slightly warmer (if at all) than the coldest periods of the last 10,000 years.  This contradicts the perspective that temperatures rise in concert with CO2 concentrations.

1. Even Past Cold Periods Were 0.5–1.5 °С Warmer Than Today
Nosova et al., 2018
“According to the present climate reconstruction, mid Holocene warming started only at 7,700 cal bp, with temperatures higher than now during the mid Holocene period. This warming was due to an increase in winter temperatures (1–5 °С higher than current), while summer temperatures remained relatively stable, with a July temperature<1 °С higher than now. … During the mid Holocene, two cold periods at 6,900–6,500 and at 5,300–5,000 cal bp were observed. Interestingly, during the cold periods, the temperatures exceeded the current ones by 0.5–1.5 °С.”
“The transition from the mid Holocene thermal maximum to the following period occurred without considerable climatic changes. The mean annual temperatures remained much higher than the current ones by 0.5–2.5 °С until 2,500 cal bp. Local maximum temperatures were observed at 4,800, 4,300, 3,500 and 2,900–2,700 cal bp. The present climatic reconstruction demonstrates a gradual cooling down to current levels at ca. 2,500 cal bp, and then followed by a new warming phase with up to 1–2 °С increase at approximately 1,500 cal bp.”

2. Only 3 Of 116 Holocene Temperature Anomaly Records Were Colder Than Today
Bajolle et al., 2018
“The mean annual temperature recorded at the closest meteorological station [La Sarre: 1961–1990] is 0.8 °C, with August temperature averages of 15.0 °C (1961–1990) and 15.4 °C (1981–2010). … During zone Lch1 (8500–5800 cal year BP), the average reconstructed temperature was 16.9 °C, with a decrease from 19 °C (maximum) to 17 °C at the end of the zone. In zone Lch-2 (ca. 5700–3500 cal year BP), temperatures had an average of 16.8 °C, with a decrease from 17.8 °C around 5200 cal year BP to 16.2 °C at 3400 cal year BP. Zone Lch-3 (ca. 3500–1200 cal year BP) started with inferences for high temperatures (19.3–18.5 °C), followed by a decrease to 16.8 °C between ca. 3000 and 2500 cal year BP. An increase (18.3 and 19.6 °C) was inferred for the period between 1800 and 1500 cal year BP. The average chironomid inferred temperature during Zone 3 was 17.9 °C. In the last zone (Lch-4), the temperatures decreased from ca. 17.5 °C at the beginning of the zone to 14.8 °C at the end of the zone. The average during this zone was 16.5 °C. The temperature anomalies show that throughout the whole record, only six of the inferences were colder than the climate normal of 15.4 °C and three were colder than today, with the climate normal of 15 °C (Fig. 4b). The average anomaly from 15 °C (2.10 °C) and from 15.4 °C (1.70 °C) for the whole record showed that the temperature inferences were generally, and significantly, warmer than today.”

3. New England (USA) Colder Now Than Nearly All Of The Last 11,000 Years
Oswald et al., 2018

4. Today’s Temperatures Still Just As Cold As The Global Little Ice Age
Coffinet et al., 2018
“This study represents the first detailed late Holocene quantitative air temperature reconstruction from the RVP [Rungwe Volcanic Province, southwestern Tanzania/East Africa] region. We identified a succession of cold/warm/cold events, largely in phase with the other regional East African climate records and with the cold periods identified worldwide by Wanner et al. (2011). This further supports that global scale processes may be the main drivers of the Holocene climatic variability. Moreover, warm conditions during the MCA [Medieval Climate Anomaly] followed by abrupt cooling during the LIA were observed at Kyambangunguru and elsewhere in East Africa suggesting that these two recent events occurred globally.”

5. Modern Temperatures -2.9°C Colder Than 7,000 Years Ago
Zhao et al., 2018
“According to the interpolation of meteorological data of the two nearest weather stations at Linxia (ca. 46 km away; MAT [mean annual temperature] = 7.3 °C) and Minhe (ca. 54 km away; MAT [mean annual temperature] = 8.3 °C)… In this study, we reconstructed mid-late Holocene climatic changes using GDGT distributions in a loess-paleosol sequence in the Lajia Ruins of the Neolithic Qijia Culture, Guanting Basin, in the southwestern end of the Chinese Loess Plateau. … MAT [mean annual temperature] decreased from 11.9 °C to 8.0 °C [today], during the past ca. 7000 yr, and a drastic decline in MAP [mean annual precipitation] (70 mm), accompanied by a 0.8 °C decline in MAT [mean annual temperature], occurred at 3800–3400 yr BP.”

6. Temperatures “7–9°C Higher Than Modern during The Early Holocene”
Zheng et al., 2018
“In this study we present a detailed GDGT data set covering the last 13,000 years from a peat sequence in the Changbai Mountain in NE China. The brGDGT-based temperature reconstruction from Gushantun peat indicates that mean annual air temperatures in NE China during the early Holocene were 5–7°C higher than today.  Furthermore, MAAT records from the Chinese Loess Plateau also suggested temperature maxima 7–9°C higher than modern during the early Holocene (Peterse et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2013). Consequently, we consider the temperatures obtained using the global peat calibration to be representative of climate in (NE) China. … The highest temperatures occurred between ca. 8 and 6.8 kyr BP, with occasional annual mean temperatures >8.0 ± 4.7°C, compared to the modern-day MAAT of ∼3°C.”

7. 1950-2015 Just 0.7°C Warmer Than Coldest Temps Of The Last 9,000 Years
Harning et al., 2018
“Iceland’s terrestrial HTM [Holocene Thermal Maximum] has previously been constrained to ~7.9 to 5.5 ka based on qualitative lake sediment proxies (Larsen et al., 2012; Geirsdottir et al., 2013), likely in association with progressive strengthening and warming of the Irminger Current (Castaneda et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005; Olafsdottir et al., 2010). Numerical modeling experiments for Drangajokull suggest that peak air temperatures were 2.5 – 3°C warmer at this time relative to the 1961-1990 CE average (Anderson et al., 2018). … During the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1250-1850 CE), the Vestfirðir region entered the lowest multi centennial spring/summer temperature anomalies of the last 9 ka.  Based on recent numerical  modeling simulations, this anomaly is estimated to be 0.6-0.8°C below the 1950-2015 average on Vestfirðir (Anderson et al., 2018).”


8. 2004-2007 Temps Colder Than All But 3 Other Holocene Periods
Wang et al., 2018   
“The average RAN15-MAAT of 18.4°C over the most recent part of the record (<0.8 ka BP) [the last 800 years BP] overlaps with the range of MAATs, ca. 16.2°C to 18.7°C (av. 17.5°C) measured since 1952 at the nearest meteorological station (Yichang, located ca. 100 km away) and is very close to the av. MAAT of 18°C measured directly outside the cave by a temperature logger between 2004 and 2007 (Hu et al., 2008a). This agreement between reconstructed temperatures and instrumental measurements increases our confidence in the potential of the RAN15 proxy. RAN15-MAATs in HS4 vary from 16.5°C to 20.6°C (av. 19°C), during the last 9 ka BP, and broadly follow a long-term trend of declining temperatures in line with declining solar insolation at 30°N in July (Laskar et al., 2004). … Interestingly, the most recent 0.9 ka BP [900 years BP] is distinguished by greater variability with the highest (20.5°C) and lowest (16.5°C) RAN15-MAATs occurring consecutively at 0.6 ka BP [600 years BP] and 0.5 ka BP [500 years BP].” [Surface temperatures dropped by -4.0°C within ~100 years.]

9. 1952-2014 Temps 4.0 to 7.0 °C Colder Than 8,000 – 10,000 Years Ago
McFarlin et al., 2018
“(Greenland)  Early Holocene peak warmth has been quantified at only a few sites, and terrestrial sedimentary records of prior interglacials are exceptionally rare due to glacial erosion during the last glacial period. Here, we discuss findings from a lacustrine archive that records both the Holocene and the Last Interglacial (LIG) from Greenland, allowing for direct comparison between two interglacials. Sedimentary chironomid assemblages indicate peak July temperatures [Greenland] 4.0 to 7.0 °C warmer than modern during the Early Holocene maximum [10,000 to 8,000 years ago] in summer insolation. Chaoborus and chironomids in LIG sediments indicate July temperatures at least 5.5 to 8.5 °C warmer than modern.”

Modern Derived Temps 0.2°C Above Coldest Of Last 14,000 Years
Wu et al., 2018
“Summer temperatures (MJT) at Xingyun Lake in the late glacial were low, increased during the early Holocene, were highest during the middle Holocene, and then decreased during the late Holocene.The range of inferred values [for the Holocene] was 21.0°- 26.5°C. The pollen inferred temperature derived from surface samples (21.2°C), is close to the modern instrumental July temperature in Kunming (22°C), supporting the reliability of reconstructions from down-core pollen assemblages.”

A Bottom-Up Heat Flux?
The deep ocean may warm hundreds (to thousands) of years before hemispheric surface temperatures and CO2 concentrations do (Stott et al., 2007).
Image Source: Stott et al., 2007
This bottom-up hemispheric-scale heat flux – independent of CO2-forcing – may occur for land area as well.
“The increase of carbon dioxide concentrations occurred 2–3 thousands of years later than the heat flux increase and synchronously with temperature response.”  (Demezhko and Gornostaeva, 2015)
“GST [ground surface temperature] and SHF [surface heat flux] histories differ substantially in shape and chronology. Heat flux changes ahead of temperature changes by 500–1000 years.” (Demezhko et al., 2017)
 “During the Last Glacial Maximum 26–19 thousand years ago (ka), a vast ice sheet stretched over North America [Clark et al., 2009]. In subsequent millennia, as climate warmed and this ice sheet decayed, large volumes of meltwater flooded to the oceans [Tarasov and Peltier, 2006; Wickert, 2016]. This period, known as the ‘last deglaciation’, included episodes of abrupt climate change, such as the Bølling warming [~14.7–14.5 ka], when Northern Hemisphere temperatures increased by 4–5°C in just a few decades [Lea et al., 2003; Buizert et al., 2014], coinciding with a 12–22 m sea level rise in less than 340 years [5.3 meters per century] (Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP1a)) [Deschamps et al., 2012].” (Ivanovic et al., 2017)
Deep ocean heat leads surface temperature change yet today?
A new paper indicates that the deep ocean in the Pacific has continued cooling in recent decades, extending the long-term cooling trend that commenced after the warmer-than-today Medieval Warm Period ended.
Other authors (Wunsch and Heimbach, 2014) have also documented a global-scale deep ocean (below 2,000 meters) cooling trend within the last few decades.
“About 52% of the ocean lies below 2000 m and about 18% below 3600 m. … A very weak long-term [1993-2011] cooling is seen over the bulk of the rest of the ocean below that depth [2,000 meters] including the entirety of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, along with the eastern Atlantic basin.”  (Wunsch and Heimbach, 2014)

Image Source: (Wunsch and Heimbach, 2014)
Little Ice Age conditions may still dominate in the deep ocean despite the dramatic rise in CO2 concentrations during the last few hundred years — from about 280 ppm during the late 1700s to well over 400 ppm today.

The global ocean below 2000 meters may actually be colder today than during the 18th century.

Gebbie and Huybers, 2019
The Little Ice Age and 20th-century deep Pacific cooling
“The ongoing deep Pacific is cooling, which revises Earth’s overall heat budget since 1750 downward by 35%.”
“In the deep Pacific, we find basin-wide cooling ranging from 0.02° to 0.08°C at depths between 1600 and 2800 m that is also statistically significant. The basic pattern of Atlantic warming and deep-Pacific cooling diagnosed from the observations is consistent with our model results, although the observations indicate stronger cooling trends in the Pacific.” 
“These basin-wide average trends are used to relax the assumption of globally uniform changes in surface conditions and to constrain regional temperature histories for 14 distinct regions over the Common Era by a control theory method. The result, referred to as OPT-0015, fits the observed vertical structure of Pacific cooling and Atlantic warming. Global surface changes still explain the basic Atlantic-Pacific difference in OPT-0015, but greater Southern Ocean cooling between 600 and 1600 CE leads to greater rates of cooling in the deep Pacific over recent centuries.”
“OPT-0015 indicates that the upper 2000 m of the ocean has been gaining heat since the 1700s, but that one-fourth of this heat uptake was mined from the deeper ocean. This upper-lower distinction is most pronounced in the Pacific since 1750, where cooling below 2000 m offsets more than one-third of the heat gain above 2000 m.”
“Finally, we note that OPT-0015 indicates that ocean heat content was larger during the Medieval Warm Period than at present, not because surface temperature was greater, but because the deep ocean had a longer time to adjust to surface anomalies. Over multicentennial time scales, changes in upper and deep ocean heat content have similar ranges, underscoring how the deep ocean ultimately plays a leading role in the planetary heat budget.”

A lack of long-term CO2→OHC correlation 
It may be worth a closer look at the graph of global ocean heat content (OHC, 0 m-bottom) during the last 2,000 years from Gebbie and Huybers (2019).

Image Source (bottom graph, heavily annotated): Gebbie and Huybers, 2019
It is interesting to note the multiple centennial-scale warming and cooling trends during the last two millennia that exceed the rate and amplitude of the ocean heat changes that have occurred since 1950, or since atmospheric CO2 concentrations began rising dramatically.
For example, despite the very modest  associated changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (< 5 ppm), it appears that both the 1850-1875 and 1925-1945 global warming periods in the 0-700 m layer exceeded the rate and amplitude of the heat content changes since 1950.
As the global oceans rapidly warmed and cooled in the centuries preceding modern times (i.e., the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age), the corresponding CO2 concentrations were remarkably stable, neither rising with the warming or falling with the cooling.
Considering 93% of the Earth’s heat changes are expressed in the global ocean, and that just 1% of global warming is said to be reflected in surface air temperatures (IPCC, 2013), the lack of conspicuous correlation between ocean heat content and CO2 during the last 2,000 years would seem to undermine claims that atmospheric CO2 concentration changes drive zero-to-bottom global ocean warming.

=====================================================
Reduction of CO2 emissions possibly would have no effect on climate over the coming 20 years


By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Jochem Marotzke, director of Germany’s Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPIM), wondered whether CO2 savings could really have a direct influence on the temperature in the near future. In a new paper (Marotzke 2018), the Hamburg-based climate researcher simulates the temperature profile of the 2030s predicted by climate models and uses once again a conventional emission profile (Scenario RCP 4.5), and once a politically reduced emission scenario. 
Conclusion: Most likely, there would probably be no difference as natural climate variability prevails over these time scales. The paper was published in WIRE’s Climate Change and can be downloaded free of charge as a pdf:

Quantifying the irreducible uncertainty in near‐term climate projections
If the Paris agreement at the Conference of Parties 21 is implemented very effectively, greenhouse‐gas emissions might decrease after year 2020. Whether this would lead to identifiable near‐term responses in “iconic” climate quantities of wide scientific and public interest is unclear, because the climate response would be obscured by quasi‐random internal variability. I define the climate response as an increase or decrease in a linear climate trend over the period 2021–2035, compared to 2006–2020, and establish the probability of such a trend change being caused by an assumed policy shift toward emissions reductions after 2020. I quantify the irreducible uncertainty in projecting such a trend change through very large (100‐member) ensembles of the state‐of‐the‐art climate model MPI‐ESM‐LR. Trends in global‐mean surface temperature (GMST) are higher over the period 2021–2035 than over 2006–2020 in one‐third of all realizations in the mitigation scenario RCP2.6, interpreted as implementing the Paris agreement, compared to around one‐half in the no‐mitigation scenario RCP4.5. Mitigation is sufficient to cause a GMST trend reduction with a probability of 0.40 and necessary with a probability of 0.33. Trend increases in Arctic September sea‐ice area and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are caused by the emissions reductions with a probability of only around 0.1. By contrast, emissions reductions are necessary for a trend decrease in upper‐ocean heat content with a probability of over one‐half. Some iconic climate quantities might thus by year 2035 exhibit an identifiable response to a successful Paris agreement but sometimes with low probability, creating a substantial communication challenge.”

In the conclusion, there are some even clearer statements. Marotzke warns that even painful efforts to reduce CO2 in the next two decades could have little impact on the climate:
My thought experiment demonstrates that it is crucial to have realistic expectations of the efficacy of climate policy in the near‐term: Even if greenhouse‐gas emissions begin to decline after year 2020, the probability is substantial that the response of iconic climate quantities to this decline will not have emerged by year 2035.”

Science communication challenge
With 90% probability, the Arctic Sea Ice (SIA) and the Gulf Stream (AMOC) will not respond to changes in CO2 emissions in the 2030s. Marotzke already sees a great communication challenge for the scientists, similar to the unexpected hiatus of recent years.

The major advance brought about by my analysis lies in the ability to quantify the degree of irreducible uncertainty about whether the assumed emissions reduction will cause the desired climate response over a given timescale. The probability of this response occurring depends on the quantity in question but also on the type of causation; for the time horizon out to 2035 the probability lies here in the range between a bit under 0.1 for causation both sufficient and necessary for SIA and AMOC and a bit above one‐half for necessary causation for ocean heat content.
Communicating these probabilities will be nontrivial but will be aided by the precise definitions and meanings underlying them (Hannart et al., 2016; Pearl, 2000). The communication challenge (Deser et al., 2012) furthermore supports the notion that the recent hiatus was not a distraction to the scientific community (Lewandowsky, Risbey, & Oreskes, 2016) but instead provided an opportunity to communicate the role of internal variability (Fyfe et al., 2016) to an audience that might otherwise be disinclined to engage in this discourse.”


The climate sciences continue to navigate in difficult waters. The natural variability causes them huge problems because it has been neglected in the models.
Alarmist dreams
Marotzke still dreams that nature only produces noise (“quasi-random internal variability”). However, the day will surely come when he will also acknowledge the systematic effect of natural climate factors such as ocean cycles and solar activity fluctuations. Perhaps he should start to take an interest in paleoclimatology, which is leaving him in the dust…

Image Source: Larcombe and Ridd, 2018
Within a matter of days after the press release for a newly published Nature paper spewed the usual it’s-worse-than-we-thought headlines throughout the alarmosphere (Washington Post, BBC, New York Times), the paper’s results were assessed to have “major problems” by an author of multiple CO2 climate sensitivity papers (Lewis and Curry, 2015, 2018).
A glaring miscalculation was quickly spotted that changed not only the results, but consequently undermined the conclusion that estimates of climate sensitivity to doubled CO2 may be too low.
And yet the paper was able to pass through peer review anyway.
Dr. Michael Mann’s error-riddled 2016 paper
A few years ago Dr. Michael Mann was the lead author of an embarrassingly non-scientific paper fraught with glaring methodological and statistical errors.
A post-publication reviewer (statistician Dr. William Briggs) wrote in his point-by-point critique of the paper that “Mann’s errors are in no way unique or rare; indeed, they are banal and ubiquitous.”
Despite the glaring errors, the paper made it through peer-review and was published in Nature‘s Scientific Reports journal anyway.
“Hoax” papers can get published in 70% of peer-reviewed journals
Analyses indicate that “fake peer review” often goes undetected, and as many as 7 of 10 peer-reviewed journals are apt to publish a deliberately-written “hoax” paper.
“Any reviewer with more than a high-school knowledge of chemistry and the ability to understand a basic data plot should have spotted the paper’s shortcomings immediately. Its experiments are so hopelessly flawed that the results are meaningless. … The hoax paper was accepted by a whopping 157 of the journals and rejected by only 98. Of the 106 journals that did conduct peer review, 70% accepted the paper…”  (Murphy, 2017  The Failure of Peer Review)
A new paper cites analyses that find half of peer-reviewed science results are flawed, not replicable

Earlier this year, a review paper (Larcombe and Ridd, 2018) published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin delivered a stinging rebuke to the modern version of science’s disturbing lack of replicability and verifiability.

Image Source: Larcombe and Ridd, 2018
The authors go on to detail a large volume of examples when peer-review failed to detect errors in Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coral research.
Confirmation bias appears to permeate the peer-reviewed literature, slanted in the direction of finding evidence for catastrophic decline in coral health.  This isn’t the first time that marine research has been called out for overselling calamity (see Cressey, 2015, “Ocean ‘calamities’ oversold, say researchers – Team calls for more scepticism in marine research.”) and falling “into a mode of groupthink that can damage the credibility of the ocean sciences”.
As just a single example among the many provided, Larcombe and Ridd reviewed the De’ath et al. (2009) study in which an “unprecedented” decline in GBR corals was alleged to have occurred between 1990-2005.
After a reanalysis of the measurements and methods used, Larcombe and Ridd used corrected data to show there has actually been “a small increase in the growth rate” of corals since the early 1900s (see below image) instead of the dramatic decline after the 1990s documented in the peer-reviewed paper.
These errors slipped past the reviewers’ notice too.   The publication of flawed results has seemingly become so common that it’s no longer even surprising.
“This paper [De’ath et al. (2009): Declining coral calcification on the Great Barrier Reef.] studied 328 corals on the GBR, and indicated a 14% reduction in growth rates between 1990 and 2005. It stated that the corals of the GBR are declining “at a rate unprecedented in coral records reaching back 400 years”. Subsequent reanalysis of the data indicated that the apparent recent reduction in growth rate was caused by a) problems with the physical measurements of calcification, which systematically biased recent growth bands to give lower growth rates (D’Olivio et al., 2013; Ridd et al., 2013), and b) an unjustified assumption that coral growth rate does not change with the age of the coral (Ridd et al., 2013). With these taken into account, the dramatic fall in growth rate after 1990 is no longer evident, and a small increase in growth rates since the early 1900’s appears (Fig. 6). Further, D’Olivio et al. (2013), working on a different set of GBR corals, showed an increase in coral calcification rates on middle and outer shelf reefs, which together represent 99% of GBR corals, of 10% for the period ~1950 to ~2005, but a decrease of 5% per decade between 1930 and 2008 on inner-shelf reefs, which represent only 1% of GBR corals. Therefore, it would be hard to glean from these datasets that there is a documented decline in coral ‘growth’ parameters, and even harder to attribute change to a particular cause.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterCharlatans exposed…when sham predictions clash with reality
Yesterday Japanese blogger Kirye prepared a chart (below) depicting Arctic sea ice volume since 2006, the year Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth (AIT) was released, and just a year or two before a spate of ice-free-Arctic-by-2013 (or earlier) predictions were issued by a number of “experts”, which of course the fake news media lapped up.

Source: Japanese skeptic blogger Kirye.
Arctic did the opposite of what the experts forecast
As Kirye’s chart above shows, Arctic sea ice volume in reality has since increased since all the doomsday predictions of 10 years ago. The very opposite of what was confidently predicted has in fact taken place.
Same level as in the 1930s, when CO2 was far lower
Naturally the alarmists like using the sea ice extent chart that goes back to 1979, which shows a clear downward trend because 1979 was at a peak for Arctic sea ice.
However, when we look at charts depicting Arctic sea ice since 1900, we see that today’s Arctic sea ice situation is in fact similar to what we experienced some 80-90 years ago:

Chart: Alekseev et al, 2016. 
A false prediction is a false prediction

That Arctic sea ice has declined significantly since about 1970 is not the point here. The real story is all the bold predictions of an ice-free Arctic that were made at the time just after AIT was released, and how they all failed resoundingly.
To illustrate the point very clearly, I used Kirye’s plot and added those expert’s predictions so we can see how they all fare compared to reality:

Total failure of the ten-year forecasts made by “experts”. 
Even 10-year forecasts are total failures – can we trust 50-year forecasts?
These “experts” couldn’t even get the forecast for the next 10 years correct. So how are we supposed to take them seriously with their “robust” climate forecasts for the next 20, 50 or 100 years?
The latest idiotic, charlatan quality prediction comes from hockey-stick maker and climate-alarm hustler Dr. Michael Mann, who recently said that Trump’s legacy, beginning in 2024, will be “a charred planet”.
Glaring failure needs to be followed by swift firings
In private industries, where forecasts really count, persons with such a track record of undisputed glaring failure would have been given the boot long ago, and in many cases even sued for outright fraud.
The death spirals and ice-free Arctic predicted for 2013 to 2018 never came to pass. And by ice-free, they implied this would be the case in the later summer year after year.
It’s time for NASA and other climate institutes to clean house and re-staff with serious, competent scientists. As a taxpayer I’m fed up with all the garbage, nonsense and local climate ambulance chasing they’ve been giving us year after year. We the people have the right to get something of value for our money.
And it’s high time we start thinking about suing for fraud.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy daughter will be visiting Wilmington next week, and so Hurricane Florence has been very much on my mind.
Days ago, almost all weather models showed the cyclone curving out into the North Atlantic and going nowhere, but they’ve turned out to be wrong.
Bastardi saw it a week ago
Already a week ago veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi got into the act, and his hunch did not quite agree with the models. On September 1st he brought up the real possibility of Florence missing the turn to the north, and instead heading out to the US east coast. What follows is the chart Joe used on his September 2 Daily Update:

On September 2nd, Joe Bastardi warned Florence could head to the US east coast. Chart: Weatherbell.
Today we already know that Joe’s forecast of Gordon was accurate, and now we are seeing that his hunch of Florence missing the turn to the north was right on.
On his Daily Update of Wednesday, September 5, it was becoming clear Florence had little intention of turning northward as Joe’s chart tells us:

By September 5 Joe had already sniffed out the likely general track. – more than a week before Florence is forecast to strike the east coast. Chart: Weatherbell. 
A day later at his Daily Update, on Thursday (September 6), ahead of everyone else, Joe showed Florence generating into a monster Category 4 storm and on a possible path to the Carolinas:

Chart: Weatherbell
Models can’t handle longer term forecasting – analogs needed
How does he do it? The veteran meteorologist not only uses models to make his forecasts, but relies heavily on analogs, i.e. similar recorded patterns having frequently occurred in the past. It’s happened before, and similar events can happen again.
His method often allows him to be days ahead of the purely mathematical models used by leading weather agencies, who find themselves constantly correcting them with every run. So today we wait with suspense to see Joe’s latest news on Florence’s projected track.
Models not in agreement
Though the latest forecasts from the different models are just about unanimous on Florence plowing into US coast (with still a small chance of curving out northward before reaching land) they are still in disagreement where the hurricane will strike the coast.
GFS model
Dr. Ryan Maue at Twitter informs the US GFS model has Florence landfalling on the coast of NORTH CAROLINA:

No change from the GFS model for #Florence … still a major hurricane landfall somewhere in the Carolinas by Thursday next week.

Since the track is curved, a small deviation or change in forward speed could yield a different landfall point or even a miss offshore. pic.twitter.com/1ImFP9UUuW
— Ryan Maue | weathermodels.com (@RyanMaue) September 8, 2018

UKMET model
Ben Noll at Twitter reports that the latest UKMet model run shows Florence going much further south, making landfall near the Florida-Georgia border!
European model
Meanwhile this morning Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann points out that the European model has Florence aiming between the GFS and UKMet models. Again the models are purely mathematical computations and do not directly take analogues into consideration like Joe Bastardi does.
Also see Ben Noll’s recent tweet here.
So follow Joe Bastardi’s daily updates at Weatherbell for the latest refined projections. Joe often sides with the European model.
Keep in mind, as every meteorologist knows, weather is highly unpredictable, and so surprises can never be excluded.
Here come the climate ambulance chasers!
One thing is certain: the global warming ambulance chasers and fake CNN-type media will be making all sorts of hysterical claims once Florence hits the coast. Naturally, despite all their climate “expertise”, none of these climate doomsday prophesiers ever had a clue about what track Florence would follow days ago.
Yet they’ll be the first (after the fact) to claim they predicted this sort of thing all along, and blame it on manmade climate change. The reality is that hurricanes have been trending downward over the past 50 years.
Media will blare Florence’s unusual track “unprecedented!”
What’s interesting about Florence is its relatively high latitude start position. As Dr. Philip Klotzback mentioned at Twitter, in the past no hurricane at Florence’s position ever managed to make it to the US east coast. All of them have turned away and disappeared somewhere in the Atlantic:

33 named storms (since 1851) have been within 100 miles of #Florence's current position.  None of these storms made US landfall.  The closest approach was #Hurricane George (1950) – the highlighted track.  However, Florence does not appear to be taking a climatological track. pic.twitter.com/4x02pasgPg
— Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 7, 2018

Get ready for insane climate headlines
But Florence has managed to find its own track to the US east coast. So expect the global warming ambulance chasing scientists to call it “UNPRECEDENTED!” and say it must be because of human emissions of CO2! The media will accept it as Gospel Truth and go crazy with hysterical headlines. The USA Today here has already begun using the “unprecedented” label.
So what would Joe Bastardi, the person who was first to forecast the event, say about it? Joe will tell you it’s all natural, and not because of humans emitting some CO2 into the air.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online Basel BAZ news site reported yesterday how the Yellow Vest fossil fuel tax protests have spread across Belgium and into the Netherlands, and so threaten to become a European phenomenon.
Previously it was thought that a move away from fossil fuels and higher taxes on them were the will of the people in Europe, and so citizens would readily accept higher taxes on them in order to get society to adopt the lean green energy diet. However that has suddenly turned out to be a gross misinterpretation by policymakers and activists.
Climate activists speechless – devastating signal
As the Yellow Vest protests intensify and spread, activists and delegates in Poland find themselves speechless as the begin to realize that a comprehensive transitioning over to green energies is not going to happen any time soon because their proposals are unmistakably generating anger. The signal to the world from France could not be more devastating to the climate protection movement.
The French have sent a loud and clear message.
The BAZ writes that the European governments are so spooked by the anger that in Brussels institutions such as the EU Commission, the EU Counsel and the EU Parliament had to be completely sealed off because of the demonstration. Police arrested some 100 protesters early as a preventive measure to keep the protest from escalating out of control.
Fuel taxes hurt the poor
Also police in the Netherlands sealed off Den Haag against protesters. The BAZ reported:

Several hundred people on Saturday also protested at the Yellow Vest demonstrations in the Netherlands against what they saw as the growing gap between rich and poor.”
Egregious arrogance, hypocrisy
One reason for the elevated level of anger is the arrogance and hypocrisy EU policymakers exhibit as they rush to impose green energies onto their population. While Eurocrats jet-set from one rescue-conference to another and lead the life of luxury on the taxpayers’ dime, they demand citizens tighten their energy and financial belts and go without.
One egregious example of such arrogance comes from the United States.  The Washington Examiner here reports how Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders spent $300,000 on private jet flights (in a single month!)while demanding citizens refrain from using fossil fuels and forgo their already modest lifestyles. The Examiner writes:
While private jets are a common tool for political campaigners, the same day the massive check was written to a private jet company, Sanders issued a call to arms to take on greenhouse gas emissions.”
Meanwhile President Donald Trump wondered if it was not time “to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement.”

Since the protests began, France has decided to put off the high taxes on diesel and gasoline fuel for the time being. Expect other European countries to crank down their fuel tax rhetoric as a result.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German language Epoch Times here reports how the entire editorial board at the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) commented how the “German government under Angela Merkel was running the “world’s dumbest energy policy”.
“Devastating comment”
After having wasted billions of euros on renewable energies, saddling consumers with ultra high power prices, shutting down nuclear power plants, Germany has just decided to shut down its coal power plants by the year 2038. The Journal writes on the move to exit coal:
Having wasted uncountable billions of euros on renewables and inflicted some of Europe’s highest energy prices on German households and businesses, now Berlin is promising to kill the one reliable power source Germany has left.”
The Epoch Times calls the Wall Street Journal commentary “a devastating comment on the conduct of political decision-makers in a country that is not geopolitically considered an explicit opponent of the US.”
Even exceeds Europe’s “stupid environmental policy”
The Epoch Times, along with the Wall Street Journal, also says that “although stupid environmental policy is routine throughout Europe, with reference to the fuel taxes of French President Emmanuel Macron, who had triggered the protests of the yellow vests, the looming German renunciation of coal, however, would easily exceed even this standard.”

Last reliable source will be shut down
“After the leadership in Berlin had already wasted countless billions of euros on renewable energies and had imposed the highest energy prices on European households and companies, Germany was now also offering the prospect of the end for the only reliable source of energy left to the country,” The Epoch Times wrote.
The Epoch Times also questions Berlin’s move with regards to pollution, writing that if the government complains that it is unduly polluting the environment, then it must ask itself why it had been “making the wrong political decisions for more than a decade” since it decided to burn more coal in lieu of the nuclear power plants which were shut down in 2011 in the wake of the Fukushima accident.
Green folly, dangerously dependent
And as Germany pushes to complete its Nord Stream 2 monster pipeline for delivering gas from Russia, the WSJ believes that Germany is dangerously making itself energy dependent on foreign countries. Just the compensation that has to be paid to coal power plants operators for the early shutdown will cost consumers 40 billon euros, the Epoch Times writes.
The WSJ does not think Chancellor Merkel will come to her senses, but hopes her successor Annegret Kramp Karrenbauer will. The WSJ adds:
Her successor will have the opportunity to name Ms Merkel’s green folly, and Germany’s troubled electricity customers should hope that this is the case.” &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img class=”wort-pixel” src=”https://vg06.met.vgwort.de/na/408ebf488a494fa392946e22f769ddd4″ alt=”” width=”1″ height=”1″ /&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;span id=”mce_marker” data-mce-type=”bookmark” data-mce-fragment=”1″&amp;gt;​&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;

By Die kalte Sonne(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The climate conference in Katowice is in full swing and a variety of carbon-saving initiatives are being discussed: eating less meat, less heating and less air travel. In the latter case, of course, the conference itself is taking on great proportions of absurdity.
It would have been easy to turn the conference into an internet meeting with live streaming and online commenting. But then the long wonderful “business trip”  with all its receptions, daily allowances and pre-Christmas meetings with fellow climate rescuers would have been missed. This time more than 22,000 participants have made their way to Poland, most comfortably by plane. The largest delegations to the Climate Conference came from Africa.
Guinea is sending 406 delegates this year, the Democratic Republic of Congo is there with 237 participants, and the Ivory Coast is sending 191 compatriots to Poland. The list of participants is available on the homepage of the conference as a pdf and is 1084 pages long.
The list of delegates from Guinea starts on page 239 and goes to page 273. There are 406 names on it. In the previous year in Bonn the group from Guinea was even larger, 86 participants more, with a delegation size of close to 500 people.
The Ivory Coast has also “severely restricted” participation this year. At the COP23 in Bonn, the country was present with 492 participants. Maybe Bonn was a more attractive destination than Katowice? Eco-business.com has compiled the numbers of climate conferences in recent years in an Excel spreadsheet, which is available here.

The obvious question: what is supposed to be the task of all these delegates? And who will pay for the travel costs? Let’s start with the first question, the role of the delegates. Here we can really only speculate, since we do not know the individual daily program of the participants. A look at the affiliation of the participants gives a first idea. Among other things, there are several employees of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation from Guinea.
There are also journalists, a large number of NGO employees, representatives of the water authority, etc. It remains unclear who really provides added value here, and who is only traveling as a tourist or on a daily travel allowance. Incidentally, this does not only apply to Guinea, but to all delegates.
Is Question 2 maybe easier to answer? Who pays the travel expenses and daily allowances? On the website of the Bonn COP23 we get some information on this:

Daily subsistence allowance disbursement and travelDelegates from Parties eligible for funding are kindly requested to contact the daily subsistence allowance (DSA) office located in the temporary structure in the foyer of the main building of the World Conference Center Bonn as of Monday, 30 April 2018. Delegates attending the pre-sessional meetings of the regional groups are invited to come to the DSA office in room H-030 in the Altes Abgeordnetenhochhaus building on the United Nations Campus from Tuesday, 24 April to Friday, 27 April. Please bring your passport, electronic flight ticket confirmation and boarding pass(es). After receiving clearance from the DSA office, delegates can proceed to the bank to collect their DSA.”

So there is a group of participants who are eligible for flight, accommodation and daily allowance. All you have to do is go to a booth at the conference with your passport and plane tickets, and then there’s cash from the bank. It can be assumed that the participants of most African countries are fully financed by the UN.
In view of the good daily allowances and travel opportunity, the incentive to participate in the climate conferences is great. The COP24 has its own website for ‘Funded Delegates Accommodation’. The minimum stay in Katowice is 12 days. What is the usual UN daily allowance? According to the ICSC website, Poland receives $194 per day outside Warsaw. For a stay of 12 days, that’s $2,328 per person. In Bonn, it was $272 per day in the previous year. This may explain the slight decline in the number of interested parties this year.
Is COP24 really only about climate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany used to be regarded as a global leader in the transition to renewable green energies — especially wind and solar power — a project dubbed the “Energiewende”. But this is no longer the case. Germany has fallen behind to the rear of the pack.
Ironically the USA is leading the world in cutting back CO2!
Germany’s “self-deception”
The Düsseldorf-based daily Rheinische Post (RP) here writes that it’s time for Germany to “face inconvenient truths” concerning green energies and that pragmatic (and not ideological) action is needed.
The title of the commentary: “Self-deception in the green energy transition“
Green, cult-like dream now colliding with harsh reality
For years the German government, activists and alarmist scientists promised that green energies — foremost wind and sun — would be plentiful, cheap and clean. “Hooray!” the entire exclaimed in jubilation.
But today in its commentary the RP concedes that “the reality looks totally different” and that it is requiring “an enormous effort” just to keep the power grids stable as waves of unpredictable green power repeatedly surge into the power grid.
According to the RP, emergency power grid interventions by grid operators cost electricity consumers last year 1,4 billion euros. German households consequently pay 47% more for their power than the average EU.
Energiewende: “risky, inefficient and expensive”
And so what have German consumers gotten in return in terms of climate and CO2 emissions for all the extra pain? Nothing.
German CO2 emissions have stagnated (i.e. haven’t fallen at all). And according to the RP: “The German transition to green energy is in reality risky, inefficient and expensive.”
Energiewende “derailed”

The RP comments that highly ballyhooed headlines of new record amounts of green energy being produced don’t change a thing with respect to the failing green energy transition, and notes that although green energies made up 37% of the gross share of gross power consumption, these clean energies amounted only to a measly 13 percent of the entire German energy mix!

The RP asks: “How could the German flagship project have derailed in this way?”
German dependence on coal “cemented for years to come”
The main reason for the failure, the RP writes, was Germany’s panicked rush to exit nuclear power in the wake Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster amid a deeply-rooted, collective and decades-old German aversion to nuclear power. This lead to the German government shutting down half of its nuclear power plants overnight and diving blindly into a rapid, unplanned expansion of wind and solar power.
The decision, the RP writes, was driven by the aim to shut down nuclear power, and not to reduce CO2.


The result, the RP comments: “Unfortunately, both goals are in direct contradiction. The politically desired phase-out of nuclear power has cemented our [German] dependence on coal for years to come. Its share is still 42 percent.”
The RP then comments that if Germany were really serious about reducing CO2, the country would not shut down its remaining nuclear power plants, which produce no “greenhouse” gas emissions.
Green energies “a naive illusion”
The RP also writes Germany should reconsider its efforts “to demonize diesel engines”, which have considerably higher fuel efficiency than gasoline engines. The move to eliminate diesel engines will make CO2 reductions more difficult. The RP also notes that electric cars “are no alternative” in terms of CO2.
100% renewables “a naive illusion” 
The RP calls the idea of covering all Germany’s energy needs through renewable energy “a naive illusion” and expects that the country will have to accept the fact that it will remain dependent on fossil fuels also over the long-term.
Also the collectively naive Germans in general need to get realistic and serious about what going 100% green entails. The RP comments:
Anyone who has solar cells mounted on the roof and then flies mindlessly to vacation on the Maldives, has not understood the problem.”
Public also opposes CCS
The RP finally comments on other possible technical solutions that could be employed to make the pain of having to go without fossil energies bearable, namely subsidizing CCS technology. However, a great number of Germans oppose that technology as well.
The way things are going, the RP suggests, Germany will never be able to meet its CO2 reductions targets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe non-falsifiable climate catastrophe: No matter if it’s hot or cold – it always has got to be global warming
By Die kalte Sonne
(Text translated by P Gosselin)
The Central European heat summer of 2018 was a feeding frenzy for the followers of the climate disaster. The media turned it into sensational news and clearly saw climate change at work.
And then came the winter. In the US, this year (2018) saw one of the coldest Thanksgiving holidays of the past 100 years. That did not suit the PIK at all. Quickly there was a press release (22/11/2018) that blamed the cold spell on global warming:
Winter weather extremes in the US and Europe: messing with giant airstreams in the stratosphere
Over Thanksgiving, arctic air masses are predicted to bring record-cold temperatures and frigid winds to the Northeast of the United States. Driver for such winter weather extremes is often the stratospheric polar vortex, a band of fast moving winds 30 kilometers above the ground. In winter, when the polar vortex is disturbed by upward-blowing air masses, this can bring cold spells over Northeastern America or Eurasia, a new study now shows. And paradox as it might seem, climate change might further disrupt the complex dynamics in the atmosphere – bringing us not only more hot extremes in summer but potentially also cold spells in winter.”
Read more here.
No matter if it’s hot or cold, it always has to be global warming. The crazy world of climate alarm. If one follows this logic, there is no single weather condition that could refute the concept. The climate catastrophe model can not be falsified, no matter what the weather. This indeed breaks an important principle of science. 
But to ensure the well-being of mankind, scientific sacrifices must be made. With autocratic climate rule breaking all the laws of science is standard procedure.

However a recent paper published in the journal Nature here authored by a team scientists led by Arjen Luijendijk found that some 75% of the world’s sandy shorelines are stable or growing!
An analysis of satellite-derived shoreline data indicates that 24% of the world’s sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, but 28% are accreting and 48% are stable.
Also erosion rates exceed 5 m/yr along 4% of the sandy shoreline and are greater than 10 m/yr for 2% of the global sandy shoreline.
Image source: Luijendijk et al., 2018
According to the paper, the application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984–2016.
The scientists also found that Australia and Africa are the only continents for which net erosion (−0.20 m/yr and −0.07 m/yr respectively) is found, with all other continents showing net accretion.

What’s surprising is that another researcher has determined that melting ice caps from global warming induced ice melt does not contribute to sea level rise, and that sea level rise is mostly caused by the Earth’s shape.
 3 mm/yr sea level rise “definitely a conjecture”
In a scientific paper published by the journal Geoscience Frontiers, Aftab Alam Khan at the Department of Geology, University of Dhaka in Bangladesh found: “thermal expansion only explains part (about 0.4 mm/yr) of the 1.8 mm/yr observed sea level rise of the past few decades.” and that the claim and prediction of 3 mm/yr rise of sea-level due to global warming and polar ice-melt “is definitely a conjecture”
He added that the prediction of 4–6.6 ft sea level rise in the next 91 years between 2009 and 2100 is “highly erroneous”!
Khan then concludes that though global warming, both polar and terrestrial ice melts, and climate change might be a reality, all these phenomena are not related to sea level rise and fall.
Ice melt would not contribute to sea level rise
According to Khan, “Geophysical shape of the earth is the fundamental component of the global sea level distribution. Global warming and ice-melt, although a reality, would not contribute to sea-level rise.”
If Kahn’s assertion turns out to be correct, then IPCC scientists will have some major scientific revamping to do.

Swiss meteorologist: Such snowfalls “nothing unique” for Alps
Yesterday one of Europe’s most high profile meteorologists, Jörg Kachelmann, penned an opinion piece at t-online.de reminding the public that heavy snow events in the Alps, such as the one we are now experiencing, are in fact nothing unique and that it is not a catastrophe.
In the days ahead, many parts of the Alps are expecting up to another meter of new snow, yet, according to Kachelmann, this should not pose any problems to buildings and structures – if their construction indeed adhered to the applicable building codes.
“Nothing to do with climate change”
Kachelmann adds later in his t-online piece: “1. The snowfalls are nothing unique so far for the Alps. 2. They have nothing to do with climate change.”
The veteran Swiss meteorologist adds that the heavy snow in the Alps “are making people happy because they ensure the ski season will extend until Easter.”
Snow is in fact welcome
Moreover, they are good for the glaciers, and will help relieve the drought conditions seen in Europe last year. The Swiss meteorologist adds:
They [the snowfalls] are making the media happy as well because weather catastrophes get many clicks. However, the current weather situation is not a catastrophe. Human lives (except in the mentioned 0.1 percent problem) are only in danger if people behave inappropriately.”

Kachelmann also thinks the media overhype now taking place may be unnecessarily scaring people away from booking ski trips to the Alps, a region where massive amounts of snow are common.
Models suggest severe winter conditions
Meanwhile, German meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net reported that a Russian “Beast from the East” looks to be in the works for Europe for the weeks ahead:

According to Jung, who cites US and European weather models, beginning January 20 much greater cold will be invading large parts of Europe. And by January 25, the cold conditions could deepen and become extreme.
Northern hemisphere “under the gun”
Also at Weatherbell, 40-year meteorologist Joe Bastardi backs Jung’s projected development, presenting a frigid chart at yesterday’s Daily Summary that shows the forecast 11-16 days out:

Cold to grip Europe, North America and Asia in the weeks ahead, models suggest.
Joe says:
Once this gets here, until March, these areas and these areas, are under the gun. Repetitive snow threats and bitter cold relative to averages, and it’s coming at the coldest time of the year.”

Hat-tip: Schneefan
UAH satellite measurements of temperature at 1500 m altitude in October 2018 came in at an anomaly of + 0.22°C with respect to the WMO climate mean from 1981-2010. That’s four tenths of a degree less than October, 2017.
So far 2018 is the third year in a row that the globe has cooled off from it’s El Nino peak set in 2015. Especially large parts of North America have seen a cold October, as an NCEP/NCAR reanalysis shows:
Arctic stable over past decade
And despite earlier predictions of an ice-free late summer Arctic made by alarmist climate scientists years ago, Arctic sea ice has in fact stabilized over the past 10 years. This year the  Northwest passage was closed the entire year.
Arctic sea ice extent has exploded since early November, gaining over 200,000 km² daily on average, as depicted by the following Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) chart:

Hudson Bay freeze-up earlier than average for 2nd year
The surprising ice burst contradicts claims that polar bears have been in trouble. Polar bear biologist and expert Dr. Susan Crockford reports here:

This is the second year in a row that freeze-up of Western Hudson Bay ice has come earlier than average” and that “it’s unlikely that a strong wind will again blow the newly-formed ice offshore (as happened earlier this year) because the ice is more extensive.”
According to Dr. Crockford: “Ice has been developing rapidly over the last couple of days.”
The Canadian Ice Service chart for 10 November shows the ice very clearly:

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn June 13 Chris Mooney of the Washington Post wrote how Antarctica’s ice sheet was “melting at a rapidly increasing rate” and “pouring more than 200 billion tons of ice into the ocean annually” — all this according to “a team of 80 scientists”. The doomsday media response was immediate.
Mooney of course blamed CO2 for the speculated ice melt change, and renewed the calls for a cut in greenhouse gas emissions in order to save ourselves.
Adventurous conclusion
Firstly the CO2 ice-melt logic here is extremely flimsy and even preposterous: An already hugely uncertain 200 billion ton figure gets adventurously blamed on Co2 through a long, uncertain and highly complex chain of physical processes — one that ignores an array of natural factors.
“Rate increase” meaningless
Secondly, Mooney’s language sounds dramatic, but the reality isn’t dramatic at all. A worker with an annual salary of $100,000 who gets a raise of $100 this year compared to $50 a year earlier also sees “a rapidly increasing” pay raise “rate” (100%). In reality the raise was meaningless.
Mooney and the media here are using trick language to purvey fake images of significant activity.
Only 0.001% of the total mass
Though the (hugely uncertain) 200 billion ton ice melt figure may sound impressive, it is in fact very tiny compared to the entire Antarctic total ice volume, which according to Dr. Don Easterbrook’s book “Evidence-Based Climate Science: Data Opposing CO2 Emissions as the Primary Source of Global Warming Evidence-Based Climate Science” is estimated at 26.5 million cubic kilometers.
Artefact of statistical torture
200 cubic kilometers of 26.5 million cubic kilometers is in reality only about an estimated paltry 0.001% of the total Antarctic ice mass. And (if it were true) would have only a minor effect on overall sea level rise.
The scientists themselves admit there’s much uncertainty involved and that the calculated 200 billion ton ice loss depends in part on model assumptions. Read more here.
The 200 billion ton figure is indeed more an artefact of statistical torture and modelling. When it comes to complex Antarctic ice mass, you can make the paltry data that’s available say whatever you want.
In this case 80 scientists participated in the waterboarding of the data.
One decade is not climate, but rather weather variability
What is more, the authors compared the last decade to the one before. Well, changes seen in one decade and compared to the one earlier is what we call weather changes, not climate change. Just because one decade is wetter than the one before it, it doesn’t mean the next will be wetter as well. Junk science.

Reality: Antarctic ice area growing rapidly
The satellite imagery and data concerning Antarctic ice area, which go back almost 40 years, in fact show an increasing long-term trend, according to one recently published peer-reviewed study.

Antarctic cooling
And in order for Antarctica to lose ice through melting, the temperature there would necessarily need to rise. Yet the best satellite data we have on this show this is not the case at all.

Satellite data spanning four decades show no temperature increase. The RSS data in fact indicate slight cooling over the past decade where accelerated melting is being claimed. How can cooling cause more melting? Source: here.
Antarctic coastal surface stations show no warming
At Twitter, Japanese skeptic Kirye has been looking at NASA surface stations scattered over Antarctica, most of them near the coast, and found that many do not show any warming, e.g. Casey, Davis, Mawson, Syowa…
Other studies show ice growth!
Moreover NASA glaciologist Jay Zwally published a paper in 2015 showing ice sheet growth in eastern Antarctica had outweighed the losses in the western ice sheet, and so ice mass was growing and not shrinking.
And today Zwally is set to release a new study that will show that the eastern Antarctic ice sheet continues to gain enough ice to offset the losses in the west. “Basically, we agree about West Antarctica,” Zwally told The Daily Caller. “East Antarctica is still gaining mass. That’s where we disagree.”
Zwally believes ice sheet growth is anywhere from 50 gigatons to 200 gigatons a year, the Daily Caller reports here.
Ocean cycles responsible for west Antarctic ice melt
Ice loss in the western Antarctic ice sheet is suspected of being driven by “warm ocean water”, i.e. natural oceanic cycles, and not warming that still has yet to occur over the Antarctic.
Prof. Don Easterbrook concluded in 2016 concerning the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which everyone loves to worry about:

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is NOT collapsing, the retreat of these small glaciers is NOT caused by global warming, and sea level is NOT going to rise 10 ft.”

Hat-tip: achgut.com.
The online Mitteldeutche Zeitung MZ) here reports the Evangelical Church in Central Germany (EKM) is pushing to impose a speed limit on German autobahns, the motorways where drivers  in certain stretches are free to drive as fast as they dare.

The days of no speed limit on Germany’s famed autobahns are about to end. Photo: Darkone, CC BY-SA 2.5, (Wikipedia)
Quoting Christian Fuhrmann of the EKM, the MZ reports that cars should she limited to 130 km/hr and the Church will mobilize to send a public petition to the German Bundestag.
The MZ adds that the petition will be launched on Ash Wednesday and 50,000 signatures are needed.
According to the MZ: “The Central German Church covers large parts of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia and has about 700,000 members.”

The Church’s main reason for limiting the speed of cars to 130 km/hr on the autobahn is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and exhaust fumes, which the Church says would translate to an emissions reduction of 2 – 2.5%. Also the high speeds and associated braking leads to more fine particle emissions from tire abrasion on asphalt surfaces, as well as more noise.
“A Confession to the Creator”
The MZ also reports that potential CO2 savings could be 2 million tonnes annually. Currently Germany emits some 900 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent gases annually.
The MZ adds:
“We see a world responsibility for ourselves, assigned by God,” said state bishop Ilse Junkermann. Mankind is destroying the foundations of life. The fight against it is “a confession to the Creator”.
Makes sense from safety alone
Personally I support a 130 km/hr limit, but not because of the silly climate reasons. Overall a limit is far safer, and some studies show it would likely improve over traffic flow efficiency and help reduce long traffic jams, which often result from messy car accidents. In the end less traffic jams means reaching your destination just as quickly as you would madly driving at breakneck speeds.
Also an autobahn speed limit could mean lower maintenance costs because the surface specifications for unevenness could be relaxed a bit. Any unevenness really becomes a factor when a vehicle is flying at 280 km/hr. With speeds at 130 km/hr, road crews would not have to be sent out to “repair” the road, which in turn means lane closures and again more traffic obstruction and slowdown.
One compromise could be to tolerate speeds of 160 km/hr (100 mph) during times and areas of light traffic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman skeptic blog Science Skeptical here takes a look at the carbon footprint of Prof. Hans-Joachim (John) Schellnhuber, the former director of the ultra alarmist and activist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
Professor Schellnhuber is so worried about man’s destruction of the climate through human CO2 emissions and the “fossil fuel metabolism” of our society that he’s written a number of books on the subject, warning we’re on the verge of burning ourselves to death.
Not surprisingly these vivid books have been very popular among end-of-world conspiracists and climate Armageddon believers. His latest: Selbstverbrennung (Self Immolation).

 Image: C. Bertelsmann Publishing. 
Mankind committing “collective suicide”
A short summary of his book explains how Schellnhuber warns that if “our civilization does not move to the often-mentioned two-degree limit, but much more dramatically to a warming of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the continued burning of fossil fuels threatens to lead to collective suicide.”
Himalayan glaciers on the verge of disappearing
The doomsday professor, known in Germany as the “Climate Pope” and whose every word is taken by most of the German mainstream media as infallible, once said that the ideal population for the planet is a billion people (meaning soon there will be 7 billion too many) and the Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2030.
Do as I say, not as I do
So with Schellnhuber’s level of conviction, certainty and urgency, it would only seem logical that the Bavarian-born professor would himself be setting an example for the rest of us on how to live responsibly with CO2 and forego fossil fuels.

Unfortunately, like a Catholic Pope and Cardinals who allow themselves lavish life styles while preaching others not to do the same, Schellnhuber allows himself exorbitant CO2 and fossil fuel privileges. Do as I say, not as I do.
“Certainly fly 100 times a year”
According to Science Skeptical, Schellnhuber was interviewed in 2005 by Tagesspiegel. In the interview he confessed he was not doing his part in “protecting the climate”. When asked if he had ever calculated his own contribution to climate change, Schellnhuber responded:
Yes, it is quite high because I myself certainly fly 100 times a year.”
And when asked what car he drives:
A BMW from the new 1 series. It consumes 6 liters diesel [per 100 km], but that’s only half as much as my previous car.”
Science Skeptical then did a rough calculation of Schellnhuber’s CO2 output using the CO2 calculator provided by the German Ministry of Environment. The result, assuming normal consumer behavior, but flying 100 times a year, each flight on average 2 hours long: 50 tonnes of CO2 each year!
The average German emits only about 10 tonnes annually.
Skeptical Science next wonders how much CO2 the climate-doomsday-preaching Potsdam Institute with its 4.5 million euro super-computer, and all it’s jet-setting climate-rescuing scientists, emit into the atmosphere. Not a pretty picture. They all happily rely on the conveniences provided by the very fuels they profess to detest.
Contempt for regular workers
In terms of CO2, the employees at the PIK thus consume a multiple times what the average German worker does. But German workers, you see, really don’t do necessary worthwhile work, and so are producing CO2 needlessly. PIK workers, on the other hand, are rescuing the planet, and so their CO2 emissions are really necessary.

Team of researchers led by Irina Polovodova Asteman, University of Gotheberg, produced a record of bottom water temperature off the coast of western Sweden and found 20th century warming “does not stand out.” Photo: ResearchGate, University of Gothenburg
The 2500-year winter temperature record was of reconstructed by using a fjord sediment archive from the NE Atlantic and through analysis of oxygen isotopes and other methods. The study was based on an approximately 8-meter long sediment core extracted from the Gullmar Fjord (Sweden).
They found that the Gullmar Fjord d18O record mainly reflects variability of the winter bottom water temperatures with a minor salinity influence.
The researchers also pointed out that a comparison with instrumental winter temperature observations from Central England and Stockholm shows that the fjord record picks up the contemporary warming of the 20th century, see following diagrams:

Chart: Polovodova et al 2018
According to the scientists, the Gullmar Fjord record shows a substantial and long-term warming during the Roman Warm Period (~350 BCE – 450 CE) which was followed by variable bottom water temperatures during the Dark Ages (~450 – 850 CE).
The Viking Age/Medieval Climate Anomaly (~850 – 1350 CE) is also indicated by positive bottom water temperature anomalies, while the Little Ice Age (~1350 – 1850 CE) is characterized by a long-term cooling with distinct multidecadal variability.
The team of Swedish scientists, led by Irina Polovodova Asteman, Department of Marine Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, noted “the most recent warming of the 20th century does not stand out, but appears to be comparable to both the Roman Warm Period and the MCA (Medieval Climate Anomaly).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome critics have slammed Germany’s decision to exit coal power by the year 2038. For example the Wall Street Journal here called Germany’s energy policy “the world’s dumbest” (it is).
Yet, we need to remind ourselves that many in Germany had been calling for an exit within 10 years, or even sooner. For political leaders, however, shutting down what today is still Germany’s backbone of power supply so quickly would mean economic and political suicide. So the decision to push everything off to 2038 was yet again the German government punting the ball down the field, and leaving the messy issue to the next generation of leaders.
The government is not taking action; it’s avoiding it.
Keep in mind that a lot can happen between now and 2038. It’s entirely reasonable to expect that other forms of cleaner energy sources will be developed – 20 years is a long time. And climate can change rapidly, as a number of scientists are warning of cooling ahead.
Under the bottom line, it’s comforting that the Germans have given themselves the extra time, especially amid so many claiming that green technology is already available. Obviously it really isn’t.
World Future Council sees more coal burning
Even hardcore green energy groups are realizing they’ve been had and are beginning to voice their dissatisfaction with the new government-set 2038 coal exit target, for example the Hamburg-based, planet-rescuing World Future Council, Because of the deal, it expects coal CO2 emissions to climb by 16%!

What follows is their recent press release (my emphasis added):
===============================================
Despite capacity reductions, coal-fired power generation and CO2 emissions can increase by up to 16 percent
Hamburg, February 7, 2019 – Dr. Matthias Kroll, Chief Economist of the Hamburg-based World Future Council, has recalculated the effects of the so-called “coal compromise” on the climate, with the result that coal-fired power generation could even increase by 2030 despite capacity reductions. The reason for this is the increase in the base load on the remaining coal-fired power plants due to the nuclear phase-out.
“The improvements suggested in the coal compromise for climate protection on the way to the 1.5°C target are a deceptive package,” says Kroll.  The main criticism of the coal compromise to date has been the very late phase-out date of 2038.
However, the current compromise conceals yet another problem that has been lost in the debate so far: “For climate protection, it is not decisive how much power plant capacity is shut down, but how much electricity generation with coal actually decreases,” Kroll continues. “In the current model, I see a bottom line increase in electricity production from coal of around 16 percent. The situation is similar with CO2 emissions. Germany must take its foot off the brake and significantly push ahead with the expansion of renewable energies, the associated storage systems (‘power to gas’) and the construction of new natural gas power plants. Otherwise CO2 emissions will increase and not decrease.”
Although about 12 GW of the currently existing 42 GW coal-fired power plant are to be shut down by the end of 2022, it has to be expected that the planned remaining 15 GW of lignite and stone coal each will produce more electricity and CO2 emissions than today. The reason for this is the significantly increasing utilisation of the remaining coal-fired power plants, as it must be assumed that they will take over the last 9.5 GW of nuclear base load that will be eliminated.
While coal-fired power plants today are only used very irregularly because they are increasingly being forced out of the grid by wind and photovoltaic power, they can largely run at their maximum load. In terms of figures, this will amount to an increase of up to 16 percent in coal-fired electricity and the associated CO2 emissions compared with 2018. To ensure that the essential phase-out of nuclear power does not lead to a permanent increase in coal-fired power generation, the remaining 30 GW of coal-fired power from 2022 must be further reduced rapidly.
“It is questionable how Germany intends to achieve the 1.5°C target it has contractually agreed to in the Paris Agreement if CO2 emissions from coal-fired power generation are even higher than current levels for another decade, even though the reduction to zero is necessary,” criticises Kroll.

Recently, CO2 Science brought up a paper in Nature Communications.
Using satellite images, Venter et al. 2018 found an eight percent increase in woody vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa over the last three decades, underscoring the global “greening trend”.

Recent study by Venter et al finds that the Sahara has shrunk by 8% over the past three decades. NASA image, public domain.
According to Wikipedia, the Sahara covers a vast area of some 9.2 million square kilometers. Eight percent of that translates into more than 700,000 square kilometers. That’s an area that’s almost as big as Germany and France combined! This is profound.
In other words, it’s well over 10,000 Manhattans!
If the added green area were effectively used for agriculture, it could produce enough food to feed the African continent. Unfortunately, this is a fact that the doomsday-obsessed media, activists and ruling politicians fear will become publicly known. They instead would prefer that the globe returns to a climate of the 1980s, when drought and famine ravaged the vast North African region.

According to the recent study, the cause was a decline in vegetation fires in a warmer and more humid climate. Abstract:
Drivers of woody plant encroachment over Africa
While global deforestation induced by human land use has been quantified, the drivers and extent of simultaneous woody plant encroachment (WPE) into open areas are only regionally known. WPE has important consequences for ecosystem functioning, global carbon balances and human economies. Here we report, using high-resolution satellite imagery, that woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8% over the past three decades and that a diversity of drivers, other than CO2, were able to explain 78% of the spatial variation in this trend. A decline in burned area along with warmer, wetter climates drove WPE, although this has been mitigated in areas with high population growth rates, and high and low extremes of herbivory, specifically browsers. These results confirm global greening trends, thereby bringing into question widely held theories about declining terrestrial carbon balances and desert expansion. Importantly, while global drivers such as climate and CO2 may enhance the risk of WPE, managing fire and herbivory at the local scale provides tools to mitigate continental WPE.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA retired German climate scientist says the IPCC has ventured into “the red rev range of ideology and reality loss”, and adds there is no stringent scientific proof of CO2’s influence on climate
At the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), a German climate scientist, wonders if the IPCC and German media have lost their grip on reality as they place the blame for global warming on human CO2 emissions.
Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke writes that the IPCC is in the “red rev range of ideology and reality loss” as the German media and politicians renew their calls to drastically cut back CO2 emissions in order to keep the planet from “dangerously overheating”.
The German climate scientist, however, says CO2’s impact on the climate are exorbitantly overblown.
Germany’s share of global CO2 negligible
First Prof. Lüdecke reminds that Germany’s share of global CO2 emissions is so puny that any reductions efforts by the country will have no detectable effect on global temperatures, and cites a Report of the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.
In the report’s Fig. 2.3 we see:
&amp;lt;img class=”alignnone size-medium wp-image-49858″ src=”https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pbl-2017-640×412.jpg” alt=”” width=”640″ height=”412″ srcset=”https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pbl-2017-640×412.jpg 640w, https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pbl-2017-768×494.jpg 768w, https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pbl-2017-1024×658.jpg 1024w, https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pbl-2017.jpg 1213w” sizes=”(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px” /&amp;gt;

Image (Fig. 2.3): Emissions of climate gases worldwide (here)
As the chart shows, the European Union share of global emissions is only 9%. At 2.5%, Germany is a mere fraction of that.
“Already we see that our share globally is negligible,” Lüdecke writes.
“Fictional” damage
Lüdecke also doubts the large role CO2 is claimed to have on climate, and characterizes the notion the climate is somehow damaged by human CO2 as “fictional”.
“No stringent proof” manmade CO2 influences climate
The retired German professor also says that according to the scientific literature: “To date, there is no stringent proof that the anthropogenic, i.e. human-made (!) CO2 has exerted any influence on the climate which is clearly traceable to this source.”
Lüdecke adds that the temperature increase seen at the end of the 20th century is well within the range of natural variability and is not unusual and that, if anything, CO2 is good for the planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite hysterical headlines from the fake media claiming the weather is weirding out due to man-made climate change, recent studies show that it’s mostly superstition and that our modern climate in fact is well within the range of natural climate variability.
If one really wants to understand today’s weather and climate, it is essential to keep it in perspective with respect to what has happened over the past 1000 years or more. This is why a number of scientists are busy reconstructing past weather patterns at locations worldwide.
Central Asia climate likely dominated by natural cycles
First, a new study published in the journal Climate of the Past authored by a team of researchers led by Feng Chen of the Key Laboratory of Tree-ring Physical and Chemical Research of China Meteorological Administration found that drought records from western and eastern Central Asia capture the regional dry/wet periods and that analyses indicate the existence of centennial (100–150 years), decadal (50–60, 24.4 and 11.4 years) and interannual (8.0 and 2.0-3.5 years) cycles.
The authors suspect that they may be linked with climate forcings, such as solar activity and ENSO.

This would tell us that climate in Central Asia is greatly dependent on the natural factors of solar and oceanic cycles, and not CO2.
Western US droughts worse 1000 years ago
Another recent study just appeared in the Journal of Climate and was authored by a team of scientists led by Toby R. Ault, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science, Cornell University. The findings indicate that the western United States was affected by several megadroughts during the last 1200 years, especially during the (MCA; 800 to 1300 CE).
The scientists found that such drought events are inevitable and occur purely as a consequence of internal climate variability. The researchers also concluded that the observed clustering of megadroughts of the Medieval Climate Anomaly were more likely to have been caused by either “external forcing or by internal climate variability”.
Canada: Scotian warm water “part of the natural variability “
The journal Continental Shelf Research published a study authored by scientists led by David Brickman of the Canadian Bedford Institute of Oceanography. The team examined the warm subsurface water temperatures in the Scotian Shelf region of Eastern Canada 2012, 2014, and 2015.

They found that the observed warming trend should be considered as “part of the natural variability of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system”.
AMS: natural variability dominates observed trends
Another a team of scientists led by Elisabeth Kendon of the Met Office Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom published a paper in the journal of the American meteorological Society which found natural variability appears to dominate current observed trends over the southern United Kingdom (including an increase in the intensity of heavy summer rainfall over the last 30 years).
The authors, citing Sarojini et al., 2016, confirmed that the “attribution of rainfall trends to human influence on local and regional scales is not yet possible”. More uncertainty over the human fingerprint on global climate.
Central Europe precipitation anomalies even greater long ago
Finally a paper published in the International Journal of Climatology and authored by Petr Dobrovolný of the Department of Geography, Masaryk University, Czech Republic, reconstructed precipitation in Central Europe (Czech Republic).
 

Source: Dobrovolný et al., 2018.
Their findings revealed two long periods of low precipitation variability, in the 13th–14th centuries and 1630s–1850s, and that precipitation anomalies of larger amplitude and longer duration occurred in the earlier part of the last millennium than those found in the instrumental period. The new reconstruction does not indicate any exceptional recent decline in MJJ precipitation.
In summary, the new studies from all around the world show that weather extremes were as bad or worse in the past than they are currently. Today’s modern climate is in fact well in phase with natural variability.
The papers mentioned above are all presented by Kenneth Richard here.

Producing Hydrogen from Natural Gas without Emissions: German Gas Industry Honors a Process Developed by Researchers from Karlsruhe and Potsdam – KIT Spin-Off Ineratec Receives Special Award for Innovative Startups

Generating energy from natural gas without climate-damaging CO2 emissions – that’s the promise of a new technology developed in a joint research project by scientists at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam. Natural gas, which mainly consists of methane, is converted into hydrogen and fixed carbon. For their work, the researchers have now received the German Gas Industry Innovation Award. KIT was also honored with a new special award for the most innovative startup which was presented to Ineratec, a spin-off of the research university.

“The German Gas Industry Innovation Award for the new methane cracking process is testament to the innovative spirit of our scientists,” says the President of KIT, Professor Holger Hanselka.
“The option of using fossil natural gas in a climate-friendly way in the future can make a major contribution to curb CO2 emissions. I am very pleased that we, as the research university in the Helmholtz Association, can make this important contribution to climate protection together with our partners.” The award was presented to the research team consisting of scientists from KIT and IASS on November 22 in Berlin. The research team also won an additional award voted for by the attendees at the ceremony. The event was held under the auspices of the Federal Minister of Education and Research, Anja Karliczek.

The new process makes it possible to use natural gas in a climate-friendly manner. “Instead of directly burning natural gas, which mainly consists of methane, we break it up into its components hydrogen and carbon,” says Dr Stefan Stückrad who has co-managed the research project at IASS. The hydrogen produced in methane cracking can be used as an energy source in fuel cell vehicles as well as for generating electricity and heat.
Applications in the chemical industry are also possible. “So far, hydrogen for the chemical industry has mainly been produced from natural gas by steam methane reforming. During this process, considerable amounts of carbon dioxide are released,” says Stückrad. In addition to hydrogen, very pure powdery carbon is created as a by-product during cracking, the importance of which is constantly increasing as an industrial raw material. For example, it is used in the production of elastomers, lightweight materials, printing inks and batteries.

Methane cracking is not a new idea as such and has previously been analyzed in experiments with gas phase reactors. “Conventional methods proved unsuitable for application at an industrial scale, though,” says Professor Thomas Wetzel from the Institute of Thermal Process Engineering (TVT) at KIT. “The carbon produced during cracking was deposited on the heated reactor walls as a solid layer, blocking the reactors in a short space of time. Other approaches on the basis of arc- or plasma-based reactors weren’t very successful either.” The research project from IASS and KIT has therefore chosen a fundamentally different approach for continuous pyrolytic methane cracking.
The basic idea is to use molten tin as a heat transfer and liquid medium in a bubble column reactor. Here, KIT scientists have applied their expertise in liquid metal research and technology. In the Innovation Award winning process, methane gas is continuously fed into a liquid metal column from the bottom, which is kept at a temperature of up to 1,200 degrees Celsius, and rises as a bubble swarm. The gas in the bubbles very quickly reaches the reaction temperature so that pyrolysis reaction takes place. “The bubbles open up on the surface of the liquid tin and release the gaseous hydrogen and carbon,” says Wetzel. “The carbon occurs as micro-granular powder that is easy to separate from the gas stream and easy to handle.”
The new technology is now for the first time enabling continuous operation of a reactor for methane cracking. A conversion rate as high as 78 percent has been proven on a laboratory scale. The groups of scientists are currently working on further optimizing and scaling the process to pilot level.
Producing synthetic fuels from renewable energy sources inexpensively is also an important element for the energy transformation. Huge systems are required to produce synthetic gasoline, kerosene, diesel and natural gas. Ineratec, a KIT spin-off, builds chemical reactors that are so compact that the assembled system fits in a shipping container and can be used anywhere. At the 2018 German Gas Industry Innovation Award ceremony the young company was honored with a special award for the most innovative startup.
The German Gas Industry Innovation Award
Every two years, the associations of the German gas industry present the German Gas Industry Innovation Award organized by the Association for the Efficient and Environmentally Friendly Use of Energy (ASUE). Award partners of ASUE are the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water (DVGW), the Association of the German Energy and Water Industry (BDEW) as well as the Zukunft Erdgas industry initiative. The awards are presented in four categories; the project from KIT and IASS on methane cracking was a winner in the “Research & Development” category. INERATEC was honored with a new special award for innovative startups.

Image Source: AVweb, August 2018 
I. Emergency Landing In 1942
In July, 1942, a squadron of six U.S. P-38 fighter planes and two B-17 bombers embarked on a flight mission to England when they were suddenly bombarded by severe weather.
All 8 planes were consequently forced to emergency-land on the southeastern corner of the Greenland ice sheet, about 29 kilometers from the coastal edge.
While all 25 of the occupants were ultimately rescued, the 8 planes had to be abandoned atop the surface of Greenland as it existed in 1942.  Eventually the planes were buried beneath decades of ice and snow accumulation.
II. The first “Lost Squadron” plane rescued in 1992…buried under 268 feet of ice
Over the course of the next several decades, nostalgic interest in a search-and-recovery effort grew.  After all, the Lost Squadron planes were effectively new when they were abandoned and, if preserved well enough, they could potentially be restored to flying condition .
The first several attempts to locate the planes during the 1980s were unsuccessful, as the search crews had underestimated how deep beneath the surface the planes were after 40-plus years of ice sheet growth.  It ultimately took 12 tries before the first plane was spotted.
In 1988 the search crews were finally able to pinpoint the location of a P-38 that was ultimately named “Glacier Girl”.   She was buried 260 feet (79.2 meters) below the surface of the ice sheet as it existed in 1988.
By 1992 the 260-foot depth had grown to 268 feet (81.7 meters), and “Glacier Girl” was slowly (piece-by-piece) retrieved from the ice.
III. Another Lost Squadron plane was found in mid-2018…buried under 340 feet of ice
Accompanied by far less fanfare, another Lost Squadron P-38 was located in 2018 using drone technology.
This plane was found buried under another 72 feet – 21.9 meters – of ice relative to the 1992 recovery site for the first P-38 rescue (340 feet versus 268 feet).

• The Greenland Ice Sheet surface area is larger now than 95% of the last 8,000 years

• Greenland hasn’t warmed overall since the 1920s and 1930s

Image Source: Hanna et al., 2011
“The annual whole [Greenland] ice sheet 1919–32 warming trend is 33% greater in magnitude than the 1994–2007 warming.”   (Box et al., 2009)
• Greenland ice melt has added just 1.5 cm to sea levels since 1900 – with no contribution during 1940-2000

Image Source: Fettweis et al ., 2017
• Greenland has been cooling during the last decade

“Here we quantify trends in satellite-derived land surface temperatures and modelled air temperatures, validated against observations, across the entire ice-free Greenland. … Warming trends observed from 1986–2016 across the ice-free Greenland is mainly related to warming in the 1990’s. The most recent and detailed trends based on MODIS (2001–2015) shows contrasting trends across Greenland, and if any general trend it is mostly a cooling. The MODIS dataset provides a unique detailed picture of spatiotemporally distributed changes during the last 15 years. … Figure 3 shows that on an annual basis, less than 36% of the ice-free Greenland has experienced a significant trend and, if any, a cooling is observed during the last 15 years (<0.15 °C change per year).” (Westergaard-Nielsen et al., 2018)

“For the most recent 10 years (2005 to 2015), apart from the anomalously warm year of 2010, mean annual temperatures at the Summit exhibit a slightly decreasing trend in accordance with northern North Atlantic-wide cooling.  The Summit temperatures are well correlated with southwest coastal records (Ilulissat, Kangerlussuaq, Nuuk, and Qaqortoq).” (Kobashi et al., 2017)
• Greenland was much warmer than today throughout most of the last 10,000 years

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe advocacy for widespread growth in renewable energy (especially wind, solar, and biomass) usage has increasingly become the clarion call of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) movement.  And yet more and more published research documents the adverse effects of relying on renewables.

Image: Wasili Karbe, cropped from video here.
Over the course of the last year, at least 30 papers have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature detailing the fatuity of promoting renewable energy as a long-term “fix” for climate change mitigation.  A categorized list of these papers is provided below.
1. “More Renewables Mean Less Stable Grids” 
Schäfer et al., 2018    “Multiple types of fluctuations impact the collective dynamics of power grids and thus challenge their robust operation.”
(press release)   “More renewables mean less stable grids, researchers find …  [I]ntegrating growing numbers of renewable power installations and microgrids onto the grid can result in larger-than-expected fluctuations in grid frequency.”
2. Increasing Fossil Fuel Use (Natural Gas) Reduces Emissions More Than Increasing Wind/Solar Energy
Anderson et al., 2018     “Before considering the future, it is worth examining just how far we’ve already come without any federal CO2 regulation (for existing power plants) in the U.S. Figure 1 illustrates historical CO2 emissions and natural gas prices from 2005 through 2017 (estimated). During that period, emissions have declined from nearly 2.7 billion tons to approximately 1.9 billion tons (∼30%), while revealing a strong link to natural gas prices. To be sure, while other factors (such as renewable energy incentives) also had an impact, the clearest means by which to reduce CO2 emissions has been to reduce the cost of generating electricity with less CO2-emitting fuels (i.e., substituting natural gas for coal). So successful have market forces been under the existing regulatory framework to date that estimated 2017 CO2 emission levels are already at the CPP’s 2025 target(albeit without accounting for electricity demand growth between 2017 and 2025), well exceeding the AEO’s own Reference Case projections for 2025.”
Jewell et al., 2018     “Hopes are high that removing fossil fuel subsidies could help to mitigate climate change by discouraging inefficient energy consumption and leveling the playing field for renewable energy.Here we show that removing fossil fuel subsidies would have an unexpectedly small impact on global energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions and would not increase renewable energy use by 2030. Removing [fossil fuel] subsidies in most regions would deliver smaller emission reductions than the Paris Agreement (2015) climate pledges and in some regions global [fossil fuel] subsidy removal may actually lead to an increase in emissions, owing to either coal replacing subsidized oil and natural gas or natural-gas use shifting from subsidizing, energy-exporting regions to non-subsidizing, importing regions.”
3. Renewables Fail To Deliver: When Demand Is High, Generation Capacity Is Low
Cradden and McDermott, 2018     “Prolonged cold spells were experienced in Ireland in the winters of 2009–10 and 2010–11, and electricity demand was relatively high at these times, whilst wind generation capacity factors were low. Such situations can cause difficulties for an electricity system with a high dependence on wind energy.”
4. Renewable Energy Becomes More Costly The More It Is Deployed … Renewable Energy Expansion Ensures More Fossil Fuel Installation Is Necessary As Backup
Blazquez et al., 2018     “However, promoting renewables –in liberalized power markets– creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. … The paradox is that the same market design and renewables policies that led to current success become increasingly less successful in the future as the share of renewables in the energy mix grows. … Full decarbonization of a power sector that relies on renewable technologies alone, given the current design of these markets, is not possible as conventional technologies provide important price signals. Markets would collapse if the last unit of fossil fuel technologies was phased out. In the extreme (theoretical) case of 100 percent renewables, prices would be at the renewables marginal cost, equal to zero or even negative for long periods. These prices would not be capturing the system’s costs nor would they be useful to signal operation and investment decisions. The result would be a purely administered subsidy, i.e., a non-market outcome. This is already occurring in Germany as Praktiknjo and Erdmann [31] point out and is clearly an unstable outcome. Thus, non-dispatchable technologies need to coexist with fossil fuel technologies. This outcome makes it impossible for renewables policy to reach success, defined as achieving a specified level of deployment at the lowest possible cost. With volatile, low and even negative electricity prices, investors would be discouraged from entering the market and they would require more incentives to continue to operate.”
Marques et al., 2018     “The installed capacity of wind power preserves fossil fuel dependency. … Electricity consumption intensity and its peaks have been satisfied by burning fossil fuels. … [A]s RES [renewable energy sources] increases, the expected decreasing tendency in the installed capacity of electricity generation from fossil fuels, has not been found. Despite the high share of RES in the electricity mix, RES, namely wind power and solar PV, are characterised by intermittent electricity generation.  … The inability of RES-I [intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar] to satisfy high fluctuations in electricity consumption on its own constitutes one of the main obstacles to the deployment of renewables. This incapacity is due to both the intermittency of natural resource availability, and the difficulty or even impossibility of storing electricity on a large scale, to defer generation.  As a consequence, RES [renewable energy sources] might not fully replace fossil sources …  In fact, the characteristics of electricity consumption reinforce the need to burn fossil fuels to satisfy the demand for electricity. Specifically, the ECA results confirm the substitution effect between the installed capacity of solar PV and fossil fuels. In contrast, installed wind power capacity has required all fossil fuels and hydropower to back up its intermittency in the long-run equilibrium. The EGA outcomes show that hydropower has been substituting electricity generation through NRES [non-renewable energy sources], but that other RES have needed the flexibility of natural gas plants, to back them up. … [D]ue to the intermittency phenomenon, the growth of installed capacity of RES-I [intermittent renewable energy sources – wind power] could maintain or increase electricity generation from fossil fuels.  … In short, the results indicate that the EU’s domestic electricity production systems have preserved fossil fuel generation, and include several economic inefficiencies and inefficiencies in resource allocation. … [A]n increase of 1% in the installed capacity of wind power provokes an increase of 0.26%, and 0.22% in electricity generation from oil and natural gas, respectively in the long-run.”
5. Biofuels – Declared Carbon-Neutral Renewables By The EU – Increase Emissions More Than Coal 
Sterman et al., 2018     “[G]overnments around the world are promoting biomass to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The European Union declared biofuels to be carbon-neutral to help meet its goal of 20% renewable energy by 2020, triggering a surge in use of wood for heat and electricity (European Commission 2003, Leturcq 2014, Stupak et al 2007). … But do biofuels actually reduce GHG emissions? … [A]lthough wood has approximately the same carbon intensity as coal (0.027 vs. 0.025 tC GJ−1 of primary energy […]), combustion efficiency of wood and wood pellets is lower (Netherlands Enterprise Agency; IEA 2016). Estimates also suggest higher processing losses in the wood supply chain (Roder et al 2015). Consequently, wood-fired power plants generate more CO2 per kWh than coal. Burning wood instead of coal therefore creates a carbon debt—an immediate increase in atmospheric CO2 compared to fossil energy—that can be repaid over time only as—and if— NPP [net primary production] rises above the flux of carbon from biomass and soils to the atmosphere on the harvested lands. … Growth in wood supply causes steady growth in atmospheric CO2 because more CO2 is added to the atmosphere every year in initial carbon debt than is paid back by regrowth, worsening global warming and climate change. The qualitative result that growth in bioenergy raises atmospheric CO2 does not depend on the parameters: as long as bioenergy generates an initial carbon debt, increasing harvests mean more is ‘borrowed’ every year than is paid back. More precisely, atmospheric CO2 rises as long as NPP [net primary production] remains below the initial carbon debt incurred each year plus the fluxes of carbon from biomass and soils to the atmosphere. … [C]ontrary to the policies of the EU and other nations, biomass used to displace fossil fuels injects CO2 into the atmosphere at the point of combustion and during harvest, processing and transport. Reductions in atmospheric CO2 come only later, and only if the harvested land is allowed to regrow.”
Fanous and Moomaw, 2018     “These nations fail to recognize the intensity of CO2 emissions linked to the burning of biomass. The chemical energy stored in wood is converted into heat or electricity by way of combustion and is sometimes used for combined heat and power cogeneration. At the point of combustion, biomass emits more carbon per unit of heat than most fossil fuels. Due to the inefficiencies of biomass energy, bioenergy power plants emit approximately 65 percent more CO2, per MWH than modern coal plants, and approximately 285 percent more than natural gas combined cycle plants. Furthermore, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that combustion of biomass generates gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions roughly equivalent to the combustion of fossil fuels. In the case of forest timber turned into wood pellets for bioenergy use, the IPCC further indicates that the process produces higher CO2 emissions than fossil fuels for decades to centuries.”

6. Biofuels “Use More Energy At A Higher Cost” And Produce More Air Pollution Than Fossil Fuels
Richardson and Kumar, 2017     “A growing human population creates a larger demand for food products and makes conservation of resources and increased efficiency of agricultural production more vital. … These results conclude that feed production systems are more energy efficient and less environmentally costly than corn-based ethanol. … [A]ccording to the findings of this study, biofuels, derived for the purpose of producing energy with little environmental impacts, actually use more energy at a higher environmental cost than the alternative crop use. As technology stands now, in terms of energy and environmental sustainability, the benefits of switching land uses to the production of corn-based transportation biofuels are not as favorable as continuing to produce corn for feed/food consumption.”
Emery et al., 2017     “Although climate change mitigation and energy security policies are generally expected to be compatible with air pollution and health cost reductions (McCollum et al., 2013), there is evidence that first-generation alternative fuels such as corn ethanol lead to higher health costs due to air pollution than conventional fuels [gasoline]  (Hill et al., 2009). … We find that life-cycle non-GHG air pollutant emissions, particularly NOX [nitrous oxides] and PM [particulates], are higher for corn ethanol and other biofuel blends than conventional petroleum fuels. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) increase by 9–50% per 100 km traveled for high-ethanol blends from corn grain and combined grain and stover feedstocks. NOX, PM [particulates], and SOX [sulfur dioxides] increase by 71–124% from corn grain and 56–110% from combined grain and stover, relative to conventional gasoline. Biodiesel blends show an increase of 1–11% (B20) and 4–55% (B100) in air pollution, with the largest increases in VOC [volatile organic compounds] and SOX [sulfur dioxides] emissions. … The total social costs of ethanol blends are higher than that of gasoline, due in part to higher life-cycle emissions of non-GHG pollutants and higher health and mortality costs per unit.”
7. Proximity To Wind Turbines Significantly Reduces Quality Of Life, Well-Being For Nearby Residents
Barry et al., 2018     “The findings indicate that residential proximity to wind turbines is correlated with annoyance and health-related quality of life measures. These associations differ in some respects from associations with noise measurements. Results can be used to support discussions between communities and wind-turbine developers regarding potential health effects of wind turbines.”
Krekel and Zerrahn, 2017     “We show that the construction of wind turbines close to households exerts significant negative external effects on residential well-being … In fact, beyond unpleasant noise emissions (Bakker et al., 2012; McCunney et al., 2014) and impacts on wildlife (Pearce-Higgins et al., 2012; Schuster et al., 2015), most importantly, wind turbines have been found to have negative impacts on landscape aesthetics (Devine-Wright, 2005; Jobert et al., 2007; Wolsink, 2007). … We show that the construction of a wind turbine within a radius of 4,000 metres has a significant negative and sizeable effect on life satisfaction. For larger radii, no negative externalities can be detected.”
Gortsas et al., 2017     “Infrasound, low frequency noise and soil vibrations produced by large wind turbines might disturb the comfort of nearby structures and residents. In addition repowering close to urban areas produces some fears to the nearby residents that the level of disturbance may increase. Due to wind loading, the foundation of a wind turbine interacts with the soil and creates micro-seismic surface waves that propagate for long distances and they are able to influence adversely sensitive measurements conducted by laboratories located far from the excitation point.”
8. “Renewable Energy Consumption Has A Negative Effect On Economic Growth”
Lee and Jung, 2018     “The results of the autoregressive distributed lag bounds test show that renewable energy consumption has a negative effect on economic growth, and the results of a vector error correction mechanism causality tests indicate a unidirectional relationship from economic growth to renewable energy consumption. The empirical results imply that economic growth is a direct driver expanding renewable energy use. In terms of policy implications, it is best for policy makers to focus on overall economic growth rather than expanding renewable energy to drive economic growth. … [O]ur result suggests that renewable energy policy should be implemented when the real GDP is enough large to overcome the negative impact from renewable energy, because the causality from economic growth to renewable energy consumption in the long run as one of our result is caused by both low productivity of renewable energy production and expansion of government-led renewable energy.”
9. Research: 100% Renewable Energy Is “Unattainable” In Reality – Decarbonization Is “Arguably Reckless”
Clack et al., 2017   “The scenarios of [Jacobson et al., 2015, “Low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem with 100% penetration of intermittent wind, water, and solar for all purposes”] can, at best, be described as a poorly executed exploration of an interesting hypothesis. The study’s numerous shortcomings and errors render it unreliable as a guide about the likely cost, technical reliability, or feasibility of a 100% wind, solar, and hydroelectric power system. It is one thing to explore the potential use of technologies in a clearly caveated hypothetical analysis; it is quite another to claim that a model using these technologies at an unprecedented scale conclusively shows the feasibility and reliability of the modeled energy system implemented by midcentury. From the information given by [Jacobson et al., 2015], it is clear that both hydroelectric power and flexible load have been modeled in erroneous ways and that these errors alone invalidate the study and its results.”
Heard et al., 2017     “While many modelled scenarios have been published claiming to show that a 100% renewable electricity system is achievable, there is no empirical or historical evidence that demonstrates that such systems are in fact feasible. Of the studies published to date, 24 have forecast regional, national or global energy requirements at sufficient detail to be considered potentially credible. We critically review these studies using four novel feasibility criteria for reliable electricity systems needed to meet electricity demand this century. [N]one of the 24 studies provides convincing evidence that these basic feasibility criteria can be met. Of a maximum possible unweighted feasibility score of seven, the highest score for any one study was four. … On the basis of this review, efforts to date seem to have substantially underestimated the challenge and delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways. … To date, efforts to assess the viability of 100% renewable systems, taking into account aspects such as financial cost, social acceptance, pace of roll-out, land use, and materials consumption, have substantially underestimated the challenge of excising fossil fuels from our energy supplies. This desire to push the 100%-renewable ideal without critical evaluation has ironically delayed the identification and implementation of effective and comprehensive decarbonization pathways. We argue that the early exclusion of other forms of technology from plans to decarbonize the global electricity supply is unsupportable, and arguably reckless. … The realization of 100% renewable electricity (and energy more broadly) appears diametrically opposed to other critical sustainability issues such as eradication of poverty, land conservation and reduced ecological footprints, reduction in air pollution, preservation of biodiversity, and social justice for indigenous people.”
10. Wealthy Countries Foist Social-Environmental Disruption From Wind, Solar Onto Poorer Countries 
Shakespear, 2018     “A trend was found, whereby developing countries tend to suffer the most socio-environmental disruption from material extraction for solar-panels and wind-turbines while exhibiting lower implementation of these technologies, and developed countries show opposite effects. This indicates that EUE [ecologically unequal exchange] effects constitute global solar-panel and wind-turbine systems, and that developed countries displace socio-environmental disruption from energy innovation onto developing countries. … [I]mplementation of solarpanels and wind-turbines tended to be the most prevalent within countries that suffer the least environmental and socio-economic consequences from the extraction of materials for these technologies. This effectively means that efforts to increase sustainability in relatively powerful countries via renewable energy implementation exacerbates unsustainable practices in the relatively less powerful countries that extract the minerals for these technologies.”
11. Wind Power Harming The Environment, Biosphere – Destroying Habitats, Endangering Rare Species 
Millon et al., 2018  (full paper)   “Wind turbines impact bat activity, leading to high losses of habitat use … Island bats represent 60% of bat species worldwide and the highest proportion of terrestrial mammals on isolated islands, including numerous endemic and threatened species (Fleming and Racey, 2009). … We present one of the first studies to quantify the indirect impact of wind farms on insectivorous bats in tropical hotspots of biodiversity. Bat activity [New Caledonia, Pacific Islands, which hosts nine species of bat] was compared between wind farm sites and control sites, via ultrasound recordings at stationary points [A bat pass is defined as a single or several echolocation calls during a five second interval.] The activity of bent winged bats (Miniopterus sp.) and wattled bats (Chalinolobus sp.) were both significantly lower at wind turbine sites. The result of the study demonstrates a large effect on bat habitat use at wind turbines sites compared to control sites. Bat activity was 20 times higher at control sites compared to wind turbine sites, which suggests that habitat loss is an important impact to consider in wind farm planning. …  Here, we provide evidence showing that two genera of insectivorous bat species are also threatened by wind farms.  … To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies quantifying the indirect negative impact of wind turbines on bat activity in the tropics. … The lower attractiveness of the foraging habitat under wind turbines, both in a tropical and in a temperate climate, indicates that the indirect impact of wind turbine is a worldwide phenomenon.”

Lopucki et al., 2018      “Living in habitats affected by wind turbines may result in an increase in corticosterone levels in ground dwelling animals… Environmental changes and disturbance factors caused by wind turbines may act as potential stressors for natural populations of both flying and ground dwelling animal species. The physiological stress response results in release of glucocorticoid hormones. … The common vole showed a distinct physiological response − the individuals living near the wind turbines had a higher level of corticosterone [physiological stress affecting regulation of energy, immune reactions]. … This is the first study suggesting impact of wind farms on physiological stress reactions in wild rodent populations. Such knowledge may be helpful in making environmental decisions when planning the development of wind energy and may contribute to optimization of conservation actions for wildlife.”
Ferrão da Costa et al., 2018     “According to a review by Lovich and Ennen (2013), the construction and operation of wind farms have both potential and known impacts on terrestrial vertebrates, such as: (i) increase in direct mortality due to traffic collisions; (ii) destruction and modification of the habitat, including road development, habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow; (iii) noise effects, visual impacts, vibration and shadow flicker effects from turbines; (iv) electromagnetic field generation; (v) macro and microclimate change; (vi) predator attraction; and (vii) increase in fire risks. … Helldin et al. (2012) also highlighted that the development of road networks associated with wind farms could promote increased access for traffic related to recreation, forestry, agriculture and hunting. The consequence, particularly on remote places, is the increase in human presence, affecting large mammals via significant disturbance, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. These negative effects are expected to be particularly relevant for species that are more sensitive to human presence and activities, such as large carnivores. Large carnivores, such as the wolf, bear, lynx or wolverine, tend to avoid areas that are regularly used by humans and—especially for breeding—show a preference for rugged and undisturbed areas (Theuerkauf et al. 2003; George and Crooks 2006; May et al. 2006; Elfstrom et al. 2008; Sazatornil et al. 2016), which are often chosen for wind power development (Passoni et al. 2017). … Results have shown that the main impact of wind farms on wolves is the induced reduction on breeding site fidelity and reproductive rates. These effects, particularly when breeding sites shift to more unsuitable areas, may imply decreasing survival and pack viability in the short term.”
Watson et al., 2018     “The global potential for wind power generation is vast, and the number of installations is increasing rapidly. We review case studies from around the world of the effects on raptors of wind-energy development. Collision mortality, displacement, and habitat loss have the potential to cause population-level effects, especially for species that are rare or endangered.”
Aschwanden et al., 2018    “The extrapolated number of collisions was 20.7 birds/wind turbine (CI-95%: 14.3–29.6) for 8.5 months. Nocturnally migrating passerines, especially kinglets (Regulus sp.), represented 55% of the fatalities. 2.1% of the birds theoretically exposed to a collision (measured by radar at the height of the wind turbines) were effectively colliding.”
Naylor, 2018     “While wind energy provides a viable solution for emission reductions, it comes at an environmental cost, particularly for birds. As wind energy grows in popularity, its environmental impacts are becoming more apparent. Recent studies indicate that wind power has negative effects on proximate wildlife. These impacts can be direct—collision fatalities—and indirect—habitat loss (Fargione et al. 2012; Glen et al. 2013). Negative impacts associated with operational wind farms include collision mortalities from towers or transmission lines and barotrauma for bats. Habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as avoidance behavior, are also consequences resulting from wind farm construction and related infrastructure. The potential harm towards protected and migratory bird species are an urgent concern, especially for wind farms located along migratory flyways. In terms of mortality, wind turbines kill an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 birds, annually (Smallwood 2013). The high speed at which the fan wings move and the concentration of turbines create a gauntlet of hazards for birds to fly through. … [T]he height of most wind turbines aligns with the altitude many bird species fly at (Bowden 2015). Birds of prey— raptors—are of particular concern because of their slow reproductive cycles and long lifespans relative to other bird species (Kuvlesky 2007).”
Lange et al., 2018     “Results from our surface water extractions and aerial surveys suggest that the wind farm has negatively affected redheads through altered hydrology and disturbance displacement. Our surface water extraction analysis provides compelling evidence that the local hydrology has been greatly affected by the construction of the wind farm. … Our results suggest the occurrence of direct habitat loss and disturbance displacement of redheads from the wind farm along the lower Texas coast. Although our study was directed solely toward redheads, it is likely that this wind farm has affected other species that use these wetlands or migrate along the lower Texas coast (Contreras et al. 2017). Studies in Europe investigating the effects on waterfowl by wind turbines have reported similar results, showing that turbines have likely compromised foraging opportunities for waterfowl through disturbance displacement (Larsen and Madsen 2000).”
Chiebáo, 2018     “I studied the large-scale movements of white-tailed eagles during the dispersal period, assessing their space use in relation to the distribution of existing and proposed wind farms across Finland. I found that a breeding pair holding a territory closer to an installation has a lower probability to breed successfully when compared to a pair from a territory lying farther away. Such lower probability may in part reflect a harmful interaction between the eagles and wind turbines in the form of collision mortality, to which the adults appear to be particularly vulnerable during the breeding season. Regarding the post-fledging period, I found that the probability of a young eagle approaching a wind turbine decreases sharply as the turbine is installed at increasing distances from the nest.”
Frick et al., 2017     “Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy facilities. However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (λ = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our findings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife.”
Hammerson et al, 2017      “Conservationists are increasingly concerned about North American bats due to the arrival and spread of the White-nose Syndrome (WNS) disease and mortality associated with wind turbine strikes. To place these novel threats in context for a group of mammals that provides important ecosystem services, we performed the first comprehensive conservation status assessment focusing exclusively on the 45 species occurring in North America north of Mexico. Although most North American bats have large range sizes and large populations, as of 2015, 18–31% of the species were at risk (categorized as having vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled NatureServe conservation statuses) and therefore among the most imperiled terrestrial vertebrates on the continent.”
Vasilakis et al., 2017     “Numerous wind farms are planned in a region hosting the only cinereous vulture population in south-eastern Europe. We combined range use modelling and a Collision Risk Model (CRM) to predict the cumulative collision mortality for cinereous vulture under all operating and proposed wind farms. Four different vulture avoidance rates were considered in the CRM.  Cumulative collision mortality was expected to be eight to ten times greater in the future (proposed and operating wind farms) than currently (operating wind farms), equivalent to 44% of the current population (103 individuals) if all proposals are authorized (2744 MW). Even under the most optimistic scenario whereby authorized proposals will not collectively exceed the national target for wind harnessing in the study area (960 MW), cumulative collision mortality would still be high (17% of current population) and likely lead to population extinction.”
12. Wind Turbine Blade Waste Disposal A Growing Ecological Nightmare
Liu and Barlow, 2017     “Wind energy has developed rapidly over the last two decades to become one of the most promising and economically viable sources of renewable energy. Although wind energy is claimed to provide clean renewable energy without any emissions during operation, but it is only one side of the coin. The blades, one of the most important components in the wind turbines, made with composite, are currently regarded as unrecyclable.  With the first wave of early commercial wind turbine installations now approaching their end of life, the problem of blade disposal is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future. … The research indicates that there will be 43 million tonnes of blade waste worldwide by 2050 with China possessing 40% of the waste, Europe 25%, the United States 16% and the rest of the world 19%.”
Ramirez-Tejeda et al., 2017     “Globally, more than seventy thousand wind turbine blades were deployed in 2012 and there were 433 gigawatts (GW) of wind installed capacity worldwide at the end of 2015. Moreover, the United States’ installed wind power capacity will need to increase from 74 GW to 300 GW3 to achieve its 20% wind production goal by 2030.  … The wind turbine blades are designed to have a lifespan of about twenty years, after which they would have to be dismantled due to physical degradation or damage beyond repair. … Estimations have suggested that between 330,000 tons/year by 2028 and 418,000 tons/year by 2040 of composite material from blades will need to be disposed worldwide. That would be equivalent to the amount of plastics waste generated by four million people in the United States in 2013. This anticipated increase in blade manufacturing and disposal will likely lead to adverse environmental consequences. … Despite its negative consequences, landfilling has so far been the most commonly utilized wind turbine blade disposal method. …  Landfilling is especially problematic because its high resistance to heat, sunlight, and moisture means that it will take hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill environment. The wood and other organic material present in the blades would also end up in landfills, potentially releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other volatile organic compounds to the environment.”

As the Asahi Shimbun here reports, Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido has been gripped by a deep freeze with the temperature plunging to -31.8°C in Rikubetsu on February 9.

Three other observation stations in Hokkaido “also reported temperatures below minus 30 degrees,” the Japanese online daily reports.
10 stations set new record lows
In total yesterday, February 9, in Hokkaido Prefecture, 10 stations saw their temperatures reach record lows:

Although some media outlets are claiming the record cold is due to a phenomenon that is often implied as being new and caused by global warming, it is in reality what people simply used to call a plain old ‘cold wave’.
The NOAA reports here that the “polar vortex” is in fact nothing new at all, and that the term had been used already 166 years ago, back in 1853!
Global warming causing “coldest ever” air masses?
The Japan Times here reported that it was “the coldest air mass ever recorded” to hit Hokkaido”.
How can global warming be causing record cold air masses? Air masses are supposed to be getting warmer, and not colder. Climate scientists are desperately scrambling to explain the inconvenient cold events.
Referring to the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), The Japan Times have written: “The agency said a cold air mass with a temperature of minus 24.4, the lowest seen since it began compiling such data in 1957, was hovering about 1,500 meters above Sapporo, which saw the mercury drop to minus 12.5 in the morning.”
Frozen fire extinguishers at nuclear power plant!
The cold is so severe that it even froze a fire extinguisher system at a nuclear power plant in Hokkaido, “due to a record cold weather,” reported the NHK World here.
Meanwhile further south in Tokyo, snow fell yesterday. The forecast is calling for cold conditions to grip Japan in the days ahead.

Utilizing real-world Raman spectrometer data, an independent researcher from Sweden has found both N2 and O2 do indeed absorb radiation, or function as GHGs. If true, the CO2-is-a-special-heat-trapping-gas conceptualization effectively collapses.

Image Source: ResearchGate
A new paper entitled “Quantum Mechanics and Raman Spectroscopy Refute Greenhouse Theory” has recently been made available online.
Written by Blair D Macdonald, an independent researcher specializing in fractral geometry and quantum mechanics, the analysis utilizes real-world IR spectral measurements from a Raman spectrometer (laser).
Concisely, Macdonald has determined that CO2 is no more “special” a gas absorber and re-emmitter of radiation than nitrogen or oxygen, even though the latter are not considered greenhouse gases.
What follows is but a tiny snapshot of some key points from this comprehensively-sourced paper.
Note: It would be advisable that interested readers – especially those who are rightly skeptical of iconoclastic analyses like these – should read the text in some detail before commenting.  Turning the spotlight on papers that question conventional wisdom is primarily intended to elicit open-minded discussion.  It is not intended to convey we have arrived at a definitive conclusion about the authenticities of the CO2 greenhouse effect.

Macdonald, 2018
Quantum Mechanics and Raman Spectroscopy 
Refute Greenhouse Theory
Abstract:  “Greenhouse theory’s premise, nitrogen and oxygen are not greenhouse gases as they do not emit and absorb infrared radiation, presents a paradox; it contradicts both quantum mechanics and thermodynamics – where all matter above absolute 0° Kelvin radiates IR photons.  It was hypothesized these gases do radiate at quantum mechanics predicted spectra, and these spectra are observed by IR spectroscopy’s complement instrument, Raman spectroscopy; and N2 spectra can be demonstrated to absorb IR radiation by experiment, and application o the N2-CO2 laser.  It was found the gases do possess quantum predicted emission spectra at 2338 cm−¹ and 1156 cm−¹ respectively, both well within the IR range of the EMS, and are only observed – and their temperatures accurately measured – by Raman spectrometers.  Raman spectrometers measure, more accurately, the Keeling curve, and have application with meteorological Lidars and planetary atmospheric analysis.  The N2-CO2 Laser showed – contrary to current greenhouse theory – N2 absorbs electrons or (IR) photons at its – metastable ‘long-lasting’ – spectra mode.  It was argued atmospheric CO2, as a law, is heated by the same mechanism as the N2-CO2 laser: nitrogen (first) and the entire atmosphere absorbs IR radiation directly from the Sun, just as it heats water on the ocean surface.  With these findings, greenhouse theory is wrong – all gases are GHGs [greenhouse gases] – and needs review.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper documents “remarkably different” land temperatures from one instrumental data set to another. In some regions there is as much as an 0.8°C conflict in recorded temperature anomalies for CRU, NASA, BEST, and NOAA. The relative temperature trend differences can reach 90% when comparing instrumental records. Consequently, the uncertainty in instrumental temperature trends — “0.097–0.305°C per decade for recent decades (i.e., 1981–2017)” —  is as large or larger than the alleged overall warming trend itself for this period.

In a just-published audit of the IPCC-preferred HadCRUT temperature data set, Dr. John McClean identified 70 problems that seriously compromise the reliability and accuracy of this IPCC-preferred instrumental record dating back to 1850.
Joanne Nova provides a summary of the main points from the paper, McLean’s Ph.D thesis.



McLean found freakishly improbable data, and systematic adjustment errors , large gaps where there is no data, location errors, Fahrenheit temperatures reported as Celsius, and spelling errors.


Almost no quality control checks have been done: outliers that are obvious mistakes have not been corrected – one town in Columbia spent three months in 1978 at an average daily temperature of over 80 degrees C.  One town in Romania stepped out from summer in 1953 straight into a month of Spring at minus 46°C. These are supposedly “average” temperatures for a full month at a time. St Kitts, a Caribbean island, was recorded at 0°C for a whole month, and twice!


Temperatures for the entire Southern Hemisphere in 1850 and for the next three years are calculated from just one site in Indonesia and some random ships.


Sea surface temperatures represent 70% of the Earth’s surface, but some measurements come from ships which are logged at locations 100km inland. Others are in harbors which are hardly representative of the open ocean.



Are Any Of The Temperature Data Sets Reliable? 
A new paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research reveals that the recorded land temperature data from the four most commonly-referenced instrumental data sets — CRU, NASA, BEST, and NOAA — are “remarkably different” from one another.
In fact, the authors find that “for some areas, different data sets produce conflicting results of whether warming exists” due especially to variations in the use of “infilling techniques” — adding artificial temperatures to areas where there are no real-world measurements.
One data set trend can be “nearly 90%” different than another data set trend, which ratchets up the uncertainty to levels that undermine confidence in the overall reliability of the instrumental record.
Excerpts from the paper’s abstract and discussion/conclusion are provided below.


Rao et al., 2018
Land Surface Air Temperature Data Are Considerably Different
Among BEST‐LAND, CRU‐TEM4v, NASA‐GISS, and NOAA‐NCEI
“Several groups routinely produce gridded land surface air temperature (LSAT) data sets using station measurements to assess the status and impact of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report suggests that estimated global and hemispheric mean LSAT trends of different data sets are consistent. However, less attention has been paid to the intercomparison at local/regional scales, which is important for local/regional studies. In this study we comprehensively compare four data sets at different spatial and temporal scales, including Berkley Earth Surface Temperature land surface air temperature data set (BEST‐LAND), Climate Research Unit Temperature Data Set version 4 (CRU‐TEM4v), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies data (NASA‐GISS), and data provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Center for Environmental Information (NOAA‐NCEI). The mean LSAT [land surface air temperature] anomalies are remarkably different because of the data coverage differences, with the magnitude nearly 0.4°C for the global and Northern Hemisphere and 0.6°C for the Southern Hemisphere.”

“This study additionally finds that on the regional scale, northern high latitudes, southern middle‐to‐high latitudes, and the equator show the largest differences nearly 0.8°C.”
“These differences cause notable differences for the trend calculation at regional scales. At the local scale, four data sets show significant variations over South America, Africa, Maritime Continent, central Australia, and Antarctica, which leads to remarkable differences in the local trend analysis. For some areas, different data sets produce conflicting results of whether warming exists.”
“Our analysis shows that the differences across scales are associated with the availability of stations and the use of infilling techniques. Our results suggest that conventional LSAT data sets using only station observations have large uncertainties across scales, especially over station‐sparse areas.”
“The relative difference of trends estimated from different data sets can reach nearly 90% for different regions and time periods. CRU-TEM4v generally appears to have the largest grid box scale differences, while NASA-GISS has the smallest differences compared to BEST-LAND.”
“The uncertainty of the LSAT [land surface air temperature] trend estimation caused by the data set differences (i.e., RMSD) ranges from 0.035 to 0.086°C per decade for the long-term trend (i.e., 1901–2017) to 0.097–0.305°C per decade for recent decades (i.e., 1981–2017).”
“In developing future LSAT data sets, the data uncertainty caused by limited and unevenly distributed station observations must be reduced.”

80+ Papers: Mid-Holocene Sea Levels
Were Multiple Meters Higher Than Today

Mid-Holocene based on 14C rock oyster chronology
• “~6000 cal yr B.P. old oysters can be found from between 3.8 ± 0.1 m to 2.5 ± 0.1 m above present day mean sea level. … Dead (fossil) oysters were collected from between 1 and 3 m above the centre of the live oyster band in a more sheltered cleft inside the notch. The oldest sample with an age of 5270–4950 cal yr B.P. was collected at an elevation of 3.01 ± 0.1 m above the apex of the notch. The ages decrease with elevation down to 920–710 cal yr B.P. at 1.03 m.”
• “In all the sites, the 14C age of the dead oysters inside the notches increases with increasing elevation above present day MSL. Clearly, relative sea level was 2 to 3 m higher than present between 6000 and 3000 B.P. and has steadily fallen since.” 
• “There was a progressive warming from ~13,500 years ago to a peak at 6500 ± 200 years ago followed by a cooling of −2.6 °C to the present day.” 
• “Generally, there is a ~1 m wide live oyster band (with modern 14C ages) in the apex of the sea notch that corresponds to the present day MSL. 14C ages of dead oysters are systematically older higher up the sea notch and reach a maximum 14C cal yr B.P. age of 6513–6390 cal yr B.P. at an elevation of 2.5 ± 0.1 m above present day MSL in an exposed site at West Railay Beach. Consequently, relative sea levels must have been higher in the mid Holocene than they are now.”
• “[A]t a more sheltered site inside a bay on Ko Pha Nak, the highest preserved oyster shell is at 3.2 ± 0.1 m above MSL and has a younger 14C calibrated age of 5845–5605 cal yr B.P. Furthermore, oysters from 3.8 ± 0.1 m above present day MSL, encrusted on a stalactite in a cave at West Railay Beach has a 14C calibrated age of 6176–6041 cal yr B.P.”

Share this...FacebookTwitter5300 years ago sea level near Surinam and Guyana was about 1m higher than today
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
A paper authored by Khan et al. 2017 looked at the Caribbean over the past 10,000 years.
After the end of the last ice age some 11,000 years ago, sea level rose around Surinam and Guyana at a rate of 11 mm per year. That’s about 5 times faster than today.
During the middle and late Holocene, i.e. over the past 5000 years, sea level rise was only 2.4 mm per year. By the way: 5300 years ago sea level at both countries was about 1 meter higher than today’s level. Surprised? Abstract:
Drivers of Holocene sea-level change in the Caribbean
We present a Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) database for the Caribbean region (5°N to 25°N and 55°W to 90°W) that consists of 499 sea-level index points and 238 limiting dates. The database was compiled from multiple sea-level indicators (mangrove peat, microbial mats, beach rock and acroporid and massive corals). We subdivided the database into 20 regions to investigate the influence of tectonics and glacial isostatic adjustment on RSL. We account for the local-scale processes of sediment compaction and tidal range change using the stratigraphic position (overburden thickness) of index points and paleotidal modeling, respectively. We use a spatio-temporal empirical hierarchical model to estimate RSL position and its rates of change in the Caribbean over 1-ka time slices. Because of meltwater input, the rates of RSL change were highest during the early Holocene, with a maximum of 10.9 ± 0.6 m/ka in Suriname and Guyana and minimum of 7.4 ± 0.7 m/ka in south Florida from 12 to 8 ka. Following complete deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) by ∼7 ka, mid-to late-Holocene rates slowed to < 2.4 ± 0.4 m/ka. The hierarchical model constrains the spatial extent of the mid-Holocene highstand. RSL did not exceed the present height during the Holocene, except on the northern coast of South America, where in Suriname and Guyana, RSL attained a height higher than present by 6.6 ka (82% probability).The highstand reached a maximum elevation of +1.0 ± 1.1 m between 5.3 and 5.2 ka. Regions with a highstand were located furthest away from the former LIS, where the effects from ocean syphoning and hydro-isostasy outweigh the influence of subsidence from forebulge collapse.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe upcoming 6th IPCC Sixth Assessment Report will be a “comprehensive assessment of the science” related to climate change and published in 2022. However, don’t expect it to be “comprehensive” at all as hundreds of scientific publications showing profound impacts by sun and oceans will go ignored.
Climate science has turned into a religion that centers on a single act of faith. Human CO2 is changing our climate.
In the past it was always understood that climate was impacted by a vast array of factors, such oceanic cycles, solar cycles, aerosols, cloud cover, etc. to name a few.

Images: NASA (public domain)
But over the years tremendous resources have been poured into an effort aimed at pinning the blame on man-made greenhouse gases. Models have been grossly distorted and corrupted to make CO2 the 90%+ climate driver.
Despite global temperatures having fallen by more than 0.5°C over the past two years due to the ending of an El Nino event, IPCC scientists continue to insist that trace gas CO2 is the main driver behi9nd climate warming. In the IPCC 5th summary report for policymakers, for example, solar and oceanic factors re described as having little effect on global temperatures:

Source: IPCC 5th Summary Report for Policymakers.
With such a disregard for natural factors, it is no surprise that we are already observing the spectacular failure of the climate models.
Not only have ocean cycles been grossly ignored in climate models, but so have solar factors. The sun is not constant in its behavior, and has been shown to act in cycles that have profound impacts on the earth’s climate system.
Research showing sun’s impact piles up
Despite all the effort to frame CO2, scientists are still conducting a formidable amount of research on the sun’s impact.

Indeed since the last IPCC report was released in 2013, there have been literally hundreds of scientific peer-reviewed publications showing that the sun directly and indirectly have a great impact on the earth’s climate. Yet IPCC scientists obstinately continue to refuse to acknowledge these in their models.
Back in 2013 I produced a list of 123 paper showing that the sun impacts global climate.
More than 600 published papers show clear solar impact on climate
NTZ guest author Kenneth Richard has been busy listing the papers as well. What follows are the list of papers showing the sun impacts global climate.
2012 123 papers had been published and ignored by IPCC 4AR
In 2014, 93 papers were published.
In 2015,  95 peer-reviewed papers were published
In 2016, 133 papers were published.
In 2017,  121 peer-reviewed solar papers were published.
In 2018, so far, ca. 60 papers.
That brings the total of scientific peer-reviewed papers that will be completely ignored by the IPCC to 625. If that isn’t fraudulent “science-based” policymaking, then what is?
Aim: human society in shackles
The aim of the IPCC is to ignore recognized standards of science, frame mankind for a nonexistent crime, and shackle human society. It’s the next planned slavery. The developing countries, who will be denied cheap and reliable energy, will bear the heaviest chains.

By Michael Krueger
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)

Three days ago, climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf published an article at his KlimaLounge blog on the hearing of Jewish climate scientist Nir Shaviv in the German Bundestag concerning the Climate Change Conference in Katowice.
Accuses Shaviv of presenting “outlandish theories”
 There he describes Shaviv as a “climate skeptic” with outlandish theories and who is courted by the fossil lobby and AfD Party. During the hearing, the German Left party even accused Shaviv of obviously being paid to publish climate-denialism. Stefan Rahmstorf went even further, claiming, “This is a targeted misleading of the layperson audience”. 
Just who is misleading whom, I would like to pursue here. 
The conflict between Jewish climate scientist Nir Shaviv and Stefan Rahmstorf dates back to 2003, when Stefan Rahmstorf wrote the following e-mail to his colleagues:
I feel another recent paper may require a similar scientific response, the one by Shaviv & Veizer (attached). …This paper got big media coverage here in Germany and I guess it is set to become a climate skeptics classic: …”
Since then, Shaviv has fallen out of favor with Stefan Rahmstorf.
Dissenters get labelled as right wingers
In the comment area of Mr. Rahmstorf’s article, some commentators — who were immediately labelled by other commenters as right wing spectrum — criticized that NASA’s temperature curve in Figure 5 was truncated in 2016, exactly when the last El-Nino pushed up the global temperature. Mr. Rahmstorf vehemently rejected the criticism.
In the article Mr. Rahmstorf refers to a link on how to create your own widget according to Figure 5, here the link. There the year 2017 is included and the curve is not cut off at 2016. Between 2016 and 2017 the global temperature dropped by 0.1°C, and in 2018 by a further 0.1°C.
Hide the decline
In the year 2016 we were at +1°C temperature anomaly according to NASA (a new record!), but today in the year 2018 only at 0.8°C. Mr. Rahmstorf obviously wanted to hide this by cleverly truncating at 2016, probably with the hope his lay public would not notice it?
Mr. Rahmstorf first showed the following Figure 5 in the article, which was truncated at 2016:

When the “deception” was discovered, he quickly changed Figure 5, without comment, and recorded the year 2017. Now the chart looks like this:

The year 2018 is still missing, which is currently only 0.8°C above the mean just before the end of the year, i.e. 0.1°C lower than 2017.

Poor correlation
With the chart he also tries to give the impression that there is a close relationship between CO2 rise and temperature rise. If one looks at the correlation coefficients, i.e. whether there is a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature rise, one can immediately see that between 1880-1970/80 there is only a moderate correlation between CO2 and temperature. It is around 0.6. A value of zero means no correlation, 1 means a perfect correlation. Only between 1980 and today does the correlation increase to around 0.9.
Thus one can say that actually only since 1980 does a good correlation exist.
To be correct, it has to be taken into account that other climatic factors also contribute to the rise in temperature and not just CO2 alone. In addition, in the recent geological past (around the last 1 million years), as evidenced by ice cores in the Antarctic and Arctic, it is always the temperature that has risen and then followed by CO2. 
So it may well be that even today the temperature increase precedes the CO2 increase and the CO2 increase is partly due to temperature, e.g. because less CO2 can be stored in warm seas. (Half of the CO2 remains in the air, the other half goes into the ocean). 
Natural factors kept hidden
Of course, Mr. Rahmstorf does not mention this in his article, in the belief nobody would notice. Or in other words, it’s about “deliberately misleading the lay audience”, and here not by Mr. Shaviv.
Mr. Rahmstorf’s supporters in the comments section obviously do not care whether Mr. Rahmstorf uses the methods which he accuses others of using. It is about deliberately discrediting others who have a different opinion and not of having a debate at factual level. The climate activists consider themselves scientifically and politically legitimized to force their policy on the opponents of opinion, and to do so by using smearing and violence if necessary. Sometimes a Jewish scientist gets placed in the “right-wing corner” and persons with a different opinion placed with the right wing AfD. The ends justify the means.
More misleading claims by Rahmstorf
In the following I would like to briefly go into further “deceptions” in Mr. Rahmstorf’s article. He writes:
30 years ago, in 1988, the American climate researcher James Hansen famously declared in the US Senate that the long predicted warming was now there and recognizable in the data.”
But Hansen was completely wrong with his 1988 scenarios, as we know today. See the following figure:

Furthermore ,Stefan Rahmstorf defends the hockey stick curve of his friend Michael Mann from 1998/99.
Busted hockey stick chart
Recent reconstructions would still show the same result. It should be noted that Mann’s 1998/99 hockey stick was truncated in 1980 because the proxy data showed no increase at the end of the time series. His colleague Briffa even truncated the chart in 1960. Used in place of the proxy data were weather data/temperatures from weather stations showing much larger rises than the proxy data averaged.
What follows is the the Briffa version where the proxy data are cut off at 1960 and replaced by data from weather stations and with the proxy data (green) up until the present.

The same was done with the more recent “reconstructions” mentioned by Mr. Rahmstorf.
When Mr. Rahmstorf was asked, he replied, claiming “these are well-known ‘talking points’ of the ‘climate sceptics’, and almost everything is wrong or misleading.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeft-leaning filmmaker German-Dutch filmmaker Martin Poels has produced some 50 films over the past 15 years. 

German-Dutch film maker Martin Poels has come under attack for questioning climate dogma. Image cropped here.
His most recent film is titled Paradogma – a personal journey why true liberty needs heretics, It focusses on current controversial debates such as climate change, and how dissenters are being silenced.
Martin Poels recently wrote: “People who dare to question important themes today, are often silenced or labeled as suspicious and dangerous and that we now find ourselves “in a new era where world views clash and free speech crumbles under pressure to conform.”
German liberty under threat
And because Poels has been critical concerning the state of the climate debate, he has been threatened and marginalized. 
German mainstream media has silenced the film, and anonymous threats have been launched against Poels, which show that the topic of climate and energy has become type of religion.
And anyone who questions this religion gets shut out of the public discussion forum.
Nevertheless journalist Jörg Rehmann spoke with Poels after the screening of his film in Brussels at the end of last year:

According to the interview:
Since Martin Poels has become critical about the contradictions of climate science, he has been blocked out by the German media and threatened by green lobbyists and at times called a Nazi.”
In the interview he begins by stating that because the film looks at climate and energy, it is a difficult topic because of the deep political dogma that it involves. “But the biggest problem,” Poels said, “Is that the media refuses to report on it.”
Climate: “forged” consensus that must not be disturbed
Poels mentions that they were successful, however, getting the film shown in 100 cinemas. Overall he calls the subject of climate in Germany a dogma that it is very difficult to criticize. He calls climate consensus something that was forged, and not something that is to be disturbed.
Hostile Greenpeace?
The filmmaker speaks of having received threats from organizations, such as Greenpeace, so much so that he became afraid. He said: “I got a call warning that I should better stop the film, before you really get problems.” He says the call was anonymous, but his understanding was that it came from Greenpeace.
Next Poels describes how some people reacted when the film was shown. He said: “Sometimes there were people who got really aggressive in their talk against me”.
“Shameful” media

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




He then calls the German publicly funded media’s role in the climate topic “shameful”, as it is clear that the green energy issue is not a topic that is to be questioned nor discussed.
Either you’re with us, or against us
Poels also notes that the topic of green energies can be discussed and criticizesd in Holland, but that it Germany the issue of green energies has become very sensitive and criticism is not welcome “because rescuing the climate is good, and when you criticize it, it means you no longer want to save the planet.” It’s: either you’re with us, or against us. Poels calls this radical mindset “nonsense”.
Corrupted by business interests
Poels sees green energies as desirable, but currently he believes they are a social injustice, as the rich benefit and the poor have to bear the costs. Moreover, they are harming the environment more than they are helping.
The flim also shows that the science is long from being settled, thus contradicting claims often made by alarmist scientists and the media. Poels believes that the science has been corrupted in part by lobbyists “where the target is no longer the target, and that business has become the target itself.” He adds:
For me, that’s one explanation why we are not allowed to discuss it. Because it criticizes not only climate change, but the business behind it.”
Biased media has abandoned its job
For Poels, this corruption by self interest is simply being neglected by the German public media: “There are simply rules within the media that say to talk about climate change uncritically – only positively. That’s a law within the media business.”
In total, Poels believes German journalism has long abandoned it’s neutrality on the topic of climate change and green energies. “It’s only politics.” He comments further:
Not only the science is politicized, but so are the media.”
German media “really frightening”
Poels then says the media are more open in the Netherlands, but finds the situation in Berlin “really frightening”. He agrees that in Germany it’s enough to express skepticism on climate science in order to be labelled a fringe right winger.
He finds it ironic that the media often accuse climate skeptics of conspiracy theories, but at the same time subscribe to the conspiracy theory that oil companies helped fund his film.
Academic arrogance
In the area of academia, Poels says overall the film has been received positively and openly by most students, but that professors have composed themselves arrogantly and simply dismiss the film’s content offhand after viewing it. One example, Poels cites, is how one professor simply dismissed a critical student – who had challenged the professor – as “a student who still had a lot to learn”.
Energiewende at a dead-end
In summary Poels agrees that the German Energiewende has reached a dead-end and that the establishment is no longer capable of learning lessons.
Historically, that all sounds familiar.

Parker, 2018
Sea level oscillations in Japan and China since the start of
the 20th century and consequences for coastal management
“Regionally, the sea levels in the PRD [Pearl River Delta, China] region and Japan show no significant acceleration from 1900 to present, but only oscillations. This result is consistent with the other coastal area of the world where long-term tide gauges are located. Policy making, and management, should therefore focus on adaptive measures linked to the monitoring by tide gauges and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) of relative sea level rise and land subsidence. Extreme sea level rise warnings based on predictions by never validated models, or speculations, that are defocusing coastal management from every other relevant situation, should be discharged.”
“[T]he long-term tide gauges of the world show no significant sign of sea level acceleration since the start of the 20th century.”
“Ocean and coastal management in the area should be based on the accurate monitoring of the relative sea level rise and the subsidence of the land by coupled tide gauge and Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, rather than models’ predictions and speculations defocusing coastal management from more relevant situations than the non-existent threat of extreme sea level rise.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNowadays the usual suspects are busily peddling the idea that Hurricane Florence’s intensity is due to climate change.
For example climate activist Stefan Rahmstorf of the alarmist Potsdam Institute blames Florence on global warming, telling the online Potsdamer Nachrichten (PNN) here: “In fact many of the strongest storms we have ever seen have occurred in the past years.”
Alarmist claims go down in flames
The German media and climate science establishment are out in full force implying recent hurricanes are mostly manmade and getting stronger and more frequent.
However, just as Kenneth Richard showed yesterday by presenting more than a dozen recent papers, when we look at the observed data, all these alarmist claims go down in flames.
Observed data refute alarmist/activist scientists
Firstly, climate ambulance chasing scientists, such as Messieurs Stefan Rahmstorf and Dim Coucou, like pretending storms are intensifying due to manmade global warming. Yet two days ago I tweeted a table showing that 75% of the most powerful hurricanes impacting the US actually happened before 1970, a time when CO2 was at supposedly safe levels:

9 of top 12 most powerful hurricanes making landfall in USA HAPPENED BEFORE 1970!! pic.twitter.com/GLR5Ksd8yE
— P Gosselin (@NoTricksZone) September 12, 2018

Although some people may think Florence is a major hurricane, it in fact made landfall as a Category 1 storm only – a far cry from the Category 4 many were warning us about just days ago — e.g. Erik Holthaus.
Hurricane number and strength not up
Prof. Philip Klotzbach recently tweeted two charts depicting the number of US landfalling hurricanes (Category 1-5) and major hurricanes (Category 3-5). If you’re a climate alarmist, then you may want to first take a seat before reading further:

According to Klotzbach, “Since 1900 neither observed CONUS [Continental United States] landfalling hurricane frequency nor intensity show significant trends, including the devastating 2017 season.”
An unprecedented major hurricane absence
What is unprecedented is the long 12-year period from 2005 to 2017 which saw not a single major hurricane hitting the US. This is probably the most devastating and frustrating fact for the global warming ambulance chasers. That’s a glaring statistic that’s impossible to alter.
Western North Pacific cyclone frequency down 25%
The story is much the same in the North Western Pacific, where the following chart shows us cyclone frequency has been much lower over the past two decades compared to the two decades prior.

And using the data from the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), skeptic blogger Kirye also tweeted that the number of typhoons being formed has declined modestly over the years:

Hooligan storms
Cyclone bedwetters have even suggested that Florence’s odd track and stall at the Carolina coast is also a sign of climatatic weirding. Yet, weird storm tracks have always occurred and Florence is just run of the mill. For example, check out Typhoon Wayne back in 1986, which ran amok across the Western Pacific like a drunken hooligan:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe purveyors of climate alarm posit that rising CO2 emissions cause up to 600% increases in burned area due to global warming. Newly published science thoroughly undermines these claims. Observational evidence affirms global-scale fire frequencies and burned area have actually been declining for decades (especially since the early 1900s), with overall biomass burning lower today than during the much colder Little Ice Age.

Bottom Graph Source: Ward et al., 2018
On a global scale, fire emissions/burned area peaked in the 1910s, but then plummeted to “about 5% below year 1700 levels by 2010” (Ward et al., 2018).
The decreasing trend in wildfires has continued unabated in the 21st century, as there has been “a strong statistically significant decline in 2001–2016 active fires globally” (Earl and Simmonds, 2018).
On a long-term scale, “global biomass burning during the past century has been lower than at any time in the past 2000 years” (Doerr and Santín, 2016).
Even in the Western United States, where wildfires are currently ravaging the landscape, there has been a “decline in burning over the past 3,000 y[ears], with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400–1700 CE)” (Marlon et al., 2012).
The perception of increasing fire occurrence vs. the observations of decreasing trends
Doerr and Santín (2016) characterize the association between global warming and increases in wildfires as a “perception” spawned by using selective regional data and short timescales (in other words, by excluding contradictory evidence).  The alarming conclusions that wildfires are worsening due to rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are then promulgated by mainstream media.
“Numerous reports, ranging from popular media through to peer-reviewed scientific literature, have led to a common perception
that fires have increased or worsened in recent years around the world. Where these reports are accompanied by quantitative observations, they are often based on short timescales and regional data for fire incidence or area burned, which do not necessarily reflect broader temporal or spatial realities.”
To summarize, there are “widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses“, and yet “the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends” (Doerr and Santín, 2016).

Ward et al., 2018
Trends and Variability of Global Fire Emissions
Due To Historical Anthropogenic Activities
“Globally, fires are a major source of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere, occurring on a seasonal cycle and with substantial interannual variability. To understand past trends and variability in sources and sinks of terrestrial carbon, we need quantitative estimates of global fire distributions. … Global fire emissions of carbon increase by about 10% between 1700 and 1900, reaching a maximum of 3.4 Pg C yr−1 in the 1910s, followed by a decrease to about 5% below year 1700 levels by 2010. The decrease in emissions from the 1910s to the present day is driven mainly by land use change, with a smaller contribution from increased fire suppression due to increased human population and is largest in Sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia. Interannual variability of global fire emissions is similar in the present day as in the early historical period, but present‐day wildfires would be more variable in the absence of land use change.”

Trends in 2001–2016 Global Fire Activity

“We find that there is a strong statistically significant decline in 2001–2016 active fires globally linked to an increase in net primary productivity observed in northern Africa, along with global agricultural expansion and intensification, which generally reduces fire activity.”


Doerr and Santín, 2016
Global trends in wildfire and its impacts:
perceptions versus realities in a changing world
“Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth’s surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses.”
“However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.”
“Analysis of charcoal records in sediments [Marlon et al., 2008] and isotope-ratio records in ice cores [Wang et al., 2010] suggest that global biomass burning during the past century has been lower than at any time in the past 2000 years.”
“Regarding fire severity, limited data are available. For the western USA, they indicate little change overall, and also that area burned at high severity has overall declined compared to pre-European settlement. Direct fatalities from fire and economic losses also show no clear trends over the past three decades. Trends in indirect impacts, such as health problems from smoke or disruption to social functioning, remain insufficiently quantified to be examined. Global predictions for increased fire under a warming climate highlight the already urgent need for a more sustainable coexistence with fire. The data evaluation presented here aims to contribute to this by reducing misconceptions and facilitating a more informed understanding of the realities of global fire.”

Marlon et al., 2012
Long-term perspective on
wildfires in the western USA
“Understanding the causes and consequences of wildfires in forests of the western United States requires integrated information about fire, climate changes, and human activity on multiple temporal scales. We use sedimentary charcoal accumulation rates to construct long-term variations in fire during the past 3,000 y in the American West and compare this record to independent fire-history data from historical records and fire scars. There has been a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400–1700 CE). Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 950–1250 CE) and during the 1800s.”
“Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE. Since the late 1800s , human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline. Consequently, there is now a forest “fire deficit” in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecological, and climate changes. Large fires in the late 20th and 21st century fires have begun to address the fire deficit, but it is continuing to grow.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterArctic sea ice volume data show earlier projections of ice-free Arctic summers were a sham. Sea ice now steady 10 years.
Lately Arctic sea ice volume has been a topic which climate skeptics have been looking at quite closely.
According to Al Gore and a number of climate ambulance chasers, Arctic sea ice in late summer should have long disappeared by now, see here..
But then just a few years after, the Arctic sea ice area began to recover from its lows of 2007 and 2012. So immediately alarmists shouted that area was not really what mattered, but rather sea ice volume is what really counted. Okay, that made perfect sense. Mass is in fact what’s important, and not area, when worrying about polar ice disappearing.
So naturally skeptics have since then been watching volume, which we were told by alarmists would shrink, and shrink, and shrink – until totally gone in late summer. In 2007 one US climate official declared the Arctic sea ice was in a “death spiral”.
Those alarmist projections have since turned up totally false
First, looking at peak ice, which occurs around April 1st, using the data from the Danish meteorological Institute (DMI) here, we find that Arctic sea ice VOLUME has totally defied the downward death spiral trend projected by experts and their models.

The chart above depicts Arctic sea ice volume on April 1st for the years 2003 to 2018, using the data from the DMI. Note the growing chasm between alarmist projections and reality. 
Humiliation of the alarmists

The most closely watched measure of Arctic sea ice magnitude is the minimum that is typically reached in very late summer, i.e. around September 20.
Here as well using the DMI data, I’ve plotted the September 20 Arctic sea ice going back to 2003.
Here’s the result of the plot:

Al Gore’s hysterical projections of ice-free Arctic late summers are exposed as an absolute sham. 2018 uses a conservative projected value.
Today the doomsday scenarios and projections made 10 years ago have yet to show any signs of materializing. Late summer Arctic sea ice has been surprisingly stable over the past decade.  Gore and alarmists fell into the trap of applying an idiotic polynomial curve extrapolation into the future.
In fact there are indications that Arctic sea ice may be starting an upward trend as oceanic and solar cycles enter their cooler phases.
Low sea ice also occurred in the past
There’s no doubt that Arctic sea ice has dwindled considerably since it peaked back at around 1980, a time when climate scientists had warned the globe risked cooling into an ice age.
Also, today’s Arctic sea ice amount is in the same neighborhood as it was back in the 1930s. Moreover, today’s levels are considerbly higher than they were over a large part of the Holocene, which saw periods that were far warmer than today.

The above chart shows August mean Arctic sea ice area in million square meters from 1979 to 2018 (red curve). There’s been a positive linear trend since 2007.
Moreover, the upward linear trend has even sharpened since 2012 (green lines) since Al Gore and Peter Wadhams made their absurd projections there would be an ice-free Arctic by now.
Kirye at KiryeNet here shows that current Arctic sea ice volume for mid September remains at the center of the pack, and thus no sign of short-term dwindling Arctic sea ice:

Chart: KiryeNet
The Northwest Passage this year as well was continuously blocked by ice and thus impassable for the entire year.
Yacht ignored warnings, got crushed
But some refused to believe the ice was not melting. For example German Yacht Online here reported how a crew on the yacht “Anahita” had ignored warnings of the Canadian Coast Guard and tried to cross the Passage. By late August the yacht ended up getting crushed by sea ice and sank within minutes. The 2-man crew was forced to escape on the ice by foot and were later airlifted to safety by helicopter.
According to Yacht online: “The ‘Anahita’ was one of a dozen other yachts on the way from the east to the west through the Northwest Passage. However this summer the sea ice in the Arctic remained tenacious.”

Also a group of publicity seeking climate activists on Russian ice breaker/expedition ship ‘Akademik Ioffe’ were forced to move their starting point about 1000 km to the south to Kugaaruk. Just hours after starting on August 24, 2018, the vessel “ran aground on an uncharted shoal” and all passengers had to be rescued.
The trip was supposed to focus the world’s attention on global warming and “disappearing” Arctic sea ice. However, the expedition ended up being an embarrassment and ironically showed the opposite: the Arctic still had quite some ways to go before becoming ice-free.

The conditions the Northwest Passage Project crew were hoping for, but never became the case. Ice breaker/expedition ship Akademik Ioffe. Photo: The Northwest Passage Project
All passengers on the Akademik Ioffe were safely transferred to shore and returned home, the site informs.
“Uncharted geologic feature”
According to the website, the expedition was abandoned because the Akademik Ioffe needed repair after it had run aground and been refloated.
The expedition itself insisted the mission was not curtailed due to ice conditions and instead blamed “an uncharted geologic feature”. But why would a ship need to enter an uncharted area? Maybe because ice was blocking the usual route?
Today “Akademik Ioffe“ is back on the way to Les Mechins, Quebec from Kugaaruk and the expedition is postponed to summer 2019.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExperts are finding out wind turbines are not only an inefficient way to produce electricity, but that they are also wrecking the environment, natural habitats and even the climate.

German meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt warns wind turbines are altering local climates. Image: Donnerwetter.de.
So far we know wind parks:

Are an erratic source of power
Have high maintenance costs
Involve recycling problems
Blight the natural landscape
Are a hazard to birds and wildlife
Result in deforestation and wrecked biotopes
Make people seriously sick (infrasound), and
Interfere with weather radars.

And according to one German prominent meteorologist, Dr. Karsten Brandt of Donnerwetter.de,  wind turbines are now even putting the brakes on wind speeds and even altering local climates.
How an environmentalist could support this form of energy is becoming increasingly mind-boggling. Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne here. The Donnerwetter.de press release follows:
Less and less wind due to more and more wind turbines?
An ever weaker wind is blowing across Germany. For example in the 1960s annual wind speeds of 3.7 meters per second were measured in Osnabrück, but now it’s only 3.2 m/s. That’s a drop of over 13 percent. Almost all weather stations in the country which were analyzed by the Bonn-based meteorologists at donnerwetter.de found that the trend looks similar. 
Wind speed has decreased “very significantly”
“In most places, the mean wind speed has decreased very significantly,” says Dr. Karsten Brandt. And he has a suspicion: “We believe that in the last 15 years more and more massive wind turbines have influenced the wind speed.”
The trend of ever decreasing winds was not observed out on the open sea, however. To the contrary: On the islands of Norderney or Helgoland the wind has in fact increased slightly over the past 20-30 years. Yet in northern Germany, just inland from the coast, i.e. just after the first wind rotors, the donnerwetter.de meteorologists found a decline in the average annual wind speed: from 3.8 – 3.9 m/s to less than 3.5 m/s.

“Of course, the increase in building construction and especially high-rise buildings in Germany has had a slight braking effect,” admits Brandt. “The braking effect of wind turbines should, however, exceed this.”
Confirmed by other studies

A variety of studies support the meteorologists’ assumption. “Danish research has shown that air flow is weaker than before the turbines even 14 kilometers downstream from a wind farm,” says Dr. Brandt. 
This is an effect that the operators of such parks are concerned about. If a new turbine park is built in front of an existing park in the main wind direction, the losses could be over 50 percent, American studies have shown.
In northern Germany, there is now one wind turbine every 10 square kilometers. According to the donnerwetter.de meteorologists, the North German air flow is generating so much energy that a weaker north wind is now arriving at the north German interior. The situation is similar with westerlies, which are weakened by wind turbines in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
Wind park warming…”more heat inland”!
According to Dr. Brandt: “The weaker wind ensures less air exchange. This in turn drives up pollutant concentration in our air. Especially in the summer months, the lack of wind means more heat inland and less land-sea-wind circulation. In addition, the air is heated by the generators, as further studies have shown.” 
“Think again before further developing wind energy”

So far the wind has been considered as an almost inexhaustible source of energy – albeit being incalculable and poorly predictable. The fact that you can extract some of your energy from the wind turbines was seen as a pioneering achievement. 
“But the fact that man takes so much energy from the wind”, the climatologist concludes, “and considering the consequences, we should probably think again before further developing wind energy.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlthough resistance to littering the landscape with industrial wind turbines continues to grow strongly and the power grid is becoming ever more unstable, the German government refuses to back off its expansion of wind and solar energy.

Protests groups reach over 1000 in number as wind turbine litter the German landscape. Photo: Windwahn.
Jonas Herrmann of the Swiss NZZ here comments how Germany “is struggling with its wind turbines”.
It started 28 years ago, when the German government enacted a law that forced power companies to buy up any green power produced, pay exorbitant prices for it and feed it into the power grid whether it was needed or not. Over time the installation of solar panels and wind turbines exploded and today many parts of the countryside have become littered with unsightly wind parks.
Ruined landscape, yet a long way to go
Yet, Germany today remains far away from supplying its energy needs through “green” sources.
The NZZ comments: “The landscape has changed in many places as a result. A longer drive through Germany inevitably leads past dozens of wind turbines.”
Moreover, every community has been impacted, Nikolai Ziegler, says the chairman of resistance group Vernunftkraft, which is the major umbrella association of wind power opponents. According to Ziegler: “In Germany there are more than 1000 citizens’ initiatives that are mobilizing against wind energy” and that these groups are getting involved in politics.
Wind and sun will never be able to do the job

Not only are wind turbines ruining Germany’s idyllic landscape, but the NZZ writes that much of the resistance is also based on wind energy’s technical unreliability as a power supply. The Herrmann at NZZ cites engineering expert Dr. Detlef Ahlborn, who says wind energy is too erratic and thus unreliable.
According to the NZZ;
With the umbrella organization Vernunftkraft, everyone is convinced that wind and solar energy will never be able to ensure a secure power supply.”
Proponents in denial
This is a claim that the German government and green energy proponents refuse to acknowledge. Proponents in Germany believe that the problems with green energies will somehow go away and the supply will miraculously somehow smooth out if more and more volatile wind and sun capacity gets installed.
Critics like Nikolai Ziegler also criticize that there really hasn’t even been any real Energiewende (transition the green energies) so far because electricity is only one fifth of Germany’s total energy demand. Green energies provide only one third of that one measly fifth, and so “it’s relatively meaningless”.
The NZZ notes that “most of the leaders of the protest group Vernunftkraft are “male in the second half of their lives” who “are united by their anger at wind energy”, but adds most have a background in natural science almost half of them are professors.
“Path to the unknown”
Vernunftkraft is calling for an end to green energy subsidies, a stop to the construction of additional wind turbines and instead greater investment in gas-fired power plants
The NZZ writes:
However, a political majority is not in sight. Although the AfD and parts of the FDP [parties] believe the Energiewende is a mistake, the German government can hardly prevent a further expansion of renewable energies. Germany is thus still on the path to the unknown with the Energiewende.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGive Der Spiegel credit for offering some balance in a debate that sorely needs it…
Geology major, science journalist Axel Bojanowski just penned a commentary at Spiegel Online on the recent hot weather hype we witnessed in the wake of Europe’s warm and unusually dry summer.

Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski takes the recent climate heating hysteria head on, writing that the recent shrill claims by some scientists defy IPCC’s own findings. Photo image: cropped from Twitter here.
The title of his commentary: “Overheated – Forest Fires, Drought, Heat – Has The Climate Catastrophe Already Arrived? Time For A Cool Examination.”
Media “part of the problem”
Over the past couple of weeks, alarmists and media from the usual suspect institutes have been stopping at nothing to blame this year’s dry northern European summer on man-made climate change, and have renewed (from within their air-conditioned offices) calls for people to finally accept making the huge sacrifices needed to keep the climate system from “tipping” into irreversible catastrophe.
The Spiegel journalist comments on another shrill column, by Georg Diez, published a week earlier also by Spiegel. Diez echoed the doom and gloom presented to us in Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change by Nathaniel Rich of the New York Times magazine.
According to Diez, it is now clear “what it means to live in a time of catastrophe”.
Here Bojanowski notes “it turns out that many reports are part of the problem.”
Global warming not known and “supported” until the 1990s
Firstly, Bojanowski calls the claim that we knew about global warming already back in the 1970s false, and that it was in reality first an idea that only came up in the 1980s and did not get scientifically supported until the 1990s. He then adds that “considerable uncertainties remain, that still have not been cleared away even until today.”
James Hansen “damaged trust in climate science”

Bojanowski also describes how James Hansen jumped the gun in 1988, and how his methods “damaged the trust in climate science even until today.” Another problem at the time was the media running with the most spectacular doomsday scenarios with the aim of capturing public attention.
Still fraught with “considerable uncertainties”
According to Bojanowski, although Hansens’s dramatic claims did thrust him into the pioneer role, they also contributed “to the division of society in the climate debate, which has made it more difficult to produce political solutions even today.”
He also points out that the media and alarmists continue to ignore the IPCC’s own findings on a number of fronts, such droughts, where he reports that drought scenarios as a consequence of climate change “are subject to considerable uncertainty, according to the UN climate report.”
‘Very sharp decline’ in the fires since 2001
The free-thinking Spiegel journalist also mentions how we seldom hear why fires worldwide have been on the decline over the past decades: “Since 2001, researchers have even noticed a ‘very sharp decline’ in the fires.”
“Debate in dilemma”
Bojanowski calls the media’s hope that exaggerations will motivate people to support climate change “a fallacy”. The more climate scientists hype up the science, the more people will turn away from the topic, he writes, citing sociologists.
Bojanowski’s assessment: “The debate is in a dilemma: only those who push themselves forward with hysteria, get attention.”
No new findings, old speculation
Finally the Spiegel journalist also expressed his surprise over how a recent shrill paper that announced the possibility a hot period was starting needed only 17 days to get published. Bojanowski noted that the paper “did not present any new findings” and that “it was about known speculations over so-called climate tipping points.”
Protecting climate protection
Without surprise, Bojanowski’s commentary was greeted by a less than friendly German reaction. He tweeted here of having been accused of “damaging climate protection”. Climate science dissent in Germany is not to be tolerated. Exercising dissent, or even just keeping a cool head, can make you an enemy of the cause.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Temperatures can be measured from the ground and from satellites. Satellite data have two versions, UAH and RSS. The version of UAH (University of Alabama, Huntsville) makes a solid impression. The RSS version shows larger deviations and suggests a stronger warming. 
How come? 
Doping the data
Both datasets surely get their data from similar satellites. The explanation lies in a “post-processing” of the measured values ​​by the RSS group. In the chart below you can see the old version in red. 

Global temperature based on RSS satellite measurements. From Climate4You Newsletter June 2018.
At some point from mid 2015, the RSS people pushed the temperatures starting at  the year 2000 manually upwards. Therefore today you can find the values ​​of the blue curve in the database. As a result of this subsequent data change, additional warming was generated at a speed of one and a half tenths of a degree. It does not sound very much, but it is much if you consider that the 20th century warming was only eight-tenths of a degree.

Data on statistical steroids
It’s a little bit as like a year 2010 high jump world record of 2.40 meter later being changed to 2.45 meter by the International Athletics Federation. We could call this desktop doping, which would certainly not be a bad description for the RSS intervention. 
RSS statisticians massively massaged their data under the radar, without any interest from the media. A few years later new heat records get surprisingly reported, but in many cases likely solely through the heat-promoting measures of desktop doping. 
Change the data to fit the broken models
The changes happen to affect the hiatus phase, as it apparently had to do with the fear that the warming would not continue. The values ​​were simply raised. It’s a classic case where the readings did not confirm the models. But instead of improving the models, the measurement data were changed. There are hardly any other disciplines out there where things work this way.
Once again, it’s clear that we urgently need climate-related checks. The damage to the trust is already done. Now only stricter checks can help, and restricting employees in cases of suspicion – lifelong in the case of repeat-offenders. 
Criminal fraud
Proposal: Anyone who fabricates or falsifies climate data, or brings these willfully into the public, should be punished with 2 years in prison.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGulf Stream is doing fine: Potsdam Institute horror story suffers bitter setback
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The horror scenario from the movie The Day After Tomorrow keeps getting presented as a real plausible scenario for our future: Falling salt content of the upper Gulf Stream due to melting ice flowing into the Arctic is slowing down the North Atlantic Current (NAC), and so doom and gloom is about to sweep across the North Atlantic.
However a team of researchers led by Carina Bringedal from the University of Bergen recently studied the northern end of the North Atlantic ocean circulation (Bringedal & Eldevik 2018). The result: the inflow of warm water and the overflow of denser deep water are in good sync. And since 1998 we do not see any long-term divergence of the sort we would expect to observe when adding more fresh water that would slow the “pump” down.
On shorter timescales the currents are influenced by the winds and the NAO. On longer timescales the currents are influenced by the AMOC.
In short: There’s no sign of a “collapsing Gulf Stream” due to the anthropogenic warming of the Arctic and the associated melting of the ice:

Observed rainfall contradicts doom & gloom claims
In the published paper that concerns the doom and gloom forecasts related to the weakening Gulf Stream (Caesar et al. 2018), there’s a second reason that gets named: anthropogenic impacts are causing more rainfall over the North Atlantic.
Yet, the following chart shows this as well is not being observed:

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year in Ljubljana, Slovenia, acoustics and health expert Dr. Mariana Alves Pereira explained the impacts low frequency infrasound can have on health. It’s far from pretty.
Infrasound is very low frequency (<20 Hz) and is below the threshold of human hearing. It is sensed by the human ear only as pressure waves.
Hat tip: Reader Jim Feasel
Dr. Alves Pereira has a Masters in Biomedical Engineering and a PhD in Environmental Sciences.

“It’s a problem to human health”
In her presentation she explains to the audience that because infrasound is of very low frequency, the wavelengths are very long and thus can easily penetrate thick barriers and into buildings. “This is why it’s a problem to human health.” The waves travel kilometers and are difficult to shield against.
Governments rely on inadequate measurements
The acoustic expert also describes why the dBA scale is inadequate for measuring infrasound and thus are irrelevant for their evaluation.
At the 12:30 mark she uses the example of a mink farm in Denmark located near a wind park and so is thus subjected to “acoustic pollution” from the wind turbines. Here she demonstrates how woefully inadequate the methods and measurements often used by permitting authorities for assessing acoustic pollution really are.
Neurological and cardiovascular damage

Later she illustrates how damaging infrasound can be to human health. For example aviation workers have a risk of epilepsy (a neurological problem) that is some 50 times higher than average (22:00) for the occupation and how workers had tumors, and cardiovascular disease from abnormal tissue growth caused by infrasound exposure.
At 33:09 mark, Dr. Alves Pereira presents the clinical stages of vibroacoustic disease for occupational exposures. Workers exposed to infrasound more than 10 years developed severe health damage, e.g. psychiatric disturbances, severe joint and muscle pain, blood in the urine or decreased vision, among others.
Horses near wind turbines developed “boxy foot”
At the 43:00 mark, Dr. Alves Pereira explains how at first they were skeptical of claims made by patients that infrasound had made them sick while at home. In 2000 her team began to look at the claims and found that non-occupational residents who were subjected long-term to infrasound indeed got sick.
At the 48:08 mark, Dr. Alves Pereira turns her attention to wind turbines.
In one example, in Portugal 4 wind turbines were installed within 800 meters of a home and began operation in November, 2006. Five months later in March 2007 the family members in the home were suffering serious health issues and the boy’s performance at school crashed. His energy had been sapped. The horses the family owned developed “boxy foot”.
Moreover, the previously mentioned mink farm in Denamrk suddenly saw hundreds of aborted fetuses (53:30), all caused by infrasound from the nearby wind turbines, experts suspect.
Post traumatic stress syndrome
At the 56:00 mark, Dr. Alves Pereira shows a home in Germany surrounded on two sides by wind turbines located less than 2000 meters away. When the family moved into the home, there had been only two turbines, but then came dozens of new turbines. The family was forced to convert into a bunker in a desparate attempt to shield themselves.
In Ireland a 9-year old child developed epilepsy and the 19-year old brother wound up with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) – as did the worker at the mink farm in Denmark. The house in Ireland had to be abandoned.
Dr. Alves Pereira sums up: “I know it’s kind of depressing, but these are the scientific facts what we have over 30 years of research.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnearthed new evidence (Mangerud and Svendsen, 2018) reveals that during the Early Holocene, when CO2 concentrations hovered around 260 ppm, “warmth-demanding species” were living in locations 1,000 km farther north of where they exist today in Arctic Svalbard, indicating that summer temperatures must have been about “6°C warmer than at present”.
Proxy evidence from two other new papers suggests Svalbard’s Hinlopen Strait  may have reached about 5 – 9°C warmer than 1955-2012 during the Early Holocene (Bartels et al., 2018), and Greenland may have been “4.0 to 7.0 °C warmer than modern [1952-2014]” between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago according to evidence found in rock formations at the bottom of ancient lakes (McFarlin et al., 2018). 
In these 3 new papers, none of the scientists connect the “pronounced” and “exceptional” Early Holocene warmth to CO2 concentrations.  

  Mangerud and Svendsen, 2018
The Holocene Thermal Maximum around Svalbard, Arctic
North Atlantic; molluscs show early and exceptional warmth
“Shallow marine molluscs that are today extinct close to Svalbard, because of the cold climate, are found in deposits there dating to the early Holocene. The most warmth-demanding species found, Zirfaea crispata, currently has a northern limit 1000 km farther south, indicating that August temperatures on Svalbard were 6°C warmer at around 10.2–9.2 cal. ka BP, when this species lived there. … After 8.2 cal. ka, the climate around Svalbard warmed again, and although it did not reach the same peak in temperatures as prior to 9 ka, it was nevertheless some 4°C warmer than present between 8.2 and 6 cal. ka BP. … The occurrence of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, suggests that climate around Svalbard was 2°C warmer than at present as early as about 11 cal. ka BP.  The climate was about 6°C warmer than at present between 10.0 and 9.2 cal. ka BP, as shown by the presence of Zirfaea crispata.  One single specimen of Mytilus is dated to 900 years BP, suggesting a short-lived warm period during the Medieval Warm Period of northern Europe.”


Bartels et al., 2018
Wahlenbergfjord, eastern Svalbard: a glacier-surrounded fjord
reflecting regional hydrographic variability during the Holocene?
“During summer, AW [Atlantic Water] rises up to waterdepths as shallow as ~55 m. … Summer surface temperatures [1955-2012] range between up to 3°C at the northern mouth and <-1.5 °C at the southern mouth of the Hinlopen Strait, while winter surface temperatures vary between 0.5 and <~1.5°C (averaged, 1955–2012; Locarnini et al. 2013). … Increased summer insolation probably amplified the surface melting of the glaciers resulting in enhanced meltwater production and in a very high accumulation of finegrained sediments within the fjord […].”
“In addition, during the mild early Holocene conditions, summer sea-surface temperatures probably reaching 8–10°C [~5 – 9°C warmer than 1955-2012] (indicated by M. edulis findings as discussed in Hansen et al. 2011) may have contributed to reducing the number of glaciers that entered the fjord directly as tidewater glaciers and thus causing a diminished IRD input.  … In lake sediments from northwestern Spitsbergen a temperature drop of ~6°C is recorded between c. 7.8 and c. 7 ka [-0.8°C per century], which has been connected to a stronger influence of Arctic Water and expanding sea ice (van der Bilt et al. 2018).”


McFarlin et al., 2018
Pronounced summer warming in northwest Greenland
during the Holocene and Last Interglacial
“(Greenland)  Early Holocene peak warmth has been quantified at only a few sites, and terrestrial sedimentary records of prior interglacials are exceptionally rare due to glacial erosion during the last glacial period. Here, we discuss findings from a lacustrine archive that records both the Holocene and the Last Interglacial (LIG) from Greenland, allowing for direct comparison between two interglacials. Sedimentary chironomid assemblages indicate peak July temperatures [Greenland] 4.0 to 7.0 °C warmer than modern during the Early Holocene maximum [10,000 to 8,000 years ago] in summer insolation. Chaoborus and chironomids in LIG [the last interglacial] sediments indicate July temperatures at least 5.5 to 8.5 °C warmer than modern.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn two new papers, scientists affirm a strong connection between solar activity and the Earth’s climate, as temperatures are said to be 3 times more sensitive to solar forcing than CO2 forcing.  
With the advent of  a grand minimum in the coming decades, a consequent “dampening” of temperatures (and slowing of sea level rise) is expected.  
Between 2000 and 2100, surface temperatures are only expected to warm by a total of about 1.1°C, a climate change that may ultimately be beneficial.  

McCrann et al., 2018
“The effect of the Sun’s activity on Earth’s climate has been identified since the 1800s.  However, there are still many unknowns regarding the mechanisms connecting the Earth’s climate to the variation in solar irradiance. Climate modelling that implements the solar sciences is a novel approach that accounts for the considerable effect that natural factors have on the climate, especially at regional level. This paper discusses the noticeable effect that planet oscillations have on the Sun’s activity, which gives a very good correlation with the observed patterns in global surface temperatures, rainfall records and sea levels.”
“A clear 60-year cycle has been identified in many studies, and in accordance with this, it is expected that temperatures will reach a trough of the cycle around 2030-2040. This is in agreement with the forecasted low sunspot activity that is usually linked to lower temperatures.”
“Furthermore, considering the influence of the Solar Inertial Motion, a solar slowdown is predicted for Solar Cycles 24 and 25, which will create a weak grand minimum. It is anticipated that this weak grand minimum will be reflected in a dampening effect of global temperatures, and a subsequent moderation in the rate of sea level rise.”

Booth, 2018
“The TCR [transient climate response] to doubled CO2 is less than 2K (1.93 ± 0.26K).  Only 1.1 K of HadCRUT4 warming is expected between 2000 and 2100AD.  ∼35% of the warming during 1980–2001 was from solar variability, by 2 different analyses.”
“Temperature is nearly 3 times as sensitive to solar radiation as to CO2 radiation.  A model for ocean warming estimates equilibrium sensitivity as 15% greater than TCR [transient climate sensitivity].”
