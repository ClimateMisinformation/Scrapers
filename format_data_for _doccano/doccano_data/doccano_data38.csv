Sun sets on Doha. Minimal compromise reached. Source: www.cop18.qa
For those calling for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions, the result in Doha can only be described as an utter disaster. The Doha agreement will do absolutely nothing to curb CO2 growth, let alone cut net CO2 emissions.
One reason is that few countries are left taking part. Online FOCUS magazine reports only a few countries have signed on to extending Kyoto I, which FOCUS calls a “minimal compromise”. Only 37 of 194 countries signed on. That means the treaty is internationally non-binding.
The only thing that is certain is that there are going to be many more climate junkets in the future, wasting more taxpayer money.
The left wing TAZ reports that these 37 countries are “responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And it still remains open how high the planned reductions will be.” Those that signed on to make reductions couldn’t even tell us how much.
The conservative FAZ  reports on financial assistance to developing countries: “…there were lots of declarations of intent – and voluntary commitments from a few European countries.” But nothing binding here either.

The green activist Die Zeit also comments on aid to developing countries, writing: “there were only vague promises in the agreement. Indeed it says that ‘beginning in 2020 at least 100 billion dollars a year will flow from public, private and other sources’. But there is no agreement on where the money will come from or how much will be made available in the years leading up to 2020.” Here, too, lots of empty promises.
Finally Spiegel writes that USA has never signed the treaty and that Canada has dropped out. Spiegel didn’t even bother putting the news of the Doha result on its online front page.
If you’re among those who are very serious about curbing CO2, then this agreement can be considered only one thing: PATHETIC!
But if you think the whole CO2 issue is nothing but a huge scam, then you can breath out yet another sigh of relief. Saved again from another dumb treaty. Better yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that most of the planet no longer takes the issue seriously – a mindset that will only increase as time goes by.
Other reactions:
Friends of the Earth on BBC: “It’s an empty deal.”
Klimaretter.de: “We are on the path to a 4°C world…Doha is a flop. […] International diplomacy still has not recovered from the disaster of the Copenhagen Summit 2009. […] It’s like the self-delusion of an alcoholic who says: Next week I’m going to quit drinking. But then every week he means next week.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterCornelis De Jager of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Silvia Duhau of the Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ingenieria, Universidad de Buenos Aires have published a new paper in the Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate titled: Sudden transitions and grand variations in the solar dynamo, past and future.

I’m not sure if other bloggers have written about this. If so, here it is again. The paper forecasts solar activity for the current Solar cycle 24, which they expect will peak in May, 2013 with a maximum sunspot number Rmax of 62 ± 12.
More importantly, the authors write (emphasis added):
The subsequent analysis, based on a phase diagram, which is a diagram showing the relation between maximum sunspot numbers and minimum geomagnetic aa index values leads to the conclusion that a new Grand Episode in solar activity has started in 2008.”
and
…we predict that this Grand Episode will be of the Regular Oscillations type, which is the kind of oscillations that also occurred between 1724 and 1924. Previous expectations of a Grand (Maunder-type) Minimum of solar activity cannot be supported. We stress the significance of the Hallstatt periodicity for determining the character of the forthcoming Grand Episodes.  No Grand Minimum is expected to occur during the millennium that has just started.”
That of course is good news, as the world can ill-afford climate conditions like the ones we saw during the Maunder Minimum – especially with governments racing to prepare for the exact opposite.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch’s Klimazwiebel here posted an insightful essay by University of Bielefeld sociologist Prof. Peter Weingart titled (roughly translated): “The Limits of Science Advising Policy – Forget About the Opportunities“. Weingart cautions us against allowing an elite class of scientists to shape our public policy.The essay first appeared in Gegenworte – Hefte für den Disput über Wissen (Counterword – Magazine for the Dispute over Science).
What role should scientists have in setting policy for societies? Weingart reminds us that if “2 heads are better than one” then millions of heads are certainly better than a small group of heads. The will of the masses may not produce optimum results, but history shows us, profoundly, that societies run by a few elitists are far worse.
Today, worldwide, and especially in Germany, a handful of cocksure climate scientists, believing to be all-knowing, are attempting to tell society what behaviour is acceptable and insist their recommendations are “without alternative, that there are no other choices”. We’ve heard that before in history, too – and with tragic consequences.
“The democratic system has to do what it is told, and if it doesn’t, then the people are too stupid or just not educated enough,” Weingart sums up the attitude of these climate scientists, who purport to have a “masterplan” that will lead us to paradise-like conditions.
In Weingart’s view, climate science has abused its position in going far beyond policy advising. They now insist that the rest of the world dance to its tune. Weingart cites examples of humans already being forced to alter their behaviour: carbon trading, changing light bulbs, basing purchasing decisions on climate impact, to name a few.
If you can read German, then the essay is worth reading. I’ve translated HIS SUMMARY:
The lesson is quite clear. Science-based politics, or ‘society advising’ is ambivalent. Premature claims of absolute knowledge or political consequences that are without alternative, stemming from scientific insights and findings, are not scientifically justifiable and belong in the category of political propaganda. Scientists cannot be denied their civic right to be politically active, but when they do it in the name of science, then they abuse their credibility and the authority that it is based on. The credibility of science is neither based on exaggerated catastrophe warnings, nor on the promises of paradise-like futures. Rather it is based more on the demonstration of the difficulty of acquiring knowledge, the discussion of conflicting theories, and the interpretation of observations and the disclosure of uncertainties. Therein lie the possibilities, as well as the limitations of their power to convince society and politicians. Above all in democratic societies, scientists are especially challenged not to succumb to the temptation of assuming that their special knowledge sufficiently legitimises them exercising political influence.”
And my summary: Prof. Weingart should be advising politicians.
Quite entertaining is the hissy reaction of a warmist (Georg Hoffmann) in the reader comments, who unwittingly confirms why it is not a good idea to allow scientists (like himself) to have a disproportionate say in shaping public society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls here has done an analysis of sea level rise. Contrary to claims made by fringe alarmist physicists, we see that sea level rise has decelerated markedly since 2003.
Sea Level Rise Since 2003 Has Slowed Down

From 1993 to 2003, sea level rose 3.5 mm/year. Over the next decade, sea level rose only 2.3 mm/year! Source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu, then supplemented by EIKE.
In his report, Puls writes that even TOPEX and JASON 1+2 show no acceleration. “The acceleration calculated by the models and constantly reported by the media does not exist!” 
Puls adds:
It is obvious to see that sea level rise has slowed down significantly. In view of the relatively short time frame in which the measurements have been made, it should not be speculated on whether the deceleration in the rise is a trend change or if it is only noise. What is certain is that there is neither  a ‘dramatic’ rise, nor an ‘acceleration’. Conclusion: Climate models that project an acceleration over the last 20 years are wrong.”
In the chart that follows, Puls fitted a polynomial curve to the data from TOPEX and JASON 1+2:

“The result is no surprise. The 20-year data series of global sea level rise shows a weakening!” No wonder con-artist Al Gore bought a mansion on the beachfront. It’s great living in a world of suckers and dimwit media.
But let’s not rely solely on the satellite data, which has been around only a measly 20 years, to infer a trend. Let’s compare it to tide gauges, which have been used well over one hundred years. Puls presents the following chart of the trend of the German bight”.

Sea level rise at the German bight. Source: see graphic. 
Puls writes:
An evaluation shows: Also tide gauges indicate a slow-down in sea level rise, and do so with a statistically very “robust” dataset of 160 years.”
Also there has been an evaluation of numerous tide gauages globally, see Die kalte Sonne.de/?p=4429. Conclusion:
We have found no indication that sea level has accelerated over the last 30 years. It doesn’t look good for the fans of acceleration.”
Puls summarizes:
The latest alarmist reports on the supposedly dramatic sea level rise for the present and the future cannot be confirmed by actual measurements. Quite to the contrary, they are refuted by the data. Globally neither tide nor satellite data show an acceleration of sea level rise. Rather they show a slow-down. Moreover they starkly contradict the previous and current claims coming from climate institutes. Also there are good indications that the satellite data were ‘overly corrected’ using inflated amounts.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls was interviewed by Bettina Hahne-Waldscheck of the Swiss magazine “factum“.I’ve translated and summarized the interview, paraphrasing for brevity.
factum: You’ve been criticising the theory of man-made global warming for years. How did you become skeptical?
Puls: Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data – first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it. The CO2-climate hysteria in Germany is propagated by people who are in it for lots of money, attention and power.
factum: Is there really climate change?
Puls: Climate change is normal. There have always been phases of climate warming, many that even far exceeded the extent we see today. But there hasn’t been any warming since 1998. In fact the IPCC suppliers of data even show a slight cooling.
factum: The IPCC is projecting 0.2°C warming per decade, i.e. 2 to 4°C by the year 2100. What’s your view?
Puls: These are speculative model projections, so-called scenarios – and not prognoses. Because of climate’s high complexity, reliable prognoses just aren’t possible. Nature does what it wants, and not what the models present as prophesy. The entire CO2-debate is nonsense. Even if CO2 were doubled, the temperature would rise only 1°C. The remainder of the IPCC’s assumed warming is based purely on speculative amplification mechanisms. Even though CO2 has risen, there has been no warming in 13 years.
factum: How does sea level rise look?
Puls: Sea level rise has slowed down. Moreover, it has dropped a half centimeter over the last 2 years. It’s important to remember that mean sea level is a calculated magnitude, and not a measured one.  There are a great number of factors that influence sea level, e.g. tectonic processes, continental shifting, wind currents, passats, volcanoes. Climate change is only one of ten factors.
factum: What have we measured at the North Sea?
Puls: In the last 400 years, sea level at the North Sea coast has risen about 1.40 meters. That’s about 35 centimeters per century. In the last 100 years, the North Sea has risen only 25 centimeters.
factum: Does the sea level rise have anything to do with the melting North Pole?
Puls: That’s a misleading conclusion. Even if the entire North Pole melted, there would be no sea level rise because of the principles of buoyancy.
factum: Is the melting of the glaciers in the Alps caused by global warming?
Puls: There are many factors at play. As one climbs a mountain, the temperature drops about 0.65°C per 100 meters. Over the last 100 years it has gotten about 0.75°C warmer and so the temperature boundary has shifted up about 100 meters. But observations tell us that also ice 1000 meters up and higher has melted. Clearly there are other reasons for this, namely soot and dust. But soot and dust do not only have anthropogenic origins; they are also caused by nature via volcanoes, dust storms and wildfires. Advancing and retreating of glaciers have always taken place throughout the Earth’s history. Glaciology studies clearly show that glaciers over the last 10,0000 years were smaller on average than today.
factum: In your view, melting Antarctic sea ice and the fracture of a huge iceberg 3 years ago are nothing to worry about?

Puls: To the contrary, the Antarctic ice cap has grown both in area and volume over the last 30 years, and temperature has declined. This 30-year trend is clear to see. The Amundsen Scott Station of the USA shows that temperature has been declining there since 1957. 90% of the Earth’s ice is stored in Antarctica, which is one and half times larger than Europe.
factum: Then why do we always read it is getting warmer down there?
Puls: Here they are only talking about the West Antarctic peninsula, which is where the big chunk of ice broke off in 2008 – from the Wilkins-Shelf. This area is hardly 1% of the entire area of Antarctica, but it is exposed to Southern Hemisphere west wind drift and some of the strongest storms on the planet.
factum: What causes such massive chunks of ice to break off?
Puls: There are lots of factors, among them the intensity of the west wind fluctuations. These west winds have intensified over the last 20 years as part of natural ocean and atmospheric cycles, and so it has gotten warmer on the west coast of the Antarctic peninsula. A second factor are the larger waves associated with the stronger storms. The waves are more powerful and so they break off more ice. All these causes are meteorological and physical, and have nothing to do with a climate catastrophe.
factum: Then such ice breaks had to have occurred in the past too?
Puls: This has been going on for thousands of years, also in the 1970s, back when all the talk was about “global cooling”. Back then there were breaks with ice chunks hundreds of square kilometres in area. People were even discussing the possibilities of towing these huge ice chunks to dry countries like South Africa or Namibia in order to use them as a drinking water supply.
factum: What about all the media photos of polar bears losing their ice?
Puls: That is one of the worst myths used for generating climate hysteria. Polar bears don’t eat ice, they eat seals. Polar bears go hungry if we shoot their food supply of seals. The polar bear population has increased with moderately rising temperatures, from 5000 50 years ago to 25,000 today.
factum: But it is true that unlike Antarctica, the Arctic is melting?
Puls: It has been melting for 30 years. That also happened twice already in the last 150 years. The low point was reached in 2007 and the ice has since begun to recover. There have always been phases of Arctic melting. Between 900 and 1300 Greenland was green on the edges and the Vikings settled there.
factum: And what do you say about the alleged expanding deserts?
Puls: That doesn”t exist. For example the Sahara is shrinking and has lost in the north an area as large as Germany over the last 20 years. The same is true in the South Sahara. The famine that struck Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia was mainly caused by the leasing of large swaths of land to large international corporations so that they could grow crops for biofuels for Europe, and by war. But it is much easier for prosperous Europe to blame the world’s political failures on a fictional climate catastrophe instead.
factum: So we don’t need to do anything against climate change?
Puls: There’s nothing we can do to stop it. Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob. Many confuse environmental protection with climate protection. it’s impossible to protect the climate, but we can protect the environment and our drinking water. On the debate concerning alternative energies, which is sensible, it is often driven by the irrational climate debate. One has nothing to do with the other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe main pillar of the global warming, climate change theory is the claim that trace gas CO2 is the single major player impacting climate today. To maintain this, alarmist scientists and climate modelers have been forced to blow up the effects of CO2 by one order of magnitude in their models and to neglect a series of other factors (like the sun!).
Not surprisingly, we see from observations today that the assumed CO2 impacts have indeed been massively overblown. Now the scientists are left to fudge and falsify past climate data to force it to fit their crumbling models.
Ed Caryl’s two recent posts on the subject point out that the Modtran model of the US Air Force, who are forced to rely on real data for successful operations, also shows that CO2 has little impact on warming. Read here and here.
Now there’s a new paper by Martin Hertzberg titled: The night-time radiative transport between the Earth’s surface, its atmosphere, and free space, which is to be published by Energy & Environment (Vol. 23, No. 5, 2012), hat-tip Marc Morano of Climate Depot.
The paper concludes:
In addition, since the recent increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations have a trivial effect on the atmosphere’s total emissivity, the effect of those recent CO2 increases on the overall infrared radiative flux balance is insignificant.
The entire abstract is available here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDear P Gosselin.
Thank you for your consideration.  I appreciate the opportunity to be heard. Due to the numbers of polar bears on land this season, I am busy with filming and away from the internet.  My reply is not as prompt as it otherwise could be.
When I read that zoos are to be considered the key to polar bears’ survival and at the same time find that there is no discussion of sanctuary, I have to seriously question the dollars, the funding and the intent behind the “zoo” message.
While polar bears that land on eastern Canadian shores are shot and killed, while the polar/grizzly hybrids are shot and killed as soon as they are discovered, while polar bears are hazed and harassed across the Alaskan coast (leading to extreme stress and mortality); in the absence of any sanctuary, alternative habitat, or effort to repopulate traditional polar bear-land habitats, I have to seriously question what kind of “conservation” is really happening.  Zoos?  If this is the present course and it remains unchecked, I have to think we all are in danger.
Just to be clear, my statement that polar bears can survive climate change but for man’s greed, does not translate to “… not threatened by climate change.”  Certainly, if not for the decline in sea ice, polar bears would have a better future.  The contraction of polar bear populations will indeed follow the loss of sea ice habitat.  The survival of a great many bears will be threatened.  This threat is a “clear and present danger” directly attributable to climate induced sea ice reduction.
Polar bear extinction, however, is not a climate issue but is electively driven by human, political, policy and government action.  If the true nature of polar bear ecology was acknowledged and pan-arctic land sanctuaries were established, polar bears would survive climate change and continue as a viable species on Earth.  As long as the current course of “drowning polar bears” and “sea ice or death” rhetoric preempts the truth, polar bears will have little to no chance for survival.
Re: Ed’s response
Nuclear Genomic Sequences Reveal that Polar Bears Are an Old and Distinct Bear Lineage , Hailer 2012 – is the most recent study of polar bear evolution. Polar bears are an older species, not of “recent origin”, and they are distinct from brown bears, not evolved from within the subset of brown bear genetics. While Hailer suggests a date range of 338,000 to 934,000 years ago for polar bear divergence, additional studies by Yu and Krause support a divergence date of 600,000 to 1.3 million years ago. The consensus resides in 600,000 to 1 million years ago.
What has confused some of the science and resulted in the “recent origin” theory, is the denial of hybrid events taking place between polar bears and brown bears.  I say “some”,  because not all scientists, as well myself, had discounted hybridization as the account for the “confusion”.  Coyne, in “Do Polar Bears Really Exist?”, stated the brown/polar bear mtDNA profile could likely be a result of hybridization and cautioned the interpretation of mtDNA as represented in Lindqvist.  The Lindqvist study of the Svalbard jaw bone fossil flat out refuted hybrid events as being relevant and incorrectly determined the answer to the mtDNA question to be resolved with polar bears to be of recent origin.  Well, five recently dead grizz/polar bear hybrids of various stages, speaks to a truth that Lindqvist would now have to consider.

The ABC brown bears of Alaska have yet to be addressed directly, but I believe they too are a population descended from the hybrid crossing of polar bears and browns as was the Irish brown bear population.  What we are seeing play out in real time, here in today’s Arctic, speaks to an insight into previous hybrid events and lends a credibility that far out weighs theory and speculation.  It is happening now, it happened in Ireland…
From Smith –  No Ice, No Choice   2012
“35,000 years ago, amidst the last great ice age, Ireland experienced a warming, an “interstadial,” that raised temperatures to within one degree of its modern day climate. Glaciers began to melt and the Irish Sea ice retreated. Polar bears came to land at 50ºN and survived a period nearly 20ºC warmer than today’s arctic. It was this warming, the Castlepook Interstadial, that forced the range of polar bears to overlap with that of Irish brown bears. Contrary to the notion that glacial periods represent a uniformly intact cryosphere, localized warming events can occur, leading to sea ice retreat, the “forced landing” of polar bears, and climate-induced species convergence.  In studying the fossil record of this period, researchers in Ireland recently confirmed that a 32,000-year old brown bear fossil was discovered to actually belong to a polar/grizzly hybrid.⁠  This hybridization challenges the idea that, during a glacial period, polar bears exist exclusive of land. The extent to which polar bears have experienced forced landings, and the extent to which this reflects upon their ability to cope with change, becomes directly related to their age as a species.”
More than one million years before the Castlepook Interstadial, the Mid Pleistocene Transition occurred, (700,000 to 1.2 million years ago).  This shift in glaciation periods from a 41,000 year to 100,000 year glacial-interglacial cycles, took place concurrent with the “polar bear emergence interval” of 600,000 to 1.2 million years ago.  CO2 records show that from +- 620,000 to 800,000 years ago, a glacial period of extreme cold and duration occurred, far exceeding any of the glacial periods that followed in the next 600,000 years.  It is the very nature of the Pleistocene cryosphere that led to the emergence of polar bears as a species.
While polar bears are here and have clearly survived, what may never be known is to what extent and frequency that “interstadials” took place within the glacial periods, similar to the Castlepook event in the British Isles.  When the cyrosphere occupied much of the northern hemisphere, arctic environments and polar bears existed in temperate latitudes, as did Ireland’s.  These bears and their environment were much more subject to localized and regional climate variation than an arctic confined to high latitudes as in today’s world (until now).  It is exactly the occurrence of these interstadials, along with interglacial periods that have repeatedly and continuously brought the polar bear to land and in contact with the brown bear.  This repeated contact and hybridization has led to the continued ability of the the two species to produce fertile offspring nearly 1 million years after divergence.  (This relationship does not preclude the polar bear from retaining its’ status as a distinct species.)
Despite the course of nature, natural selection and the process of evolution, polar/grizzly hybrids have been characterized as a threat to polar biodiversity, that species are “imperiled” by interbreeding.  Citing no studies, no facts, no “science” to support (an unnamed) science article, the significance of the hybrid genetic exchange between polar bears and browns seems to be less relegated to science than it is to personal opinion. (What would Darwin say?)  The forced landing of polar bears may lead to population “bottlenecks”, (referred to by Hailer).  But, the role polar bear/brown bear hybrids have played in the survival of polar bears as a species, and the answer to “bottlenecks” may never be known.  If the prevailing attitude is to replace science with opinion, and today’s polar/grizzly hybrids remain unprotected and shot on sight, then, maybe Zoos are the answer.
Thank you again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf there ever was a sign that the issue of climate change is struggling with irrelevance in Europe, and thus has lost its global leadership force, it can be found in this candid (frustrated) view expressed in the Austrian STANDARD: “Disinterest in Climate Change” by Eric Frey.
“Despite Sandy, global warming is a fringe issue in the USA – unfortunately also for Europe.”
In the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, Europeans were quick to scorn America for its lack of interest in protecting the climate. Many blamed the storm on CO2 emissions. Europeans were angered by and indignant at the fact that the issue had not been worth mentioning once during the presidential campaign.
But as Eric Frey of the Austrian Standard writes: Europeans ought to first look at home before criticizing others abroad.
He writes:
Before Europeans express too much outrage over the Americans, they should look at what’s going on at their own doorstep instead. Also here interest in climate protection has gone lame. Euro-crisis, recession, unemployment – with such a terrible economic situation, n one is protesting on behalf of the environment. […]  Emissions trading has no teeth, as certificates cost next to nothing.
Climate protection has no lobby. Even the greens no longer consider it a core issue. […] Thus the upcoming climate conference in Qatar will achieve no progress. The price will be paid by millions of people on all continents – in New Jersey as in Africa. […] The only hope lies in a surprsing technological breakthrough. Ironically, the best news for climate protection comes from the USA: The increasing production of shale gas is replacing dirty coal and is allowing America’s CO2 emissions to fall. That may bring some relief, but it is certainly not a solution.”
There’s nothing else to add.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou really have got to worry when the U.S. Secretary of Defense declares a major security threat that isn’t real. History shows that such declarations are often followed by the suspension of civil law to make way for martial law, rationing and curfews.
Casus belli refers to offenses or threats directly against a nation. It can be grounds for suspending elections and democracy until the crisis subsides and stability gets re-established.

Secretary Panetta has an imaginary enemy: developed human society.
Hat-tip: WUWT
Why is Panetta declaring Casus belli? According to Wikipedia’s definition:
Countries need a public justification for attacking another country. This justification is needed to galvanize internal support for the war, as well as gain the support of potential allies.

In the post World War Two era, the UN Charter prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except 1) as a means of defending themselves against aggression, or 2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries which embark on wars of aggression. In effect, this means that countries in the modern era must have a plausible casus belli for initiating military action, or risk UN sanctions or intervention.”
Human climate change is a national security threat says Secretary Panetta.
He apparently sees a climate Pearl Harbor and probably already has his generals in a war room making plans to seize control of the nation’s vast resources and direct them against the imagined enemy, which this time is domestic and is anyone who emits GHG without a permit or an offset. Martial law in this case would hardly be temporary – as the climate crisis is a long-term affair that will take decades and generations to fix, so we are told. That’s a long time to be under a state of emergency.
Yes, there’s a lot in it for the Secretary of Defense, and it is surely very tempting. Panetta is probably just itching by now to round up people deemed a threat (skeptics) and holding them in camps, like the US did with Japanese-Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack.
Panetta, the number one military man, is treading dangerous territory and anyone concerned about preserving democracy and the rule of law has got to be seriously worried by his paranoid view. It’s one thing to be concerned about climate change, but quite another to view it as casus belli. It’s time to question his psychological stability. When military leaders start fantasizing major threats and insist we mobilize to ward them off, it’s scary.
Clearly climate change is not the real threat to national security. The real threat are leaders who fantasize and have delusions of threats that aren’t real, and who react by publicly declaring a phony national emergency.
Folks, in most places it’s May, sunny, getting warm and the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming. People are outside enjoying themselves, sunbathing. Panetta, on the other hand, is obviously in a climate war room and thinks the sky is falling and the planet is imploding.
Congress needs to look into this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you wonder why more and more among us are becoming skeptical of the claims made by the climate institutes, with some of us even believing they’ve long become crackpots and charlatans, then the following German ZDF public television video (in German) demonstrates why.

When the Arctic set a record minimum sea ice extent this year, the media exploded with end-of-the world headlines claiming that man-made CO2 was driving the planet to the brink. But as the above video shows, the science changes completely when cold records are set. In the clip, ZDF television interviews scientists from the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) to explain the Arctic record minimum and the Antarctic record maximum.
To ZDF’s credit they do say at the 1:40 mark that the 2007 Arctic minimum was due to a weeks-long high pressure system that pumped warm winds up into the Arctic, thus accelerating the melt. However, they then say that man had a hand in it. To support that, they interview Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke of the Alfred Wegener Institute at the 2:00 min mark.
There is no explanation for this other than the increase in man-made CO2.”
I’m not a professional reader of facial expressions, but to me he really does seem to have a hard time keeping a straight saying this, and it reminds me of an old great classic song by the Eagles.
At the 2:17 mark, Dr. Marcel Nicolaus describes this summer’s expedition to the Arctic with ice-breaking research ship Polarstern, saying:
We would have liked to have gone to the North Pole, but the ice was so thick that even the Polarstern could not manage it.”
The ZDF report then turns its attention to the Antarctic, saying at the 2:26 mark (my emphasis):
On the other side of the globe at the Antarctic, satellites have measured this the greatest ice extent since the start of observations. For the science, this is nothing unusual because the sea ice surrounding the South Pole has little to do with with climate events, and have much more to do with wind and weather.”
Prof. Dr. Peter Lemke explains how this all works:

When the wind gets stronger in the Antarctic, then the ice gets spread out, meaning the sea ice area expands, and in the spaces between the ice chunks it is cold enough for new ice to form.”
Like we are all going to buy that. Lemke doesn’t offer any words on increased albedo leading to more cooling, like the reverse is at play in the Arctic, or why the wind explanation works for the Antarctic, but not the Arctic.
At the 3:16 mark, the ZDF reports then warns us in a grave tone:
But global warming will soon make it’s mark also over the South Pole. Most scientists agree on that.”
Lemke then adds that Antarctica was once ice-free and sea levels 70 meters higher. But this time:
Now we are helping the sea level to rise 70 meters; it will of course take several thousand years before that happens. But then we will have to move all the coastal cities that we have built and move them.”
The ZDF adds one final, comical warning with more grave tones at the 3:53 mark:
Global warming is not only threatening nature, but also human civilization. At least as we know it.”
Oh brother.
My conclusion is borrowed from that Eagles song: “I’d thought you’d realize by now. There aint no way to hide your lying eyes.”
The science is just getting worse and worse, and is turning into a freak sideshow. Nobody can take this nonsense seriously anymore.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie Welt blogger and science journalist Ulli Kulke writes here about how another scare story (melting permafrost) is a load of “imbecility”.

In the above paper, permafrost expert Georg Delisle shows that permafrost scare is irrational bedwetting. Source: Poster Bad Honnef.
Some alarmist scientists claim melting permafrost could lead to a dangerous “tipping point” as methane and CO2 released would act to enhance global warming further, which in turn would cause more permafrost to melt, thus accelerating global warming until it careens out of control.
Just in time for Doha, this disaster scenario has once again been hyped up, with Kevin Schaefer of the National Snow and Ice Data Center recently sounding the alarms. So has UNEP.
Kulke writes, however, that the permafrost is much more stable than claimed and that studies have been conducted on permafrost – since decades. Kulke writes:
I remember a seminar in Bad Honnef in the spring of 2008 where geoscientist and permafrost expert Georg Delisle from Hanover presented his research.

He studied time periods from the last 10,000 years when the global temperature was warmer than today for several thousand years by as much as 6°C. Ice cores that had been extracted from Antarctica and Greenland provide exact information about the composition of the atmosphere during the these warm periods. His conclusion: ‘The ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica provide no indication of any elevated release of greenhouse gases at any time even though back then a deep thawing of the permafrost when compared to today would have been the case.’  This was clear to see on the poster he used for his presentation. Obviously CO2 and methane are much more stable in the ground also when it thaws, Poster Bad Honnef.”
Delisle is an expert on permafrost. What does he think about the claims being made that there’s a risk it will thaw out and release lots of climate-shattering gas? Kulke tells us what Delisle said emphasis added:
‘…it is utter imbecility to suppose that the entire permafrost could thaw out by the end of the century. It would take thousands of years.‘ His study ‘Near-surface permafrost degradation: How severe during the 21st century?’ was the basis for his presentation. It had been peer reviewed and has not to my knowledge been refuted to this day. 2007GL029323.”
Kulke writes that it would be nice if the IPCC took such research into account, the same applies for the sun as a factor as well.
By the way, the Poster Bad Honnef concludes:
• Permafrost in the Arctic will remain mostly intact in the 21st century.
• When making a comparison to other earlier warm periods, the massive release of greenhouse gases from disintegrating permafrost is considered improbable.
Another global warming myth debunked. Now bring on the “melting ice caps”.

Climate science skepticism in Germany now has spread from a few once marginalized groups over to the junior member of Germany’s coalition CDU-FDP government, the Free Democrats Party (FDP). Hat tip: Ökowatch.

Coalition government FDP party invitation questions climate dogma – announces skeptical climate and energy conference.
The FDP is holding a skeptic conference at the end of this month. This is the first time any political party in Germany holds a “skeptic” conference, and thus marks a watershed event in Germany when it comes to climate science skepticism. Make no mistake – it’s a clear signal.
It used to be that every political party in Germany, from the communists to the conservatives, accepted the science underpinning the man-made climate catastrophe. But that’s changing now. Germany’s Free Democrats (FDP) party appears to be breaking away from the blind, stampeding herd and is holding a conference that casts serious doubt on global warming dogma, which has gripped Germany for over 2 decades, and the direction of Germany’s environmental and energy policy.
Of course skeptical conferences have been held in Germany, but never has one been sponsored by a political party, let alone one that is in power.
Ökowatch writes that “a conference on the topic of climate organized by a political party is taking place for the first time in Dresden on June 30, 2012“. It is one that will offer an alternative view in the debate: The state faction of the FDP Saxony is holding together with ALDE, the Alliance of Liberal Parliamentarians in the EU, a climate conference titled: “Are we beyond rescue? Between climate catastrophe and eco-hysteria.”
Here’s what the above pictured invitation says:
Whether it is the ban of the incandescent light bulb, the mandating of E10 ethanol fuel, the planned energy renovation obligation for residential buildings, which was set up at the end of December 2010, or the attempt by a few overzealous communities to impose the mounting rooftop solar systems: Starting with the European Union and extending to the administration of German towns, eco-bureaucrats are always waiting to impose new, excessive demands and environmental standards.
Here no one seems to care that the energy-saving light bulbs will have to disposed of as toxic waste at a high cost, that the manufacture of a single electric car requires an additional amount of energy consumption that would be enough to fuel a compact car over its entire lifetime. Ecological hysteria and symbolism have come to dictate our everyday life. Just the requirement to renovate residential buildings could lead to costs of over 10,000 euros for each single family home. For many German homeowners, this will mean financial ruin. Apparently every mean is justified when it comes to protecting the climate, no matter the cost. The ends justify the means. Economic sense? Ecologic sense? – Don’t ask!

Among all this, the question of whether or not there is climate change, a global warming, and if so, is it really caused by man, plays no role.  Today a number of serious scientists seriously doubt the increase in global temperature, let alone the anthropogenic causes.
The FDP faction of the State Parliament of Saxony has decided, together with the Saxony FDP European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer, to offer an alternative to the media-driven hysteria by holding a climate conference.
Our primary objective is to give scientists, economists and journalists, who view the green activism with skepticism and warn of incalculable consequences, a chance to speak out.
The speakers will include scientists Prof. Dr. Knut Löschke, Leipzig; Prof. Dr. Josef Reichholf, Munich; environmental economists Prof. Dr. Bodo Sturm, HTWK Leipzig; Dr. Benny Peiser, London; as well as journalist and publicist Michael Miersch of Munich.
See event website“
Of course no one expects the mainstream media to cover this event, nor is that important in the end.
The skeptic movement in Germany is growing just fine without them. For years eco-activists, scientists, politicians and the media have tried everything to marginalize the skeptics: The result: the skeptics are winning and are stronger than ever.
Look at the progress: EIKE has held 4 independent international conferences in Germany, a number of blogs have sprung up, a new best-selling book by one of the founders of the eco-movement, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, came out earlier this year, and now the FDP party is is joining in and holding a skeptic conference – a first ever. So do we need the elitist media?
Don’t waste a single minute fretting about the absence of our drugged-up-on-green media. They live on another planet.
The blogs and Internet sites will report on this event and you know where to come to get informed. I do hope it will be possible to view the conference via webcam, or later on Youtube.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother peer-reviewed paper, another smashed hockey stick.
The latest paper is one by Mathias Trachsel et al, titled: Multi-archive summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps, AD 1053–1996. Moberg and Esper are among its authors.
They present a multi-archive, multi-proxy summer temperature reconstruction for the European Alps for the period AD 1053–1996 using tree-ring and lake sediment data. The results show that summer temperatures of the last millennium are characterized by two warm periods (AD 1053–1171 and 1823–1996) and two cold phases (AD 1172–1379 and 1573–1822).
But get this. The abstract states (my emphasis):
Highest pre-industrial summer temperatures of the 12th century were 0.3 °C warmer than the 20th century mean but 0.35 °C colder than proxy derived temperatures at the end of the 20th century. The lowest temperatures at the end of the 16th century were ∼1 °C lower than the 20th century mean.”

Now let’s assume the end of the 20th century proxy-derived temperatures are reliable. That would mean all the CO2 added by man over the last 1000 years (approx. 110 ppm) has led to a whole third of a degree Celsius of warming when compared to the Medieval Warm Period.
That’s it? This is a crisis?
Skepticalscience.com couldn’t find anything alarming either. All they could conclude was that the end of the 20th century in the Alps was a wee bit warmer than the Medieval Warm Period, that according to proxy data.
The added late 20th century tree-ring growth was probably due mostly to the CO2 enrichment.
That really should tell us and especially the IPCC something about the magnitude of feedbacks involving CO2 and water vapor.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf the science and consensus were solid, then we wouldn’t be having the endless string of failed climate conferences we’ve seen year after year over the last 2 decades. Obviously policymakers have stopped viewing the science as being credible enough on which to base policy.
Clearly policymakers no longer view climate change as threatening. The real threats are indeed economic and financial.
Today Spiegel here writes that there is “little hope of a global worldwide climate treaty” being reached in Doha, Qatar, three weeks from now and that “the chief economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Ottmar Edenhofer, sees negotiations at a dead-end“.
Over the years there have been plenty of non-binding declarations and empty commitments, and Ottmar Edenhofer doesn’t see anything different happening in Doha: “It looks as if not much is going to come out of Doha. The outlook for a climate treaty at the moment is unfortuately not especially good”.
Spiegel adds:
Economics and climate scientists are especially placing their hopes on ‘linking the emissions trading systems’ in the short term between Europe and Australia, and over long term probably also with China.”
That’s it? Only Europe and Australia are willing to “tackle climate change”? Already Doha is dead even before arrival.
According to Spiegel, Edenhofer also adds that “a reform of the German Feed-in Act is necessary”. “The Energy Feed-In Act cost transfer to consumers is not sustainable over the long-term,” said Edenhofer, and that the current system offers “too little competition to lower the prices and to find the best locations.”
In summary, Edenhofer admits that the German Feed-in Act has been a failure. Finally a step in the right direction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe real story of 2012 is one of unextreme weather and natural events. Deaths globally in 2012 from natural disasters were 90% below the longterm average.

Photo: Public domain photo, NOAA
The online, eco-leftist TAZ from Berlin has an article about reinsurer Munich Re’s Natural Catastrophe Statistics 2012 report on weather and natural disasters, released yesterday. 2012 was a year of few deaths and relatively little damage from natural disasters worldwide.
Recall that Munich Re is in the reinsurance business, and they stand to profit handsomely from the belief that climate related catastrophes are on the increase. They’ve been aggressive promoters of the manmade climate change story.
So it comes to us as a big surprise to hear them report that 2012 “saw far less damage than a year earlier“.

According to TAZ, 2012’s “total damages of $160 billion was below the long-term average. And foremost ‘only’ 9500 people died in 2012 from storms, floods and earthquakes – far less than the 106,000 in an average year.” That’s a huge drop of 90%! So all the dramatic stories about deadly weather extremes we’ve been hearing for months was mostly hype.
The Munich Re report said it was a “low-damage year”, with most of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy and drought in the USA. Good news came from developing countries, where, according to the TAZ, “there were few catastrophes”.
Boy, if that isn’t a stark contrast from what we’ve heard from the media.
Yet, always itching to jack up their premiums, Munich Re insists that climate change is a major crisis for humanity, and although Hurricane Sandy cannot be attributed to man, it is “a sign of what the future holds”.
I bet all that good news was just really tough for the Munich Re to handle.

We kept hearing that the Republicans were enthused, would turn out in huge numbers, and that Obama voters would stay home, or even vote for Romney, and so the GOP had a good shot at taking the White House. It turns out that only one of the above actually happened in reality – lots of Democrats stayed home.
So why did Romney lose? Because also too many Republicans didn’t bother to go out and vote, the numbers suggest.
The final results are still not in, but it appears most are (ca. 90%), and they tell a sad story: too many Republican voters sat on their butts and thus gave this one away:
Obama 2008: 69,456,897 votes
 Obama 2012: 59,000,000
McCain 2008: 59,934,814
 Romney 2008: 57,000,000

Like I said, there are still more votes to be counted, and the GOP tally probably will surpass 08’s, though not by much, if at all. The numbers already suggest that enthusiasm was lacking.
All that talk about an “energized party” appears to have been lots of hot air.
The numbers also tell us just how valuable Palin was in energizing the GOP in 2008. Although people were tired of the GOP, she mobilized GOP voters – as many as what we saw yesterday. If Palin had not been the VP candidate in 2008 and had made her debut yesterday, we’d be saying “President-elect” Romney today.
I’m not taking anything away from Paul Ryan. But we have to admit that the ticket was a bit bland this time around.
The GOP really knows how to pick ’em. Is there a Ronald Reagan in sight for 2016?

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday website Die kalte Sonne tells us there’s a new paper appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters on the relationship of CO2 and temperature.

Al Gore teaching science to a gullible audience. (Image from film: An Inconvenient Truth)
Let’s recall how Al Gore in his Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth proudly stood before the CO2-temperature curve of the last several hundred thousand years and fooled his gullible audience into thinking that CO2 drove global temperature in the past, and not vice versa.
Too bad Gore didn’t take a closer look at the curves. If he had, he would have noticed that temperature rose first with CO2 following, and so CO2 could not possibly have been the main driver. What really happened is that a warming Earth warmed the oceans, which in turn released CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s the real inconvenient truth.
Now there’s a new study by Jinho Ahn et al of Seoul National University. His team has taken another look at the temperature fluctuations 39,000 years ago. What did they find? Did CO2 lead temperature, or was it the other way around.
The data don’t lie, but obviously Gore does.  The results were clear: In the abstract the authors write (emphasis added):

This rise in CO2 was synchronous with, or slightly later than, a rapid increase of Antarctic temperature inferred from stable isotopes.”
Morover, it was thought that atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature in Antarctica varied on millennial time scales and that these changes were gradual. But the authors of the paper write:
In a detailed analysis of one event we now find that approximately half of the CO2 increase that occurred during the 1500-year cold period between Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events 8 and 9 happened rapidly, over less than two centuries.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt at Die kalte Sonne find this interesting. They write:
…about half of the total CO2 increase took place within just 200 years. This brings up important questions. The authors point out that the models based on the CO2 cycle are unable to to reproduce the rapid changes in CO2 condentrations.”
Back to the drawing board for climate modellers. But this time they really ought to put the horse before the cart.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp at Science Skeptical reports on Director of the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany brings us this glittering example of how arrogant and detached from reality the scientific elite among us can be.
How the Fraunhofer Director saves energy in his vacation home in California
By Rudolf Kipp
Professor Eicke R. Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany, recently expressed his opinion in a commentary appearing in the daily Badischen Zeitung. It bothers him that German companies simply are not acknowledging the huge potential of photovoltaics. They simply lack faith, he claims.
Completely unimpressed by the the wave of bankruptcies that has rippled through Germany due to low-priced competition from China, and despite all the generous subsidies pampering the industry, Weber is still convinced that photovoltaic systems will undergo a boom in the future.
Lack of faith as a reason for bankruptcies?
It’s not really clear if the Professor Weber really means solar companies in Germany are going bankrupt one after another because they lack the faith that he himself demands. That seems to be the least of the problems for German manufacturers. They all believe their products are better than those from China, and that the only way to a sustainable future is if more and more customers buy more and more of their solar modules.
Indeed faith can move mouintains, but it cannot pay a single bill from a supplier or employee wages. And because this is the reality, we are currently experiencing a die-off of an entire industry. The problem is not a lack of faith – it’s the lack of profitability.

Rising electricity prices are no problem for the professor
Another thing that agitates the professor from Freiburg is “the myth that German pensioners with their electricity bills are financing rich property owners who own buildings covered with solar panels and Chinese industrial bosses”. But it is indeed true that in Germany mainly land and homeowners are the ones profiting the most, along with Chinese solar panel manufacturers, while low income earners with no possibility to invest wind up footing the bill. Weber makes no attempt to refute this.
Instead, he simply recommends that low wage earners consume less power. And to ensure that they really do this, incentives need to be created. Here the professor, who resides in Germany, prefers a graduated price structure. He explains how this would work:
My electricity bill in my vacation home in California is structured as follows: 13 cents/kwh for base consumption, 29 cents/kwh for up to 200 percent of the base consumption and much more for households with large consumption.”
When you read this, it becomes clear why Professor Weber is not afraid of rising power costs. The man can obviously afford it. Clearly he has enough money to fly to his vacation home in California multiple times a year – emitting huge quantities of CO2 as he does so.
Moreover, the professor has the chutzpah to expect other people, who can only dream of having the professor’s lifestyle and who emit only a fraction of his CO2, to limit their energy consumption in order to rescue the planet. To reach this target, he considers it absolutely necessary to make energy so expensive that the “little man” is no longer able to afford it.
If at some time rising energy prices should lead to unrest, then I would recommend that Professor Weber remains at his California vacation home instead of staying in Germany. In earlier revolutions such arrogant elitists ended up facing angry mobs armed with pitchforks and torches.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Michael-Shawn Fletcher
Based on data from a few carefully selected tree rings, dogmatic warmist scientists like to insist that the Medieval Warm Period really did not exist globally and was only a local North Atlantic phenomenon.
The climate, they tell us, was pretty much steady over the last couple thousand years – until man began to prosper a hundred years ago.
However, yet another new study, one by Michael Shawn Fletcher and Patricio Iván Moreno, has been published and adds more to the growing mountain of evidence that the Medieval Warm Period was indeed a global phenomenon. This in turn means that natural climate drivers are dominating the development of the climate, and not CO2.
Yeah, like we’re really surprised.
The authors did an analysis of pollen and charcoal from Laguna San Pedro, a small closed-basin lake located in the Andes of Chile. Their results reveal centennial-scale changes in vegetation, climate and fire regime since 1500 cal yr before present.
According to the study’s abstract, they found periods of relatively low summer moisture and increased fire activity between 1500–1300 and 1000–725 cal yr BP. The period  1000–725 cal yr BP (i.e. Medieval Warm Period) is characterised by remarkably rapid bulk sediment accumulation, from which they infer prolonged annual sedimentation resulting from a decrease in the duration of lake freezing under a warmer climate. Before the Medieval Warm Period, i.e. 1300–1000, they found relatively moist conditions during summer and low fire activity. After the Medieval Warm Period, from 725–121 cal yr BP, there was slow bulk sediment accumulation implying a cool and wet climate. Adios Hockey Stick!

The abstract concludes (emphasis added):
Our results suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly chronozone was relatively warm and dry, followed by a cool-wet climate during the Little Ice Age chronozone, before a substantial modification of the vegetation landscape by Europeans occurred in the mid 1800’s. The timing and direction of changes in the Laguna San Pedro record bear a striking resemblance to multiple independent tropical Pacific precipitation reconstructions, areas where precipitation is governed by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and with the modern influence of ENSO over the climate in the region. We conclude that ENSO was the main driver of changes in growing season moisture in this part of the Temperate-Mediterranean Transition in south-central Chile over the last 1500 years.”
Here the authors lost it in the last sentence. I’m not at all convinced by their attribution to the ENSO, which is an internal oscillation occurring over annual and decadal scales. But the changes that the two authors have observed actually occur over decades, centuries and likely millenia. They really need to compare their results to solar and ocean cycle data, which today are readily available. Of course, they may not like what they find. But as scientists, they’ll surely put aside any prejudices that may exist.
If they do that, then they’ll reach a different conclusion. One thing is sure: the observed climate cycles have nothing to do with GHGs and man. That hypothesis can be fed to the shredder and dustbin.

But at least China is not taking this lightly, as they are threatening to impound EU planes should Hedegaard and all the napoleonic enviro-bureaucrats in the EU not back down.
Wei Zhenzhong, secretary general of the China Air Transport Association, said:
We would not like to see a situation of ‘you hold up my planes and I hold yours’. The government will take at least the same kind of measures, and these anti-sanction moves will be lasting,”
But the EU enviro-bureaucrats think it’s okay to boss the rest of the world around. Reuters writes:
The EU says such action is needed to meet the bloc’s environmental targets and fill a vacuum left by international failure to deal with aviation emissions.”
China has already postponed orders for Airbus planes worth $14 billion. Those are orders Boeing surely has an eye on. Expect Hedegaard to come under lots of pressure from other EU pols more concerned about jobs and urgently work on a face-saving measure.

There are plenty of gullible Donahues and drones out there who think Boy Wonder Obama, with all his candy-coated utopian promises, can organize society for us, along with the EPA, or the WBGU, or the European Commission, or the UN, or…
Four years later, 6 trillion dollars more debt and 9 million unemployed people more should tell you everything you need to know. “The record of history is absolutely crystal clear.”
That’s why you must go out and vote.
PS: And here’s Friedman on socialized medicine:

Little wonder that the US lawmakers made themselves exempt from the very system they now are planning to impose on the rest of the country.

Cold, snow and wind batter Europe again.
So much for rare and a thing of the past. Europe has seen much snow and cold over all of the last 5 winters!
The online Spiegel.here reports on heavy winter weather taking a deadly toll across the continent.
Four people died in Croatia and one in Serbia because of the cold authorities reported on Sunday. Traffic came to a standstill at many locations, the airport in Zagreb was closed for hours. Also German President Joachim Gauck was delayed for hours flying back to Germany.”

Southeastern Europe was hit especially hard, with up to a half a meter of snow falling in the Balkan region. More lives were claimed in Poland, where Spiegel writes: “The winter outbreak has claimed 3 lives since Friday, temperatures in some regions fell below minus 15°C.”
Spiegel writes that German meteorologists at the German Weather Service (DWD) are expecting up to 20 centimeters of snow by Monday accompanied by dangerous blizzard conditions.
No change in weather is in sight: ‘Snow, ice and frost will accompany us through next week.'”
The English language The Local here reports on German weather conditions:
DWD issued snow storm warnings for several regions including parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Thuringia. The coldest temperatures of the winter so far at minus 22 degrees Celsius were recorded in Sohland in the Upper Lausitz area.”
Scandinavia was also har hit last week, where as many as 30 centimeters of snow fell during a “blizzard”, the English language Swedish The Local reported.

(Translation / editing by P Gosselin)
The IPCC thinks the sun plays nary a role on climate and that anthropogenic factors explain almost the entire warming since 1850.
It’s been completely ignored that Gerard Bond was able to show more than 10 years ago that the last 10,000 years have been characterized by a global temperature roller coaster that runs up and down in sync with solar activity (Bond et al. 2001).

Figure 1: Comparison of solar activity (blue curve) and the Asian climate development (green curve, delta 18O of a stalagmite in a Chinese cave) for the last 9000 years (both curves normalized). One clearly sees a good agreement between the two curves, which stgrongly suggests a significant climate impact by the sun. Figure from Steinhilber et al. (2012).
In our book “The Forgotten Sun“ (p. 68-75) we were able to show the close relationship between the climate and the sun in multiple studies from all parts of the globe and that the warming of the last 150 years also closely follows the pattern.
Now a new paper by the international team of scientists led by Friedhelm Steinhilber of the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Sciences and technology (Eawag) has just produced yet more important evidence of the sun’s impact on the Holocene climate development. The group, which also includes glaciologist Hans Oerter of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, published the results last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Using multiple Antarctic and Greenland ice cores and global tree-ring data, the scientists reconstructed solar activity over the last 9000 years. They also used the so-called cosmogenic beryllium and carbon isotopes 10Be and 14C, whose frequency on Earth is controlled by the strength of the sun’s magnetic field, and thus by solar activity.

The group carried out a spectral analysis of the new solar activity curves and found, as expected, the usual characteristic solar cycles, among them also the 210-year Suess-de Vries cycle, the 1000-year Eddy-cycle and the 2300-year Hallstatt-cycle. The Grand Solar Minima coincided mostly with the minima of the Suess-de Vries cycles.
The cycles are superimposed by the longterm rising and falling signal of orbital changes associated with the Milankovitch cycles. The Milankovitch cycle is in part responsible for the warm temperatures of the Holocene Optimum 6000 years ago, when it was considerably warmer than today. Steinhilber and his colleagues removed these orbital signals from the data in order to filter out the primary solar activity.
They then compared the new solar activity reconstruction with a climate dataset earlier obtained by colleagues in a Chinese cave covering the last 9000 years. The fluctuations in the 18O-oxygen isotope concentrations show the precipitation fluctuations and the intensity of the Asian monsoons. What resulted was a surprising agreement between solar activity and the Asian climate development (see Figure 1 above).
In times of low solar activity, Asian monsoons were less pronounced in general. Also the most important solar cycles could be found in the frequency analysis of the Asian climate signal. One can only conclude that solar activity cycles are the main driver of the last 10,000 years and that they continue to be so today as we continue to remain in the now well-documented pattern.
In the 9000-year time period investigated by Florian Steinhilber and his colleagues, there are however some phases where the correlation between solar activity and climate is missing. For these periods, the scientists assume that other geological factors, like large volcanic eruptions and associated atmospheric aerosols, or other natural factors influenced and overrode the solar signal. In general these factors must always be taken into account when conducting statistical analyses.
The new results from the Steinhilber Group once again shows the significant importance of the sun on the Earth’s climate development.
We can only hope that the authors of the current, new IPCC report will add it and all the other important studiesn in its synthesis report and finally add the sun’s major impact in the models. However, this only hopeful thinking. In contradiction to the growing body of scientific evidence, the IPCC has already made it clear that it will ignore the sun’s major impact even more (see our blog article “Der neue IPCC-Klimabericht: Sonne noch weiter degradiert!“).
This needs to be seriously looked into.

It’s time for a break from blogging.
I’ve gotten a hefty amount of work to do and the deadlines are really tight. There’s no way I will be able to blog regularly for the next two weeks. I may be able to post a short item or two here and there, but not more.
It’s a bit strange – in Europe normally business is slow in August. But not this year.
If readers would like to post as a guest, you are welcome to do so – just send in what you have by e-mail. Keep it short and not more than 3 graphics.
Comments will remain open, but I will not have time to go through the spam to rescue legitimate comments. So it’s possible that your comment may get thrown out now and then.
This is the first time in over 2 years that I have taken a break from blogging.
I should be back at it in about 15 days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn this American Thinker piece by Clarice Feldman, the parallels to Steve McIntyre just jumped right out at me.
The German press is trying to make it look like the Democrats are thrilled about Ryan being the running mate, (predictably) painting Ryan as a “huge target” and a “radical conservative”, just because he believes in responsible spending (a concept that is foreign to many in Europe, e.g. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, France – to name a few).
But Europe’s reaction reminds me of Michael Mann’s initial reaction to the first enquiries he received from a once obscure mining consultant and statistical expert from Toronto. Today we know that Michael Mann and his hockey stick team ended up learning respect for the power of mathematics and the scientific method – the hard way. McIntyre dissected, organ by organ, the suspiciously flawed curve and left the hockey team forever humiliated.
While climatologist cheats tried to fabricate a statistical hockey stick from tree-ring data, the DC finance hockey league (yes, it is an entire corrupt league) is trying to do the opposite: they are trying to take a grotesque hockey stick and make it look flat by using tricks – thus postponing the towering blade onto the next generation. Like McIntyre, Paul Ryan is poised to dissect the phony straight line curves DC is trying to fool us with.
First, Feldman quotes the Iowahawk:
“Paul Ryan represent[s] Obama’s most horrifying nightmare: math.”
And then adds:

Let me remind you how nightmarish Ryan is to Obama. Here’s a six-minute take down of Obamacare by Congressman Ryan.
Watch the vacant look in Obama’s eyes as it becomes clear he has no idea how to respond to the facts Ryan raises, to the math which demonstrates the utter  unsustainability of Obama’s legislative scheme.”
We can all recall the climate hockey team’s similar reaction. Andrew Montford wrote a whole book on it. First they tried to hide the numbers, claiming they were lost. Then they said the numbers were out there and anyone could see them. When the numbers were exposed, they had other “experts” bogusly confirm that they were right. And when these were shown to be flawed, they made up new phony curves. In the end, it was all about hiding an ugly truth. Today, except for the fabricators themselves, nobody believes the climate hockey stick curves anymore.
Paul Ryan is poised to be the floodlight that is about to illuminate Washington corrupt practices, which are taking the USA to Greece in a hand-basket.
Romney’s message is clear: We’re going to expose the mathematics (truth) of the numbers. Irresponsible spending and the looming debt crisis are going to be in the spotlight over the remainder of the campaign. You can run from Ryan all you want, but you won’t be able to hide from him.
Just ask Michael Mann.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy takes a look at how Germany’s experimental taxpayer-paid “energy-efficient home” is doing.  The home is a project by the German Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS). As you can see, it leaves little to be desired aesthetically.

The ugly-duckling energy self-sustainable home that isn’t. Erected in Berlin. Price tag: € 2.2 million
The home was opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel late last year amid much media pomp and ceremony and is intended to serve as a model for clean, environmentally responsible living. Strangely, Merkel has recently cut back solar subsidies specifically designed to achieve the aims of the house.
==========================================
The energy efficiency home – the latest act of foolery
by Michael Clemens for EIKE
In the story of the fools of Schilda, the citizen fools built a city hall but forgot the windows. So they put sunlight inside bags and carried it inside. Now a new episode of the fools of Schilda has been written in Berlin. Today’s fools are in a state of panic over the world’s energy reserves and dangerous atomic radiation. And so they’ve built a house that produces more energy than it can use and is supposed to fulfill the dream of “100% supplied by renewable energy”.
When it comes to transforming its energy supply, no cost is too high for the German government. As a flagship project, the shimmering blue “Efficiency Plus with Electromobility” was ceremoniously opened on 7 December 2011 by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a Federal Minsiter, and has been recently occupied by a test family.
Federal Minister Peter Ramsauer said, “We want to show people that a completely renewable energy supply is already possible today and is an every-day thing. Our motto: ‘My home is my petrol station.’ The house should not and will not stay a prototype: What we are presenting here is the home of the future.“
In a brochure issued by the Federal Ministry for Transportation, Construction and Urban Development (BMVBS), we find the following technical information, data and claims:
The surplus energy the house produces is stored in a house battery and in an electric car, which acts both as a storage and user of energy. Both home and mobility are thus independent of the power grid.
The house is ecologically sustainable, fully recyclable and highly energy-efficient. No fossil fuels based energies are needed and no CO2 emissions are caused.”

The monthly energy need is given by the following chart:

But a check of the data yields a different picture
Misrepresented in the chart of energy demand given by the BMVBS is the monthly power generation of the photovoltaic system. In the wintertime when you have the highest demand for electricity and power, only 10% of the energy needed is generated. Using the monthly averages for PV generation in the region of Berlin in 2011, the following monthly energy budget results:

Thus the house is not energy independent and self-sufficient. By taking a close look at the daily amounts one sees that in the winter months the photovoltaic system delivers no energy. The planned batereries with a capacity of 40 kWh barely suffices to cover the night in the summertime. The necessary capacity for the wintertime would have to be more than 100 times greater, i.e. 4500 kWh (approx. 30% of the annual need). For this no technology is in sight.
The heat pump and electromobility increase the winter peak demand for electricity by a factor of 4 with respect to purely conventional power need. The niche technology of photovoltaics cannot replace a single kilowatt of power plant output.
The price tag for the”energy efficiency home” is pegged at 2.2 million EUR.
With this BMVBS project, the day-in and day-out supply of energy and independence from the power grid is an illusion. A layman cannot recognize that it merely exists in a worthless annual energy balance and that there often shortfalls at various times of the year.
Indeed the house proves the opposite: it is not energy independent. Despite the massive deployment of resources and technology, the laws of physics could not be ignored and the supply of renewable energy suffices only for a shed in the summertime.
The energy efficiency house is a symbol of a failed energy policy. It represents misguidance and deception of the citizens by ideologues, lobbyists, media and politicians, as well as a huge waste of resources.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSheesh! This is like a Normandy invasion – this one by the climate science skeptics. The Americans have landed on one beach, and now the Canadians are following on another.
First it was Prof Fred Singer of the USA, then the evil Heartland Institute, and now it’s veteran investigative journalist Donna Laframboise of Toronto, Canada.
Donna’s hard-hitting, unflattering book exposing the corruption rampant within the IPCC has been translated in German and is now being launched in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg – i.e. the heart of the climate catastrophe regime in Europe.
Note that the skeptics only wish to openly talk about the subject of climate science and to have a little public debate. Why are the warmists so afraid of a little open dialogue? Is their science so weak? Fear is hardly a sign of confidence.
If the German alarmists thought Fred Singer and the Heartland Institute were trouble, wait until they see Donna’s book about the IPCC. Expect a massive smear campaign by the alarmists soon. Hope you’ve got a thick skin, Donna.
So Donna, tell us who is really funding you? What about your ties to Koch Industries and to Big Oil? Surely you’re hiding them. And who is paying you all that money? Are you a climate scientist? Why do you spend so much time hanging out with all those deniers and attending their climate conspiracy conferences? Vee hav vays of finding these things out!
You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, young lady.

And expect friendly e-mails from “investigative” journalists at Die Zeit, or German Public Radio, asking for cordial interviews.

Donna’s climate dissent now spreading in German in Europe.
Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne website here and the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here both have a small write-up on Donna’s book, The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert, now being launched in German. They write:
On December 5, 2012, Candian IPCC critic Donna Laframboise is making a presentation at 7 p.m. in Berlin. The topic: just exactly how objective is the IPCC, which was formed to act as a climate referee? The presentation is taking place at the Albrechtstr. 11 in the ‘Haus der Zukunft’ (1st floor). It’s open to the public and entrance is free. Space, however, is limited so it is best to be there early.
Donna Laframboise summarized her IPCC criticism in her book “The Delinquent Teenager Who Was Mistaken for the World’s Top Climate Expert”, appearing in 2011. It is strongly recommended. The book is now available in German at a price of € 19.90 at TvR media publishers: buch@tvrgroup.de.“
Reaction to this book is not going to be pretty.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier today a reader (I think Juraj)  left a comment with a link to a snow cover chart that disappeared on me. Sorry about the accidental deletion, but I’ve managed to find the chart using Google. According to Rutgers University here, snow cover over the northern hemisphere reached record December levels last month, thus dumping cold water on the notion that wintertime snows are getting rarer.

December northern hemisphere snow cover. Chart source:Rutgers University
Why is it that whenever snow disappears in the Arctic in the late summer, warmists scream bloody climate murder, but when snow reaches record levels in the wintertime, then they get real real quiet. Yoo-hoo media…where are you?
It would be nice to see a trend line on these charts. Actually I just found a time series here.
Looking at the last 30 years, we see a definite trend upwards. If this keeps up, all that albedo is going to reflect all the solar radiation back into space, and thus cool the Earth more, which will then lead to more snow cover, more albedo…and thus (assuming the warmists are right about the theory of melting Arctic sea ice), lead to a tipping of the climate.
The chart for January northern hemisphere snow cover also shows a clear upward trend  over the last 20 years:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a new study out titled: A public health frame arouses hopeful emotions about climate change – A Letter in the Journal Of Climatic Change. It is a rare and precious glimpse at the warmists’ future strategy.
The study’s conclusion:
Framing climate change in terms of public health and/or national security may make climate change more personally relevant and emotionally engaging to segments of the public who are currently disengaged or even dismissive of the issue.
Don’t expect the results of this study to be made very public. But do expect them to be made very well known to the mainstream media, and watch them zealously apply the results with abandon soon in future communication with audiences.
As for the public, expect to be massively bombarded by all sorts of scare stories about the dangers of climate change to public health soon enough. I can see it now: climate change induced influenza, mental illness, epidemics, widespread allergies, rheumatism, malaria, cancer, depression…you name it!
The authors used a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, and randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions.
The results: “across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation.”
The introduction of the paper frames what the challenge is all about:
Effectively engaging the American public on climate change—including its causes, impacts, and solutions—remains both a major research question and a communication challenge.”
Clearly even though the public is growing more and more skeptical, the warmist bunch is a long way from giving up.

While many of us may scoff at the notion that a 1°C rise in temperature threatening public health, expect this dastardly scheme to scare will be aimed particularly at schoolchildren and students – the most emotionally vulnerable among us. Again, it’s the warmists resorting to the dirty tactics of scare-mongering and mass psychological manipulation.
The paper adds:
People’s emotional reactions to messages about climate change are an important consideration, yet to date they have often been overlooked both in research and in communication efforts. […] Emotions serve as affective prompts for engagement with an issue and lead to forming predispositions for action when a relevant situation arises.”
But the authors warn that there’s a risk of producing an unintended angry backlash, and that caution is needed:
However, eliciting anger against the claims or proposed recommendations emphasized in a communication strategy also has the danger of inciting action counter to the communicator’s intent. […] the very claim of climate change’s reality might elicit anger among people dismissive of the issue. Thus, a given message could generate an angry backlash by some recipients, leading to an unintended social response, while provoking an equally angry—yet intended—social response by other recipients.”
Us skeptics must work to educate the public about the true intentions of this budding campaign. We need to feed that legitimate backlash.
The authors end by saying the “research demonstrates the potential of the public health frame to inspire hope in the context of the climate change discussion while demonstrating the possibility that certain frames may be poorly received within some interpretive communities. More research is needed to understand how frames both set the context for perception on the issue and interact with emotions in guiding public decisions and behavior.”
It’s a good idea to print this study out and to read it carefully. In my view it’s a playbook for one of the next rounds of the manipulative mind games they intend to play on the public.
The study was supported by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Investigator Award and by the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt saddens us to report that prominent Austrian climatologist Reinhard Böhm has died unexpectedly, Der Spiegel reports. He was 64.

Leading Austrian climate scientist Reinhard Böhm (64) dies. (Photo source: ZAMG)
News of his death was made public by the Central Office for Meteorology and Geodynamics in Vienna (ZAMG).
Spiegel calls him the “father of Austrian climate science” and that he was one of the most important worldwide.
‘The personal and professional loss can hardly be expressed by words,’ says Michael Staudinger, Director of the ZAMG.”
Böhm was an independent thinker, and he advised his students to be critical and to not accept anything at face value. He worked at the ZAMG since 1973 and authored or co-authored more than 150 papers about climate in the Alps and glaciers.

For Böhm, the key to science was to always be skeptical and critical. Spiegel quotes Böhm:
‘Don’t let anyone tell you we know enough,’ he told laypersons. ‘Always question the science, be skeptical, and check everything that I claim,’ said Böhm.”
According to Spiegel, he bristled at the notion of politicians rescuing the planet and detested the politicization of climate science, refusing to participate in political debates, saying: “I don’t know the first thing about rescuing the planet. For that I am not an expert”.
Spiegel adds:
His critical view often contradicted the modern opinion on environmental topics. The renowned scientist never backed down, always distrusting every ideological, pre-concluded science.”
Last May I wrote about a study which he had authored where he found that weather extremes in the Alps had not increased.
Another great one has left us. Rest in peace.

Overall, eight people have died due to cold weather in Santiago, in addition to six others who perished in other the Central and Southern regions of the country. The cold front has caused temperatures throughout Chile to drop well below freezing. Some parts of Santiago reported temperatures as low as -4 degrees Celsius, causing homeless residents throughout the capital to face the cold without proper accommodations.”
According to www.news.de here, the cold is also gripping Bolivia and Peru, where the mercury has dropped to -23°C.
The low temperatures will continue in the days ahead as cold is expected to grip much of South America for the next week, see chart above.
Last week in Argentina, serious frosts led to a declaration of an agricultural emergency and disaster, read here.
The extreme cold is not isolated to South America. In Tasmania night-time temperatures in the South and Liawenee posted the coldest June day in almost 30 years. “Temperatures in some areas fell to almost 10 degrees below average between June 20 and June 28.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHooray, Spiegel reports on the Antarctic sea ice record! Though, the piece was pretty much buried in the back pages. Yet, thanks to science reporter Axel Bojanowski, Spiegel at least mentions that the South Pole did set a sea ice record last month, and even presented the following NSIDC chart:

September sea ice extent at the South Pole keeps growing. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center, USA
Spiegel reports:
While sea ice at the north pole this summer disappeared like never before since satellite measurements began in the 1970s, sea ice at the south pole set a counter record: Never has so much ice surrounding Antarctica covered such a large area at this time of the year since satellite measurements began in the late 1970s.”
Isn’t it nice pushing it right back into the faces of warmists?
Of course, we are told that the loss of the north polar sea ice is due to warming. So would it not be logical to blame the sea ice increase at the south pole on cooling? No! says the NSIDC. Spiegel writes:

For the Arctic, it’s global warming. But for the Antarctic, it’s local phenomena! And if we hold our horses for just little while longer, surely the spinsters at the NSIDC will even find a scientific explanation blaming the southern sea ice increase on global warming.

This is a short extension to my last article on Why The Earth Is Cooling. When I first began exploring Modtran, the numbers it produced for downward radiation at the surface seemed to make no sense. It nearly always produced the same number, and I thought that part of the program was broken. On reflection, it became clear that the numbers were correct and that I had fallen into the warmist trap of believing that CO2 really does something to the Greenhouse effect. When the numbers in the very low humidities were charted, all became clear.
Here is what Modtran says about downward or “back” radiation at the Earth’s surface for values of humidity from 0 to 90% and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm.

You should notice that the legend cites six traces, but you see only four. That is because the 10, 50, and 90% humidity traces are superimposed. There is very little change in the downward radiation for any humidity from 10% and above and for any CO2 concentration from zero to 1000 ppm, or indeed for any concentration of CO2 up to 10,000 ppm.
Here are the Excel numbers copied from Modtran used to draw the above table:

As you can see, only in the driest desert on Earth will increasing CO2 increase the “back” radiation. Water vapor is by far the strongest greenhouse gas, but it is nearly saturated at 10% humidity. At 10% humidity and above, no amount of CO2 does anything. Most of the humidity on Earth is in that area on the right where doubling CO2 will do nothing to increase the long-wave radiation from the sky. Yet another warmist fail.
Unless the entire planet very soon goes to zero-percent relative humidity, we can go ahead and shut down the global warming hoax industry. If it’s happening, it is hardly because of CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things are now horrendous for the Northeast US, just wait few more days. Hell in New Jersey and New York could turn into Super Hell, especially if they don’t get power and real help soon.

 Chart from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of the US National Weather Service indicates massive snowfall across the Northeast, with up to 25 inches of snow in Massachusetts and Vermont in the days ahead. 
More often than not, computer forecasts 5 days out are not that far off. If the latest 5-day forecast has any degree of accuracy, then it bodes very very ill for the Northeast USA – a region already battered and down on its knees after the body blow delivered by Sandy. Mother Nature has no mercy.
The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) models show a massive winter storm brewing, one that is poised to deliver icy temperatures and heavy snow in an area that is already fully exposed and vulnerable.
On Twitter I’ve been following Dr. Ryan Maue and Joe Bastardi, who have been watching the ECMWF models developing. It appears Mother Nature is preparing to deliver no. 2 of the old one-two punch.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi‘s reaction at Twitter looking at the models:
ecmwf delivers classic noreaster with m-id north atlantic gale to storm forces winds on coast, heavy snows n va to ny/ne. wow!”
Mateorologist Dr. Ryan Maue adds:
Actual snowfall, of which some may melt, 20-25” maximum for W. Mass. Still 5-6 days away to gas up snowblower.”

Maue also brings our attention to projections of a Canadian model:

Canadian model projection for 8 November looks a little less threatening, yet has lots of potential for real danger.
I really do hope people, the media, and especially disaster management officials take this seriously. There are lots of people with no power and other essential services who are fully exposed. Sure the weather is much nicer out in sunny Nevada, but Obama should really get his parka out and get back East and prepare the area.
The forecast is a good 5 days out, and so the accuracy is still somewhat iffy. The picture will definitely become much clearer in the next 24 hours.
Meanwhile, Maue warns that winter is about to break (early) in full earnest out West.
Colorado Low means major winter storm for Montana + Dakotas.  Winter.”
Global warming is causing early winters, the warmists will soon be telling us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following is video of a CNN debate between Marc Morano and Bill Nye. I thought Bill Nye was supposed to be well-informed about science. Boy, was I wrong.

Marc Morano Exposes Bill Nye’s astonishing ignorance of climate science.
It started as soon as Nye opened his mouth at the 1:39 mark, he claimed the Medieval Warm Period and Roman Period were isolated incidents occurring only in Europe. He repeated it again at 2:55.
That claim was already refuted 10 years ago. Since then there have been dozens of studies from every corner of the globe where proxy data clearly show that the aforementioned optimums occurred in cycles WORLDWIDE. Incredibly, Bill Nye thinks that the global temperature was more or less constant before human CO2 emissions. Even Michael Mann no longer believes that.
At the 2:20 mark, Nye then says that the rate of CO2 rise is of great concern. False. What is of concern is CO2’s impact on global warming. All scientists agree that a doubling of CO2 will lead only to about 1 – 1.5°C of warming by itself. CO2’s impact is turning out to be far less than originally feared. In fact “the rapidly rising CO2” has resulted in no global warming in over 15 years!
Then at about the 3:35 Morgan and Nye seem to claim that the climate is directly related to the human population, i.e. when population rises, then temperature rises. Now we are getting a good idea of just how bad Nye and Morgan’s science truly is.

Throughout the debate, Nye and Morgan’s arguments are carried by fear and horror visions. You can’t help but to think they are a bit on the hysterical side.
At the 4:30 mark, Morgan then totally confuses weather with climate. “How do you explain the warm weather today? Why is it we have all this freakish weather just when we have so many people? That’s evidence isn’t it?” The CNN host has now ventured into comedy science. It’s again that psychological affliction of insisting that the world is coming to an end, and not being able to live without that.
At the 6:30 mark it’s the old “precautionary principle” line. It’s a wonder these people ever hop onto a plane or drive a car.
The rest of the debate is pretty much Bill Nye and Piers Morgan neurotically worrying about the phony computer-generated horror scenarios 100 years down the road, and confirm they believe that global temperatures are rising (they aren’t, they’re flat) and that sea level rise is accelerating (it isn’t, in fact it is decelerating).
Finally, I couldn’t help noticing that their primary worry is population growth – for them there are just too many people on the planet. They need more “Lebensraum“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother short one…
Last week my wife and I spent a few days in Berlin, and we visited the German Historical Museum.
Part of Germany’s very early history involves the Roman Empire, which never succeeded in taming the unruly tribes east of the Rhine.

Climate change during the Roman Empire days, when CO2 was below 300 ppm.
One of the exhibits there was accompanied by a piece of interesting text, which I photographed (without a flash), see above. The Roman empire collapsed in part due to climate change back then.
I thought the climate was gentle when atmospheric CO2 concentration was below 300 ppm – steady, unvariable and associated with few weather extremes. That’s what fraudster warmist climatologists tried to have us believe with an assortment a various hockey stick charts.
Someone needs to tell the German Historical Museum that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal climate, we are told, was more or less constant before man began emitting greenhouse gases. This is what a number of IPCC scientists tried (and are still trying) to tell us with their fabricated hockey sticks.

A  new 9170-year paleohydrologic reconstruction by Kirby et al is out. The team of scientists have examined deposits from Lower Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains, in southwest United States. These mountains are the source region for the Mojave River.
The authors write in the abstract that “the new multi-proxy record is characterized by alternating organic-rich/carbonate-rich sediment units”, which they say can be interpreted “to reflect hydrologically-forced changes in the lake’s depositional environment”.
What result did they find? (My emphasis):
Our interpretation of the proxy data indicates nine decadal-to-multi-centennial pluvial episodes [periods of heavy precipitation] over the past 9170 cal yr BP. Of these nine inferred pluvials, five are interpreted as more pronounced based on their combined proxy interpretations: (PE-V) 9170?–8250, (PE-IV) 7000–6400, (PE-III) 3350–3000, (PE-II) 850–700, and (PE-I) 500–476 (top of core) cal yr BP.”

This tells us that precipitation amounts were high in the region of the San Bernardino mountains during those periods. Moreover, the authors add that this was not a locally isolated phenomenon, but was widespread over the general region:
Our comparison extends north also to Tulare Lake, which drains the southcentral-western Sierra Nevada Mountains. This temporally and spatially coherent signal indicates that a similar climate forcing acted to increase regional wetness at various times during the past 9170 cal yr BP. […] Holocene pluvial episodes are associated with changing the frequency of large winter storms that track across a broad region at decadal-to-multi-centennial timescales.”
Centennial time scale? This would indicate something more at work than ocean cycles, which are internal within the climate system, and suggests that other natural, external cycles are at work. However, IPCC scientists like to suggest that these natural factors no longer play a role today, that they stopped working a hundred years ago, and so leave them out of their climate models.
According to the German-language Wikipedia, in paleoclimatology pluvials are usually in connection with unusually strong precipitation – geologically shown to have occurred mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Good examples are areas that are deserts today, e.g. the mudpans of the Sahara, Lake Bonneville in western Utah, Lake Moeris Faiyum, Egypt, and Lake Chad.
Overall the cold periods on the Earth were less wet than the warm periods.
All that is left to do is to compare the results of the new study to solar activity over the last ten thousand years. Maybe we’ll find that there was cyclic volcanic activity driving it all!

======================================================

What Do Polar Bears Dream While They’re Dying?
Dear Ed, P,
If this were only the Pleistocene, your factual errors, outdated science references and unfounded conclusions aside, you are right, polar bears would come to land and survive.
However, this is not the Pleistocene, it is the Holocene. For the first time in polar bear evolution, the decline of sea ice now places the bears’ turn to land in direct conflict with an animal with which it has never before had to compete: man.
Polar bears are most certainly more threatened now than in any time in their history, and we are to blame. Behind the screen of climate change, the world has been duped; polar bears do need land, a fact and reality that is being denied.

Behind this denial, there exists no sanctuary for polar bears in Alaska and no one seems to mind, much less care. “Critical Habitat” here in the US, is 96% melting sea ice. While only 4% is land, that land is still available for development.
When the sea ice melts, and it is melting, and the polar bears come to land (they are already doing so), 2,000+ polar bears will have no choice but to come ashore with no land set aside for them.
When 2000+ polar bears find no sanctuary, no refuge from development, no home, no peace, they will not survive. You say they they are in no danger, the fact is that they have never faced a greater danger.
Like Mr. Gore, your misguided position only serves to further public confusion, and further damage the future of polar bears.
Polar bears can survive climate change, but not human greed. If we continue to wage the politics of climate change on the backs of polar bears, they will never have a chance.
Polar bears need sanctuary, and until they get it, they have no future as a species on this planet.
Respectfully,

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Hans H.J. Labohm has written an overview, soon to appear in Energy and Environment Journal titled: Climate Scepticism in Europe.

Dr. Hans Labohm says climate science scepticism is “very much alive and kicking” in Europe.
The opening sentences set the tone in no uncertain terms. He calls the notion of dangerous manmade global warming a “delusion”, a science that has been plagued by “cherry–picking, spin-doctoring and scare–mongering by the United Nations’ IPCC and other climate alarmists.”
In his analysis, Dr. Labohm analyzes the sceptic movement in various European countries and believes that “the tide seems to be turning” and that it has “gained considerable ground”. But the obstacles in Europe are still huge, as almost “all political parties are toeing the global warming line”.  Labohm writes that “sceptical views – even from well-known scientists with impeccable credentials – tend to be ignored and/or actively suppressed by governments, academia and the media.” However, it appears that the obstacles can be overcome. Labohm adds, citing a variety of recent public opinion surveys:
Over the last few years a disconnect has been growing between public opinion and official climate policy. Despite massive climate change propaganda, less and less people seem to be concerned about the putative threat of an imminent climate catastrophe.”
Labohm begins his look at Europe by first focusing on Russia, where he says Russian scientists aren’t at all timid about expressing their scepticism. Some Russian scientists openly say that a little ice age is imminent in the coming decades, and adds that “it was no surprise that the Russians have announced to drop out of Kyoto”.
Sweden also has a small but very vocal group of sceptics including: Göran Ahlgren, Jonny Fagerström, Per Welander, Tage Andersson, Per-Olof, Eriksson, Sten Kaijser, Wibjörn Karlén, Ingemar Nordin, Åke Ortmark, Carl-Gustaf Ribbing, Peter Stilbs, Maggie Thauersköld and Fred Goldberg. Another harsh critic of global warming science is Axel Mörner. In Denmark there are renowned researchers Bjørn Lomborg, Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen.
Labohm then looks at the German speaking part of Europe, where he writes that in Switzerland two associations are active in opposing AGW. One association is the Swiss branch of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, NIPCC Suisse, which makes use of the research work of the NIPCC and its associates under Fred Singer.” Other influential associations in the German speaking area include the Initiative Against the Climate Scam, IKLIS.8, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), which “plays a central role” and “runs an excellent website and has organised successful climate conferences”.

Labohm’s report also looks at the development of Germany’s two most prominent and visible sceptics: Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt (green activist) and Dr. Sebastian Lüning (geologist) who published their “bombshell book ‘Die Kalte Sonne’ (The Cold Sun’)”, which was extensively covered by renowned media such as Bild, Die Welt, and Der Spiegel.
Moreover, the warmists recently took one to the chin, as Stefan Rahmstorf, who lavishly uses “ad hominem attacks and insinuations that his opponents lack qualifications and/or are being paid by industry”, lost a court case against science journalist Irene Meichsner, who had sued Rahmstorf “for spreading false accusations of inaccurate reporting”.
France also has vocal skeptics with Claude Allègre (former minister of education), Vincent Courtillot and Jean-Louis Le Mouël. Labohm also writes that in Great Britain “climate scepticism is very much alive and kicking”, thanks to the massive efforts of Lord Monckton, Benny Peiser, Martin Durkin and Andrew Montford, to name a few.
Fortunately, the climate science debate is not hopelessly polarized everywhere. Take the Netherlands for example. Labohm writes:
In my own country, The Netherlands, the relationship between protagonists and antagonists of the AGW hypothesis has markedly improved over the last few years. In line with the Dutch tradition of consensus-seeking (‘polder culture’), it has been possible to establish something close to a real dialogue between the two camps, which is pretty unique in the world. Climate scepticism has even received official recognition, thus undermining the information monopoly of climate alarmists.”
At the end of the analysis, Labohm tells us why European diplomacy is creating “a convenient alibi to pull out of the Kyoto process at some point in the future, without losing face”. You’ll have to read his overview when it is published to find out why. So don’t expect much out of Doha.
Finally, Labohm also calls Europe’s emissions trading system (ETS) a failure: “Europe’s experience with ETS is dismal. The system is expensive and prone to massive fraud. Moreover it did not stop the increase in Europe’s CO2 emissions”.
Overall, the Energy and Environment report by Labohm is 7 pages chock-full with analyses of the skeptic movement in Europe. Best of all, it provides vast encouragement and motivation to those seeking to continue pushing the debate on climate science. The battle is definitely downhill.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that the mainstream media are hyperventilating over global warming being responsible for the heat wave, fires and thunderstorms hitting the US, it is a good time to check if they are applying the same science they used to explain winter cold snaps, like the one we saw just 2 years ago.
If they were serious, you’d at least think their science would remain consistent when explaining weather extremes. Anything else, after all, is just quackery.
Two years ago, the AP and scientists blamed the unusually cold winter weather on “natural variability”; they began:
Beijing had its coldest morning in almost 40 years and its biggest snowfall since 1951. Britain is suffering through its longest cold snap since 1981. And freezing weather is gripping the Deep South, including Florida’s orange groves and beaches.
Whatever happened to global warming? experts say the cold snap doesn’t disprove global warming at all  ‘It’s part of natural variability,’ said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. With global warming, he said, ‘we’ll still have record cold temperatures. We’ll just have fewer of them.’
Scientists say man-made climate change does have the potential to cause more frequent and more severe weather extremes…and even cold spells.”

The AP then quoted scientists to explain the cause of the cold snap of 2010, saying that it was just a “big outbreak of Arctic air over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere“, and then went on to provide the details about natural variability, which of course is reasonable.
But to explain the current 2012 heat wave near DC, they completely abandoned the reasonable science and went off and blamed CO2 witchcraft and Big Oil sorcerers summoning a heat wave.
So it’s up to us to use the rest of the AP’s 2010 story to explain the heat wave, changing only a few words:
‘We basically have seen just a big outbreak of Arctic tropical air’ over populated areas of the Northern Hemisphere, Arndt said. ‘The Arctic tropical air has really turned itself loose on us.’

In the atmosphere, large rivers of air travel roughly west to east around the globe between the Arctic and the tropics. This air flow acts like a fence to keep Arctic tropical air confined.
But recently, this air flow has become bent into a pronounced zigzag pattern, meandering north south and south north. If you live in a place where it brings air up down from the south north, you get warm cold weather. In fact, record highs lows were reported this week in Washington state and Alaska West Coast.
But in the eastern United States, like some other unlucky parts of the globe, Arctic tropical air is swooping down in from the north southwest. And that’s how you get a temperature of 3 104 degrees in Beijing Washington DC, a reading of minus-42 +104 in mainland Norway Norfolk, and 18 inches of snow rain in parts of Britain the South, where a member of Parliament Congress who said the snow heat ‘clearly indicates a cooling warming trend’ was jeered by colleagues.
The zigzag pattern arises naturally from time to time, but it is not clear why it’s so strong right now, said Michelle L’Heureux, a meteorologist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The center says the pattern should begin to weaken in a week or two.
Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said he expects more typical winter summer weather across North America early next week.
That will be welcome news in the South, where farmers have been trying to salvage millions of dollars’ worth of strawberries and other crops.

Why Borenstein and the quack scientists he interviewed didn’t use the same 2010 cold-snap science to explain the general atmospheric dynamics behind the current heat is sort of a mystery. Now that we are dealing with heat, they are blaming it all on CO2 without even citing a single paper to back it up.
So what are we left with? We have to assume that it’s a few fringe charlatans trying to fan the flames of fear. It’s as sad an example of sham science as you’ll ever find.
For these catastrophe-mongers, warm weather in the winter means global warming, cold weather in the winter also means global warming, heat in the summer of course means global warming, and so does cold in the summer. It is nothing more than the irresponsible perpetuation of an increasingly obvious fraud.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore on Sulfur Dioxide
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all of the literature about SO2 claims that it is not a greenhouse gas. This “consensus” opinion is based on the belief that SO2 residence time in the atmosphere is too short for the gas to have an effect.
In my last article on this subject it was asserted that the severe pollution from Norilsk in Siberian Russia moves out over the Arctic Ocean on the prevailing winds, preventing cooling, slowing the freeze-up. This is seen on the anomaly maps as warming. (It is now warmer than the 1998-2006 average.) As can be seen in Figure 1, the same thing happens in Arctic Canada, due to the SO2 from Canadian oil and gas fields that produce similar amounts of SO2.
There have been several estimates for the residence time of SO2 in the atmosphere. Keep in mind that residence time is the half-life of the substance in the air, that is, the time it takes for half of the material to disappear. If the residence time of SO2 is ten days, this means that, ignoring dilution, the 50,000 parts per million present at Norilsk, will be 25,000 parts per million 10 days later as the wind pushes that parcel of air over the Arctic Ocean, 12,500 parts per million after 20 days, 6,250 after a month, about 750 ppm after two months, etc. Because of inversions over the Arctic Ocean, there isn’t much vertical mixing to dilute the gas, so most of the mixing is horizontal in about a 100 meter altitude layer.
But, (and it is a big but) the residence time increases with a reduction in temperature. In the Arctic, at temperatures way below zero centigrade, the residence time may be more than 30 days, so multiply the time intervals above by three. That covers a whole season. And the SO2 is continuously being replenished. We are not describing an impulse in time like a volcanic eruption. Concentrations over the Arctic Ocean may build up and approach the concentrations at the source, if the wind blows steadily from south to north for an extended time. The residence time increases if there is nothing to remove the SO2.
Here are the things that remove SO2 from the atmosphere (read here).
1. Direct photo-oxidation (in the presence of oxygen and water).
But in the Arctic in the winter there is no sunlight, so that doesn’t function. The water vapor concentration is also very low. Below freezing, water vapor partial pressure is below 5 mbar; at -20°C it is below 1.5 mbar (below 0.5% and 0.15% of the atmosphere).
2. Indirect photo-oxidation (with O2, NOx, OH, organic oxidants).
Same problem as 1, no sunlight. And no sunlight to produce OH radicals.
3. Oxidation in liquid droplets (in the presence of liquid water).
There is no liquid water remember? The temperatures are way below zero.
4. Homogeneous aqueous phase oxidation.

Same problem as 3.
5, Catalyzed oxidation in liquid droplets (requires metal ions as well as water droplets).
This one might work, as there are lots of metal ions in the pollution from Norilsk, if there are super-cooled water droplets. But as in 1, the water vapor availability is very low because of the cold. What acid production that does occur happens in the smelter smokestacks where water vapor and temperatures allow 3, 4, or 5 to operate. Once the SO2 gets into the cold, dry, arctic air, all that stops.
6. Catalyzed oxidation on dry surfaces.
No joy here. Once it reaches the coast, the stuff is over open ocean or ice.
So, in winter, once SO2 leaves the smelter smokestacks, there is no mechanism to get rid of it. No wonder the Arctic is warming!
Is this what happens? Is the Arctic warming in winter? The climate scientists say it is, and in this regard they are correct.

Figure 2: Monthly maps of Arctic temperature anomaly for the last 7+ years. Source: Climate4You.
Note in Figure 2 the amount of red and orange (warm) areas in the October through April months. December and January have the most red in several of the years above. Most of the warm areas are right over Norilsk in Arctic Siberia. The warming happens only in the cold months. In Arctic summer there are mostly cool colors. In Arctic summer the humidity rises, sunlight produces OH radicals, and all the mechanisms 1 through 6 above begin operating, removing the SO2.
According to one source, 93.5% of the SO2 emissions in 1998 were in the Northern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere is where most of the measured warming is taking place. Circumstantial evidence would seem to point to SO2 as the culprit. Can SO2 act as a greenhouse gas? It has an infrared spectrum with two peaks at 7.27 and 7.345 µm. This is on the shoulder of one of water vapor’s absorbance peaks. In the absence of water vapor, in the Arctic cold, it can replace it as a greenhouse gas. In that role it can produce back radiation just as water vapor, CO2, and methane do. In past periods of high volcanism high volcanic emissions of SO2 have overwhelmed natural reduction mechanisms and have produced warming periods (see here).
The study of SO2, especially how it acts in the polar regions, has been neglected in favor of pushing CO2 as the ONLY cause of global warming. As is easily seen by looking at anomaly maps, the warming is not global. It is concentrated in the Arctic at certain locations, and to a lesser degree, the Antarctic, again, in the Southern Hemisphere winter. In the Antarctic, warming seems to be concentrated around the large research stations. All the stations in the Antarctic burn oil for heat, power, and transport. Is SO2 and the Antarctic winter the problem there?

It’s  utterly disgraceful that the VP of the US would stoop so low. Biden symbolizes what’s wrong with science today. Either it is being run by absolute ignoramuses, or just plain deceitful people. The evidence indicates it’s the latter.
According to Biden, government running science can only produce wonderful miracles, and quickly – in just a few years!

Already today they have the means to control global climate, they say. A world without ills awaits you! What are you waiting for?
Excerpts of Joe Biden speaking at Cypress Bay High School graduation ceremony (emphasis added, and not in order):
Imagine the breakthroughs that are on the horizon and just beyond it. Imagine by the time you’re in a position to buy your first home, putting a roof of solar shingles that will cost no more than today’s ordinary shingles that will be able to power your home, heating, cooling, running appliances at a fraction of the cost your parents pay today.  Imagine a world in which hunger is vanquished by crops that don’t depend on the soil or water or fertilizer or pesticides to thrive! They’re just around the corner. Imagine famine being a memory — and with it, the end of so much war and conflict that plagues so much parts of the world! Imagine a day when the lightweight materials, cleaner fuels, [and] advanced engines simultaneously make our air cleaner — allowing us to go the equivalent of hundreds of miles to the gallon. And maybe, most importantly, freeing us from our dependence on foreign oil and all that entails for a nation. Imagine a day within your lifetime when doctors can and will engineer your white blood cells to attack cancer cells and leave healthy cells untouched, allowing cancer patients to live out a full life without undergoing the difficulty some of you observe, painful chemotherapy and radiation procedures. Imagine a day, when in your, doctors are able to regenerate entire body parts and limbs that have been damaged and lost, not only saving tens of thousands of lives, but restoring the thousands of  our Iraq and Afghan veterans coming back in need of prostheses, so they will be able to live a full and ambulatory life.”
If his audience believes all that, then those graduation caps really need to be replaced with dunce hats.
Remember:  if anything ever happened to Obama, he’d be President! With a little luck, only another half year before we’re out of the woods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German left-wing online TAZ here has a report bemoaning how industrial countries are all shirking their responsibilities when it comes to helping the poor countries develop sustainable societies.

Sorry – no money for climate protection.
If there is a sure sign of just how serious countries really are when it comes to the “grave problems of climate change”, then look no further than money. If climate change was an imminent catastrophe, you wouldn’t know it from the money that countries are pledging. In fact, you’d think they’ve stopped taking it seriously.
The TAZ writes:
And today, 20 years later? Never has there been a UN climate conference where so little is being said about money, even though it is so urgently necessary,’ wonders Jens Martens, development expert of the international non-governmental organisation Global Policy Forum. The industrial countries wish to avoid costly promises and the South has given in to resignation.”
There are two reasons for that: 1) Many industrial countries are teetering on the brink of financial disaster, and 2) the same countries (e.g. Japan, China, Russia, Canada, USA) are beginning to wake up to the FACT that man-made climate catastrophe is a hoax.
At the 2010 Cancun Conference, industrial countries pledged $100 billion for so-called green climate funds. However, according to the TAZ, only about 10 billion have been paid.
With the financial markets in Europe and North America in worsening disarray, expect the supply of money for climate projects to get even more scarce. It’s back to 1992: “It’s the economy, stupid!” Climate change is just a hoax.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know that Romney is wishy-washy when it comes climate change science, and that us so-called skeptics were not at ease with that. Well, now you can cast your worries aside.
Over the last hours there’s been a lot of buzz out in the media that Paul Ryan has been chosen as Romney’s running mate. Confirmation of that is still pending. If true, that means we have a VP candidate who is a pretty solid skeptic when it comes to catastrophic manmade global warming. Romney is obviously comfortable with that and is using Ryan to reposition himself on the issue of global warming and energy.
What is Ryan’s position on climate science? Here’s what Paul Ryan wrote less than 3 years ago:
To the detriment of the American people, environmental issues have fallen victim to the hyper-politicization of science. The Journal Times editorial board sensibly cautioned both sides of the political divide against this unfortunate trend (“Science must trump spin,” The Journal Times, 12/3/09). At issue in the Journal Times’ recent editorial and on the minds of many Copenhagen observers are published e-mail exchanges from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU). These e-mails from leading climatologists make clear efforts to use statistical tricks to distort their findings and intentionally mislead the public on the issue of climate change. The CRU e-mail scandal reveals a perversion of the scientific method, where data were manipulated to support a predetermined conclusion. The e-mail scandal has not only forced the resignation of a number of discredited scientists, but it also marks a major step back on the need to preserve the integrity of the scientific community. While interests on both sides of the issue will debate the relevance of the manipulated or otherwise omitted data, these revelations undermine confidence in the scientific data driving the climate change debates.”
Here’s a list of Ryan’s other climate and energy accomplishments:
– voted to eliminate EPA Limits On Greenhouse Gases. [Roll Call 249, 4/7/11].
– voted to block the USDA from implementing its climate raindance. [Roll Call 448, 6/16/11].

– voted to eliminate the assistant to the president for energy and climate change, the special envoy for climate change (Todd Stern), and the special adviser for green jobs, enterprise and innovation. [Roll Call 87, 2/17/11].
– voted to eliminate ARPA-E. [Roll Call 55, 2/17/11].
– voted to eliminate the ban of incandescent light bulbs. [Roll Call 563, 7/12/11]
– voted for Keystone XL. In 2011, Ryan voted for the construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline. [Roll Call 650, 7/26/11]
– Paul Ryan’sFY 2013 budget resolution retained a decade’s worth of oil tax breaks worth $40 billion, while slashing subsidies in alternative energy research. The plan called for a $3 billion cut in energy programs in FY 2013 alone. [CAP, 3/20/12].
You can read how Ryan voted on every energy and environment issue here. Expect the debate on climate to gain traction in the campaign in the weeks ahead. We welcome it!

Seth Borenstein’s recent article in the Associated Press claims that recent weather events are a result of global warming. They are not; they are clearly weather, local in nature and short-lived. Borenstein is another “Chicken Little”, a calamitologist, crying “Wolf”. Here are the facts.
If recent weather events were because of a global increase in temperature, we should be able to see a global increase in temperature. We don’t. We see quite normal local variations, but on a global basis, nothing… a slight cooling.

Figure 1: GHCN/GISS temperature trend from November 2011 to April 2012 (the most recent figures). In the upper right corner is the global trend, 0.03°C cooling.
The previous six months shows a quite different pattern of local trends, but, again, the global trend is cooling.

google_ad_height = 200;

Figure 2: Trend for May to October 2011. In this six month period, the globe cooled by 0.07°C. The local trend pattern is completely different than in Figure 1.
Six months does not establish any kind of climate trend. Six month trends are Weather. Others have said that it takes 17, 30, or 60 years to establish a climate trend. These longer periods are simply climate cycles. What we experience from year to year is simply weather. We are now into 14 years of cooling according to satellite measurements.

Figure 3: RSS satellite global temperature anomaly. Where’s the warming?
In Figure 3, temperatures before 1998 were affected by the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo volcanic cooling events. 1998 was affected by a strong El Niño event, as was 2010. But the global trend over that last 14 years is cooling by about 0.1°C. But please note that I am not using that trend to claim a coming ice age.
There is another meme used in Mr. Borenstein’s story, that global warming is causing more wildfires.
Others have claimed that global warming is causing the Pine Bark Beetles to wildly expand, killing vast stretches of forest. One of the fires in Colorado was in a forest with 70% beetle-killed trees. The truth is that before the white man arrived, the forests were managed by nature using fire. The natural condition was that fires thinned out the forests keeping the tree population to about 100 per acre of mostly mature trees. The Forest Service has suppressed the natural fires, does not allow thinning, and now the tree density is up to 1000 per acre. The Pine Bark Beetles no longer need fly from tree to tree, they can walk,… without touching the ground.
Mr. Borenstein, you need to get over your fits of hysteria.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger at German blogsite Readers Edition uncovers how one of Stefan Rahmstorf’s scariest prophecies of climate doom has just been RESOUNDINGLY refuted by hard data from a new European study.

Gulf Stream is not weakening, a new European study says. Photo source: NASA (public domain image).
Krüger writes:
In 1999 German scientist Stefan Rahmstorf was awarded the one-million dollar “prize of the century” by the American James S McDonnel Foundation for his work on calculating climate change through changes in the Golf Stream. Rahmstorf had postulated that already a really small warming of global temperatures leads to an altered flow or even a tipping of the ‘Gulf Stream climate machine’.”
Rahmstorf was also quoted in the year 1999 by the Süddeutsche Zeitung:
The Atlantic current will likely weaken noticeably in the coming decades – here the computer models of various institutes broadly agree on this.”
And recently Rahmstorf reacted to a report appearing on the subject in science magazine mare. Rahmstorf reaffirms:
Summa summarum one can conclude from these very broadly supported estimations that the risk of a tipping of the North Atlantic stream is being increasingly  pessimistically assessed among experts. That also corresponds to my assessment, which also has grown more pessimistic over the course of my work on the subject. […] According to the latest, the risk appears to be greater than what we saw 10 or 15 years ago.”
Let’s recall that at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Rahmstorf’s employer, the only good science there are prophecies of the end-of-world. Anything else is considered heresy at the PIK. If it’s not laced with doom and gloom, then it isn’t acceptable science.
So how is the Gulf Stream really doing? Is it weakening noticeably as Rahmstorf and a consensus of computer models prophesied 13 years ago?
A recent report on ARD German public television (see clip below) now tells us the answer: No. No. No.

Youtube excerpt of the ARD public television Tagesschau and Tagesthemen news from 24 September 2012.
The ARD news anchor-lady tells her many viewers that the Gulf Stream “remains stable” and “has not weakened”, citing a team of scientists from 9 European countries. “New studies show that it is going strong, and is unaffected by climate change.” At the 1:22 mark according to Detlef Quadfasel of the University of Hamburg:
It shows that it remains stable and that we will have a relatively weak warming in Europe and in the North Atlantic and that no catastrophe will occur in the next 10 years.”
The news reporter then adds:
That’s a small sensation! And a reaction to a false warning from 7 years ago when a new cold period had been prophesied. Back then, measurements had been taken from only a few locations.”
The reporter then adds that over the last 5 years, measurements have been taken from 3000 measuring probes and they show no signs of any weakening.
There you have it. Obviously Prof. Rahmstorf (and the computer models from the other institutes he cites) were FOS with their prophecy of a weakening Gulf Stream and climate tipping point. Now it’s clear they had no idea what they were talking about.
Do you think Prof. Rahmstorf will come out and admit his error? Don’t hold your breath. The PIK sees itself as the Vatican of climate science, i.e. as infallible.
I challenge anyone to find one piece of good climate news coming out of the PIK. You won’t find any. Good news there gets strung up every morning at sun-up and never sees the light of day.
When is the government going to wake up and close that science nuthouse down?
 PS: Stefan Rahmstorf is also one of the outlier scientists claiming sea levels will rise more than a meter this century, even though all the tide gauges show no acceleration at all. Do we see a trend when it comes to Rahmstorfian science?

Share this...FacebookTwitterJournalist Michael Miersch at blogsite Die Achse des Guten reports on remarks made by Germany’s recently sworn-in President Joachim Gauck at Schloss Bellevue on Tuesday in a speech to open the Week of the Environment, where the elite of Germany’s environmental protection are meeting for two days.

German President Gauck bringing Germany back to eco-sobriety? (Photo by J. Patrick Fischer)
The eco pow-wow includes Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Lufthansa and 197 other ecological companies who have pitched tents at the Schlossgarten to show how to rescue the planet.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), President Gauck warned against forcing an energy supply transition through central planning measures:
‘We are not going to succeed with central planning regulations, and absolutely not with excessive subsidies,’ said Gauck .”
Moreover Gauck gave two thumbs up to free markets and competition, adding:
There’s no better way to solve problems than having a society with open markets and free competition.”
Miersch also adds Gauck delivered one of the most sensible speeches he has heard from a politician so far:

No apocalyptic scenarios, no tacky ecology prose, but a few sentences that got stuck in the throats of the audience. There was also a call to approach questions regarding the environment and climate reasonably and factually.”
Gauck also made another statement that surely irritated some in the audience:
Sustainability does not mean restriction or going without. Rather it means reason and responsibility.“
Gauck, who spent a large part of his life under the boot of Soviet/East German tyranny, ended with a call for “sustainable progress“. Surely he knows something about what that means, having seen little of that in the communist days.
Overall, a detectable shift in tone is taking place; alarmism is being ratcheted back. Gauck did not not cite a consensus of scientists. This year his speech mentioned only “leading scientists warn of a consequential global climate warming that can hardly be stopped.“
This is indeed a toning down compared to last year’s speech by then-President Christian Wulff who claimed that “THE climate scientists“ and even “THE climate research“ left “no doubt“ of an imminent huge warming.
Miersch writes:
Now its only ‘leading climate scientists’ who are ‘warning”. A diplomatic retreat from an all-party dogma.”
Let’s hope.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Gergis Australian Hockey Stick folly has been dominating climate science news. Won’t they ever learn?

New hockey stick, but with the same problems.
Geologist Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt comment on the story. I’ve translated their comment in English to give readers an idea of what the German skeptic viewpoint is. Parts have been edited for brevity.
=========================================
Controversy surrounds new Australian Hockey Stick: authors withdraw paper
Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Most of you know about the Hockey Stick saga. Late in the 1990s Michael Mann in his doctorate thesis flattened the pre-industrial temperature history by using a “suitable statistical process” along with faulty data so that the warming occurring since the end of the Little Ice Age could be shown as an unprecedented event (see The Hockey Stick Illusion by Andrew Montford). Today this Hockey Stick curve is deemed as refuted. Even Michael Mann’s team bit their lips and corrected it in 2008. Suddenly the Medieval Warm Period and ther Little Ice Age reappeared.
Even so, it seems some IPCC scientists just can’t to break their addiction to the good ol Hockey Stick days. They’d like nothing more than to turn back time. With this in mind, one can surely understand the short-lived euphoria that swept over IPCC fanclub website “Real Climate”.
Real Climate erupted in jubilation when the new Australian hockey stick by Gergis et al appeared. In the new reconstruction they had found their long lost son. The warming of the last 100 years was once again something special, and not because of natural cycles.
The Australian authors interpreted their new curve as evidence of an unusual warming in the late 20th century. Once again this impressed the IPCC so much that the paper was promptly integrated into the recently drafted AR5. The draft boasted of “completely new datasets” that made up the reconstructions.

However, hockey stick sleuth and statistics ace Steve McIntyre (prompted by a tip  from Jean S) could not resist the temptation of taking a good look at the curve. Here he found unexpected things (see his report at Climate Audit).
Firstly the “new” datasets turned out not to be as new as claimed in the AR5 draft. Moreover, the data had been used in the report from 5 years earlier.
In addition, Joelle Gergis and her colleagues committed capital methodological and calculation errors, as McIntyre together with Jean S were able to show. McIntyre began to correpsond with Gergis by e-mail, but instead of thanking McIntyre for the important information, Gergis curtly wrote back saying she wanted no further E-mail contact. Also Gergis refused to provide further data for the purpose of checking.
That’s a strange communication strategy in such as scientific crisis situation – batten down the hatches and close your eyes. Also Gergis’s website appeared to go offline. Andrew Montford then reported that Joelle Gergis is apparently an active member of the environmental movement. Her blog related to this also suddenly disappeared. But the Internet has a memory and a copy of the blog can be found at at webcitation.org.
By mixing activism and science, Joelle Gergis has apparently lost all critical distance research results, which invariably leads to such errors. A science open to results is impossible with that attitude. This is not only true for Gergis. Inconvenient results are suppressed, interpretations constantly distorted in one direction, and alternatives are ignored or swept aside. Gergis’s refusal to admit to errors and to have a fruitful dialogue with opposing views can only be explained by her ideological fixation.
Luckily a co-author of the Australian paper jumped in and controlled the damage. David Karoly wrote McIntyre an Email, thanked McIntyre for the information and confirmed that there had been large errors which the team will look into. The published paper was withdrawn. At the Journal of Climate site, the paper is no longer available:

 
In summary, the comeback attempt of the Hockey Stick turned into a complete folly. The IPCC are certainly the ones who will be the most annoyed by the incident, as the already integrated paper will have to be removed from the 5AR draft. According to a press release press releaseg about the paper put out by the University of Melbourne dated 17 May 2012, it is clear that the it had been written especially for the IPCC 5th assessment report. Does the blunder indicate that peer-reviewers of many journals are simply too uncritical when it comes to works by authors close to the IPCC?
How could peer-reviewers have missed it? Similarly slipshod was the work of Notz & Marotzke (2012) (see our blog article ”Hamburger Max-Planck-Institut uses dubious data on Arctic sea ice“). It is absolutely mind-boggling how such papers are able to survive the peer-review process. The grievances are obvious already at first glance.
At Realclimate blog the team has shifted its focus over to determining who actually first discovered the error in the Australian paper. The last thing they want is to do is to concede the victory to McIntyre.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, challenging a dogma takes real courage and character. There’s the real risk of being ridiculed, marginalized – even criminalized.

Fritz Vahrenholt thinks it is going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’
And history has often shown that sometimes you even have to wait way beyond your death before society wakes up and appreciates that you had been right all along.
Yesterday I wrote about Dr. Hans Labohm‘s report, soon to appear in E&E. In it he describes the growing sceptic movement in Europe and how it is succeeding in forcing a very much unwanted debate on the cause of today’s climate change. It’s a debate that unfortunately governments, academia and media would very much prefer to skip altogether.
Labohm mentions how in Germany Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, a leading environmentalist, began challenging the AGW theory. Prof. Vahrenholt could have taken the easy path, stuck to the popular and morally accepted AGW narrative, and kept his good standing among his many prominent peers.
However, he saw that something was amiss, that the theory was flawed and ridiculously simplistic – he couldn’t in good conscience just stand in silence. So he challenged the “consensus” by co-authoring together with geologist Sebastian Lüning a best-selling skeptic book that took Germany by storm earlier this year. This year you can be sure Prof. Vahrenholt will be getting far fewer Christmas cards.
Thankfully, some elements of the mainstream media have remained open to Vahrenholt‘s views and have given him a voice. One of these is flagship daily Die Welt, which conducted an interview with the free-thinking environmentalist professor.
On the IPCC, Vahrenholt thinks that the UN organization “has committed a huge blunder” by blaming the recent warming on CO2. “This demonization is too one-dimensional, it’s even banal. When it comes to the world’s fossil supply, he says we are still a long way from reaching its peak.
In the interview Vahrenholt believes that Germany “went completely overboard and got over-excited” with its move to renewable energy. Vahrenholt says:



<!--

We are conducting a fear-driven energy policy.”
Germany’s drive to renewable energy is not only driven by fear and a lack of science, but also because in Germany “we want to be good. But in truth we are self-destructive.”
What could be the consequences of Germany’s hasty and misguided rush into renewable energy? Vahrenholt tells Die Welt:
Indeed I fear that with the energy feed-in tariffs we are on a path to putting huge burdens on people, especially the poorest among us, and that we are driving out energy-intensive industries out of the country. Even worse, Germany is losing its attraction as a place to generate electricity.”
In the interview Vahrenholt reveals his commitment to protecting wildlife, and explains how Germany’s “green” biofuel policy has actually caused great harm to biodiversity, as thousands of hectares of land have been covered by corn monoculture. Windmills are now claiming hundreds of acres of forests and endangering birds and other animals.
One coal-fired or one nuclear power plant needs about 1 sq. km. of area. To get the same energy output, wind energy needs 1000 sq. km, an area that is 3 times bigger than all of Hamburg.”
When it comes to the heated global climate change debate and how long it is going to take before Vahrenholt is vindicated:
Every morning I can look at spaceweather.com at how the sun is changing. It is doing exactly as we expected. But it is still going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’ […] For the time being, a bitter religious war is raging. But I’m taking it in stride because I know that those who maliciously came after me will soon be on the defensive. […] In the meantime my biggest worry is that too much could be destroyed by then. Like I said, I think we will recognize by 2020 at the latest, that climate gas CO2 had been completely over-rated.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday I present to you the latest wonderful example of tolerance and open-mindedness from fundamentalist warmist site klimabedwetter.de here in green nutsy Germany.
Nowadays it’s hard to tell what the alarmists are more petrified of: the global climate catastrophe or the skeptic invasion in Europe.  They are angry and panicked that the skeptics have succeeded in getting the public in Europe to question the dubious climate science.
It helps to recall that the klimaretter website is run by devout climate catastrophe alarmists who absolutely can’t live without the imminent threat of the end of the world. Don’t take my word for it, all you have to do is read their site. Of course, you may ask how anyone could possibly get so psychologically obsessed with and insistent about the end of the world? I’m afraid you’ll have to ask a psychiatrist that question.
You can be pretty sure that when December 21 passes many of the disappointed Mayan calender kooks are going to be hitching their wagons to the next best thing: the coming global climate catastrophe. But don’t try to tell them that it’s just another hoax. Good news on climate is like holy water to the devil.
I witnessed this first hand at a press conference when a klimabedwetter went into emotional seizures when Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning introduced their book Die kalte Sonne telling us that there wasn’t going to be a climate catastrophe after all. “Sorry – now go home and do something worthwhile for a living.” That good news was simply too much for the warmists in the audience to take.
So without further ado, here’s the latest spread-the-hate piece by klimabedwetter.de.  It’s about the drive-by journalism hit on skeptics by weekly Die Zeit:
The unscrupulous schemes used by certain circles of business and politics to manipulate public opinion on climate change and renewable energies are revealed by a report by Die Zeit: “The Climate Warriors”. It exposes the crusade of these ideologically blinded deniers in horrifying detail. It is really shocking how professional PR strategists, with the help of lots of money and self-anointed climate experts, are hounding renowned scientists. It is of great worry that these well-paid ‘experts’ have in the meantime gotten gotten attention in Europen. Their crude claims have not only been picked up by the major dailies and talk shows, but also by the German parliament.

It is essential for us all to take a stand against these demagogues and to publicly denounce their unscrupulous schemes.
Die Zeit performed an exemplary service here. I really would like to see more of such detailed researched articles.”
What does this tell us about the warmists in Germany? Gandhi says it the best in a nutshell: First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.
The skeptics in Europe have made it to step 3 in almost record time. I suspect step 4 will the accomplished even more quickly.
And, appropriately, here are Ghandi’s seven sins: 
Wealth without work. Pleasure without conscience. Knowledge without character. Commerce without morality. Science without humility. Worship without sacrifice. Politics without principle.
Sin has always led to downfall. It won’t be any different this time.

Some commenters on my previous articles using MODTRAN, here and here, have called into question the validity of using it to investigate the physics behind the CAGW theory. Of course in the 24 year history of MODTRAN, the US Air Force and many other organizations, including climate scientists, have validated the software for their own purposes. The best way to prove that it is valid for the purposes of my articles, is to show comparable spectra from other sources. One commenter claimed the humidity settings were not interpreted correctly. The interface labels do not appear the same in the version used as in his example. His advice was attempted, and the software would not run a fractional entry. The examples below illustrate that my interpretation is correct.
Infrared astronomers are quite familiar with the problem of atmospheric IR. IR astronomy is not easily done on the earth’s surface because the lower atmosphere is nearly opaque to IR. Consequently IR astronomy is done at high altitudes or at very dry locations, or both. The Atacama Desert in Chile, the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the south pole, airborne observatories, or satellites are the favored locations.
The web was searched for any image of the back radiation spectrum. None were found for any temperate or tropical zone. The only spectra found are from the Arctic at -10°C, and the south pole at -30°C. From the spectral shape, it appears that the Arctic data was taken at Summit Camp on the Greenland ice sheet. Those are the next figures with the MODTRAN version for comparison.

Figure 2a and b. The 2a is from Petty (2006), found at skepticalscience here. 2b is from MODTRAN. The scaling is slightly different, the resolution is not as high, the shape is very nearly the same.

Figure 3a and b. Figure 3a from South Pole station here. Figure 3b is from MODTRAN. At sea level, with a clear sky, temperature at 15°C, 50% humidity, and 400 ppm CO2, the spectrum of downward IR, the “back” radiation, looks like this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMake no mistake about it – they’re coming for it – the world’s private pension money. The greens used to tell us that green energy could be profitable and would not burden our economy – in fact they even claimed it would lead to an economic boom and prosperity.
But now that the first building blocks of the green energy grid are in place, they too realize this is going to cost a lot of money – HUGE MONEY! Reports say it’s going to cost $1 trillion dollars a year for the rest of the century. Where should this kind of money come from?
Prof. Hans Joachim Schellhnhuber, Director of the ultra-climate-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Chairman of the anti-democratic WBGU (German Advisory Council on Global Change) has the answer: Raid the global private pension and retirement funds…and steal the money we worked our entire lives for.
WBGU BLUEPRINT TO THE GREAT PRIVATE PENSION HEIST HERE
And let’s not kid ourselves about who is going to make out on this. The leftist online DIE ZEIT daily here reports:
In the fight against global warming, the top environmental advisers of the German government, according to information from Die Zeit, want to tap a new source of funding – the private pensions of savers.”
Some thieving bastards will stop at nothing, won’t they? Now governments are using science to legitimize the widescale plunder of private pension funds. “Sorry people, but we have to steal your savings to save the planet.”
Globally, there’s lots of hard-earned “private” money tucked away for the retirement years of many citizens. But the greens are now thinking: “You didn’t save that.” They’re salivating over it, scheming to get there sticky, grubby hands on it. Die Zeit writes:

Insurances and pension funds alone have 50,000 trillion dollars at their disposal, which has to be securely invested over the long-term, says an expert report of the scientific advisory council of the German government for global environmental issues (WBGU). This capital could be mobilized for the Energiewende (energy transformation), like for revamping the power grid.”
The WBGU just released that “expert” report on how the greatest heist of all-time is to be executed, and it will be submitted today to Germany’s Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier. For example on page 20 it states:

Despite the fact that private capital is, in principle, available, general willingness to invest in or finance the transformation of energy systems towards sustainability falls short of what is required.”

Now we know the sad state of green energy’s ability to compete or to be profitable. The energy only becomes viable (and that only over the midterm) if there’s a state-ordered mass-scale plunder of the world’s private retirement accounts. It cannot survive with anything less. This is unprecedented in scale when it comes to a lack of feasibility.
Personally, my wife and I, are looking at retirement in about 10 years. I’d say it would be wise to start making plans to take “our money” and running fast and far.
Finally, I don’t know where the “intellectual” Die Zeit or the WBGU got this “50,000 trillion” figure. That’s over 3000 times the US debt -or $7 million per person globally! That’s way out of the park and obviously wrong. It shows that lefties have no idea when it comes to scales of money.
The world needs Paul Ryan, fast!

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: reaction from Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke here (in German), who says this is a welcome but not surprising conclusion.
UPDATE 2: The names of two of the resigning scientists are known: Mr “Honest Broker” Hans von Storch and German Weather Service VP Paul Becker.
The print edition of Der Spiegel this week has a short article that tells us what every sober person in Germany already knows: coping with climate change here will not pose any difficult challenges.

Spiegel writes: German Academy of Sciences and Engineering calls off the climate catastrophe.
In fact we know this to be the case for the rest of the world, unless of course the climate veers into another ice age like situation. The above conclusion was reached by the German Academy of Sciences and Engineering (Acatech) in a study commissioned by the German Federal government. According to Acatech President Reinhard Hüttl:
No climate conditions are going to occur here that already do not exist on the globe elsewhere and that we cannot cope with.”
Worse for the climate alarmists, the report goes on to say that warming will even bring benefits along with it, such as longer growing seasons and reduced wintertime heating costs. Readers should note that typical Germans heat their homes about 8 months per year.

Now we know that for some people bedwetting is a tough habit to break, and so we hope this latest news will help put some of the less chronic among us on the path to recovery.
Concerning rising sea levels, the scientists say that this ought to be an important concern, but “the scientists reject horror scenarios”. The scientists add:
A climate-related mass migration to Germany appears improbable.”
Four alarmist scientists walk out in protest of the good news
People of normal psychological balance would of course be relieved to hear this good news. But in catastrophe-obsessed Germany, this is unfortunately not the norm, rather it’s the exception. A number of scientists, bent on spreading fear, are angered by this good-news conclusion. Spiegel writes:
There was a dispute about the reliability of climate prognoses. Because of the involvement of RWE Innogy supervisory board chairman Fritz Vahrenholt (Social Democrat Party), four scientists resigned from the Committee. The former Senator of Environment of Hamburg accused established climate science of exaggerating man’s share in causing climate change.”
Fritz Vahrenholt is a professor of chemistry and co-author of the controversial skeptic book Die kalte Sonne. The names of the four scientists who resigned are still not known. It’s tough when people no longer want to play along with the alarmist hoax.

Share this...FacebookTwitterState parliamentarian Wolfgang Greilich led an FDP delegation on a visit to the German Weather Service (DWD) in his home-state of Hesse.The German Weather Service said it’s time to get back to the facts and away from hysteria. Hat-tip: Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt.
Here’s the press release issued by the FDP Free Democratic Party:
=========================
Visit of the German Weather Service / Greilich: climate debate must be factual and conducted without horror scenarios
“It is of fundamental importance to understand which climate risks (mid-term and long-term) represent a possible danger for our state. It is the duty of politicians to be informed about the current facts concerning climate change so that the appropriate measures can be implemented to weaken the risks from natural catastrophes for the good of the public,“ explained Wolfgang Greilich, Chairman of the FDP faction of the state parliament in Hesse during a visit to the German Weather Service in Offenbach.
“We put a lot of value on drawing conclusions for measures against climate change by using facts instead of myths,“ René Rock, vice faction chairman and climate political spokesman of the state parliament in Hesse. Prof. Dr. Gerhard Adrian, President of the German Weather Service, extensively informed the FDP politicians during over the latest findings concerning weather and climate research during their visit. He reminded that it is necessary to return to the facts and emphasized the importance of scientifically addressing the highly complex issues surrounding weather and climate. The statistics of the German Weather Service show climate fluctuations and their impacts going far back into the last century. One of many examples is the blossom of apple trees, which is currently almost 14 days earlier. Deriving a climate catastrophe from this is, however, false,” said Prof. Dr. Adrian in a discussion with the FDP delegation. After all, strong fluctuations have been shown to always exist. It has been shown that there have always been warm periods with high CO2 concentrations. “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss,“ explained Dr. Becker.

Another point of discussion was the various methods of measurement that scientific meteorology employs. “Political circles using climate and weather storms to fan the fears of people are foolishly putting their own credibility at stake. An active climate and environmental protection is the task at hand. Necessary for this are valid facts and data for example like those collected and scientifically assessed by the German Weather Service,“ Greilich concluded.

==========================================
Getting getting back to the facts and away from hysteria is a good idea. But then they go on about “protecting the climate”, which is utter nonsense. How does one protect the temperature? The humidity? What does a psychiatrist do? Does he protect the behaviour of his patient? When someone talks about protecting the climate, then it’s a sure sign he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Dr. Becker then says, “Some arguments by climate skeptics are superficial and easy to dismiss.” Maybe some, but there are many that still need to be answered and we’ve been waiting a long time: 1) Storms are not increasing. 2) The 800-year CO2 lag behind temperature 3) 15 years without global warming. 4) Antarctic sea ice increasing in size. 5) Weather events following the cycles of the sun. 6) A host of questions on the failures of the climate models, just to name a few.
Overall, though, the direction of the visit was correct.

And so one really has to wonder about the sheer brilliance of Energy Secretary Chu’s latest idea – more electric cars for a country that can no longer provide its citizens with a steady supply of electricity.
I have a question for Secretary Chu: Even if electric cars were free, what purpose would they serve when your energy system cannot produce electricity for days and days? If people and emergency services had your electric cars, they would all be stranded by now with no means of getting around.
Secretary Chu, rather than calling for more electric cars, which very few people want, you need to focus on, well, energy. After all, you are the Energy Secretary, and not the Secretary of Golf Carts.
How about focusing on revamping the utterly dilapidated electricity grid, which has been allowed to go to hell over the years? The energy generation and distribution system has been so neglected that it can no longer withstand a summer storm or heat wave. What a joke.
It’s time for you to start focusing seriously on making the supply of electricity affordable and reliable. Why do you refuse to do that? As it now stands, Washington DC and surrounding area are looking like a banana republic.
It’s time to seriously invest in more coal, nuclear and gas power generation technology. These supplies are cheap and RELIABLE.
And only then can you start to think about electric cars.

The following report appeared at the “Die kalte Sonne” site a couple days back. It looks at two views of the IPCC from two renown scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK): Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and Ottmar Edenhofer. Here it is in English:
===========================
Do we still need the IPCC? Hans Schellnhuber thinks we don’t
By Sebastian Lüning / Fritz Vahrenholt
Ottmar Edenhofer thinks the IPCC is just fine. For him it is completely okay that climate scientists are closely linked to policymakers and that the boundaries between science and politics are completely blurred away. For Edenhofer, the IPCC is absolutely essential.
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a completely different opinion and expresses concrete criticism on the IPCC:
The IPCC has to rethink its reason for existence and possibly face serious consequences. The IPCC is a unique mixture of science and politics. For example, the global community of relevant scientists does not select the lead authors of the IPCC report. Rather this is ultimately done by the involved countries. In the end. it is not the lead authors who decide the wording of the summary report, rather it is the representatives of the governments. And it is only this summary that gets really considered by decision-makers worldwide. Therefore, politics crowds out the science. This is not because governments are malicious: They are (as a rule) not so,because it is purely their functional logic to assert short term national interests. […] Because the boundaries between politics and science are completely blurred in the structure of the IPCC, it makes itself unnecessarily vulnerable to attacks. As one possibility from many, why doesn’t the InterAcademy Council (IAC) select the lead authors, i.e. the alliance of national science academies? Up to now the cumbersome regional proportional representation in the composition of the team of authors, foremost the exaggerated demand for completeness concerning the content of the IPCC reports, has led to a watering down of scientific substance.”
In June 2012, Schellnhuber received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin. Die Welt wrote:
In 1991, Schellnhuber founded the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and has led it since 1993. He is also professor ot theoretical physics at the University of Potsdam. The Bavarian-born climate scientist was also honored for his political advising.”
===================================
In summary, Edenhofer loves the IPCC just the way it is, but Schellnhuber thinks that politics has ruined it. Schellnhuber of course advocates scientists having the say on how society should be shaped.

Hans von Storch: Policymakers and society must decide, not science
Interestingly, Hans von Storch here thinks science should just lay out the facts, but stay out of politics and let the political process decide what to do next. Scientists should not be deciding policy. What follows is what he said in a recent interview with klimaretter.de. (Klimaretter questions are in bold print, von Storch’s answers in italics):
Is adaptation more a question for science or for politics?
The entire climate issue is a political question. In the past in a false manner, it has been suggested by publcity-loving scientists that certain political decisions should follow certain scientific results. This misunderstanding produced an infinite amount of conflict surrounding scientific details […] The job of science is not to say what the solutions are supposed to look like – it must show which consequences the solution options would have. This assures that in a democratic process a solution is chosen that corresponds to the mix of values of society.
Politicians seem to think its okay to shirk their responsibilities: When it comes to unpopular measures, they say that science forces certain things.
Science was stupid to give in to this temptation and to make itself more important than what is deserves to be…
Science only stakes out the framework conditions. What follows from that and what concrete actions are to be taken must be weighed by society based on its preferences and values.”
I agree with von Storch. Edenhofer is clearly disconnected from reality if he thinks the IPCC is fine the way it is. Schellnhuber thinking the scientific community has to run the show to me is appalling.
Whatever you may think, it’s clear there’s no consensus among the warmists.

The Climate Team has always claimed that a doubling of CO2 would add 3.7 Watts/m2 to the global climate budget and thus this would fry us all. This fate is their religion’s version of Hell, except we will all suffer this rather than just the “sinners,” thus giving them leverage to force us to do their will. Many bloggers, and some others, notably even BEST, have pointed out that there are many locations that are cooling rather than warming. The warmists would have us believe that these cooling stations are just due to local phenomenon, such as albedo change, land use, site moves, or other changes, and that the warming stations are not due to UHI.
Last year, Willis Eschenbach took a look at Modtran. Modtran is a program that was initially developed by the US Air Force in the late 1980’s that does a line-by-line analysis of the IR spectrum transmitted by the atmosphere. An on-line version is available at the University of Chicago, here. Willis noted that none of the latitude selections would give a CO2 doubling figure higher than 3.2 Watts/m2. He didn’t notice that the default settings in the program include a setting for water vapor at a pressure setting of 1. Any water vapor in the spectrum will lower the CO2 doubling figure.
Here is the result of calculating the outbound long-wave radiation (OLR) or as it is labeled in Modtran, I out. The settings used were: CH4 – 1.8 pmm, Tropical Ozone 800 ppb, Strat. Ozone 1, Ground T offset – 15°C, hold water vapor – Relative Humidity, Water Vapor Scale – at 0, 10, 50, and 90 percent, Locality – 1976 U. S. Standard Atmosphere, No Clouds or Rain, Sensor altitude 100 km, Looking Down. These values were the best available to represent a global average. This produced the following table and chart for various CO2 and water vapor values.
 
 Table 1 is TOA OLR for CO2 values from 0 to 1000 ppm and RH at 0, 10, 50, and 90%.
 
Figure 1 is a chart of Modtran output for 0, 10, 50, and 90% humidity, and CO2 from 0 to 1000 ppm. The radiation (vertical) scale has been inverted so that increasing greenhouse warming is upward. Note that both CO2 and water vapor forcing are logarithmic; increasing amounts have decreasing effect.

With humidity set to zero, the doubling of CO2 figure actually goes to 4.7 W/m2. Any reasonable humidity value drops that number drastically. At 50% humidity, and our current CO2 value, we get a tiny 0.188 W/m2, far, far below the IPCC favored value. Of course humidity doesn’t stay constant. In the tropics, 90% is more typical. In that case, doubling CO2 gets us 0.125 W/m2. This is all before the additional factors of clouds and rain, which will drop the value even further, into the negative territory that Willis noticed here. The blue triangle in the chart and the blue value in the table are the current values with today’s CO2 and global average humidity.
Given the data, Modtran can compute the real outbound radiation over time. The humidity at 600 mbars and the Mauna Loa CO2 values were applied through Modtran to result in Figure 2. This is a “zoom in” on the blue triangle in figure 1, adding the time dimension. The 600 mbar level for humidity seemed a good compromise, as only one humidity figure could be entered.

Figure 2 is a chart of the outbound radiation increase since 1948. There has been a more than 1 Watt/m2 increase in outbound radiation in that interval, despite rising CO2.
Humidity has been decreasing in the upper atmosphere over the last 60 years. That offsets the rising CO2. We saw the cooling in the 70’s but increased solar radiation along with ocean cycles held off the cooling over the last 20 years. That period has now come to an end.
Mother Earth has an excellent thermostat system. Even if somehow average humidity should increase to 50% and CO2 goes to 1000 ppm, only about 2 Watts/m2 will be added. This is unlikely in the extreme, and would add a small fraction of a degree to warming. No one would notice.
My question is: Why have the professional “climatologists” not done the simple work that I did on a lazy Saturday afternoon with my laptop? They must know that water vapor nearly wipes out CO2 in warming the Earth, and that clouds and albedo do the rest. What’s their excuse for this massive “oversight”?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Dutch province of North Holland has realised that windparks are a complete and useless eyesore that blight the landscape, and they save very little CO2. Therefore, the province has decided to forbid their construction. Hat-tip Science Skeptical here.
The North Holland region would seem to be ideally situated to take advantage of the windy North Sea. Indeed it would be difficult to find a more suitable spot for windmills. So if windparks there don’t make sense, what does that tells us about other places? Read here (in Dutch).
As a result, 20 planned windparks have been recently forbidden. Only a single planned token windpark in the Wieringermeer may be built.
The senselessness of the wild construction of weather-dependent windparks is revealed by a Dutch study here. Science Skeptical writes that experts “found out that the real fuel savings, and thus the reduction in CO2 output, is a whole 1.6% of the windpark’s rated capacity.”
Adding it all up, one must conclude that under the present conditions in the Netherlands a 100 MW (Megawatt) ‘name plate’ capacity wind development produces on average 23 MW because of the capacity factor. 4,6 MW (20%) of this has to be subtracted from the final net result because of initial energy investments. From the actual Statline production figures we know that 27% of this 23 MW = 6,17 MW represents the actual fossil fuel and CO2 savings. But from this figure we need to subtract the amount of energy invested in the construction works: 4,6 MW. The net total of fuel saving electricity provided by our wind turbines therefore is 6.17 – 4.6 = 1.57 MW on average over the year. That is ~ 1.6% of the installed capacity. It makes wind developments a mega money pit with virtually no merit in terms of the intended goal of CO2 emission reduction or fossil fuel saving.
This conclusion needs to be made known to anyone thinking about installing a windpark.
Are you listening, Renewables Guy?

Heavy snows have also hit China, hitting Peking with full force, according to German online Bild daily, which writes:
Snow Alarm in China! The capital Peking has been paralyzed by a winterstorm. […] The situation is worse in the countryside regions of North China. In the Yanqing region 47 cm of snow fell in just a few hours, entire villages have been cut off, thousands are without power and heat. […] A group of Japanese tourists got caught in drifting snow while on the Great Wall; three women froze to death.”
Winter also paid an early visit last weekend in England, reports the Daily Mail, with snow falling in the South and West Country, including in Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire and Devon. The Mail writes that “the snowfall was England’s fifth in nine days  amid an early winter”. and that “temperatures plunged to -5.6C last night at Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, with -4.3C Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, and -0.9C at Brize. The Weather Service says temperatures are up to 5°C below normal.
Snow was also reported in Gloucestershire and Dorset, with “up to six inches in Somerset in Bath, Frome, Midsomer Norton and the Mendip Hills” The Mail quotes. Charlie Powell, forecaster at the Met Office:

It has been incredibly cold recently and the snow was caused by an area of low pressure coming in from the North West.”
And adds:
More snow is due on higher ground in the North by Friday, with mainly below-average temperatures expected for the whole of November.”
Britain’s early winter is being enhanced by a mid-Atlantic high pressure preventing mild south-westerly winds from reaching Britain, and is pumping in Arctic air from Greenland. 
So much for snow being a thing of the past at the middle latitudes. Indeed winter is making early appearances not only locally, but globally.  Odd signs of warming, wouldn’t you say?

Meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Photo source: Weatherbell
Contrary to what a few crackpot physicists tell us, it’s not because of a relatively small 2 million sq km area of less ice in September, but because of gigantic areas in the tropical Pacific.
At the 2:10 mark Joe tells us:
What goes on in the tropical Pacific is huge. It’s absolutely huge – you have to understand that. In fact it’s huge as to control the entire climate of the globe, which is why you hear me with the type of attitude I have on that because of the flip of the Pacific to a colder mode.”
Later in the video at the 5-minute mark his attention is directed at Europe:
“Look at this! This is just hard to believe. I just want too, again, people get a little nervous when I start talking about the climate aspect of this, but this is how the Little Ice Age began. In Europe there was an attack of one cold winter after another. This is the fourth one in a row that severe to record-breaking cold has entered Europe.”
Clearly ocean cycles do play a major role on climate, as Joe shows. But it’s not only Europe’s weather that is beginning to resemble the Little Ice Age. Also the sun is beginning to look like it did during the Little Ice Age.
Solar cycles as well bode very ill for the coming winters.
Frank Bosse has an article today at Die kalte Sonne.de/7191 on the current solar cycle. He writes as follows (translated and condensed):
Solar Cycle 24 is indeed the start of a deep solar slumber. Leif Svalgaard published a paper Svalgaard et al. 2005 already back in 2005 where he estimated sunspot activity would be a maximum of 70 for Cycle 24. David Hathaway of NASA and his colleagues on the other hand projected a powerful solar cycle, based of course on a new model. Lesson here: Don’t believe every model.
How has SC 24 progressed thus far?

The red line in the chart above shows the monthly sunspot value. The blue line shows the average of the previous cycles 1-24. The light, thin line depicts the entry into the Minimum of 1800 – 1833 ( SC5…SC7). In November 2012 the sun also was only able to reach half of the average value. All SSN values were corrected according to a new paper by  Svalgaard.
The following figure shows a comparison of the periods of activity and allows us to evaluate the accumulated monthly sunspot anomaly for each cycle:

Solar activity as measured by sunspot count today is the weakest we’ve seen since SC 7, which ended in October 1833. The question today is: Was the peak in November 2011 with a SSN=96.7 the high for the current cycle? Although the sun is capable of surprises, all observations indicate that SC 24 indeed reached its peak last year. There are a number of signs that tell us this: The poles of the sun’s magnetic field have switched, which is a strong indicator that the peak is behind us:

The weakness of SC 24 is also indicated by the strength of the solar winds, given by the Ap Index, and is depicted by the following chart:

Here we see that the maximum of the solar wind is always offset by 2-4 years after the sunspot maximum. In 2008 we saw a low point of the kind we haven’t seen since the space age began over 50 years ago. We are still stuck at low levels.
Let’s recall that there are a number of papers showing a strong correlation between low solar activity and harsh winters in Europe, e.g. Lockwood et al.
So what impact could the solar winds have on the planet? They could act as a modulator for cloud formation, which in turn has a massive impact on global temperature – Svensmark’s theory. The following chart depicts the galactic cosmic radiation measured by the Oulu <neutron Monitor, Finland:

It’s easy to see that this curve is the inverse of solar activity: the weaker the solar winds, the greater the cloud-seeding cosmic rays reaching the Earth’s atmosphere. In the current cycle, cosmic radiation is 5-15% stronger than the previous cycle.
So what do the experts say? Much points to a Grand Minimum. observation of the convection belt, solar corona and magnetic field strength of the solar sunspots allows us to derive that the sun could get a lot weaker. This last occurred during the Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715. Scientists Livingston and Penn were hardly given attention when they had observed in 2005 there had been a good linear falling tendency since 2000 with regards to magnetic field and sunspots.

 
If this development continues, then we will see hardly any activity during solar cycle 25, which is anticipated to begin in 2020. It could very well be that our quiet sun is a harbinger of what is to come in the years and decades ahead.
Models of the mainstream climate scientists say: It will not impact the climate on Earth more than 0.1 to 0.2°C. Such models may very well be wrong – much like the “solar model” in 2006 projected a powerful SC 24.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran German journalist Ulli Kulke at his website writes about the Arctic ice melt: Never Say “Like Never Before“. German media have fallen all over themselves ringing the alarms over the “new record” – as if we have an Arctic Fukushima on our hands.

Thankfully, however, there are still a few sane journalists left among us. Kulke is among that very small group and reminds us: “Is the ice melt at the North Pole really unprecendented? There are indications that show otherwise.”
Kulke labels claims of Arctic ice melt reaching “unprecedented” levels “gross nonsense” and reminds us that “during changeovers between warm and cold periods there have been already completely ice-free Arctics on multiple occasions.”
Kulke also quotes Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) physicist Rüdiger Gerdes (in Bremerhaven, Germany) who says the high Arctic temperatures are not only because of man-made greenhouse gases, but also because of natural periodic fluctuations with a rhythm of 60 to 70 years. Kulke quotes Gerdes:
Right now we are in a warm phase.“

Kulke explains, citing NSIDC Director Mark Serreze, “…the summer of 2012 was not especially warm at the higher latitudes” and that the sea ice development was unusual this year. Kulke writes that in March 2012, sea ice area was greater than at any time in the last 5 years and ice melt proceeded normally during almost the entire melt season until early August when a huge storm caused the sea ice area curve to turn sharply downwards to a level never seen – in at least 30 years, that is.
Kulke tells his readers that there’s a lot more to the Arctic than just temperature. Over the years scientists are finding out that it is a lot more complex and involves ocean currents, drifting, precipitation, freezing and thawing cycles. he adds:
That’s why serious scientists refrain from making statements such as ‘like never before’ when discussing the ice situation in the Arctic. Statements about the Arctic during times before satellites are made only with great reservations. About 50 to 70 years ago – a time when there was no systematic measurement and evaluation of temperature and sea ice area – we are finding a growing number of newspaper reports about dramatic disappearances of ice all around the North Pole, and could have been worse than today. The Franz-Josef-Land islands, which can be reached by boat only a few weeks a year, could be reached for 8 months in some years. Especially interesting, during one trip underneath the Arctic ice in the summer of 1958, the US submarine ‘Skate’ was able to emerge in open water 9 times – with one of those directly at the North Pole. At the end of the 1930s, Soviet scientists observed along the Arctic coast that it was 6°C warmer for an extended time than it was during the times of the Nansen ice drift  – somewhat warmer than today. The time period corresponds to the rhythm that AWI scientist Gerdes mentions.”
And Kulke cites Steven Goddard’s blog:
At the website www.real-science.com/arctic“ there’s an entire series of international newspaper article facsimiles from various years that document a number of profound Arctic climate fluctuaions earlier. The tenor of those articles, like today: The sea ice at the North Pole threatens to disappear”.
After a years-long spell where climate catastrophe alarmism had to go without without new record data, it can now enjoy a warm shower with Arctic sea ice. But on whether we are dealing with a record that goes way back, that is however very much in question.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving been born and raised in Vermont in the 1960s and 70s, I remember the state always being environmentally aware and active in the sense of clean water, clean air and beautiful landscapes. The drive behind this traditional environmentalism came from the natural beauty of the state’s rolling green hills, mountains, lakes, forests and rural charm. There was always a desire to protect and preserve.
I’m no photographer, but here are a couple of shots I took of Vermont awhile back.

Near Craftsbury, Morey Hill Rd. I own a one and a quarter acre lot about a mile away. 

The “climate rescuers” want to industrialize these areas. Town Hill Rd. Wolcott

View from the top of Mt. Mansfield, just under the clouds. 
 I remember many long walks along gravel roads like the ones pictured above when I was a boy.
In the 1970s environmentalist kooks started pouring into the state from places like New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut. With them they brought an extreme strain of environmentalism, and lots of connections to big business and financiers.
Before too long a mission of a much higher order took hold: the world climate had to be rescued, whatever it took. And the only way to protect Vermont’s way of life and icons like maple syrup, ski industry and fall foliage season (what Germans like calling “Indian Summer”), they told us, was to build huge industrial wind turbines on Vermont’s mountain tops. The slick environmentalists somehow managed to convince the citizens to enter this madness.
And politicians, always the first to be duped, took it in hook, line and sinker. Old US Senators like Jim Jeffords, Pat Leahy and Bernie The Kook Sanders, who years earlier had warned us that rain was threatening our mountains and forests, led the way and suddenly became huge proponents of mountain top wind power. Soon construction companies and power companies began cutting down forests and blasting mountain tops in order to make way for the 500-foot monster wind turbines. Vermont patted itself on the back, believing it had become a global leader, role model and hero in “climate protection”.
Ethan Allen rolled in his grave.

Today, now that some windparks have been erected on mountains tops just a couple miles from my hometown, Vermont residents are starting to wake up, and many are truly shocked by the ugly reality of industrial wind energy. Citizens are realizing the wool had been pulled over their eyes.
Website Energize Vermont here reports that Vermont state senators Joe Benning and Bob Hartwell have drafted a bill calling for a moratorium on wind energy in the green mountain state. It’s high time.
What follows is a video of the press conference by these senators presenting a powerful case:

At 6:47 Benning:
The problem ladies and gentlemen is our Public Service Board has gone from its original mission of trying to determine whether or not a public good can be sustained when electric power is available, it itself can be sustained, and is inexpensive. That was the original intent of the Public Service Board. That mission has morphed into ‘industrial wind is renewable, and therefore it is good. We must build it now. We must build as much of it as possible and we igonre this kind of environmental destruction and the social upheaval that comes with it’.”
Disappointingly, the senators still believe in all the climate change crap and they advocate other silly energy sources that wouldn’t fulfil the Public Service Board’s original intent. But progress is slow at times, and I suspect they’ll have to get burned by every type of worthless renewable energy before they do finally learn. I’m sure there are plenty of people who are already telling them that solar and biogas are crap, too. Do you think they are listening?
We’ll have to be patient.
No matter, note the loud applause when Benning points out that mountain mutilation “is not right”. A few years ago such a reaction would have been unimaginable. There’s thunderous applause throughout the press conference. The growing momentum is palpable.
It’s interesting to listen to the comments of the senators. I can’t believe that they had not been told about the problems with wind energy earlier.
I don’t know what the situation is like in WUWT’s Ric Werme’s state of New Hampshire, Vermont’s sister state.
Please feel free to Send e-mails of support to any Vermont leader Senators with links to interesting stories we’ve discussed here in Europe, like: http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8807761/wind-farms-vs-wildlife/  or http://www.ref.org.uk/press-releases/281-wearnandntearnhitsnwindnfarmnoutputnandneconomicnlifetime

Share this...FacebookTwitterRalf Alexander here of the New York Post has a blunt commentary on the state to which global warming science has devolved. In a single word: insanity. Climate science is beginning to look like a repeat of “The Lord of the Flies”.
===============================
Extreme weather & superstition
Superstorm Sandy. Parching drought across North America. A scorching midsummer heat wave in the Midwest. All these weather extremes are telltale signs that CO2 causes climate change, according to global warmists.
Indeed, the global climate-change nomenklatura gathered last week in Doha, Qatar eagerly (if grimly) cited Typhoon Bopha, which had just wreaked carnage in the Philippines, as the latest proof.
But it’s not. The link between extreme weather and global warming has as much scientific basis as the pagan rite of human sacrifice to ensure a good harvest.

Yes, the supposed connection between unusual weather events and global warming is often taken as self-evident.
It’s even been propounded in scientific papers — but not persuasively. A recent paper from Goddard Institute for Space Science chief James Hansen, for example, was quickly debunked by climate scientists on both sides of the…

Renewable energy boom leaves Germans in the dark.
It’s one way of reducing carbon emissions – just catapult your population back to the Stone Age. Online German flagship daily Die Welt has an article on how skyrocketing electricity prices are making electricity unaffordable for a large number of Germans.
Many people in Germany are no longer able to pay their electricity bills. And energy prices continue to climb – rapidly. The president of the VdK social association Ulrike Masche, accuses the German federal government “of having neglected the social dimension of the energy transformation”.
Over 10 years ago Germany enacted the Renewable Energy Feed-In Act (EEG) which requires power companies to pay small producers of renewable energy exorbitant rates for their green power. The power companies in turn simply pass the higher prices on to their customers. Electricity prices rose 10% in 2011 alone!
So far Germany has committed over 100 billion euros to renewable energy, all to be paid for by the consumer. Little wonder that today almost a seventh of Germany’s population is now living in “energy poverty”.
The high costs are hitting the poor and retirees especially hard. Die Welt writes:
Klaus Müller, Chairman of the Consumer Office in North Rhine Westphalia estimates: ‘Ten to fifteen percent of the population are struggling to finance the constantly rising energy costs.” Every year 600,000 households are getting their power cut off.’

‘Earlier energy poverty was a fringe problem. However in the meantime it has become an every day problem,’ said Müller.
According to a survey by the consumer protection group, 600,000 households per year are getting their power cut off because of unpaid electricity bills. Foremost the rapid expansion of renewable energies has led to a 10% rise in electricity prices.”
As utilities are forced to buy the exorbitantly expensive renewable energy, even when they don’t need it, they are forced to increase the prices they charge consumers.
Die Welt writes that the prices are expected to rise unabated and that they likely will even accelerate. The feed-in tariffs will add up to 5.2 cents to the price of each kilowatt-hour.
The greens, the architects of the energy feed-in act, deny they are responsible for the disaster, and blame Germany’s current conservative, liberal-democrat coalition government for the skyrocketing prices. The truth is that all the politicians zealously supported the feed-in tariffs, especially the conservative CDU led by Angela Merkel, who was duped and spurred on by crackpot scientists in Potsdam.
Some leading politicians are beginning to return to their senses, however, and are calling for more coal and gas power plants.
Well, they’d better hurry up. Otherwise expect the pubs and beerhalls to come alive with angry political talk – and soon.
Happy May Day everybody!

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Sebastian Lünning’s and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s climate website Die kalte Sonne, has a report on a paper on the Maunder Minimum  in the Journal The Holocene. What follows is a translation in English:

Study by Diodato and Bellocchi show that Little Ice Age was not restricted to North Atlantic region (Painting by Hendrick Barentsz)
The climate of the last 10,000 years has been everything except stable, and global mean temperatures fluctuated by more than 1°C. Today’s “Modern Warm Period” was preceded by the Little Ice Age (LIA), which lasted from 1300 to 1850.
The high point of the Little Ice Age occurred during a period of weak solar activity from 1645-1715, called the Maunder Minimum. During this time, Central Europe turned bitter cold, glaciers grew and the Thames River even froze over in the wintertime. During the cold winter of 1683/1684, the ground froze more than a meter deep in Southern England.
The Little Ice Age is widely known for the North Atlantic region of Northern Europe, and for this reason some scientists falsely assumed that it had been a regional phenomenon and it was balanced out by other areas on the planet being warmer. However, this hypothesis has not been confirmed as a growing body of scientific literature shows that all continents were hit by the LIA.

In the Mediterranean region there have been no reliable temperature reconstructions from during this period. The existing tree-ring temperature reconstructions for the last 500 years have been regarded as riddled with problems as tree rings in some cases in the Alps and upper northern latitudes are turning out to be an unsuitable method for climate reconstructions.
An Italian team of scientists led by Nazzareno Diodato and Gianni Bellocchi of the Met European Research Observatory has analyzed historical climate records from the Mediterranean region of Italy to see how temperatures developed in southern Europe during the Little Ice Age. In their study they reconstructed the temperatures for the winter months December-February . The Moio and Susanna Manuscript as well as the Corradi-Annals made up the core of their study. The chronicles of Giovanni Battista Moio and Gregorio Susanna contained a list of extreme weather events and famine in the region of Calabria. The Corradi-Annals consist of a collection of reports on climate extremes and their impacts on the environment from 5 AD to 1850. In addition the researchers used other data sources such as a catalogue of the Italian Agency for New technologies on environmental events. Indices were calculated based on historical information and were converted into temperatures.
In their study, the Italian scientists discovered that the winters in the Mediterranean area of study were several degrees colder than what had been earlier assumed by coarser simulations for Europe. The scientists were able to show that the known cold phase of the Maunder Minimums was also prevalent in the Mediterranean region.
Extreme cold with snow occurred in 16 of 25 winters between 1675 and 1700. Especially the years 1665, 1677, 1684, 1687 and 1692 temperatures fell sharply and rivers on the Italian peninsula froze. From 1682 to 1707 a number of flooding catastrophes occurred in Northern Italy. Extremely cold winters struck between 1684 and 1694 and an especially cold winter in 1709. The Venetian Lagoon froze over in 1684 and 1709. The lowest temperature was measured in 1684. In Sicily a series of catastrophic harvests hit in the 1690s. For the cold of the 1683/1684 winter, a statistical period of repetition of 1000 years was calculated.
The study’s authors say that the cold at the peak of the Little Ice Age was mainly due to the low solar activity of the Maunder Minimum. However they do point out that there was large regional variability for climate development during this phase of solar inactivity in the Mediterranean region due to below average atmospheric air pressure. An important atmospheric element during this period was a high pressure zone over Northern Europe while low pressure dominated the Central Mediterranean region. This resulted in protracted weather blocking in the winter and associated cold snaps striking Central and Southern Europe.
The study impressively shows that the Little Ice Age was much more than an event restricted to the North Atlantic region. The Holocene.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough this is a climate and energy blog, I’ve decided to meander off into pure politics this one time. It’s a slow day.
In 2009 I asked a friend of mine, who I’ll call Norm, to predict where we would be under Obama’s leadership by 2012. Norm is a flaming liberal and ultra-Obama fan. Needless to say Norm thought Obama was going to heal the planet and deliver the world’s population to socialist prosperity. Below are three predictions he made in April 2009, with reality in brackets. Do you see the difference?
– Unemployment rate 4.5% [8.3%]
– Federal deficit: balanced [about -1.5 trillion$]
– Price for a gallon of gas: $4.50  [$3.82]
Now you’d think Norm would be disappointed with Obama’s performance and change his vote this time around. Even gasoline was nowhere near as expensive as he had hoped. But he won’t. Some people live their lives denying reality. The excuse of course is that Obama had inherited a problem that was much greater than any of us could have imagined, but he’ll surely fix it in the next 4 years, if given the chance. No matter what the stats say, we are better off today, they insist.
On Facebook someone posted the following table. Are we really better off today?

If these numbers aren’t enough to convince all the Norms out there, then nothing will. Some people are unable to cope with reality.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) provides a statement on the senselessness of renewable energy in Germany and features a video by skeptic EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul (Germany).
EU Parliamentarian Herbert Reul of Germany’s conservative CDU Party has produced a video about energy policy in Germany and put it up at Youtube and the Internet. His primary message: The isolated energy policy of the German government will cost Germans €2.3 trillion €. In numbers that’s €2,300,000,000,000. And for what? To brake a computer-simulated increase in global temperature a whole 0.003 °C. It is claimed that it serves to ‘protect the climate’.
That some German Parliamentarians are finally beginning to address the failed and destructive German energy policy is very welcome. However, they’re are few in number. We suppose that there is a lack of courage and knowledge among them to articulate themselves to the mainstream ideologues of the eco-industrial complex. Perhaps a video is the right approach to take for now.
As European Parliamentarian Holger Krahmer reported at the Climate Conference of the Free Democrat Party (FDP) of Saxony on 30 June 2012, the European Parliament recently took up the the proposals of the Commission and ratified the so-called Energy Efficiency Directivese (also see here). In it there’s very little about energy efficiency, but much more about rationing energy. The directives obligate member countries to make sure that energy providers sell their customers 1.5% less energy every year. Thus energy shall be – with no need to do so – rationed.
That’s a scandal of the first order and a socialistic assault on the free market economy that will have far-reaching repercussions. Even “if all of Germany switched off all its power overnight, hardly anyone would notice globally,“ said Krahmer. And Professor Bodo Sturm of the HTWK Leipzig confirmed in his presentation at this conference: ‘Germany’s total share of global emissions of greenhouse gases is less than 3%. That alone shows how senseless many mini-actions for reducing CO2 are in Germany, for example the symbolic turning off of lights for one hour.'”

====================================================
And here’s the video of Parliamentarian Herbert Reul:

The main points:
0:25: Energy policy in Germany is driven solely by climate – cost has been thrown overboard.

0.50: Go-it-alone policy would be irresponsible. A large consulting company concluded: “Going-it-alone will cost Germany €2,300,000,000,000.00 (2.3 trillion euros).
1.30: Wind energy costs an enormous sum of money and its supply is unreliable. The massive infrastructure for delivering it to markets just isn’t there.
2.20: Just the solar systems installed through 2010 are going to cost Germans 80 – 100 billion euros.
3.00: Renewable energies need generation systems, transmission infrastructure and back-up systems. It’s going to be extremely expensive, so expensive that a significant part of the citizenry is not going to be able to afford it and industry is going to leave.
4.00: It’s going to cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. People claim that renewable energies will create 300,000 jobs, but it’s also going to cost billions and over a million traditional jobs.
4.50: Renewable energies are a major assault on the environment and wildlife.
5.20: The supply of fossil fuels is vastly larger than what we once believed. Coal for 300 years…America shale gas is revolutionizing the energy market. Spreading fear that energy is running out is pure nonsense.
6.00: The solution is a mix of energy sources. Energy politics must be honest and informed.
Unfortunately Herbert Reul is only one of very few within the German conservative CDU party. But he at least represents a start.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA sudden blast of cold polar air accompanied by heavy precipitation led to heavy snowfall in the Alps at levels below 1600 meters. Read here (in German).

Snow falls in August under 1600 meters elevation in southern Germany.
Up to 35 cm of snow fell at some locations. Wetter.24 reports:
Low pressure system “Christine” delivered heavy rains in southern Germany and even the first snow in the Alps. Some passes in the Alps had to be closed. After steady snowfall, several Swiss Alp passes had to be closed for traffic on Friday evening. Streets around the Gotthard range were hit especially hard by the snowfall.”
Imagine the surprise of German vacationers returning from Italy over the Alps and being told to turn back because of snow in the summertime! Wetter.24 continues:
The snow line dropped from the northwest and then a cold polar air mass was fed down to the Alps region (see Figure 3).

Snow line at times at 1600 meters. On Friday it was already snowing at 2000 meters and during the past night the snow line dropped to 1600 meters, and even less at some localities, thus many peaks are now covered with a blanket of snow.
A total of 21 cm of snow fell on Säntis from Friday morning to Saturday morning. On the Zugspitze 45 cm was reported, of which 35 cm fell during the last 24 hours. The rest fell during the night of Thursday to Friday (see Fig. 4). In the figure it can be seen that especially the north side is hit by the first snowfall. It is however not unusual that winter shows up for the first time in the Alps at the end of August.”
Oh, now I get it: snowfalls and skiing are “rare and a thing of the past” only in the dead of winter. But snows in August, on the other hand, are completely normal?
Gee, climate science is making more and more sense with every passing day.
Finally, I was just sent the following chart depicting Germany’s summertime temperatures for the last 16 years.

Runaway warming? Looks like it ran away for good 10 years ago – and it’s not coming back. (Chart from Josef Kowatsch).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThank you Sweden for not acting like duped, non-thinking zombies, blindly marching behind activists who claim to be cool, educated and hip. Thank you for exercising critical and open thinking.
Sweden’s English language The Local  has a report titled: Swedish politicos ‘don’t buy climate change’. What on Earth happened to politically correct Sweden? Are they getting tired of enduring bitter, long winters and have they given up hope on the warmer times that were once promised? The Local starts with:
Six of ten local politicians in Sweden doubt whether human activity is to blame for global warming, a new study has found.
In addition, one out of ten municipal politicians and local government managers totally deny that the phenomenon of global warming even exists, according to a survey carried out by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (Försvarets forskningsinstitutet – FOI).
‘This is clearly not good. These people feel like they don’t have to take responsibility for environmental work in their municipalities,’ FOI’s head of climate and energy research, Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper.
The findings come from a survey carried out by FOI looking into how local decision-makers in Sweden view the issue of climate change.”
Continue reading here.
Don’t expect the rest of the western media to even mention a peep about this survey, which completely embarrasses climate science. Note how they make belief in climate change sound like a part of our “environmental responsibility”.
But what about our responsibility to truth and reality? Oh, I forgot. There’s now a Ministry for Truth and Science for that!

The Local goes on to quote the Defense Research Agency: “It’s a threat to national security” and that the results of the survey “took them by surprise”. Such is the life of those who live in climate-catastrophe fantasyland. Annika Carlsson-Kanyama, head of climate and energy research, says:
It makes me angry that there are groups that spread the idea that research on the climate can’t be trusted.
In essence, the survey indicates that 70 percent of Sweden’s local politicians don’t believe in the science.”
There goes Ms Carlsson-Kanyama’s obsession – up in smoke. The fact is that much of the science has long been revealed as a hoax – a fraud that never held water. I can see the Agency trying to load the survey questions to get the answers they want, and getting all frustrated. Next time they’ll be wiser and just make up the results. That’s what everyone else involved in the climate-catastrophe science does. But it’s the reason no one takes it seriously.
Now comes the funniest part. According to Carlsson-Kanyama, “climate change-doubters are often men from small, conservative-leaning municipalities, while it is often women from larger municipalities who are champions of the need to act to combat climate change.”
So there you have it.  They’ve given up on concensus and have moved on to claiming that the science of climate change is now endorsed by “hip people”.
Carlsson-Kanyama should know, however, that Sweden’s leading skeptic climate blog is operated by a cosmopolitan woman, Maggie Thauersköld Crusell, who, if I am not mistaken, lives in hip Stockholm. And what about Donna Laframboise in Toronto? Or Judith Curry at Georgia Tech? Jo Nova in Australia, to name a few?
Attempting to marginalize “doubters” as narrow-minded male hicks instead of presenting scientific arguments shows precisely why people no longer believe the climate bedwetters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German daily Die Welt here published a surprisingly anti-alarmist article written by Prof Wolfgang Behringer, a science historian at the University of Saarbrücken.
His conclusion: climate change and ice cap melting (and freezing) are nothing new and that man ought to be grateful it’s warmer, and not be hysterical about it.
Indeed this is the first time in human history where some among us are cursing the warmth. He writes: “The ice at the poles is supposedly melting faster than ever before – but that has occurred many times before. That it’s getting warmer on the planet is good news for man.” (Actually, it hasn’t warmed in over 10 years, but we will go along with Behringer’s overall statement).
Behringer says that so many climate predictions have been shown to be wrong, e.g. more hurricanes because of warming, that climate scientists have adopted a new pattern of argumentation: “The prognosis was wrong, but we are still right.”
Behringer writes that all the horror stories about melting Arctic every August are convenient for journalists for filling in the slow news cycle that is typical during vacation month of August. Warm periods are hardly foreign to the planet. Behringer reminds us: “In the nomenclature of geology, a ‘warm period’ is defined by completely ice-free poles. According to this terminology, we’ve been living in an ice age for a few million years now.”

The warm period of the Holocene over the last 10,000 years (70% of which has been warmer than it is today) has been a blessing for mankind, facilitating the development of agriculture. Behringer cites numerous examples and reminds us that life during the Little Ice Age, let alone the ice age itself, is not anything we would want to go back to.
Behringer then says that the role of the Arctic is minor:

The entire Arctic plays hardly a role. 90 percent of the ice and 70 percent of the world’s fresh water are stockpiled in the Antarctic ice sheet, and it is disputed on whether or not it is growing. At 82.5°C below zero at the top of Antarctic, the risk of melting would appear to be relatively small for even the laymen among us.
As long as it keeps getting warmer, it’s good news. When the Holocene comes to an end, as it was once believed in the 1960s after a few cold years, then we could really be in for the blues. […] With all the consensus on global warming, we are obviously treading on thin ice when it comes to its interpretation.”

Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Behringer teaches at the University of Saarbrücken and is the author of A Cultural History of Climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp has written an essay on the false alarmism surrounding a warming Antarctica. What follows is the English version:
============================================
Every Year The Same Story – Ice Melt in Antarctica
By Rudolf Kipp
The topic of this article ought to handled in short order. When you take a look at the data from Antarctica, it is plainly visible that the ice around the 7th continent has been more or less growing since satellite measurements began in 1979.

No sign of melting here.
However, you’d never know it from the news we get from this corner of the planet. After all, any report about steadily growing ice simply doesn’t fit the narrative of the growing threat of global warming and the related melting ice caps.
Indeed the media never send us reports about the continent as a whole. Rather, they prefer to focus on what is happening on a very small area at the fringes of the South Pole, a northern area of about 0.5 million square km², which represents about 4% of the entire Antarctic surface.

For climate science and our media, the Antarctic Peninsula is of decisive importance, as ultimately it is the only place at the entire South Pole where “something is happening”. This region has huge ice sheets, which float on the sea and are mostly connected to the ice on land. Common for these ice sheets is that their tips break off time and again in a natural process known as calving.
And it just happens that the ice sheets on the West Antarctic Peninsula are everything but static. Since the dynamics of these ice fields have been measured by satellites with increasing precision, it has been observed that these sheets break up and get released into the sea as huge icebergs.
According to prevailing dogma, all this can only be blamed on the human impact on climate. Thus year after year we’ve been receiving reports about the imminent collapse of the Antarctic ice sheets. Here are just a few from the German press: 2002, 2003,  2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.
This tradition of yearly alarms continues this year as well, this time from the European Space Agency (ESA), which appears in a report at Spiegel. The evaluation of satellite photos over the last 10 years shows that the Larsen-B-Ice Shelf has lost three quarters of its area. According to ESA, the blame for this is (man-made) global warming. After all, northern West Antarctica has warmed 2.5°C over the last 50 years.

So with such claims, it is truly worth taking a look at the measurement stations in this region. Let’s take a look at the results from measurements taken at the Larsen Ice Shelf. We see immediately that the trend is relatively constant, if not slightly downward, since measurements began in 1985.

Temperature development Larsen Ice Shelf (NASA GISS)
However, the measurements at the Larsen Ice Shelf go back only to 1985, and the ESA press release expressly states a temperature development going back 50 years. So let’s look at the next stations closest to the Larsen Ice Shelf with sufficiently long measurement histories. They are (see charts below) Faraday (since 1944), Rothera Point (since 1946), Bernado O’Higgins (since 1963), Base Esperanz (since 1945) and Base Arturo P (since 1966).
All these stations have one thing in common: A “warming of 2.5°C over the last 50 years” is nowhere to be found. And any warming that did occur, did so without exception before 1980. Taking this into account, attributing the break-up of the Larsen Ice Shelf to global warming is already quite adventurous, to put it mildly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJuliet Eilperin sees the “climate change” issue slipping away. It is no longer the number one environmental concern among Americans. When climate change is ranked among all problems that concern Americans, most polls show it as a mere asterisk, or bundled in with “other” or “misc.”
Eilperin starts her commentary:
Just 18 percent of those polled name it as their top environmental concern. That compares with 33 percent who said so in 2007, amid publicity about a major U.N. climate report and Al Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary about global warming. Today, 29 percent identify water and air pollution as the world’s most pressing environmental issue.”
That means the number of people who view climate change as a problem has been almost cut in half in just 5 years. Now about 60% more people are concerned about water and air pollution in the world – that’s good!
Clearly education on the issue of climate is spreading. People are becoming aware that climate change is natural and that the globe has not warmed in 15 years.
Eilperin writes that “the findings indicate that Washington’s decision to shelve action on climate policy means that the issue has receded” and that some “who feel passionately about the issue say they have noticed that President Obama is no longer pushing a bill that would limit greenhouse gas emissions.”
Don’t expect any politicians to make climate change a central issue in this year’s elections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s early September, mornings are cooling down, days are getting shorter and the kids are back in school. What are fall and winter going to be like? The following National Weather Service chart shows the following:

Indications a cold winter lies ahead for Europe.
Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here also writes that two climate scientists, Hans Graf of the University of Cambridge and Davide Zanchettin of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, have developed a rule of thumb for predicting if it’s going to be cold or mild for the entire winter. How is this possible? Spiegel writes:
Graf and Zanchettin have discovered a weather kitchen that is mainly responsible for cooking up the winter for Central Europe. That kitchen is located on the other side of the planet in the Pacific the two climatologists report in a study in the “Journal of Geophysical Research”, which they submitted in the summer of 2011.”
They say it depends on the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which impacts weather globally.
According to Graf und Zanchettin: “After an El Niño over the Central Pacific, there’s a frosty winter in Europe – temperatures are on average 3 to 4°C lower than during other winters. Winters after El Niños are the coldest in Germany.”

Spiegel summarizes the rule of thumb the scientists use:
In Germany there’s a frosty, snowy winter when the following three conditions are fulfilled:
1.) For months there’s been an El Niño, meaning the ocean water surface is markedly warmer than usual.
2.) If the warm water spreads eastwards all the way to the coast of South America, then the chances for a cold winter in Central Europe drop off.
3.) There’s been no major volcano eruption – which would disrupt weather patterns.”
Leading climatologists Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel and Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Center for Coastal Research, both in Germany, found the study to be of great interest. So once again Mr. Co2 warming Latif agrees that other factors drive the climate. An alarmist one day, and a scientist the next.
We’ll find out soon enough if Graf’s and Zanchettin’s rule will work for this coming winter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen scientists drift away from research and involve themselves with religious groups in order to focus on the mission of reshaping society, then you’ve got to wonder. Was that the original idea of our tax money?
Today, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are claiming that the Green Economy has the potential of destroying the progress that has been made over the last 10 years, so writes alarmist site Klimaretter here. You read that right.
This does not mean the PIK has changed its mind. To the contrary, it simply views the current path to Green as being totally inadequate and that a much more radical one has to embarked on.
PIK chief economics scientist Ottmar Edenhofer has warned of failure for the upcoming Rio+20 conference, which is taking place in 2 weeks:
“We’ve got to start opposing the Green Economy.The Green Economy paradigm has the potential to destroy the progress of the last ten years. We’ve got to destroy the illusion that a few actions in energy efficiency and renewable energies at national levels will be enough to reduce the emissions to the necessary extent. We’ve got to oppose the ‘big proclamation’ of the Green Economy. What we need is a ‘big proclamation’ of Justice.”
For Edenhofer, the issue is not about climate change at all – it’s about social justice and redistribution. Edenhofer now demands:
The atmosphere must not be viewed as a free territory, but as a global common whose ownership and usage rights have to be negotiated. Distribution conflicts here are inevitable, and thus strong international agreements are needed.”
According to UNEP, global economic growth in the future must not be powered by fossil fuels fossil in order to stabilize the climate, protect the environment and to maintain species diversity.
But as Klimaretter writes, the opposite is now actually happening:
Indeed today we are experiencing a Renaissance in the use of fossil energies instead: The rising price of oil and gas has not only led to a Renaissance in coal, but is also making the tapping of unconventional oil and gas reserves lucrative. The international Energy Agency (IEA) is already celebrating the ‘Golden Age of gas supply’.”

So much for the shortage of energy we are always told about. The problem today is actually an oversupply of energy. Edenhofer criticizes:
Over the past years we have limited ourselves too much to the topics of energy efficiency and renewable energies. Here we have under-estimated the supply side of fossil energies.”
That energy surplus problem has to be dealt with. So Klimaretter chimes in:
With respect to the amounts of coal, oil and gas into consideration that are still in the ground, an effective restriction of their extraction is needed.”
For Edenhofer the whole climate issue gets down to one objective: justice. And to move to that target, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, an organisation that claims to be scientific, has taken an unusual step: working together with environmental NGOs and religious groups. Klimaretter reports that (my emphasis added):
…the PIK together with development aid organisation Misereor are asking that sustainability focus more on the questions of justice. Energy efficiency and renewable energies here are not enough. One thing is clear: If we are to take climate protection seriously, then the fossil fuel industry must lose.
To get the debate rolling, Edenhofer and his colleagues of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research have entered an unusual alliance. Over three years the scientists have been grappling with the relationship between climate change and development policy. To do this they brought NGO representatives on board – and also a partner of the Jesuit-founded Institute for Society Munich, Catholic development aid organisation Misereor and Munich Re reinsurer. The result of the cooperation: a book called “Climate Change, Justice, and Sustainability”. The book’s main message: The debate surrounding climate change must be carried out as a debate over global justice.”
The PIK charter has become religious. Edenhofer himself was  a member of the Jesuit Order from 1987 to 1994.
Obviously the PIK is not quite an organization of scientists, rather it is becoming one of religious zealots. What’s tomorrow? An alliance with jihad groups?
I don’t have anything against religious groups and faiths. But we do need to really worry when dogmatists start running institutes of science.

Low carb living. (Image source: http://www.psychicdonut.com/wp)
First they tell us we’re too fat and lazy, and that we need to be more active instead. But now that too turns out to be undesirable because according to a Max Planck Institute scientist, you end up breathing harder, thus emitting more CO2 and making the climate worse as a result. I kid you not!
The scientifically moronic Handelsblatt today here has the latest idiotic piece titled: Climate Killer From The Lungs. A reader asks the Düsseldorf-based financial daily how much CO2 a human emits. Every week the Handelsblatt answers such stupid questions as part of its Klima-Orakel – in an effort inform (lol) its readers on climate change.
To answer that question, the Handelsblatt consults Matthias Heil of the Max Planck Institute for heart and lung research, who says that fit, muscular people breath out more CO2 than unfit people do, and that things get really bad when we become physically active. According to Heil:

During rest, about 4 litres of air pass through the lungs per minute. But that jumps to over 50 litres during physical activity. Over an entire year it comes out to 2100 cubic meters of air, or 168 kg of CO2, when at rest and 25,500 cubic meters of air, or 2040 kg of CO2, when at constant physical activity.”
Of course nobody is physically active constantly over the course of a year (especially me). We could say say that each human breathes out roughly 1/4 ton of CO2 per year, and thus that adds up to a couple billion tons. Heil concludes (emphasis added):
The figures foremost show one thing: Individual lifestyle has an enormous impact on our CO2 emission. From that standpoint, a small non-athletic person who never moves and spends the whole day on the sofa has the optimum climate result.”
Boy, I feel a lot less guilty already. Damn! I’m really doing my part.
Are there any guys out there whose wives would believe this crap? “Sorry honey, but fixing up the house is gonna make me breathe harder and that’s bad for the climate.”
Sounds like a good way to get assaulted by the rolling pin.

And true to their tradition of if the news is inconvenient, then bury it, and if it’s really inconvenient, then ignore it altogether. This is what we are witnessing today. Under no circumstances is the German public to sense that Obama’s political Titanic has struck the dreaded iceberg. The election confirms the Tea Party is for real and is not going away; the political ground has shifted massively in USA and the Democrats are in huge trouble.
I listened to German NDR public radio this morning – not a peep about Walker’s landslide victory. Same goes for the online Die Welt, Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, FOCUS, TAZ, Bild, Süddeutsche, ARD, ZDF, and RTL.
I expect they’ll come out with something later today (It’s afternoon now), once they shrug off their stunned stupor and find a way to spin the story.
Flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), on the other hand, does have a story, half way down its site, titled: Erfolgreicher Stimmungstest für Romney (Successful test vote for Romney). The FAZ writes:
The outcome of the election was a national event, which is said to be of importance for the Presidential and Congressional elections on November 6. Scott Walker.”
And that is as far as the FAZ is going to take it.

Vermont disfigures, self-mutilates its scenic ridgelines and mountains for the sake of a blind obsession. Source: lowellmountainsnews.com/
It shows how public opinion on the issue of “green” energy is evolving in Vermont, and that (some) people are finally coming to their senses. Also read big-wind-moratorium/.
German readers will quickly see that Vermont is not leading the world in renewable energy, but is in fact now just a monkey imitating the failed energy policies we’ve already seen here in Europe and Germany. Vermont’s leaders are not visionaries; they have blindly hitched their wagon to a European train whose locomotive has already gone over the edge of a cliff. It’s time to unhitch.
=============================================
Fire On The Mountain
by Joe Benning
Recently I hiked up to the top of Lowell Ridge to see where twenty-one, four hundred foot wind towers will be placed. As I crested the mountain I came face to face with an energy policy that is at war with itself. The environmental destruction taking place there pits those seeking to reverse climate change against those who wish to preserve Vermont’s pristine natural resources. While that battle rages, the economic cost to Vermont has been pushed aside as irrelevant.

Our new energy policy calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Targeting our entire energy spectrum (including transportation), it relies on instate renewables to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. At the same time we’re eliminating Hydro Quebec, nuclear power, fracked natural gas and less efficient biomass electricity as acceptable “renewables.” Industrial wind, currently the darling of the present administration, has become the power that now drives our legislative policy.
What price are we willing to pay for this new policy? Vermont currently does a better job than most states at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so self-imposed mandates are not even necessary. And to those who believe Vermont will “lead the way” in reversing climate change, any hope that Vermont alone can cause a world-wide domino effect to achieve this lofty goal should be carefully balanced against the very real environmental destruction taking place right now in the cherished natural solitude of the Northeast Kingdom.
And more wind farms are coming as corporate investors, motivated by tax incentives and artificially inflated electric rates, seduce small towns with infusions of cash. Since wind is intermittent and has no storage capacity, our policy alone will require more wind farms and many miles of transmission lines to achieve our energy goal. If regulatory authorities fall short insisting on decommissioning plans, our ridgelines will end up littered with forty story rusting hulks when this technology becomes obsolete. These new wind farms are encroaching on our wildlife corridors, destroying pristine mountain environments and radically changing the aesthetics of our state. They pit citizens of towns against each other, and towns against towns in a given region.
In the meantime, we in the legislature have not been living up to the responsibility that comes with guarding Vermont’s Constitution. Article 18 urges us to be moderate and frugal when enacting only such legislation as is necessary for the good government of this state. At a time when Vermont already has more power than it can use, our new policy is not moderate, not frugal, and certainly not necessary. We haven’t even taken the time to ask ourselves what these policy goals will mean to our economy in the absence of similar goals in surrounding states.
I cannot support the raping of a pristine environment in exchange for intermittent power that has to be subsidized by both the taxpayer and the ratepayer. At a time when Vermont already has an ample power supply, this is no energy plan, it is a blind obsession. It’s time for Vermonters of every political stripe to join together in defense of ‘These Green Hills and Silver Waters.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the Arctic set a record sea ice minimum back in August, the European mainstream media and government funded climate institutes howled in a deafening, days-long chorus of “global” climate Armageddon.

In late September, Antarctic sea ice hit an all-time high, reaching the highest level since modern data-recording began. Chart source: National Snow and Ice Data Center.
Now fast forward one month to late September 2012 with the sea ice peaking at the opposite end of the planet, i.e. Antarctica. Knowing that the media has grown particularly sensitive to weather extremes, you’d think this current weather extreme around Antarctica would have set off a similar reaction. Any extreme, we are told, is proof of global warming.
All that extra ice beyond the 70°S latitude will reflect the sun’s precious heat back out into space, thus cooling the water even further, which means more ice will eventually develop, and thus there’s a real risk of reaching a dangerous and irreversible tipping point into unstoppable warming-induced cooling.
So why haven’t the media reacted? Well, there’s a limit to just how far the public and politicians, as gullible as they are, can be fooled. The media know where that line is: in Antarctica. When a cold, bitter and snowy winter strikes, only absolute morons actually believe that it is induced by global warming, and the media know that there are enough of them making up their readership. But when it comes to believing that global warming causes 19.5 million sq km of ice to form around Antarctica, even the media do not expect its dimwit readers to believe that. So they are keeping completely deaf and dumb about it. Informed readers, after all, are the last thing they want.

So not a peep of this has been mentioned anywhere in the German mainstream media.
If we google “Rekordeis” and limit the search to the last 7 days, we get thousands of reports of the Arctic melting, although it’s old news, but no reports of Antarctic sea ice setting a new all-time maximum.
Except for stories at German skeptic blogs EIKE and Science Skeptical, there’s nothing about this extraordinary event occurring at the South Pole in the major media outlets like German public television and radio, Spiegel, Bild, and at the major dailies. Also the main German climate institutes like the PIK, AWI and MPI are completely silent about it. They have no way of explaining this one.
So what can we conclude from this? The media saying absolutely nothing about this says a lot!
This is one genie they are not going to be able to keep bottled up.
ANTARCTIC SEA ICE HITS ALLTIME RECORD HIGH!
Get used to it.

It’s possible Mr Goddard has already posted this one. If so, then it doesn’t hurt to remind people of what nature does on it’s own and that today’s Arctic condition is nothing new. Note how the language is the same as what we hear from the media and climate institutes today. Like today, it was surely effective fund-raising back then as well.

Prof Hans von Storch on EU climate issue: “more as an opportunity to do social experiments”. (Photo source: wikimedia.org/wikipedia)
Rainer Grundmann writes about it at Prof. Hans von Storch’s klimazwiebel blog here and quotes the BBC:
The European Commission believes that policies to cut greenhouse gases will only work if individuals share the vision of a low-carbon society. ‘It’s perhaps been a bit too much doom and gloom in the past on climate,’ one official told the BBC at the launch in London. ‘We are now emphasising the need to inspire people.'”
Too much gloom and doom? Well then they ought to revamp the IPCC 5th Assessment Report so that it inpires readers, and not send them off scurrying under the bed pretrified of Mother Nature’s wrath. All indications are that it will be gloomier and doomier than ever.

Indeed, the issue has been so misused against the public that it has actually backfired in places like Great Britain. According to the BBC:

One of her officials admitted that the UK was suffering from something of a media backlash against climate policies because previously there had been media “overkill” on climate.”

Interestingly, Hans von Storch has an unkind assessment of the EU’s approach. In a reader comment he writes:
If this report is accurate, it describes a sad inability of European elites to take climate change seriously. The issue seems more as an opportunity to do social experiments – such as mass mobilization, steps towards a truly global governance – than dealing with efficiently limiting climate change and protecting society against ‘non-mitigatable’ climate change.”
Moreover, von Storch doubts that fixing the”gloom and doom” practice by using the educational approach of “‘inspiring people’ – without recognizing that the gloom & doom practice caused damage in the trust in policymakers, media and science…” will work at all. He suspects: “…it seems that the EU officials consider the media as culprits.”
It’s the media’s fault! Climate science and EU policy – what a circus.

But they also knew that Romney is within striking distance and were told by the media that with Americans you just don’t know what stupid things can happen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis summer in Germany is yet another wet one. Everywhere the media are moaning about the ongoing rains, lack of sunshine, flooded basements, etc. It was the same story last year. German scientists are stumped, their models have been exposed as being completely wrong – again.
For years Germany’s “climate scientists” kept warning the German public and governments they had to prepare for drier summers with periods of drought – because of galloping climate change. That’s what the climate models of renown institutes like the Max Planck Institute and the Potsdam Institute showed. That cannot be denied.
For example the online Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung here warned “Climate change, according to the German Weather Service, will result in very rainy low pressure areas during the wintertime and more dryness with periods of drought in the summertime. The source of this projection is DWD Vice President Paul Becker, early May.
Not long ago, the online Der Tagesspiegel warned its readers of the same: “Wet winters, dry summers, less water, high temperatures, more hail, more storm damage.” Here they were using model projections from the Potsdam Institute of Bedwetters and Climate Neurotics (PIK).
In September, 2008, Der Spiegel here wrote: “More heat waves, no snow in the winter: After years of calculation work, the climate prognoses of the German government are complete. With unprecedented accuracy they predict how the climate will change by the year 2100 – region by region.” Unfortunately the “unprecedented accuracy” they’ve seen up to now is not what they had in mind.
Der Spiegel here also wrote: “Calculation made by Max Planck Institute scientists show that temperatures over Germany could be on average 1°C higher beginning already in 2021.” For sure we’ll be checking up on that in just a few more years.
Der Spiegel continues: “‘Every few years there will be heat waves like 2003,’ said climate scientists of the Max Planck Institute.”
Well, we’re still waiting for it. If anything, the summers in Germany have been getting rainier and cooler – not resembling anything at all the summer of 2003.
Not only have the summers been misprdicted with astounding failure, but so have the recent winters. Here Der Spiegel predicted increasingly snowless winters. By 2031, much of Germany could expect never to see snow again. However, the last winters have seen a large number of days with snow cover. Indeed the red-colored Germany needs to be repainted green or even blue!
Looking back at the much ballyhooed climate models, we see that they’ve made a complete string of major mispredictions:

1. Not a single model predicted the stagnant temperatures the globe has seen for the last 15 years.
2. Not a single model projected the recent slowdown in sea level rise.
3. Not a single model predicted harsh winters of the type many parts of the world have experienced.
4. Not a single model projected the disappearance of hurricanes striking the US. Not a single model prjected fewer cyclones globally.
5. Not a single model projected increasing sea ice at the South Pole.
Just to name a few.

Video of what the wind industry is doing to my home state. Sheffield and Lowell Mountain are only a few miles from my hometown. Climate activists in Vermont, once big proponents of wind, are now shocked and aghast. Video source: http://vermontenergyoptions.org/
Shumlin thinks that reducing Vermont’s fossil energy consumption (which is not even measurable on a global scale) by a couple of percentage points will lead to a gentle climate for his state and prevent flooding there (2:25). Watch the video! I don’t know if he’s a swindler, or a complete moron.
So radical Shumlin is when it comes to protecting the climate with windmills that he has become an environmental Jim Jones who is ready to lead the state to commit mass environmental suicide.
And like the followers of Jim Jones, many Vermonters believed, and they all lined up behind the Jim Jones Shumlin’s wind energy movement – cheering on the army of wind turbine builders that would soon invade the state and disfigure it permanently – thinking it would bring them salvation. Today they are shocked and horrified. They now realise the punch is spiked with death.
The video above interviews an entire series of opponents, many are kooky environmentalists, some openly admitting they had been duped by the windpower pipe-dream (e.g. see 7:45 mark). They were all conned by Al Gore’s AIT film. They were all suckered by the “consensus” science that never was. They were manipulated by the media and politicians. And in a state of panic, they all thought something had to be done quickly.

Although many have since woken up to the true horror of the wind energy punch brewed by Shumlin, most are still convinced of man-made climate change. This is because they have been too lazy (or too damn stupid) to actually take a look at the hard data of historical climate.
How can people get so nutty? That’s the question that we often ask about Nazi Germany, isn’t it? It has to do with group-think reaching a certain tipping point. Eventually madness loses its brakes and turns into a runaway train that can’t be stopped. That’s what happened in Vermont.
Let’s recall that Vermont gave Obama something like 68% of the vote in 2008 (the greatest of all 50 states). So when that level of political onesidedness (cluelessness) grips a state, it’s little wonder that really dumb things like Shumlin can happen. The state lost its brakes. The state didn’t used to be that way. Things started to get especially bad after I left 30+ years ago.
Today the tiny state of Vermont is busy permanently altering and industrialising 200 miles of mountain ridgelines with 500-foot wind turbines – thinking this will rescue the planet. This, if allowed to continue, will turn the state into an environmental catastrophe of Soviet dimensions. What will Vermonters gain from it all the sacrifice? A theoretical cooling of the global climate by 0.0000000000041°C over the next 100 years. They’ll still have to buy flood insurance.
Fortunately, it is not only in Vermont that people are sobering up from their drugged green stupor and are starting to focus on the consequences of their runaway collective madness: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9597461/Soviet-style-wind-farm-subsidies-to-face-the-axe.html

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA chief scientist Waleed Abdalati has issued a response to the letter of protest from 50 former esteemed scientists, engineers and astronauts. Unfortunately, his response only adds to NASA’s embarrassment.
Normally when a professional organisation gets a high level complaint from such a number of esteemed members, the first step is confirm and to look into it seriously. Something like: “Thanks – we’ve received your complaint; we’ll look into it and get back to you”.
Apparently the chief of NASA no longer bothers taking the precaution of following up and investigating high-gravity issues from within. He just dismisses them off the bat. Not only is this inappropriate, but it is also reckless managerial behavior.
Abdalati has failed to exercise due diligence in the face of a serious matter.
Here’s NASA’s “us-against-them” response:
NASA sponsors research into many areas of cutting-edge scientific inquiry, including the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate. As an agency, NASA does not draw conclusions and issue ‘claims’ about research findings. We support open scientific inquiry and discussion.
“Our Earth science programs provide many unique space-based observations and research capabilities to the scientific community to inform investigations into climate change, and many NASA scientists are actively involved in these investigations, bringing their expertise to bear on the interpretation of this information.
We encourage our scientists to subject these results and interpretations to scrutiny by the scientific community through the peer-review process. After these studies have met the appropriate standards of scientific peer-review, we strongly encourage scientists to communicate these results to the public.

If the authors of this letter disagree with specific scientific conclusions made public by NASA scientists, we encourage them to join the debate in the scientific literature or public forums rather than restrict any discourse.”
Sheesh – no wonder the Challenger blew up! Have they not learned anything?
Instead of sweeping serious issues under the carpet, how about contacting those with the grievance and looking into it to see if there is something behind it? Did you even bother to call them?
Did NASA tell Morton Thiokol engineers to take the peer-review route in 1986?! Who are they kidding?
NASA’s knee-jerk dismissal of the letter of complaint is dubious, and reveals an organisation that is no longer functioning correctly. Its off-hand decision to dismiss the letter is amateur, unprofessional and stunningly negligent. Here, unwillingness to investigate is cover-up.
Abdalati’s handling of this matter is a scandal, and is on par with a CEO ignoring a letter from 50 women managers bringing up sexual harassment issues.
Moreover, open scientific discourse begins by looking into claims of serious deficiencies, and not ignoring or suppressing them.

Meteorologist, European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)
(Translated with permission, edited by P Gosselin)
Climate model trends have been providing prognoses (scenarios) for temperatures for the various atmospheric layers for about 2 decades: near the ground surface, troposphere and stratosphere.
According to the CO2 hypothesis, the atmosphere from ground level to the upper troposphere is supposed to warm up while the stratosphere is supposed to cool. However, meteorological measurements show that just opposite is occurring!
Institutes close to the IPCC have been conveying temperature prognoses (scenarios) in the media of spectacular and supposedly dramatic warming trends for surface temperatures for about three decades. However, the atmosphere can not be simply reduced to this relatively thin lower layer, and thus it has to be taken into account as a whole.
Figure 1, above, shows the levels of the atmosphere (image source K.E. Puls).
One atmospheric interaction is that when it gets warmer in the troposphere, it gets colder in the stratosphere – and vice versa.
For this reason there are also considerations and claims by the climate models on how the temperature at various altitudes is supposed to develop according to the AGW CO2 hypothesis.
These involve mainly:
– the lower troposphere
– the upper troposphere (hot spot)
– the stratosphere
1) The Lower Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, global temperatures near the surface are supposed to increase about 3°C during the 21st century: “For the next two decades…a warming of 0.2°C per decade is projected” [1].
But since 1998 there’s been no trace of warming. There hasn’t been any warming in 14 years, despite steadily increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Yet, this did not prevent the IPCC from making the absurd claim:
Progress in modelling…has allowed the specification of very narrow ranges of uncertainty for projected warming….”
But the most recent evaluation of the HADLEY Institute (CRU) up to July 2012 shows that precisely the opposite is true. There’s been a slight cooling over the last 14 years, what many refer to as a temperature plateau:

Figure 2: Global temperature 1850-2012 (Source: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/nh+sh/)
The contradiction becomes even more stark when IPCC prognoses are directly compared to measured temperatures:

Figure 3: IPCC prognosis vs. NASA sat. data (Source: http://wattsupwiththat.com).
2) Upper Troposphere Model Failure
According to the climate models, the upper troposphere is supposed to show a distinct warming, a so-called “hot spot”:
“Theory states that the hot spot is supposed to be created by additional evaporation, and the additional evaporation transports warmer and wetter air to altitudes where cooler and drier air masses once prevailed.” (read here).
But weather balloons have been unable to confirm this, and in fact show that precisely the opposite has occurred!

Figure 4, left: From data from millions of weather balloons, right: what the models predicted. Source: http://wattsupwiththat.com.
This also means that all models with a temperature prognosis over 1°C or more because of the “sure” water vapour amplification are falsified. According to the Die kalte Sonne website (www.kaltesonne.de/?p=4803):
Only a few people in the climate discussion are aware that CO2 is not the main driver, and that most of the warming is assigned to the dubious amplification mechanism. CO2 by itself only has a warming potential of 1.1°C per atmospheric concentration doubling. It is only through the theoretical assumption of the up-to-now poorly understood amplification mechanism that the warming gets catapulted by the IPCC to  2.0-4.5°C per CO2 doubling, mainly through water vapour and clouds.”
And:
A coupling between CO2 and water vapour is at this time not detectable.”
3) The Stratosphere Model Failure
The developments and effects of ozone, CO2, and the temperature in the stratosphere have long since been well illustrated by the German Weather Service (DWD) in one of its ozone bulletins [2]. There it is stated:
In the stratosphere…the absorption of sunlight by the plentiful ozone trace gas is the main source of heat. …Naturally the absorbed radiative energy must be given off once again. In the stratosphere this occurs…for the most part through heat radiation into space by CO2 molecules. Therefore CO2 in the atmosphere has a cooling effect, ozone a warming effect!”
And also cited there:
While CO2 in in the atmosphere has increased over the last decades, and ozone in the upper stratosphere (40 km) has reduced by almost 20% since the 1970s, (see Bulletin No. 103), …therefore it has to be expected that the CO2-cooling in the stratosphere would have had to increase over the last years, while ozone warming should have reduced. That means the upper stratosphere should have gotten colder over the last decades! Indeed almost every chemical-climate model, e.g. within the scope of the CCMVAL project (http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/CCMVal/) foresaw a cooling of about 1°C per decade for the upper stratosphere at 40 km .”
The actual measurements in the stratosphere between 1980 and 2008 yield completely different results, and are shown in in Figure 5:

 
The German Weather Service explicitly writes:
While the models show a steady and gradual cooling, the measurements at all stations show an entirely different development: A cooling was indeed the case until the end of the 1980s. Over the last 20 years all the temperatures at practically all the stations have remained more or less steady (exception data from Table-Mountain Lidars).”
According to Figure 5) The DWD writes:
…the gradual cooling of the upper stratosphere computed by the models did not occur over the last 20 years…. Therefore there had to have been changes that have compensated for the expected cooling since 1985, and which were not reproduced by the models.”
Summary
The projected temperature changes forecast by the climate models for the various layers of the atmosphere are all wrong!

Share this...FacebookTwitterSulfur Dioxide and Arctic Warming
By Ed Caryl
Sulfur dioxide, SO2, is not a greenhouse gas. But it should not be ignored when discussing climate. We know that the SO2 injected into the stratosphere by large volcanoes such as Agung, El Chichon, and Pinatubo, can cause cooling for a period of years. This is because of the reflective haze created by SO2 combining with water vapor to create sulphuric acid aerosol that then takes two or three years to fall down to altitudes where they find enough water vapor to grow, form clouds, and rain out.
We know that SO2 from industry and fossil fueled power plants form smogs and low clouds that produce acid rain down wind from the sources. We know what damage acid rain can do when the acid content is high enough to harm plant life. But little attention has been paid to the climate effects of the smogs themselves.
We know that low clouds and fogs keep surface temperatures from falling at night, as well as keeping surface temperatures from rising during daylight.
We know that in the polar regions in winter it is night all the time.
Now put those things together. In the Arctic, in winter, smogs and low clouds caused by SO2 will trap heat below them 24 hours a day, and in the spring will prevent sunlight from reaching and warming the surface. On the Arctic Ocean, this will delay both freezing in the winter and melting in the spring.

Figure 1: NORSEX ice extent for the last five years plus 2012 to date.
 We can see clearly that the freeze-up in the Arctic has been delayed in recent years compared to the 1979 to 2006 average. Because the freeze-up is delayed, there is less ice to thaw in the spring, so that delay is less obvious, except that the ice minimum is also delayed compared to the average. Now we get to why? First, we look at two temperature anomaly maps of the Arctic.

Figure 2a and 2b: Temperature anomaly maps from Climate4You of the Arctic for all of 2011 and March of 2012. Note the location of the warming.

Now another map. This is a map of northern Russia.

Figure 3: Google map of northern Russia. The indicator on the map is the location of Norilsk.
Norilsk is the location of the world’s largest nickel mine. They also recover copper, cobalt, platinum, and palladium. Nearby, coal is mined to support the power needs of the city (130,000 population), the mine, and the smelter operations. SO2 emissions are about one million metric tons per year. This one location is responsible for 1% of all the SO2 emissions in the world, 10% of all of Europe’s emissions.
CNN reports that there is not a single living tree within 48 kilometers (30 miles) of the nickel smelter. 2,832 square kilometers (1093 square miles) of forest have been killed, and another 5371 square kilometers (2073 square miles) have been damaged. For a full report on the damage read this pdf document.
Norilsk Mining has other smelters on the Kola Peninsula very close to the Norwegian border. They also emit large amounts of SO2. Both locations are well above the Arctic Circle. All these emissions are within a very sensitive part of the Earth: the Arctic.
During the winter, the winds in the Arctic are variable, depending on the position of the Arctic front. The winds alternate between blowing to and from the land, moving any pollution over the Arctic Ocean or inland. In Figure 2b, in March,
the pollution from Norilsk was moving over the ocean much of the time. You can see the ebb and flow of the winds as they moved the sea ice in an animation of the last year here (from NRL).
Normally, SO2 is not a greenhouse gas, but it is in the dark of winter in the Arctic. In combination with water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas, it produces smog and low clouds that reflect heat back to the surface when it is dark, and upward into space when the sun shines. This distorts the melting and freezing patterns resulting in less ice in the Arctic Ocean. Yes, the reduction in ice in the Arctic is anthropogenic, with a Russian accent.
One thing people don’t know is that the platinum/palladium used in in automotive catalytic converters comes from Norilsk. We are simply moving the pollution from a distributed source, automobiles, to a concentrated source in Siberia. We are all responsible for Arctic warming.
Postscript: Norilsk Mining plans to reduce SO2 emissions by two-thirds as soon as they develop the necessary technology. They think this can be done by 2015 or 2020. Just in time for the general global cooling.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper has been published by Twila Moon et al titled: 21st-Century Evolution of Greenland Outlet Glacier Velocities appearing in the journal Science.

Lead author Twila Moon finds that claims of rapid Greenland glacier acceleration are massively overstated.
The study contradicts all the bedwetting projections made by the crackpots at NASA or the PIK in Potsdam.
The paper’s abstract concludes:
Observed acceleration indicates that sea level rise from Greenland may fall well below proposed upper bounds.”
The German online daily Die Welt also reports on the story in an article today called Greenland Glacier Disappearing More Slowly Than Thought.
Die Welt writes that the behavior of 200 glaciers was evaluated over 10 years and that they accelerated on average only 30% instead of the often ballyhooed doubling. Die Welt writes (emphasis added):

The large glaciers ending on land or in fjords have on the other hand hardly changed or have even become slower, the scientists reported in the Journal ‘Science’.
Sea level rise resulting from Greenland ice melt therefore could end up being far less than what climate scientists predicted.”
Gee, like we’re even surprised.
A series of scientists like expert Nils-Axel Mörner have been telling us for years that the bedwetters had been hyper-exaggerating and that there has not been, is not, and will not be an acceleration in sea level rise. How many experts and how much more real, observed data is it going to take before people realize the models are sheer crap?
Moreover, the scientists are simply just not sure how much sea level is rising. Moon admits that. Die Welt writes:
Just how much, remains unclear however, say Twila Moon of the University of Washington in Seattle and her colleagues.”
The tide gauges show zero acceleration. And Die Welt adds:
‘In some respects our results produce as many new questions as they answer,’ said Ian Joughin, co-author, of the Applied Physics Laboratory of the the University of Washington.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems that parts of the German mainstream media are becoming more cautious with the information warmist scientists feed them.
For example Axel Bojanowski of Der Spiegel here writes a report about Richard Muller’s “CALL me a converted skeptic” opinion piece that appeared in the “New York Times”, which the German and international warmist media gleefully pounced upon.

But Bojanowski took a deeper look at Muller and discovered that all is not well with the “converted skeptic”, writing:
However, looking more closely, the showstopper turned out to be a fake: Namely, with Muller, it turns out he is not in any way a former skeptic who just changed his mind. Already in 2003 he wrote in ‘Technology Review’, that his opinion was that ‘carbon dioxide as a gas emitted from fossil fuels is the biggest polluter in the history of man.’ It is likely that CO2 will ‘have severe and detrimental effects on global climate’.”
Bojanowski then brings up Muller’s BEST study and his claims that global surface temperatures have risen 1°C over the last 50 years and that if CO2 continues to rise in China unhindered, the climate could warm another 1°C in the next 20 years. To this Bojanowski adds:
Climate scientist Judith Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA however wanted nothing to do with this conclusion and refused to have her name as one of the authors of the Best-Project. Curry has made a name for herself as a ‘climate realist’ – she is fighting against the polarization of climate science by ‘skeptics’ and ‘alarmists’.
When influential media outlets like Spiegel start taking a second look, you can pretty much guess what’s in the pipeline for the months and years ahead. Indeed the global warming scare has its best days behind it.
In a way, this is Der Spiegel indirectly slapping down the New York Times.

The State of Alabama and all political subdivisions may not adopt or implement policy recommendations that deliberately or inadvertently infringe or restrict private property rights without due process, as may be required by policy recommendations originating in, or traceable to ‘Agenda 21,’ “
[…] Public support for the Alabama law was overwhelming and bipartisan […] the law points out, the UN has enlisted a broad array of non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations in its effort to foist Agenda 21 on the world — most notably a Germany-based group called ICLEI […] Meanwhile, local governments across America — under intense pressure from citizens and activist groups — are slowly awakening to what critics call the “dangers” of the UN scheme. Dozens of cities and counties have withdrawn from ICLEI in recent years, and as awareness continues to grow, that trend is expected to accelerate.”

Things are just going like clockwork for Romney. It’s increasingly clear the Democrats are propping up a knocked-out feather-weight fighter, insisting he’s still conscious when in fact he’s out cold.
Romney’s momentum continues and now looks unstoppable. Expect it to carry through election day. The Democrats are more demoralized than ever.
When one looks at the polls closely, say what you want about them, we see that a voter tsunami developing for Romney:
1. Florida is all but locked up.
2. Pennsylvania is going to Romney, and with it Ohio.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately we’ve seen how leading IPCC scientists have been ignoring real data and presenting instead fantasized catastrophe scenarios as the real facts.
Global temperatures, they claim, are rising faster (in fact they haven’t risen in 15 years), sea level rise is accelerating (in fact it is decelerating), and storms are increasing (when in fact they have been decreasing). Yet, despite the recent flurry of hysterical claims, policymakers are no longer listening anymore. In Doha they simply brushed them aside and pushed off the whole process yet another year – this for the 19th time in a row.
So what are climate scientists to do?
The answer: exaggerate even more scenarios, like polar ice melt. At least that’s what leading IPCC scientist Prof. Mojib Latif of the GEOMAR Heimholtz Centre for Ocean Research appears to have done. Just ignore the real measurements and make up your own scary story. And because you are a renowned climate scientist, hapless, lazy journalists will automatically believe everything you say.
Half of the polar ice area has melted in the last 30 years
Prof. Latif’s latest scare fantasy is reported by journalist Heinrich Pantel of the Kieler Nachrichten here. He reports, quoting Latif (emphasis added):
‘Whatever our grandparents and parents blew into the atmosphere is still there today.’ The problem here is: ‘The climate reacts slowly.’ It could take decades before we feel the full force of our actions.
The speaker [Latif] referred to the retreat of the ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. Since the first satellites in space have enabled precise measurements, it is known that the ice area at the poles has decreased by almost a half over the last 30 years.”

Half of the ice area has disappeared at the Arctic and Antarctic poles? That’s what the Kieler Nachrichten reports, based on a presentation by Mojib Latif. Who cares anymore what the real facts are – just say whatever shocks the audience and readers at hand. None of them are going to look up the true data anyway.
At the rate suggested by the Kieler Nachrichten, who we assume quoted Latif correctly, the remaining half of the ice at the poles will likely disappear over the next 30 years – if not sooner should the warming indeed be accelerating. Moreover, if half of the polar ice area has disappeared, wouldn’t sea levels be rising something like 100 times faster?
Sloppy science communication – irresponsible journalism
This is yet another classic example of both sloppy science communication by an IPCC scientist, and irresponsibe and negligent journalism by Pantel and the Kieler Nachrichten. Any journalist, who had even posessed just an inkling of knowledge about climate science, would have immediately known something was amiss here. Fact-checking? What for! Journalist Heinrich Pantel just accepted “expert” Latif’s nonsense as the Holy Gospel truth.
To be fair to Prof. Latif, it’s possible that the hapless journalist just got the facts all mixed up and thus completely misinformed his readers.
Unfortunately this has become the norm of science communication in Germany.
And so one should not wonder that many German citizens and policymakers have become hopelessly hysterical on the climate issue. And we should not be surprised that more and more readers are turning their backs on the print media and opting instead for information from blogs.

How many German readers here at NTZ will disagree? Not many I suspect. Hat-tip Science Skeptical.
Germany — Insane Or Just Plain Stupid?
We usually give the Germans credit for being rational, but this coal plant will emit over one million times more carbon this year than all of their nuclear plants would have over the next 20 years, and cost over twice as much to run as any one of the them. Germany’s present strategy will absolutely not allow them to reduce their carbon emissions anywhere near their goal of 40% by 2020.
Unless the German people give up the nice parts of their lifestyle and become insanely efficient, they most likely will not reduce their emissions at all by 2020.

No one thought Germany would be insane enough to shut down their nuclear plants, without a reason and without backup….” Continue reading…
That’s because nobody knew how drugged-up-on-green the Germans have become over the last 20 years. Even the conservatives are marching to the beat of fundamentalist green – in a zombie state, all thinking they are going to get 70 virgins in climate paradise later on.
To James Conca: never under-estimate Germany’s power of collective thinking, and it’s potential to send the entire nation through a phase of insanity.
Yes, I’m sorry to say, and likely violating the rules of being a good guest here, the German leadership did indeed become scientifically, collectively insane – all led on and duped by an elitist class of crackpot scientists, journalists and activists. The proof is in the reality, as so vividly exposed by James Conca.
Now, finally, the conservatives, it seems, prodded along by the Free Democrats, are beginning to recognize their folly and are quietly going back to what really works.

This morning I took one final look and applied a more worst-case scenario. We can’t expect most toss-up states to go to Romney. So here’s my more worst-case scenario prediction, swing states in bold. With a little push, Romney could very well end up near 290 or more.
