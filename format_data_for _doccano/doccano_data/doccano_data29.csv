The Swiss Academy is apparently unswayed by the change in direction recently adopted by the Royal Society in Britain. Pro-Clim is sticking to activism and dogma, at least until further notice. Comically it claims that skepticism is scientific, but only if it does not come from climate skeptics. More on this below.
The news release that follows serves to remind warministas that the science is settled and that arguments against “climate change” are to be dismissed. So keep the faith! The release also links to a pdf file, which provides frustrated warministas with arguments they can use against skeptics in public debate. Here is the release in English:
===================================================================
The Arguments of the Climate Skeptics
Climate Press No. 29
Skepticism is the basis for scientific work, as scientific findings must be reproducible and stand up to rigorous examination. On the other hand, the skepticism coming from climate skeptics is problematic because they accept scientific proof only selectively.
The arguments from climate skeptics are numerous, but often contradictory. The facts behind climate change are challenged in more or less complex ways.  These are arguments that have been either refuted already, or simply are not scientifically plausible when examined more closely – but are always put forth anyway. In the meantime answers and detailed explanations for each point can be called up from websites at any time. A look at the collection of arguments allows them to be categorized into groups. Arguments made by climate skeptics almost always fall under one of the categories. The described categories will help you orgnanize the hundreds of arguments.
===================================================================
To me it seems strange that a scientific society would take sides instead of remaining neutral. I especially like their claim “the skepticism of climate skeptics is problematic because they accept the scientific proof only selectively“. What they are saying here is that skepticism becomes unwelcome and dismissible if it threatens their dogma.
When this belief becomes a guiding principle of a scientific society, then it has truly succeeded in reducing itself to a joke.
Sorry, but you don’t get to accept or dismiss skepticism based on whether you like it or not. If you don’t like skepticism because it’s “selective”, or “problematic”, then science is not your field.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the climate conference now taking place in Bonn with the aim of coming up with a successor to the 2012-expiring Kyoto Protocol for Durban later this year, signs of success are non-existent.
Obituaries are now being written everywhere in the German press, also see here and here.
For that we can all breathe a big sigh of relief – saved again from another huge Soviet-scale bureaucratic folly run by enviro-zealots.
The latest obit appears today in the leftist online Frankfurter Rundschau titled Kyoto Dies, which frames the current conference as follows:
If the EU fails to give a signal of a breakthrough, then the conference in Durban in December threatens to be a flop. That would make the Kyoto process practically dead -– almost 20 years after it started at the UN Earth Conference in Rio de Janeiro.”
With the USA, Russia, Canada and Japan out, and only countries that represent 20% of the global emissions still in it, the death of Kyoto is assured.

Not everyone has given up hope. For example “climate expert” Christoph Bals of tree-mater (we’re talking about real enviro-perverts here) group Germanwatch hope that Europe will summon the courage to take the lead and be the first to leap into the abyss of economic suicide. The Frankfurter Rundschau writes:
He demands the EU increase its reduction targets for the year 2020 from 20% to 30%. In fact the EU has already reached 17%.”
Most of that 17% reduction came in the early 1990s from shutting down inefficient industries centrally-run by the Eastern European communists, whom the tree-maters admire so much.
Meanwhile here’s how Der Spiegel starts off:
Already at the start of the climate conference in Bonn hopes were next to zero. No one gave a successor protocol  for the 2012-expiring Kyoto Climate protocol a chance of being passed on time, said UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres. Now, 11 days later, the renewed failure is perfect: there is hardly any tangible progress.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe animated graphic below was created by geophysicist Joachim Saul from the Helmholtz Association GFZ Research Centre for Geosciences, read here and shows the sequence of quakes since March 9. The animated image is available at www.gfz-potsdam.de. Click the image to activate.

The GFZ press release writes:
It shows the earthquake activity in the region of Honshu, Japan, measured at the GFZ since 8 March 2011. After a seismically quiet 8th March, the morning (coordinated universal time UTC) of the March 9 began with an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 off the Japanese east coast, followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.
The morning of March 11 sees the earthquake disaster that triggered the devastating tsunami. This earthquake is followed by many almost severe aftershocks, two of which almost reach the magnitude 8. In the following time period the activity slowly subsides, and is dominated today (March 16) by relatively small magnitude 5 quakes, though several earthquakes of magnitude 6 are being registered on a daily basis.
By analysing over 500 GPS stations, the GFZ scientists Rongjiang Wang and Thomas Walter have found that horizontal displacements of up to five meters in an eastern direction occurred at the east coast of Japan. The cause lies in the earthquake zone, i.e. at the contact interface of the Pacific plate with Japan. Computer simulations of this surface show that an offset of up to 25 meters occurred during the earthquake.
Calculations of the GFZ modeling group headed by Stephan Sobolev even yielded a displacement of up to 27 meters and a vertical movement of seven meters. This caused an abrupt elevation in the deep sea, and thus triggered the tsunami. The images of the GPS displacement vectors and the computer simulations can also be found among the online material provided by the GFZ.
Already shortly after the quake Andrey Babeyko and Stephan Sobolev of the GFZ modeled the propagation and wave heights of the tsunami in the Pacific over the first 16 hours. The tremendous force of the earthquake is highlighted here, too: in the open Pacific, relatively large wave heights of over one meter were calculated, which agrees very well with the observations. How high the tsunami is piled up on the coast is largely determined by water depth and the shape of the coastline. The GFZ material also contains an image and an animation regarding this work.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI don’t have a single one of these damn things in our house, and I’m glad. Now the German online DIE WELT has a report here called: Energy Saving Lights Emit Toxic Substances.
Hat-tip DirkH
It was already widely known that CFLs released deadly mercury, but only if they broke, see here for example, or here onwhat to do if one breaks. Now, according to the German television news show “Markt“, which will air tomorrow evening at 8:15 pm, CFLs also emit cancer-causing fumes during their operation, principally phenol, which is highly toxic even in small amounts.
DIE WELT reports that the NDR news magazine selected a random sampling of CFLs from various manufacturers and had them tested by an independent laboratory.
DIE WELT writes:
The official expert for lighting, Peter Braun, confirmed the magazine’s claims that substances can find there way in the air in a room. ‘Of special concern was that all lights that were tested emitted cancer-causing substances while they operated, and these happened to be the substances that occurred with the highest concentrations,’ Braun told the network.”
One manufacturer said they would look into it, while another said they know of no concentrations that are a threat to anyone.
Great! Now we are creating a global Love Canal to make believe we are rescuing the behavior of the atmosphere.

A reader has pointed out that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone appear to have started a trend: Climate Bets For Charity. Here at NTZ, the warmists have entered in a bet (for charity) with the coolists on whether the 2011-2020 decade will be warmer or cooler.
Climate Bet Of The Decade For Charity
Now other blogs are following. It’s the new motto now spreading in climate science:
Either put up, or shut up!”
The latest bet out there is from the outspoken Joe Romm of Climate Progress, who offers to bet Joe Bastardi on temperature and Arctic ice melt. Glad to see he wants to settle it that way, and not through a wrestling match (though the result may very well end up being the same).
Romm’s proposal is very similar to our bet here at NTZ.

In the temperature bet, Romm wants to use the 2000-2009 period instead of the 2001-2010, thus moving the high temperature year of 2010 into his column. His bet is also for charity and insists using the average of RSS and UAH – as we are doing.
But Joe Romm is adding an escape clause: If 2 Pinatubo-size volcanoes erupt, then the bet is off. Such confidence!
I haven’t checked to see what Joe Bastardi’s reaction is. I think he’ll accept both bets. Go for it Bastardi! Unfortunately it’s going to take 10 years to shut this Romm loudmouth up.
Joe Romm seems awfully cocky. I wonder if he has the guts to make a sea level bet. That’s the issue where warmist blow the most hot air, yet are most afraid of touching. What do you say Romm? 5 mm/year over the next decade? That’s way below what Gore and the PIK in Germany are forcasting.
Don’t hold your breath.
Another blog has also got into the climate betting for charity action, but on a more modest scale. Georg Hoffmann here is betting 100 € that 2011 Arctic sea ice extent will reach a record low (NSIDC). Also an attractive bet for coolists.
If all this keeps up, then it won’t be necessary to make up a global warming scare for redistributing global wealth. Looks like the betting is going to care of that itself.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sporting and dog magazine Wild und Hund reports that thousands of domestic and wild animals are falling ill from tainted waste from green “climate-friendly” biogas plants, which is then used as an agricultural fertilizer in fields.
Hat tip: Dirk Maxeiner here (in a commentary titled: “Gross negligence in green”).
Wild und Hund has put out a press release announcing a report appearing in its latest issue, now available at news stands today. The Wild und Hund press release reads as follows (slight editing added for international readers):
DEATH FROM THE BIOGAS PLANT – CHRONIC BOTULISM
There’s been a terrible suspicion for years. The residue from biogas plants that produce “clean” green electricity is causing a deadly disease among domestic and wild animals, and humans – chronic botulism.
Wild und Hund not only examines the disease, but also looks into the background as to why such a hazard has not been publicly discussed for 10 years. In the aftermath of Fukushima, the public wishes to shift to renewable energy sources. Today in Germany already over a million acres of land are producing corn for biogas plants. German Agriculture Minister Ms Ilse Aigner announced on 27 April 2011 that land used for growing plants for producing energy will be significantly expanded to an area anywhere between 4 to 6 million acres. Today biogas plants are sprouting everywhere in the countryside.
However, the supposedly environmentally friendly supply of energy is likely hiding a lethal bacteria in its waste. Christoph Boll of the hunting magazine WILD UND HUND has investigated the disease, whose existence has been denied by the industry, and whose impact on wildlife could be catastrophic to wildlife. In the German region of Vogtland in Saxony, 600 cows and the farmer himself fell seriously ill. Diagnosis: chronic botulism. And that was no isolated incident says Professor Dr. Helge Böhnel of the University of Göttingen. The scientist reveals that the number of sick animals observed runs to 4-digit numbers. Dr Böhnel is convinced that chronic and visceral botulism could impact all birds and mammals  – including humans.
In general botulism is a lethal type of poisoning. But chronic botulism can also stealthily drag on in small quantities for years. Dr. Böhnel believes that biogas plants are “very likely” the source. How is it caused exactly? In early spring when harvesting biomass plants, foremost green rye, young wildlife end up getting minced by harvesters and end up as an ingredient in the biogas plant brew. In a addition slaughterhouse waste and other meat, such as old hens, along with manure slurry, get thrown in as raw material. At a brewing temperature of 40°C, bacteria multiply with abandon, which in turn leads to the production of enormously resistant botulinum spores that survive the hygienisation process (heating to 70°C). The waste material that is left at the end of the biogas process then gets used as fertilizer for agriculture, and so the spores wind up spread all over the landscape where they get ingested by grazing animals (domestic livetsock, wildlife, birds, etc.). Once in the digestive tract they then convert into the bacteria that produce the deadly toxin. Often the amount of toxin is not sufficient for a quick death, rather the poisoning is slow and chronic.”
So add another to the list of wonderful things delivered by the green revolution, which already includes a mercury contaminated environment from energy saving lights, birds getting shredded by windparks that have devastated the local landscape, biofuels that drive up the price of food and so lead to hunger for millions more, etc.

Finally, I wonder if they use this all-natural fertilizer from the “clean” biogas plants as a fertiliser for the organic food farms?
==========================================================
UPDATE: VIDEO HERE IN GERMAN, hat-tip DirkH
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev6hOeog5jU&feature=player_embedded
Cause of the suffering and dead cows: chronic botulism. Worse! The infected cattle shown that are still alive are being slaughtered and sold as fresh meat to supermarkets! The moderators says:
“The state veterinary officials say chronic botulism does not warrant the cattle be stopped from being slaughtered. ‘For the delivery of cattle for slaughter…there are no restrictions.’ “
and
Experts say up to 1000 farms may be affected – thousands of dead animals are the result.”
In the meantime, the infected cattle are being sent to slaughterhouses, and the meat to the supermarkets. The German health officials don’t want to hear about it, the report says. The Green movement keeps moving. This is a scandal.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProgress is not achieved by abandoning development
Imagine if the Wright Brothers had abandoned flight after the first mishap, only listening to the voices of fear that heavy objects have no place in the air and that it isn’t possible to eliminate accidents? Imagine if society had abandoned the automobile after the first deadly accident? Imagine if early doctors had been prevented from attempting surgery on a seriously ill person. Of course, if humans had given up after every failure, we’d still be in the Stone Ages – if not extinct.
Japan’s disaster will provide valuable lessons learned
I believe the disaster in Japan will act as a blessing is disguise. I say this because many lessons will be learned from this incident. This is not to say we are pleased about any injury or death resulting there – that’s tragic. I’m saying we have the chance to learn from it. It’s already quite impressive that the Fukushima facility survived the 9.0 mega-earthquake and was done in only by the ensuing mega-tsunami. Fukushima was subjected to an extreme natural event and the results will lead to many valuable findings. It’s up to us if they will be applied to future power plants. It’s a chance to improve our lives.
China and applying lessons learned
China has announced it will put its plans to build new nuclear facilities on hold for now. This in no way means China is abandoning its ambitious plan to build nuclear power plants. Indeed it is going to pause and take a look at what went wrong at Fukushima, and then apply the lessons learned to its own plants, making them more sound, and equipped with better and even more reliable redundant safety systems. The result: China’s nuclear power plants of the future will be even safer, more modern and thus will end up saving many lives with the reliable supply of electricity they will provide.
China’s bold electrical energy plan: 200 reactors
Along with 2000 coal-fired power plants, with each one getting more modern, China will also add a huge number of nuclear reactors to its energy supply infrastructure over the next 2 decades. Already China is currently constructing 27 reactors, another 50 have been approved and funded, and a whopping 110 additional reactors are proposed. China today is already the number 2 economy globally. With addition of hundreds of power plants, China will surely be the powerhouse of the future. That does not come from being chicken with small risks, but from boldness and belief in huge technological progress.
Some western countries are abandoning development
Many western countries, on the other hand are taking the opposite approach. Instead applying lessons learned, they are moving back to the Dark Ages, when energy was harnessed from the wind or direct sunlight, where the energy yield per square meter is in the range of watts, and not kilowatts or megawatts. Oil is being abandoned, so is coal – and now nuclear.
The west reacts with fear and hysteria

The accident in Japan did not lead Germany to examine what went wrong and to attempt applying lessons learned to improve safety and reliability at its own reactors, rather it has decided, in a fit panic and hysteria, to abandon the technology altogether and relinquish it to other competing countries. No othe rcountry has reacted so rashly. Physicist Dr. Peter Heller at Science Skeptical explains why:
There were times in history when ignorance and cowardice overshadowed human life. It was a time when our ancestors were forced to lead a life filled with superstition and fear because they were forbidden to use their creativity and fantasy. Religious dogma, like the earth being the centre of the unverse, or creationism, forbade people to question. The forbiddance of opening a human body and examining it prevented questions from being answered. Today these Medieval rules appear to us as backwards and close-minded. We simply cannot imagine this way of thinking having any acceptance.
Unfortunately today, they do. It is well-documented in nuclear and climate science.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s response to Fuskushima? She blinked, panicked and immediately shut down 7 of Germany’s nuclear reactors, and then announced an accelerated shut down of nuclear energy in Germany overall. I’m not aware of earthquake-prone Japan even shutting down its other nuclear reactors. Such actions are undertaken only by hysterical minds.
Superstition and prophesies of disaster pervade
Today in modern Germany, and in many western countries, phony catastrophe scenarios, both in nuclear science and climate science, are being served up as science when in fact they are pure dogma – i.e. gross departures of science – and are solely intended to spread fear. We are discouraged from asking questions; we are told to believe the “experts”. Do not dare to ask questions.
Religion in technology
The media and anti-nuclear technology activists are now applying religious terms to describe the Fukushima disaster: Armegeddon, mega-disaster, catastrophe, etc. Some have even attempted to connect the earthquake and tsunami to climate change, caused by man’s activity, without producing an iota of data to support this. Like God’s wrath on man in the Bible, it’s Nature’s wrath on man. Nuclear power has been branded as evil, although it has a very high level of safety in almost every country where it is used.
Sure there will be accidents and mishaps, but they will become rarer and smaller, and the benefits will far outweigh them. Just like all other technical products and systems.
Heller ends his essay:
I am a physicist. I’d like to live in a world that is willing to learn and to improve whatever is good. I would only like to live in a world where great strides in physics are viewed with fascination, pride and hope because they show us the way to a better future. I would only like to live in a world that has the courage for a better world. Any other world for me is unacceptable. Never. That’s why I am going to fight for this world, without ever relenting.
I agree with Dr. Heller and he has plenty of company. There are many out there who share his view. As dogma, fear, superstition take hold and western society slips backwards into dark times, more and more on Heller’s side will make their voices heard.

Share this...FacebookTwitterComputers have been forecasting a wicked cold winter for Europe this year. Looks like it’s shaping up to be just that.
Later this week a blast of Arctic air is set to sweep across northern and central Europe, as a huge high pressure zone off in the Atlantic combined with low pressure system Gundula to east over the Baltic pump frigid air over the continent.
One meteorologist says such a weather pattern was last seen 70 years ago.
Wetter.com writes here:
Cold air will clash with moist air and, as a result, we will get more and more snow in the days ahead. But that’s not all. By and by the cold will tighten its grip, and by Friday temperatures will not get above freezing.
That is still not the end of it. This weekend temperatures nationwide [Germany] will be between 5 below and 13°C below at night. But hang on tight. Next week will be even colder – especially at night, where for example, the temperature in the Black Forest will drop to 26°C below!
And if that is not enough, then drive out to the Swiss mountains. 38°C below is the forecast during the night from Sunday to Monday!

German tabloid Bild newspaper reports here, quoting meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net:
The weekend will be bitter cold. Daytime highs will climb to only -8°C to -2°C . Nighttime temperatures will drop to -10°C. But in areas with clear skies and snow cover, especially in the central mountain regions, temperatures of -25°C will be reached.
Jung says such a weather pattern can stay around a long time before it goes away. He tells Bild newspaper:
When cold polar air is really there, than it’ll stick around for awhile. At the moment weather models show no end in sight for the coming cold wave. Quite to the contrary, the first weekend of December is going to be even colder, and there’s the threat of heavy snowfalls.
We’ll be getting temperatures like we would only expect in the dead of winter. A similar weather pattern led to the extreme winter in 1939/1940.”
And it’s still autumn officially!
Strange how the leaders of the world’s most climate-activist countries will be discussing ways to prevent warming in balmy Cancun Mexico just when their respective countries will be struggling in bitter cold. The Gods have a sense of humour.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore evidence of the obvious now revealed in a recent Nature article from research conducted by the IFM GEOMAR and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Believe it or not, they are slowly finding out that the oceans play a role in climate.
Once again climate scientists, who often claim the science is settled, are running into “surprises” and finding out that there is so much they don’t know. Here’s the press release from the IFM GEOMAR (emphasis added):
====================================================
Oceanographers from Kiel document the effect of equatorial deep currents on West African rainfall
May 18, 2011/Kiel. Our climate is affected by the ocean in many ways.
The most prominent example is the El Niño phenomenon in the Pacific, a well-documented interannual climate signal. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI, USA) have recently documented the effect of deep equatorial currents in the Atlantic on rainfall and climate over West Africa.
Precipitation associated with the West African Monsoon is of major significance to agriculture, water resources and health concerns in one of the more densely populated regions in Africa. The timing and amount of rainfall each year in the countries along the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea are determined in part by the sea surface temperature of the tropical Atlantic. The details of this interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere are not fully understood at this time. Previously it was thought that effects from the Pacific and North Atlantic were the main source for climate fluctuations in the equatorial Atlantic. Oceanographers from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR), in collaboration with their colleagues from the USA, were now able to demonstrate the existence of regular interannual temperature fluctuations which have an effect on the rainfall of the region but cannot be traced back to the previously known sources.  Even more astonishing for the scientists is the fact that all measurements indicate that these fluctuations are caused by deep currents of the equatorial Atlantic itself. “To date, when trying to explain tropical climate variations, we have always looked upwards, specifically to the atmosphere. Our new data, for the first time, direct our attention towards the depths of the ocean, thereby opening new perspectives for our scientific approach,” explained Dr Peter Brandt, professor at IFM-GEOMAR.
In a large-scale, international research programme, the Tropical Atlantic Climate Experiment (TACE), experts have attempted for years to track the causes, effects and potential periodicities of climate fluctuations in the tropical Atlantic. The German contribution to this programme also includes deep-sea moorings along the equator. These moorings consist of several km of mooring wire held upright in the water column by flotation and buoys. Instruments are mounted along the wire to continuously record current speed and direction, salinity and temperature, thereby allowing the observation of long-term changes of parameters in the deep ocean. Furthermore, the scientists obtain current data from freely drifting deep-sea buoys, so-called Argo floats, and also information on the sea surface itself and the atmosphere from various satellite-based sensors. “The time series obtained over the past ten to twenty years have revealed previously unknown fluctuations of currents and temperatures at the surface of the tropical Atlantic which have a regular cycle of 54 months, or 4 ½ years,” explained Peter Brandt. The scientists were able to document similar fluctuations of the “Deep Jets”, deep currents down to 3000 m with speeds of 10-20 cm/sec. They flow along the equator, crossing the entire Atlantic, with flow reversals every few hundred meters. “These jets are generated in the deep ocean, and their energy apparently propagates upwards through the water column. Once near the surface, this energy affects currents and temperatures,” stated Dr Brandt.
On the other hand, sea surface temperatures are among the deciding factors for rainfall fluctuations over West Africa. “How large the effect of these deep jets is, and how they are generated is still somewhat of a mystery,” said Dr Brandt, “we still have a lot of work ahead of us.”

We keep hearing that CO2 is the main climate driver, yet so much research has come out showing that it’s the sun and oceans.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days back I wrote about a German meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt here, who claims climate prognoses are “not worth the paper they are printed on“.
Dr. Karsten Brandt says CO2 is completely overblown in climate models. Photo source: donnerwetter.de
At his website here, Germany’s new climate enfant terrible posted a report titled: The Future Of Our Climate In Europe (in German) where he fires blistering criticism at regional climate forecasts made by computer-models.
Worthless models – ocean currents are 100 to 1000 times more powerful than CO2
First Brandt takes a look at CO2 versus other climate factors. Brandt says that surely CO2 will have some impact over the long-term – over centuries, but over the shorter term (100 years) and on continental scales, CO2 plays nary a role compared to other factors like ocean currents:
At the continental level, ocean currents are especially capable of completely knocking our climate out of whack. In Europe, that would be of course the Gulf Stream. This has an influence factor on our climate that is 100-1000 in comparison to the long-term CO2 impact.
So how can we trust computer climate model forecasts made for the next 100 years? Can you leave out such factors like the sun, ocean cycles and volcanoes – which are all poorly understood – and still get a useful outlook? To answer this question Brandt uses a financial analogy (which Brandt knows something about, as he runs his own private meteorological services company):
Imagine you are preparing the financial plan for your company, but you completely forget the all-important factors of taxes and mandatory expenses for employee benefits. You’re sure to go bankrupt. That’s basically the appraoch used in the climate models and their prognoses. These models exclude numerous difficult details. Still, climatologists go out and hock their climate forecast maps of central Germany and Bavaria for the year 2060.
Gulf Stream factor 100+ times bigger factor than CO2. NASA photo
By now, any normal reader begins to understand just how dubious and worthless such forecasts truly are. Just months ago we recall how these climate forecasters predicted warm, mild winters for Europe, along with the end of the ski industry in the Alps. Now today, having their heads pulled out of the sand by meteorologists, the same climatologists are forecasting bitter cold winters in Europe. Gone suddenly is all the dreaded warming. If this to you all sounds like a swindle, you’re not alone.
Brandt tells us more about how climatologists behave:
 Just a small change in the Gulf Stream results in Europe shivering, thus rendering obsolete all the plans made for a mild future. What’s even worse, many climate scientists know this, but still claim to make precise prognoses. The business with the future is really great, especially when the speculation involves no risk, or if others have to bear the costs of the forecasts.”

Brandt is sure that the climatologists of 2040 will need a good supply of excuses for the climatologists of today, and suggests some for the newspapers of 2040:
‘Well, that was the state of the science back then.’
or:
The models were correct, they just under-estimated this one factor.’
Brandt adds:
Perhaps you can send your suggestions for excuses to PIK in Potsdam.”
He then presents tables of the strengths of impacts of various climate drivers for Europe. We see that Europe’s climate is significantly coupled to the Gulf Stream. If the Gulf Stream were to weaken, then forget about mild winters. Winters in England could become like winters in Newfoundland. Brandt summarizes:
If you still haven’t heard from the climate debate which climate factors must be taken into account when making regional forecasts, it certainly isn’t CO2.”
Brandt does say that CO2 will have an impact over larger timescales, i.e. 1000 years.  But who knows where the climate will be in 1000 years. The earth could be back into an ice age. The earth could also be obliterated by an asteroid. You choose the scenario! Brandt writes:
Over the very short term (2-50 years) and short-term (50-100 years) climate prognoses for continents, especially Europe, depend on a number of unpredictable factors. For the next 1000 years, the Gulf Stream is the decisive factor. Even changes in air currents have similar impacts as CO2 does. Over time, the earth’s orbital parameters, random volcanic eruptions, and, in a 1000 years, again the earth’s orbit will have huge impacts. That alone is already an explosive mixture for every climate computer model, in which the most important factor is still not even accounted for: the Gulf Stream.
If that doesn’t convince you that the models and claims made by climate institutes like PIK in Potsdam are useless crap at best, then you truly belong among the fundamentalists in the AGW religion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe excellent SOLARKRITIK.de here  brings our attention to a very recent clip of Hans Schellnhuber in an interview with ZDF German Public television (July 3, 2011). Note how master-planner Schellnhuber just cannot control his itch to rewrite international law.

Again climate lies from Professor Schellnhuber
He now claims that the 2°C limit of global warming, which is the invention of Schellnhuber’s own junk science at the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Crackpots (PIK), is “Völkerrechtlich anerkannt“, i.e. in English: “recognized by international law”. Here’s what the man Schellnhuber said:
The emissions of the global greenhouse gas, CO2, must again start to sink globally at the latest by 2020, otherwise we will have no chance of reaching the 2-degree C limit recognized by international law – the Earth’s warming must be limited to 2°C.
At the 19 sec. mark, the video repeats “das Völkerrechtlich anerkannt 2°C”  a number of times just so listeners can be sure they heard it right.
That the 2°C is recognized by international law is a flat out lie, a fantasy of Schellnhuber’s growing desperation. It is not international law. The 2°C limit is, however, one of the cornerstones of his masterplan to transform society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Alfred Wegener Institute has issued a press release about a comprehensive study on the erosion of Arctic coastlines it has recently released. Many media outlets in Germany were busy peddling the “dramatic results” over the last day or so. So what data do we have to back up all the drama? Only about 10 years worth, it turns out.
Dramatic! Most coastlines are stable or actually agrading. (Source: Alfred Wegener Institute)
Excerpts of the AWI press release (emphasis added):
The coastline in Arctic regions reacts to climate change with increased erosion and retreats by half a metre per year on average.  This means substantial changes for Arctic ecosystems near the coast and the population living there. A consortium of more than thirty scientists from ten countries, including researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association and from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, comes to this conclusion in two studies published in Estuaries and Coasts and online on www.arcticcoasts.org. They jointly investigated over 100,000 kilometres and thus a fourth of all Arctic coasts and their results have now been published for the first time.”
I’d think data from up there is probably rather scant going back more than 10 years, certainly when you go back 50 years or more.
The changes are particularly dramatic in the Laptev, East Siberian and Beaufort Seas, where coastal erosion rates reach more than 8 metres a year in some cases. Since around a third of the world’s coasts are located in the Arctic permafrost, coastal erosion may affect enormous areas in future.”
Two thirds of the Arctic coasts do not consist of rock, but of frozen soft substrate (permafrost). And precisely these coasts are extremely hard hit by erosion. As a rule, Arctic regions are quite thinly populated. However, as nearly everywhere in the world, the coasts in the far north are important axes for economic and social life. The growing need for global energy resources as well as increasing tourism and freight transport additionally intensify anthropogenic influence on the coastal regions of the Arctic. For wild animal stocks, like the great caribou herds of the north, and the widespread freshwater lakes near the coast progressive erosion brings about significant changes in ecological conditions.

This looks more and more like a touchy feely nature documentary we often see on TV. No one lives there, yet it has an economic impact? Ice ages have also had an impact on these regions, like being covered by a mile of ice. Most animals get a bit disturbed by that too.
‘When systematic data acquisition began in 2000, detailed information was available for barely 0.5% of the Arctic coasts,’ says Dr. Hugues Lantuit from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).”
10 years of data? That’s it? That’s enough to call the situation dramatic?

These are impacts due to weather. We have little historical data with which to compare this to. Coastal erosion has been around since we have had oceans and seas. I seriously doubt there is much there except a subtle plea for more funding. Finding a spot or two along the Arctic shores with 8 meters of erosion makes for nice headlines.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the bitter cold and snowfall forecast for the days ahead in northern and central Europe, this winter is truly shaping up to be the 3rd consecutive hard winter to batter Europe with snow and cold. This of course all flies in the face of projections made 10 years ago and even less. I thought now is a good time to bring up what the consensus and settled science told us 10 years ago.
The Independent brought us an infamous story that has become a favorite of the climate realists, click here, titled:

Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past
Britain’s winter ends tomorrow with further indications of a striking environmental change: snow is starting to disappear from our lives.
According to Dr David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia,within a few years winter snowfall will become ‘a very rare and exciting event’.
‘Children just aren’t going to know what snow is,’ he said.”

And what gets printed by The Independent in March gets used for April Fools Day by Der Spiegel, read here, article dated 1 April 2000:

Snow never again?
Influenced by man, temperatures will continue to rise here with a certainty of 95%. In Germany the bitter cold winters belong to the past: ‘Winter with deep frosts and a lot of snow like 20 years ago will no longer occur at our latitudes”, says scientist Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg”
Damn that 5%! To be honest, it seems like Der Spiegel has April Fools climate stories every day.
Finally, WDR German public television talk show “Hart aber fair” (Hard but fair) featured the following topic on January 17, 2007, i.e. less than three years ago!

Warmer winters, broken climate – welcome to the hot future?

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to locate the video clip of that show. But it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to imagine what that discussion was like.
Today things are indeed very different. Suddenly all the talk of warm winters in central Europe has disappeared from the media radar. Instead all the talk is now about hard winters coming to Europe – due to global warming, of course.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Der Spiegel here reports on Ottmar Edenhofer, who once admitted that reducing CO2 emissions was really all about redistributing global wealth.
Edenhofer is a UN economist and researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and is responsible delivering the economic arguments for conducting the Great Transformation to a decarbonized society.
How much is it going to cost? According to Der Spiegel and Edenhofer, so far except for lots of wild ass guesses, there are no real reliable figures available.
Recently it was reported that it would require only a “mere” 12 trillion by 2025, read here. That IPCC WG3 report, read here contains a lot of “ifs” and “maybes” scattered over a broad spectrum. Even Edenhofer sees a huge information deficit. Der Spiegel writes:
‘Everyone talks about renewable energies, but no one knows the costs exactly’, he said on Monday at a press meeting in Berlin. He too was amazed at how bad the state of information was.
In the report 120 researchers tried to derive an estimate of the costs of renewable energy. They rummaged through studies and databanks, and what they found was hardly satisfactory. ‘The data have a wide range and are often not critically checked over’, Edenhofer reported.”
So the proponents of the Great Transformation have no ideas how much it is going to cost. Yet we can be sure that energy will be much more expensive, and much more expensive energy and food are going to cost the poor lots of money and so many lives. So what does one do when there is such broad uncertainty? Der Spiegel writes:

In the end the IPCC scientists could only present numbers accompanied with error bars, said Edenhofer. Politicians, who expect clear recommendations, were aggravated by this.”
For Germany, switching to renewables also means revamping the entire power transmission grid. For example windparks in the North Sea will need power lines to bring the power inland and to the south. Everything would have to be integrated with the current system. There’s very little literature available to show how much this would cost. Edenhofer says:
The integrations costs cannot be determined from the literature. There’s a large factor of uncertainty. Whoever converts systems has to anticipate many surprises.”
Edenhofer also sees no reduction in CO2 emissions without a binding global CO2 treaty. As long as there is no treaty with teeth, CO2 emissions will continue to rise.
Kyoto successor will be buried in Durban
So what are the chances of getting a treaty in Durban next year? Der Spiegel quotes Edenhofer:
I have the impression that the successor to Kyoto will be buried there.”
Let’s hope he is right – permanently. But Edenhofer has not lost all hope. According to Der Spiegel, he belives the chances of getting a climate treaty will be good in 2014 – after the release of the next IPCC assessment report.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClearly there is a pattern. We’ve seen it with Bill Clinton, allegedly Al Gore, and now we have the IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the Socialist Party France.They are all proponents of a powerful, domineering state that demands citizens bend to its will. Submit to the state and all shall be well, the statists tell us.
It’s all over the news today. But unlike Al Gore, Strauss-Kahn is not that central to the global warming religion, and so there’s much less at stake with him getting arrested.
What is it about some people that leads them to believe everyone else has to bend to their will? They are so convinced of themselves, elitist, all-knowing, believe they have all the answers and expect everyone to follow their instructions.
In climate science, they (politicians, activists like Al Gore, and a number of scientists) demand everyone else fall to their knees and start acting according to their instructions. “Don’t do this, don’t do that – do this and do that. Stop resisting – you know you want it…”
Giving instructions while being the beneficiaries of the consequences of the instructions is fun. But notice how they rarely ever follow their own instructions. They continue their lives of private jets, mansions and pleasure. They sure do like it on top, don’t they?
I’m not passing blanket judgement. But I am saying beware of people who constantly and habitually demand we bend and submit to their will – especially when the science is bad and it serves to satiate a personal need. Throw in power, arrogance, and a lack of checks and balances, and soon you get disaster.
Of course we have to wait and see the results of the investigation before concluding. Clearly it’s another case of the weak up against the very powerful. The political deck is firmly stacked against the young woman – good luck reaching justice. The bearer of truth here once again will probably come out of this smeared, ruined – a victim for a second time.
If a smear campaign is launched against the victim, or if a huge amount of hush money gets paid, then we’ll know the truth. Rules for you, but not for me.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI get really nervous, I have to admit, when the President of the United States, who happens to be a leftist ideologue, sits down with really powerful people who happen to be the biggest players in the US Internet and communication technology. Politics the Chicago-way is not exclusive to Chicago.
This is the table where deals are made. “Cheers to helping me out”.
Obama meets with Internet and Technology executives. (Photo source: White House release, by Pete Souza)
 You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch yours. Corporations don’t make big changes in business plans and policy unless there are very promising incentives to do so. And the President of the United States is someone who is fully capable of delivering such incentives.
Is this really about creating jobs? A little. But anyone can tell you that the CEOs attending this dinner are capable of only creating so many jobs – a number that wouldn’t even change the US unemployment statistics.
Everyone also knows that most jobs get created by the small to medium-size companies. Give small business some incentives, and watch the economy take off. Yet, no one was there at the dinner to represent them.
Small and medium-size business are being ignored. And we already know how strained the relations between the representative of the these businesses, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Obama Administration are. I’d have to conclude that this meeting was not really about jobs, but about how to win next year’s election, and how to turn the tide of politics back to where it was 2 years ago.
One important way to do this would be to take stronger control over the internet. Doing this by law would backfire, of course. So just let the companies do the dirty work for you.
Take a look at some of the persons in attendence:

Eric Schmidt, Google
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
Dick Costolo, Twitter
Carol Bartz, Yahoo!
Steve Jobs, Apple
John Chambers, Cisco Systems
Larry Ellison, Oracle
Reed Hastings, CEO, NetFlix

Although these people won’t be able to create enough jobs to solve USA’s economic crisis, they are capable of rescuing Obama’s presidency with lots of money and assisting in providing “better communication” to the public. Again, it makes me nervous. Obama is fighting a war not in Iraq or Afghanistan, but at home.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany of you may have noticed that Steve Goddard at his Real Science site has recently posted a number of similar articles, putting to rest that weather extremes are exclusive to today (because of our CO2 emissions). Indeed they were just as frequent in the past.
This story here is just the latest, from online Der Spiegel titled: Tree Rings Witness To Devestating Droughts.
Der Spiegel starts by mentioning that Mexican construction workers in 2007  in Tula had excavated into an ancient Toltec chamber which held the skeletons of 24 youths, all under the age of 15. Among the bones were small statues of the god of rain, Tlaloc. The children had not died of natural causes, but had been sacrificed – in the year 1150 AD.
They had been the victims of futile weather appeasement rituals performed by high priests.
Tree rings show extreme droughts in the past
A recent study by author David Stahle, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, shows that an ancient drought, previously confirmed for the U.S. Southwest, extended into central Mexico from 1149 to 1167, and thus likely delivered the potentially fatal blow to the Toltec culture.
Photo credit: David Stahle
Stahle and his co-authors assembled a new and complete 1,238-year-long tree-ring chronology – the longest and most accurate of its kind – for ancient Mexico and Central America (or Mesoamerica). It  is the first to reconstruct the yearly climate of pre-colonial Mexico over more than a millennium and identifies four ancient megadroughts down  to their exact years.
Stahle’s team used 30 specimens of the more than 1000 year old Montezuma bald cypress trees near Tenochtitlan, which served as the captial of the Aztec empire, and Tula. Our amazing planet.com writes:
Tree rings give a precise estimate for wetness for every single year, Stahle said. The researchers determined the year of formation for each tree ring and analyzed what the rings’ growth patterns had to say about how soil moisture varied from growth season to growth season over the years, a parameter directly associated with rainfall.”

Stahle and his team stumbled upon the reason why these children had been sacrificed: Severe droughts had been decimating the Toltec population, and so the Aztec priests appear to have had the children sacrificed to in a bid to end the weather extreme that had gripped the region and parched their agricultural activity. Der Spiegel writes:
For many years the fields yielded too few crops to feed the people. At the end, the drought was so bad that the residents of Tula offered the god of rain the blood of children in a bid to gain back mercy – but the drought stayed.”
The drought lasted 18 years, from 1149 to 1167, forcing an entire generation to grow up under constatnt hunger and killing thousands. Der Spiegel also writes that another major drought could be easily discerned from the tree-ring chronology, one beginning in the year 1514, five years before Cortez and the Conquistadors landed on the Mexican beaches, and ending in 1539.  Like the Toltecs, the Aztecs also performed human sacrifices. Der Spiegel:
Similar to the Toltecs, the Aztecs tried to appease god of rain Tlaloc; archeologists discovered the skeletons of 42 executed children in the large pyramids of the Aztec capital if Tenochtitlan.”
Strangely the ouramazingplanet.com article issues a message of warning to today’s societies, though probably not the one it intended. University of Tennessee/Knoxville archaeologist David Anderson says:
This study will prompt a great deal of follow-up research by archaeologists and paleoclimatologists alike, and offers lessons for our own civilization — specifically how vulnerable complex societies may be to drought-induced crop failures.”
If any lesson ought to be learned from all this, it is that rain-dancing and performing rituals to appease the weather gods with the aim to prevent “weather extremes” is not only ineffective, but is pure madness.
The difference today is that at least Toltecs and Aztecs waited until things were really desperate before embarking on their madness. In today’s modern world, at the very height of human prosperity, we have science lunatics proposing the same mad behaviour in a bid to prevent weather extremes in a distant future – based on tea leaves and crystal balls.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a look into a climate science debate conference between skeptics and warmists that took place last month in Potsdam, Germany. The skeptics are scientists from the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) and the warmists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
In October 2010 PIK Director Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber invited (reluctantly after some controversy) the skeptic EIKE scientists for a scientific colloquium on the subject of climate change with the aim of clearing up misundertandings that had flared up earlier. For years skeptic scientists had been denied the opportunity to debate the issue, and so thus advance science.
EIKE requested that I translate their conference report.
While PIK, which is massively funded by the state, is convinced of an approaching climate catastrophe, EIKE, on the other hand, views the science behind man-made catastrophic climate change with deep skepticism, and has acted as Germany’s spokesman for skeptic or non-alarmist scientists. EIKE has been the targeted and often denied a voice by the media and warmist scientists. It is run on a shoestring through private funding.
The following is a translation of EIKE’s protocol, see here for the original German (Note: some parts were condensed to remove clutter).
Translation:
———————————————————————————– 
Participants:
PIK: Dr. Georg Feulner, Eva Gaigg, Prof. Dr. Friedrich Gerstengarbe, Dr. Veronika Huber, Dr. Brigitte Knopf, Claudia Köhler, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Kropp, Prof. Dr. Anders Levermann, Dr. Jörg Pietsch, Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Prof. Dr. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Dr. Thomas Schneider von Deimling, Mareike Schodder, Jonas Viering. External participants for PIK: Tanja Fröhlich, Prof. Dr. Uwe Ulbrich
 
EIKE: Dr. Siegfried Dittrich Prof. Dr. Karl-­‐Friedrich Ewert, Michael Limburg, Prof. Dr. Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke, Klaus-­‐Eckart Puls; EIKE guests Dr. Alexander Hempelmann, Dr.Rainer Link, Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, Prof. Dr. Werner Weber
Date: April 2011
Location: Potsdam Telegrafenberg
The conference began with a presentation by Dr Feulner of the PIK, and then was followed by four presentations by EIKE scientists. All participants were aware that great differences existed beforehand between PIK and EIKE on the development of the global climate, reliability of models, interpretation of datasets, greenhouse effect, extreme weather frequency, sea level rise etc.
Before the conference, information exchanges mainly took place indirectly via media publications, the Internet and events like conferences and symposiums.  These discussions were often extremely heated, and so this face-to-face meeting was to serve as a professional way of exchanging information to avoid misunderstandings and to discuss controversial topics directly.
Opening
Prof. Schellnhuber opened the conference with a short statement at 1:40 pm and spoke about the circumstances that leading up to the invitstion [1]. He then explained why PIK, acting as the host of the event, wished no media attention although this had been suggested by EIKE, and expressed astonishment that EIKE planned to hold a press conference after the conclusion of the conference. He then opened the conference.
Michael Limburg (EIKE Vice President) expressed his thanks for the invitation and the opportunity to discuss scientific knowledge among each other.
“State Of Climate Science“
Dr Feulner then started his presentation: “State of Climate Science“ (see  Feulner). He presented the development of trends, as to PIK. The discussion after the presentation was lively. Dr Vahrenholt doubted the presented influence of solar activity (Feulner pegged at 0.1°K and so called it slight) referring to the newest findings from (Shapiro et al 2011) where the TSI-increase from the Little Ice Age until today was possibly 6 times higher than assumed in AR4. Also a paper from January 2010 from Solomon was referred to, where the cooling over the last 10 years has something to do with the 10% reduction in water vapour in the stratosphere.
It was also pointed out that GISS, in generating a “global temperature”, showed Arctic temperatures even though there exist nowhere near enough measurement stations there, as is also the case in Antarctica.
Dr Rainer Link also pointed out that the temperature oscillations of the oceans like the AMO, PDO, El Nino etc. are not accounted for in the models, and that the models cannot predicts them. But Dr Rahmstorf objected. Dr Feulner explained his claim that no decreasing trend in the recent global mean temperature can be discerned because a short-term look of less than 30 years doesn’t allow it. The climate models would not have a fine enough resolution to allow it. EIKE disagreed with this view by pointing out public data like from Hadley Center and UEA, which show no temperature increase since 1998.  Although it is correct, said EIKE, that a climate reference value of at least 30 years should be used, one has to recognise that the models used so far cannot appropriately show the last 10 – 15 years.
“Sun and Climate“ 
Dr Weber then started his presentation “Sun and Climate” at 2:20 pm “ (see short version here). In the brief first part, he showed the expected saturation of CO2 by the atmosphere. Today about 50% of anthropogenically emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere, while at the start of the industrial times all CO2 emitted by man remained in the atmosphere because of the equilibrium that existed between ocean and atmosphere. Then Dr Weber introduced the resulting differential equation that leads to an exponential saturation of atmospheric CO2 absorption in the most simple model with constant CO2 emission. At approx ca. 4 ppm annual CO2 emission, which is what we have today, saturation is at about 500 ppm CO2. Weber also pointed out that it is scientific practice to use the simplest models for public showing and then discuss subsequent tweaking and corrections. The necessary corrections and model limits would then be added.

//-->




In the main part of the presentation, Dr Weber looked at the indirect influence by the active sun on climate, caused by an up to 20% reduction in cosmic radiation by the solar magnetic field, which in turn eventually leads to an increase in solar radiation reaching the earth. These trends, which Weber had found in earlier solar data, had been doubted by Dr Feulner (PIK) in a paper. Then the presentation went on mainly about the quality of analyses on both sides. Unfortunately Dr Weber only had a preliminary and unclearly formulated version of Feulner’s paper at his disposal, and as a result Mr Weber assumed a technical error by Mr Feulner. Misunderstanding resulted and eventually the accusation of a technical error was cleared up. It was agreed that the final version of Feulner paper would be discussed in detail by Dr. A. Hempelmann, who had started a cooperation in this field with Weber.
“Climate Sensitivity of CO2 “
Next Dr Rainer Link made his presentation on “Climate Sensitivity of CO2“, (see short version), beginning with the well-known saying about science: “Every theory in science is accepted only when it is confirmed by observation. A single observation that contradicts the theory is sufficient to refute it. The postulated water vapour positive feedback in the models is the essential part of the alarmist forecast for temperature increase by the climate model cannot be confirmed by a single observation. To the contrary, it has been refuted on multiple times.“A Hot Spot in the middle to upper troposphere in the tropical regions could not be found by hundreds of balloon measurements. That therefore eliminates the possibility that the climate system would go out of control because of CO2 and the subsequent water vapour positive feedback. That also impacted the so-called 2°C target. Link calculated the temperature increase from a doubling of CO2 at a max. of 1.6°K ; however, it is probably significantly less (quoted Lindzen, Paltridge, Harde and others). Thus there is no reason for climate alarmism. Taking part in the controversial discussion in addition to Dr Link, were Dr Schellnhuber, Dr Rahmstorf, Mr Puls, Dittrich and Dr Huber. Dr Rahmstorf pointed out that the ice ages could not be explained by Milankowitch cycles alone and had to have been caused by the CO2 induced water vapour feedbacks, but could not deliver the evidence. The rise in temperature after each ice age is not the consequence of higher CO2 concentrations, but rather the higher CO2 concentrations result from the warming oceans. The arguments presented by Dr Link could not be convincingly refuted by the PIK participants.
 “Extreme weather and sea level“
After the coffee break, meteorologist Klaus-Eckert Puls made his presentation: “Extreme Weather and Sea Levels“ (see Presentation – long version). Mr Puls talked about how the public had been bombarded by countless, and at times absurd, warnings on weather and climate over the last 10 years. These warnings were aimed at producing the impression of an already started climate catastrophe. Moreover: In the public (media and politicians!) results from climate models from climate institutes are often presented as prognoses without the advisory that they are in fact only scenarios that entail large uncertainty. Puls suggested –  analogous to the Hamburg Declaration on long-term weather prognoses made by meteorologists – that PIK and EIKE draw up and agree on a so-called “Potsdam Declaration” with the objective of mutually setting the record straight concerning false or exaggerated statements in the media. No reply from the PIK with respect to this suggestion, and no mention of it in the conclusion (Schellnhuber).
Using charts, graphics, statistics and quotes from a variety of institutes, Mr Puls showed that after 150 years of global warming, weather agencies worldwide have found no 100-year trends in middle latitude cyclones, tropical storms, tornadoes, flooding and other weather events. Moreover, using a series of sea level measurements and satellite data from their own institutes and from the IPCC, the expected acceleration in sea level rise is nowhere to be found. Dr Rahmstorf noted that there are other datasets out there. Puls and Rahmstorf agreed to exchange their data. Concerning the 100-year trends documented at the German North Sea coast by K.-E. Behre (B., NIHK Wilhelmshaven), Puls in a debate with Dr Kropp pointed out that Behre did not take temperature into account and that Behre detected a deceleration in sea level rise over the last 400 years, particularly during the 20th century.
Global long-term temperature series
Dr Horst-­‐Joachim Lüdecke began his presentation “Global Longterm Temperature Series“ (see short version here). At the start, the various versions of the Mannian temperature reconstructions over the last 1000 years were clear. Dr Lüdecke and others termed them as clear falsification, whereby Dr Rahmstorf demanded proof of that claim. He was then refered to the comprehensive works of McIntyre and McKitrick. And it is very well summarised in Andrew Montford’s book: The Hockeystick Illusion“.
The core conclusion of the studies by Lüdecke and Ewert – backed by comprehensive statistical analysis intensive of auto correlation (persistence) on thousands of temperature series is: “There is nothing unusual about the warming of the 20th century.“ After a drop in temperature in the years before, there was a mostly naturally caused warming once the man-made influences of the UHI are removed. It is easily recognizable. Similar and often times even more pronounced fluctuations can be observed in the past over the last 2000 years. They were all caused naturally. Dr Schellnhuber and Dr Kropp both engaged in the lively discussion that followed. Dr Schellnhuber noted that the paper quoted by Dr Lüdecke (which Schellnhuber himself co-authored and confirmed missing warming) was a paper where Dr Kropp was the project leader with the University of Giessen. Dr Schellnhuber remarked that the result was in any case no smoking gun (against CO2-induced warming?). Dr Rahmstorf added that the statistic was “blind“ to the physics. This was rejected by Dr Lüdecke and Dr Link. Dr Kropp then pointed out that the methods that were used are still in development.
Summary
It is obvious that the participants were for the most part in agreement with the perception of the facts – the absence of increased weather extremes being unchallenged by PIK speaks volumes. The methods for assessing these facts however appear to differ. While the participants from EIKE put unconditional priority on physical measurements, climate impact research has to rely on models calculations for future orientation. It would be desirable if this difference were better known among the generally uninformed public. For the truthful informing of laymen, it is not helpful when popular presentations are made by scientists in which catastrophic weather extreme increases are reported as being attributed to anthropogenic climate change, in contradiction to measured facts.
Conclusion: Thanks and return invitation:
On behalf of the guests Mr Limburg expressed thanks for the open discussion and that they would gladly like to continue as the debate, as in EIKE’s view they were especially fruitful. Mr Limburg invited the PIK colleagues for an orderly meeting for late summer of this year – to which there was no objection.
The conference was ended with a short speech by Dr Schellnhuber somewhat behind schedule at 5:50 pm. He thanked the participants for their work and for the almost always factual discussion. He also remarked that he assumed there would be a fair treatment of PIK at the ensuing press conference. In response Mr Limburg invited him to join it. Mr Schellnhuber declined as he had another private matter to attend to, but named some of his colleagues to attend.

———————————————————————–
Some additional notes: Michael Limburg has informed me that PIK scientists have turned down EIKE’s invitation to continue the exchanges. And it is rather peculiar that the PIK objected and refused the presence of the media, and expressed reservations that EIKE held a press conference afterwards.
From the report one gets the impression that PIK puts a lot faith in climate models and is suspicious observations that do not conform to their models. In real science one ought to be suspicious of models that do not conform to real-life observations. Michael Limburg also added in his e-mail:
The scientific position and ability of PIK scientists during that meeting was rather weak. Whenever they had to agree that observation do not show any special increase neither in extreme weather, temperature nor sea level and so on, they mentioned: ‘But our models show…’ “
That their science is weak ought not be a surprise. What else could one possibly expect from a science that ignores observations and relies on models?

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch offers more interesting insights on skeptics, alarmists, the role of the media, politics, scientists etc. at his Klimazwiebel site, read here and here (in German).He answered quite a number questions as part of an “Expert Interview – Climate Change and Media”.  I picked out only some of the questions and his answers. There is quite a bit there.
Indeed Prof von Storch has plenty of criticisim for both sides (not surprisingly). In summary, Prof. von Storch advises the media, politics and scientists to stick more to their roles, and to stay away from one extreme or the other.
Q: How do you perceive public communication on anthropogenic climate change in Germany?
HvS:  The communication has improved considerably over the last year since ClimateGate, the IPCC blunders and the failure of COP-15.  The talk has become less dramatic, as well-known alarmists can longer be so sure with the attention of the public.
Q: In your view how should successful public communication of anthropogenic climate change be set-up?
HsV: Less positive is the tendency to moralise and to propagandise, like Germany should be a model for the rest of the world while countries like China and USA are to be demonized. The communication on one side should present the scientifically supported perspectives as factual supplementary conditions for decision-making, while on the other hand highlighting as political options the possibilities for making decisions by politics and society (i.e. decided by values).
Q: What has to improve with the public communication of anthropogenic climate change and what has to happen so that it gets better?
HvS: More openness to questions and skepticism; more skepticism with respect to the alarmists (i.e. the ones who have the more interesting “stories” for the media and politics); more resistance to attempts at using single events as proof that supports far-reaching statements (like on the irrelevance of the man-made greenhouse effect) on climate dynamics; caution in the argumentative use of the latest scientific findings (much in Nature and Science later turns out to be in need of revision); evaluating scientific results from the methodical points of view, and less from the point of view of political application.
Q: How do you assess the current situation in climate research?
HsV: The situation in climate research as much improved over the last year– to the extent that the discussion is more open. The influence of political circles and cartels has decreased some.

Q: What’s going well, and where are there problems?
HsV: Climate science finds itself in a post-normal phase where the mixture of politics and science is mutually beneficial to both. That doesn’t mean that the scientific process itself is damaged, but there is a need for a discussion in public on what role science should play.
Q: What must be improved and what must happen in order for things to get better?
HsV: The practice observed up to now of  “stealth advocate scientists“, i.e. of scientists who, without saying it, put their science in service of a certain political matter, needs to be stopped.
Q: What trends in the media in Germany with respect to communication on global climate change do you see?
HvS: Since about one year, the reporting has gotten more critical and open.
Q: What’s the deal with the interest of the media? Could you give us a current example?
HsV: The interest by the media was very considerable for a period of about 2 months after the events surrounding COP-15, ClimateGate and the IPCC revelations, but then faded. Alarmist reports have become somewhat less lately, also during COP-16 in Cancun. Obviously there seems to be an interest in better researched background reports.
Q: Over the last years, what impact have the increased number of skeptics had on the public communication of anthropogenic climate change?
I don’t believe the number of skeptics has gone up; more are just admitting it. I think there have always been latent reservations also among other professors from physics, geology and other areas. These reservations are now being more explicitly expressed. Many of these people are so-called “skeptics“. They are not oil-industry seduced hacks.
Q: In your opinion how does the future constellation between, climate science, climate politics and the media appear?
HsV: Hopefully in such a way that all three of these players start accepting more and more their own roles and functions, particularly I hope the media find their way back to accompanying science and politics more critically also in the climate field.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSlowly, but surely, more and more people in Germany are speaking up against the hoax that is man-made global warming. Websites and blogs are sprouting and scepticism is spreading. The old, established narrative is now being seriously challenged.
The latest example is a piece written by Ronald Gläser in the online news and commentary magazine called eigentümlich frei:
Brutal Media Campaign Against Climate ‘Deniers’
For starters, Gläser calls the 10:10 no pressure film “only the latest high point in the ongoing campaign against climate sceptics”.
In the run-up to the climate conference in Cancun, which starts on November 30, the propaganda machinery of the academic-media complex will get even shriller.
Gläser then cites the slanderish Der Spiegel piece called Science As The Enemy which suggests only a handful of US scientists are sowing doubt on the AGW theory, and that “97% of all climatologists support the theory”. Gläser equates this Der Spiegel claim to communist East German propoganda.
This is a percentage that not by coincidence reminds of the old Communist East German election results.

The Der Spiegel hit-piece was designed to intimidate other scientists into silence. Gläser writes;
This is Mao’s favorite principle: Educate hundreds by punishing one.
Gläser then provides the background on the resignation of University of California Santa Barbara professor Hal Lewis from the American Physical Society (APS), after having been a member for 67 years. Gläser summarises:
With his open letter he has shown again, for the zillionth time, what’s behind the so-called consensus on the topic of global warming: nothing!

Here’s another “global warming is good for everything that’s bad, and bad for everything that’s good” story. Now according to the online Swiss suedostschweiz.ch:
Ticks could become more dangerous because climate change favours infected ticks. That’s the conclusion that researchers of the University of Neuenburg concludes. The study was supported the Swiss Nation Fund.”
Scientists claim that the infected blood-sucking critters live longer when it’s warmer. Every year 10,000 Swiss people are infected with the Lyme-Borreliose.
A team led by Lise Gern have been studying the Holzbock tick over 10 years and found they have become increasingly infected during that period. The Suedostschweiz.de says:
Climate warming could have enhanced this trend, the researchers fear.”
Could?
====================================================
Inflation In Germany and Europe Jumps
This certainly is no surprise to anyone. When sources of energy are villainized and citizens are forced to buy more and more expensive energy, plus the senseless shut own of nuclear power plants, eventually these dumb policies start having an impact on supply chains. The online Mitteldeutsche Zeitung here reports:
Consumer prices climbed in march like in February on a year earlier another 2.1 percent. That’s the highest increase in two and half years, according to the German Federal Office of Statistics. Foremost energy prices are fuelling inflation. Energy increased in price in March 10 percent. Heating oil (+ 32.8 percent) as well as gasoline and diesel (+ 11.2 percent) were at the top of the list. But also electric bills climbed sharply (+ 7.6 percent).”
There are no “coulds” here – just hard reality. The price of food, which requires substantial energy to produce, also jumped 2.2%. Unfortunately political shift to renewable energy has barely gotten underway, and so these increases are only a tiny sampling of what is in store should Europe plunge fully into the renewable energy madness.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere is no energy shortage. What we have is a shortage of energy that we are ALLOWED to be used.
The list of energies we are allowed to use just keeps getting shorter. Techno-politico elitists are busily crossing out everything on the list, like coal, nuclear, all petroleum products, wood, and biofuels. The latest to join that list is the hope of the future: natural gas, this according to the The Hill blogsite here.
Recently there has been a flurry of reports of huge natural gas reserves in shale formations that are abundant enough to supply the world’s energy needs for decades, read here.
The Hill has posted a draft of a new study from scientists at Cornell University that concludes that natural gas mined by using hydraulic fracturing is even more dangerous than burning coal due to high fugitive methane emissions. The study will appear in the “Climatic Change Letters“.
Natural gas-fired power plants were once viewed as the ideal supplement to balance out the irregular supply of wind and solar energy. Coal and nuclear power plants are unable to react quickly enough to fluctuations in supply and demand. The Hill has posted the entire paper – here’s the abstract:
Abstract:
We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high-volume hydraulic fracturing from shale formations, focusing on methane emissions. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, and 3.6% to 7.9% of the methane from shale-gas production escapes to the atmosphere in venting and leaks over the life-time of a well. These methane emissions are at least 30% more than and perhaps more than twice as great as those from conventional gas. The higher emissions from shale gas occur at the time wells are hydraulically fractured — as methane escapes from flow-back return fluids — and during drill out following the fracturing. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. Methane contributes substantially to the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas on shorter time scales, dominating it on a 20-year time horizon. The footprint for shale gas is greater than that for conventional gas or oil when viewed on any time horizon, but particularly so over 20 years. Compared to coal, the footprint of shale gas is at least 20% greater and perhaps more than twice as great on the 20-year horizon and is comparable when compared over 100 years.”
No problem, let’s just set up more windmills, enviro-nutjobs and kooks may say. But these plants, aside from their technical problems, are now facing grassroots opposition as well.
This is where we stand today. We are literally standing on huge reserves of cheap natural energies, just waiting to be taken, yet some zealot, power-mad earth-nannies, armed with nothing more than climate change wive tales, are telling us we have to go without.

According to The Star Phoenix:

A group of ferocious Australian crocodiles were so traumatised by a maximum-strength cyclone last week that they hid under water and stopped eating, wildlife park officials said Friday.

Because the Star Phoenix doesn’t say it, I’ll do it for them: Man and his carbon emissions are responsible for the trauma the poor crocodiles had to endure!
No reports on whether crocodile counselors have been dispatched to the area to assist the crocodiles in dealing with the emotional scars of their days-long ordeal. And if counselors were sent, there are no reports of any coming back.
How long have crocodiles been on the planet?

The latest press release from the Helmholtz Institute, in Geestacht, Germany features Professor Hans von Storch and reports that he has been placed on the List Of The Top 100 Influential Germans by FOCUS magazine, who have dubbed him “The Climate Realist”.
Again, for the 2nd time this week, kudos to FOCUS.
Hans von Storch is a warmist (in name only?), and says man is having an impact on the climate. But unlike his paranoid colleagues at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research, whose neurotic science foresees only doom, gloom and catastrophe unless global society immediately suspends democracy and implements a radical and massive wealth redistribution scheme, von Storch prefers to stay within the realms of science and reason – both in practice and in function. Here’s what the Helmholtz press release says (excerpt, translated in English):
Hans von Storch, 61, The Climate Realist — apocalyptic bluster is foreign to him. Smart adaptation to change is Hans von Storch’s credo. The climate scientist from the University of Hamburg is not one of the skeptics, but is convinced like the majority of  his expert colleagues, that global warming is taking place. And because over the last years many exaggerations in climate scenarios have become known, his solid scientific argumentation is gaining more attention.”
‘Climate research is always a project involving many colleagues whose mutual findings can yield a certain amount of influence. Still, I’m pleased to be named because it demonstrates that a realistic approach with climate knowledge is gaining acceptance in the media,’ says Hans von Storch, Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Center in Geesthacht and Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg.

The bit above about “not being one of the skeptics” is just standard CYA stuff. Who hasn’t been convinced that the earth has warmed? The question is: “Over which timescale?”
Personally, I’m been both pleased, and annoyed by von Storch. On one hand he is not an alarmist, and you can be sure he bases that on scientific data. Although I haven’t done a thorough review of his writings, he tends to produce results that fall into the sceptics column (he was one of the first to confirm McIntyre’s demolition of Mann’s hockey stick – which he called Quatsch – which means “nonsense” in English. He’s a skeptic of catastrophic scenarios – that’s pretty clear. He’s been attacked by a hot-headed Rahmstorf a number of times.
Yet, on the other hand, I find him making enough warmist comments without presenting data. It’s not for nothing he calls himself  “the honest broker” at his Klimazwiebel blog,…i.e. someone who takes a position in the middle, on the fence, and often acts to try to resolve opposing differences. One has to remember that in Germany being a skeptic is the same as committing career suicide. The only alternative is to move to the middle.
Give FOCUS credit for putting him on the list. I don’t know if any of the dark knights of climate science horrors from PIK , i.e. Schellnhuber, Rahmstorf or Edenhofer are on the list. I guess we’ll find out Monday when the new issue of FOCUS is available at news stands.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt amazes me how the media take a non-story and inflate it into a “climate time-bomb”.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung has an interview today with Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten, a director at the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), who has been studying the permafrost in Siberia for 20 years now. Not surprisingly he sees signs of some permafrost melt – and why not? After all the globe has warmed about 0.6°C over the last 100 years.
In the interview Hubberten speaks about the scenario of massive permafrost melt and the implications such a scenario would have, but then reminds us that in reality the permafrost is thawing only very slowly, and so it’s no big deal. So what does the media focus on? On the horror scenarios of course, and not the reality.
One of the favorite horror scenarios floated out by AGW alarmists is sub-marine permafrost melt and the associated release of huge quantities of potent greenhouse gas methane, which then could lead to the much dreaded, yet elusive, tipping point.
Hubberten points out that there are 36 million square km of permafrost, which is equal to 25% the size of the earth’s land surface. Much of it lies below the Arctic ocean. The thickness ranges from a couple of meters to 1600 meters in some spots in Siberia. Of course warming and cooling of the climate leads to corresponding changes in the permafrost over time.
Here are some of Hubberten comments on melting permafrost:
1. Impact on sea levels:
It could by the end of the century lead to an additional global sea level rise of a few centimeters. Therefore the permafrost must be studied with the same seriousness as melting glaciers and sea ice.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




This is a not so subtle call for lots more funding.
2. Is the permafrost thawing? According to Hubberten (paraphrasing):
In some areas in Russia within 50 years it has gotten about 20 cm thicker. Right now in treeless regions the upper 50 or 60 cm layer  is thawing. In the forested southern permafrost region up to 5 to 6 meters. The permafrost is warming also at greater depths where temperatures over the entire year range from -5°C to -20°C. We have exact measurements in Alaska for example. At a depth of 20 meters it has warmed 1.5″C over the last 35 years.”
Some places it’s thicker, some places thinner, and some places it is less cold. That shouldn’t be a surprise though because the planet has warmed a bit over the last century. So not really that much has happened.
3. What does Hubberten think about the possibility of a massive methane gas eruption from rapidly thawing permafrost (paraphrasing – emphasis added)?
Much is speculated on this ‘methane climate time-bomb’. In a sceanrio where there is a rapid and complete disintegration of the sub-marine permafrost, there could indeed be a huge methane release into the atmosphere, and from that a considerable global temperature increase from a greenhouse effect. In reality we assume, however, that there is a relatively slow reduction of the submarine permafrost – with a possible slight addition of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.”
Hubberten then throws his pitch for more funding, again, adding:
But, the sub-marine permafrost and the methane  gas hydrates are still mostly not researched and with today’s level of knowledge it is a big factor of uncertainty in the climate system.”
In the end we can safely say that all the permafrost warnings will likely turn out to be like the UN 50-million-refugee-predictions we have all been hearing about the last few days.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf saving the human race from the imminent climate disaster is so imperative, then why did Chancellor Angela Merkel request the immediate shut-down of CO2-saving, technically sound nuclear power plants in an area free of earthquakes or tsunamis?
Merkel suddenly decided that coal power plants emitting 4% more CO2 is no longer a problem.
Not long ago, Chancellor Merkel called climate change due to greenhouse gases emitted by man the greatest crisis facing humanity and said no efforts can be spared in drastically reducing CO2 emissions. So grave was the CO2-climate problem that a massive, society-altering $15 trillion plan was recently unveiled by Brussels, all with the target of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% over the next 40 years.
Suddenly all the imperative and urgency oc climate change gets waved aside.
Veteran author Hartmut Bachmann at Die Freie Welt has written an essay on Angela Merkel’s knee-jerk reaction in ordering the closure of 7 of Germany’s 17 reactors, in a political knee-jerk response to Fukushima. Bachmann writes:
The only energy that can really be delivered free of CO2 on a large scale was and is from nuclear power plants. But these have been ordered shut down without a single mention of  the word – the term – CO2, neither from the government nor – as is expected– from the media. And this was done without any discussion whatsoever on the consequences this would have on the government’s fight for our purported survivial against CO2. This exposes the fight against CO2 as a hoax, as a fiction, that only serves to bilk the citizens rather than serve them.”

The reactors were certified as safe just months ago
The shutdown of the seven reactors, which were deemed completely safe just a few months earlier, and so were granted extended operating times, will now result in much more coal-burning, which of course will increase Germany’s CO2 emissions by a staggering 4%.
Years of painful investment to reduce CO2 are thus being wiped out, all with the snap of a finger, by the once CO2-fearful Merkel.
One has to ask just how threatened is the human race from Co2 after all. Not very much if coal plants spewing millions of tonnes more of CO2 are even safer than allowing technically approved nuclear reactors to run – in an area that is free of tsunamis and earthquakes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn none of the reactors are there processes where there is a danger of something going out of control. The nuclear catastrophe is not taking place.”
That’s quoting Zettels Raum blog description of the deescalating situation at the Fukushima Diichi facility. Zettels Raum blog has been monitoring the Fukushima incident since the start, and reports on the latest.
Water is being pumped into the reactors with high-capacity airport fire fighting vehicles used by the military. A special piece of equipment has been flown in from the USA as well. Zettels raum writes:
Yesterday 44 fire fighting vehicles with 141 firemen arrived from Tokyo. According to the NHK , these are ‘elite units’. One of the vehicles is equipped with an unmanned extinguishing tower that is 22 meters tall and is designed to fight fires that are difficult to reach. In addition the military is using 5 extinguishing vehicles. So far today, 60,000 litres of water have been sprayed onto Block 3. The operation today will last a total of 7 hours.”
Things are getting under control there. But if you listen to the mainstream media to get the news about what is going on, you’ll quickly find yourself buying a Geiger counter, getting iodine tablets and digging a bomb shelter in your back yard. Again, it’s messy work and things don’t happen right away. On the power situation:
NISA has informed that power connections to Blocks 1, 2 , 3 and 4 will be completed on Saturday. In Blocks 5 and 6 the cooling systems have been put into operation.”
Zettels Raum also reports on radiation:
Radiation on the premises is decreasing, but is fluctuating.”
Around the atomic power plant there is a 20-km evacuation zone , and a 30-km zone in which people have been requested to stay indoors. Most measurements taken beyond these zones show higher, but not dangerous, radiation levels (between 0.0005 mSv/hr and 0.052 mSv/hr).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSometimes you have a slow day in climate news and so you have to post something trivial. This is such a post. But it’s short.Hollywood environmental campaigns always seem to involve some “star” who sings and lectures us on saving the planet. But then the star hops on a private jet and flies circles around the globe, smothering it in jet exhaust.
One recent campaign is Disney’s Friends for Change campaign in Germany, which has a promo video featuring singer Selena Gomez. I just couldn’t help but notice in the music video, Make a Wave, that Gomez and her hunk are driving to the beach in a huge gas-guzzling 4WD SUV. Why didn’t they go by foot or by bicycle? At the very least, they could have used a small hybrid car?
I often get the impression that Disney and Hollywood elitists believe CO2 is a gas that is emitted only when “other people” use energy, jets and SUVs, but not when they do.
Reading up about Selena, I see that she’s only 18 years old, and so I won’t blame her. Obviously Hollywood is just exploiting her. I really doubt she knows the first thing about climate. Poor girl is all confused.

ARD public television is Germany’s flagship news channel which broadcasts its “Tagesschau” news at the prime-time slot of 8 p.m. You can compare it to the BBC News (unfortunately its reputation is following the same path).
It’s no secret that the German media has über-hyped the news in Japan in order to über-dramatize the nuclear power plant accident. So dramatic was the response to the incident in Japan that Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered the immediate shutdown of 7 of Germany’s older reactors in order to restore some semblance of calm among Germany’s freaked out population.
As an example of the media’s reckless reporting, Zettels Raum blog here brings our attention to 14 factual errors made in the ARD news last Thursday evening. Zettels Raum writes:
You will probably not want to believe what you are about to read, but it is the truth: In itsPrime-time newscast yesterday at 8 pm, the “Tageschau” reported 2:30 min on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. In these two and half minutes, there were 14 factual errors.”
The Zettels Raum author then lists all 14 errors and corrects them. As a whole, the entire ARD report was what Germans would call a media GAU (huge media meltdown). Of course all the errors, every one of them, served to exaggerate and over-dramatize the situation. I’ll now describe briefly each error.
Error 1: ARD claimed the military used water cannons and helicopters to cool the reactor, when in fact the water cannons were used by the police, and the military used helicopters of the fire department of a military base.
Error 2: ARD claimed that personnel risked their lives. Zettels Raum calls this claim “absurd”, saying that the guidelines for exposure to radiation by workers were fully adhered to.
Error 3:ARD claimed the radiation in the area had increased sharply, when in fact the radiation had dropped from 3. 8 mSv/h to 1.6 mSv/hr.
Error 4:ARD claimed that a video had been published in the Internet showing the destruction, when in fact the video was news footage from an NHK program.
Error 5: ARD claimed that the helicopter that made the video “flew over the reactor grounds,” when in fact  it was 30 km away.
Error 6: ARD claimed that the army way trying to prevent a reactor meltdown, when in fact the risk of such had not been in existence for days. The real concern were for the used fuel rods that were outside of the reactor.

Error 7 and 8: ARD claimed attempts by helicopters and water cannons to cool the reactors were interrupted and so precious time was being lost in the fight against a nuclear catastrophe, when in fact the water cannons were replaced by the more powerful fire-fighting vehicles of the military, and the claim that “precious time was being lost” was freely fabricated by ARD.
Error 9: ARD claimed that there was a hydrogen explosion at the building, in Block 3 an explosion in the building, when in fact the explosions did not occur once “at” and once “in” the building, but with both blocks in the reactor building.
Error 10:ARD claimed that the fuel rods had been exposed at times and that there was an explosion in Block 2 that may have damaged the reactor core and that after a fire the fuel rods were exposed and could not be cooled. But in fact, Zettels Raum blog writes:
A connection between the fire (likely burning lubrication oil) and exposed fuel elements is not known up to now. The elements are no longer suffciently covered by water because the pumps didn’t function, and the water in all cooling ponds – whether there was a fire or not – had evaporated.”
Error 11:And so, ARD claimed that the exposed fuel rods would eventually heat up to the point they would melt,  penetrate the concerte reactor encasing and eventually reach the earth and then radioactively contaminate the groundwater. Zettels Raum calls this claim: “one of the most absurd errors in this “Tagesschau” report, saying reactors 1-3  had long since ben cooled and that reactor 4 had not been in operation and thus no heating to lead to such a scenario.
Error 12: ARD claimed that experts were working feverishly to lay an emergency power supply line to the power plant in order to switch on the cooling system, when in fact it wasn’t an emergency power supply, but a line to the ordinary ordinary high voltage power grid.
Error 13: ARD claimed that line would be finished earliest on Friday, and that it was unknown whether or not the cooling unit would even switch on. At this point German viewers were probably biting their fingers off. But the fact was that it was already Friday in Japan – 4 a.m. – when the ARD report was being aired. So there was no way for the line to be finished on Thursday or earlier.
Error 14: How the ARD knew that it is”unknown” whether it would function is their “secret”. Of course pumps can be repaired and put back into operation. But you need power to do this.
Zettels Raum concludes as follows:
Is that only a mess, sloppiness or pure ignorance? Or is it political agitation? What is obvious, in any case, is that all the errors were made without exception in a way that exaggerated the actual damage and actual danger. If this were simply sloppiness, one would then expect some errors to be made in the other direction too.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel has a report here today on what an accelerated shutdown of all 17 German nuclear reactors by 2020 would mean.
Germany was spooked by the nuclear disaster in Japan, all fueled by turbo-hysteria from its media. In a knee-jerk reaction, unmatched by no other country in the world, Angela Merkel’s coalition government ordered 7 of the country’s reactors be shut down immediately. Now activists are demanding the shutdown of all reactors.
This, of course, is easier said than done. Who or what would step in to fill in the 20.8 gigawatt gap?
Half of Germany covered by solar panels
In a nutshell, this would be horribly expensive, and ugly. Der Spiegel looks at what Germany would look like if it converted over to mainly renewables such as solar, wind and biogas by 2020 in place of the nuclear reactors. This is how Der Spiegel describes it:
The dream of a rapid shutdown of nuclear reactors is technically possible. But it would have a high price.
First of all it would profoundly alter the landscape of Germany.
In the 2020 scenario, the current status quo of wind and solar would be multiplied many times over: 46 gigawatts of wind energy, 52 gigawatts of photovoltaic and 8 gigawatts of biomass – quasi half of Germany would be paved with solar panels. Huge rotors would litter the landscape. On fields, there would be a questionable monoculture of bioenergy plants.”
So why does all this massive government intervention and state-controlled energy remind us of Soviet style central-panning? The consequences certainly threaten to be the same: an abject failure and bankruptcy.
Not only would this trash and ruin Germany’s once idyllic countryside, but it would probably bankrupt he country too. According to Der Spiegel stopping nuclear and switching over to  a hodge-podge of unsteady renewables would first require an investment of € 245 billion just to build up the needed equipment and infrastructure. Then consumers would also have to bear much higher electricity rates.
Lack of acceptance

//-->




Der Spiegel also looks at the problem of dwindling acceptance of renewable energy due to consumers’ displeasure with their rising electric bills and the scourge to the landscape they represent. Der Spiegel:
Indeed large wind turbines are again and agin met with fierce protest. And even the most green-blooded environmentalists fly into rages because of the growing corn monoculture.
Windmills and solar systems have short lifetimes
Unfortunately, Der Spiegel and the eco-masterminds also seem to have failed to notice another costly factor: operating lifetimes. While lifetimes of 40 years are not uncommon for coal and nuclear power plants, they are much shorter for renewable energy systems. 20 years is already a pipe dream.
This all means everything would have to be replaced soon, and again at a huge cost. Let’s not forget the higher maintenance costs as well.
Back to 200 years ago
But costs have never discouraged the eco-masterminds in their pursuit of their goals. People can be brainwashed into accepting them, at least that’s what Michael Sterner, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy Systems Technology (IWES) and advisor to the federal government, seems to think:
The acceptance for renewable energy must be urgently increased. Because of climate change, resource shortages and the atomic catastrophe, people have to be made aware that our energy supply system must return back above ground – just like it always was 200 years ago.”
The irony of the Japan earthquake is that in the end Germany may be the country that winds up with the most damage. Not because of the tsunami per se, but because of a tsunami of technical and economic blindness.
200 years back? That would be about right.
==============================================
UPDATE: I’d also like to remind the taxpayer-subsidised Fraunhofer Institute how energy needs were met 200 years ago. Have they ever wondered what happened to all of Europe’s forests back then?

This from Reuters: Exclusive: Sierra Club sues over California solar plant. Hat tip: DirkH.
These guys don’t even know what they want. They’re against everything – and now even the things they once said would save the planet – like windmills, solar panels and crops for bio-diesel.
The report starts as follows (emphasis added):
A leading environmental advocacy group is suing the state of California’s Energy Commission over its approval of a giant solar plant, underscoring the growing challenge to the nation’s renewable-energy goals from within the environmental community.”
I suspect it’s because they have come to learn that these things are in reality ugly, dangerous, inefficient, expensive, and will end up doing real damage to wildlife, environment and landscape.
Now all we have to do is to get them to realize that CO2 is nowhere near as bad as they think, and that it actually makes the planet greener. That’ll take probably another 10 years to do, or a full-blown ice age.
Not only environmentalists are protesting the construction of solar plants, but regular folks and landowners have already had real success. Reuters:
In December, the Quechan Indian tribe won an injunction blocking construction of the Imperial Valley solar project, under development near California’s border with Mexico by NTR’s Tessera Solar.
The Calico plant was also under development by Tessera until the company sold the plant last month to K Road Sun, a subsidiary of New York investment firm K Road Power. Tessera has been struggling to find funding for its plants, which cost about $2 billion.
With the huge areas of land needed and overall opposition, it’s getting more and more difficult to find investors. These projects are turning into hot potatoes.

Today is World Liberty Day
Updated: 17 June, 5 p.m. CET
The above website I’ve linked to was set up in Germany as a project by liberty-enthusiastic individuals, led by Christoph Widenhorn of the German FREIHEITSWERK. Many people are not aware of this, and so I hope this spreads around a bit more. It is also supported by the Berlin-Manhattan Institute.

 These individuals are working to establish a Day of Liberty in Germany, and the world. The website is a 100% pro-bono project with no budget – all those involved are strictly volunteers. Sign up as a supporter!
I’m pleased and honoured to have helped out a bit in setting up the above-linked website. Take a few minutes to look at the different pages of the website.
Let your friends, family and other websites know about it. Here are just a few famous quotes on liberty and freedom:

The secret of happiness is freedom.
The secret of freedom is courage.  
– Pericles
For to be free is not merely
to cast off one’s chains,
but to live in a way that respects and
enhances the freedom of others.
– Nelson Mandela
Freedom is never more than one
generation away from extinction.
We didn’t pass it to our children
in the bloodstream.
It must be fought for, protected,
and handed on for them to do the same.
– Ronald Reagan
Liberty,
when it begins to take root,
is a plant of rapid growth.
– George Washington
As AGW-science skeptics know very well, freedom all over the world is always under attack. There are always people out there who think they ought to decide everything for us and run our lives. We see this, for example, in climate science as governments attempt to misuse it for the purpose of implementing intrusive bureaucracy, state-control and more taxation.
Take a few minutes to look at the website I’ve linked to above and help liberty take root.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone reading last Friday’s piece here on the autobahn pile-up that killed 8 people (thankfully revised down from 10) because high-speed autobahn drivers were suddenly caught by a dust storm surely thought: “Hmmm, I wonder if warmists are going to blame this on climate change too?”
Yes we can!
Here it is at the online Bild in a headline story called: Dangerous Sandstorms Will Become More Frequent! Meteorologist Blames Climate Change. Bild writes:
A sudden sandstorm Friday led to aMass Car Crash near Rostock. Now a meteorologist warns: Such dangerous storms could be more frequent in the future! The fault is climate change.”
Of course driving too fast had nothing to do with it.
In last Friday’s piece, I did everything to avoid the temptation of writing “how long will it be before some opportunist steps up and blames climate change?” Not very long. That opportunist is publicity-seeker meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net, who also happens to be the official meteorologist of the Bild tabloid.
Northern Germany has received little rain over the last weeks and conditions were ripe for dust storms as farmers’ fields are exposed just as the planting season is getting ready to begin. Jung, who is a 33-year old whippersnapper, claims:
Climate change produces extreme weather conditions. Record heat waves, cold waves and extraordinary droughts, like the one that led to the sandstorm, are becoming more frequent.”
It’s the science that just cannot be falsified.

The prices that is. The UK Daily Mail reports today that inflation has reached the highest level in 20 years. Price increases have been fuelled primarily by an increase in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, and spiralling energy prices. The Mail writes:
For millions, the biggest battle is finding the money to fill up their car. The average price of petrol and diesel has never been higher. For example, a 50-litre diesel car now costs £70 to fill, compared with £59 last year. Unions said the inflation figures from the Office for National Statistics show ‘how tough it is for working families struggling to afford the most basic necessities, like food and fuel’.
Dr Ros Altmann, the director general of Saga, described the inflation figures as ‘truly dreadful’.”
Indeed a litre of petrol is up 14.7% in February over a year earlier, a litre of diesel is up 19.7%. And a litre of pure vegetable oil is up a whopping 42% and electricity up 6.5% . For petrol and diesel that all translates into something like $8 or$9 a gallon. This is the near future in America if you let the envirokooks get their way.
Risk of blackouts in Germany
Meanwhile in Germany electricity prices are also jumping. And as the country shuts down 7 of its nuclear power plants in a panic reaction to Fukushima, pressure for even higher prices will certainly mount. FOCUS magazine reports here that:

Many consumers are now threatened with a bad surprise when they get their next electric bills. According to an energy portal, prices will increase at 43 utilities. Also gas consumers are hit.
The announced price increases of the 43 utilities are at an average of 6.5%, according to the consumer portal.”
 
Natural gas prices are also rising. FOCUS reports that 37 utilities will jack up the prices.
High energy costs are not the only factor causing woes for German consumers. Soon they may no longer be able to rely on a steady supply. Yet another FOCUS report warns of possible blackouts, writing:
The German Energy Agency cautions on an overly hasty shutdown of nuclear energy. Switching off seven reactors power outages. The power grid needs to be massively expanded.”
The expansion of the power grid of course is to accommodate offshore windfarms and solar panels. The 7 nuclear power plants are scheduled to be shut down in May.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have to keep repeating this because the irresponsible media keeps distorting everything.
Zettels Raum brings the latest update here. So far every single one of his reports has been spot on. 
Here are the latest main points:

Works on the nuclear power plant have made amazing progress. One can say with high probability that no big accident will occur. The catastrophe, which the media has been filled with, will not take place.

The first days of activity focused on preventing a meltdown of the reactors. To do this the pressure inside the containment had to be lowered by releasing air out of the containment and into the reactor building. That led to two consequences:  
1) the air was radioactive and escaped into the surrounding environment. This improvement naturally led to a worsening situation on the other hand. This makes every decision a difficult balancing act.
2) hydrogen had gathered in the room between the containment and the building roof when the valves were opened, which led to an explosion. The resulting harmless fire outside of the containment made for good pictures for the media and led them to falsely claim that the reactor had been reduced to rubble and ash. These picture were shown repeatedly on TV. See here.


The fact is that there was very little damage – and workers were back immediately putting the system back into order.Such trade-offs have been the order of the last day.Now also Blocks 3 and 4 are now connected to the power grid and so this allows the control room to be put back into operation. But switching on the the power is not possible as long as huge amounts of water continue to be sprayed  onto the reactor building. This leads to a difficult decision: When can you risk stopping the external cooling – at least temporarily – to allow the power to be switched back on and to change over to normal cooling by pumps?
As NHK reported this evening at 18:01 CET, normal cooling of Block 3 will begin tomorrow, provided that the external cooling of this block ends. This is all about making the transition from improvised cooling  over to normal cooling operation in a coordinated manner, and making sure that cooling goes as uninterrrupted as possible.”

Thanks to Zettels Raum blog for keeping us informed.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ from Zurich has a report on a recent multiple-proxy temperature reconstruction produced by a Swedish team of scientists. It wasn’t that long ago when European media outlets were saying Mann’s old hockey stick was settled science – that is until a series of scientific and statistical analyses by leading experts debunked it and the pressure to drop it became too much to bear.
Now Europe’s media are quietly abandoning it and returning to what years and years of reliable literature originally had stated: The temperature trend over the last several thousand years was by no means flat and that there were periods that were just as warm, if not warmer than today.
Here’s the 2000-year reconstruction of the Swedish team I found at the NIPCC site:
Swedish proxy temperature reconstruction: Source; http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2010/dec/15dec2010a4.html
The meticulous new reconstruction was produced by scientists of the University of Stockholm, led by Fredrik Ljungqvist, and the results were published last year in Geografiska Annaler. It’s a temperature reconstruction of the extra-tropical northern hemisphere (30°-90°N)  over the last 2000 years.
Eduardo Zorita of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht Germany says it’s one of the best reconstructions he’s seen, and reminds us that proxy reconstructions aren’t easy. NZZ quotes Zorita:
Errors can be avoided only when paleoclimatologists and statistics experts work closely together. The right method for reconstructing temperature history hasn’t really been found up to now.”
Even when done meticulously, uncertainties can’t be eliminated. According to the NIPCC, this reconstruction was based:
…on 30 temperature-sensitive proxy records with annual to multi-decadal resolution, including two historical documentary records, three marine sediment records, five lake sediment records, three speleothem δ18O records, two ice-core δ18O records, four varved thickness sediment records, five tree-ring width records, five tree-ring maximum latewood density records, and one δ13C tree-ring record, but not employing tree-ring width records from arid and semi-arid regions…”
Indeed, Ljungqvist found temperature fluctuations that are markedly more pronounced than shown earlier in many reconstructions. NZZ writes:
According to his reconstruction, the Littel Ice Age, which took place between 1400 and 1850, was up to 0.8° Celsius colder than the climate average of the period 1961–1990. 
Perhaps the temperature dips of the past are even greater – Ljungqvist suspects that the cold of the Little Ice Age is underestimated.”
There’s still a lot of discussion on whether the current modern period is warmer than the MWP and the Roman Period. The study indicates that it was warmer in the past. The reconstruction also shows that the current warming started already way back in the early part of the 18th century, i.e. long before man started emitting CO2 in earnest. So what could be the cause of the temperature fluctuations? The NZZ writes:
Considered as causes are external factors such as volcano eruptions and solar changes, but also internal climate processes.”

The NIPCC also provides additional quotes from Ljungqvist, who notes:



<!--

//-->




…decadal mean temperatures in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere seem to have equaled or exceeded the AD 1961-1990 mean temperature level during much of the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period”
and
…the second century, during the Roman Warm Period, is the warmest century during the last two millennia,”
adding:
…the highest average temperatures in the reconstruction are encountered in the mid to late tenth century,”
Clearly the evidence shows that nothing unusual is happening. The Swedish reconstruction also uses “Mike’s nature trick“, tacking on the instrumental record for the last 20 years, but does not cover this up. And what about the claim that CO2 is causing the temperature to rise? Here’s how the NIPCC sums it up:
That claim — for which there is no supporting evidence, other than misplaced blind faith in climate models — is totally bogus.”
Do you now hear the hisses and gnashing of teeth from the AGW cultists?
Interestingly, the traditionally green NZZ first starts its story by glossing over some background and history on tree-ring temperature reconstructions, mentioning “pioneer” Michael Mann’s work and his iconic hockey stick graph, and provides some details about its embattled story, writing: 
…skeptical activists even accused Mann and other paleoclimatologists of fraudulently fabricating the curve.”
The NZZ refuses to believe this of course, but Mann most certainly did. But we understand the greenie media – sometimes it’s hard to say goodbye to an old friend that had served them so well. Good riddance to one of the most corrupt chapters in the history of modern science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHardly! Ed Caryl brings us a classic example of GISS temperature data “adjustment”.
====================================================
Urban Heat Island at Providence Rhode Island
By Ed Caryl
A recent paper by Ping Zhang and Marc Imhoff of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA materials found here), pointed out the incredible heat island around some eastern U.S. cities, including Providence, Rhode Island, and Buffalo, New York. This author decided to examine this data, and compare it to the GISSTemp data for the same location.
First, here is the image from the NASA paper, and below it, a heat map image derived from it. Note the temperature scale on the bottom of both images. The temperature scales are from 20 to 40 degrees C. Find the airport in these images.
Original NASA image
and
NASA image converted to a false-color heat map
The airport should the easy to find, it is the hottest place on the map, about 15 degrees hotter than the cool countryside at the edges of the images. This is the Warwick/Providence TF Green State Airport.
Now, where do you suppose the temperature is being measured at this airport?
As at most airports, it is in between the main runway and the taxiway in front of the terminal. Right next to that purple spot on the heat image, the hottest place on the map. After all, the pilots want to know the runway temperature when they plan their landings and takeoffs.
Look at the 2 images below from the U. S. Geological Survey, and Google respectively. The weather instruments are near the navigation beacon (the dark spot, at the arrow, near the center of the USGS photo):

What does GISSTemp say about this location? There are two records in the GISS database: a raw data file, and a corrected file that they use for further processing, such as the U.S. and the global average temperature. The default file is the uncorrected raw data. The URL looks like this:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/gistemp_station.py?id=425725070060&data_set=1&num_neighbors=1
If you change the digit after the “set=” to a 2, you get the corrected data. Both sets of data are available as text files from a link below the resulting chart. Both sets of data were downloaded and charted below, along with the mathematical difference, the “correction”.

Both sets of data show a warming trend, but the uncorrected data (Providence 1) shows much more warming than Providence 2. The difference is a stepwise correction, warming the past by as much as 1.2 degrees C.
One would think that any correction should be to cool the more recent temperatures to correct for the increasing UHI, but that isn’t what they have done. And, most of the correction was done to data before 1940. This doesn’t make sense either, as most of the infrastructure and population buildup around the airport didn’t happen until WWII and after. Also, the correction amount doesn’t approach the UHI temperature rise measured by Dr Zhang.
Will Drs Hansen and Zhang get together?
Most of the surface temperature data that goes into the averages, whether world-wide, or here in the U. S., come from airports. In the U. S., the number is 121 out of 134 stations. Each of the airports in the images in the NASA paper can be clearly seen as a hot spot. Clearly, some work needs to be done to correct the surface temperature record in light of this information.
When will GISS get around to that?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has a ""Master Plan"" for society. (Photo credit: http://nachhaltigkeit2009.commerzbank.de)
Hans Schellnhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability‘s real economic and social impacts would be incalculable. This has never been attempted before, and its approach completely contradicts all fundamental economic and scientific principles. Moreover, it is to be implemented without first having a public debate, and to be done so at warp speed. This in itself makes the plan reckless, callous and extremely dangerous. It especially puts the poorest among us at risk. And with its authors having castigated our modern society time and again, it is de facto a Declaration of War on our current system.
That’s the conclusion I have reached having read in more detail Hans Schellhuber’s Social Contract For Sustainability, which he himself dubbed “a masterplan” for radically transforming society. It is truly baffling that this scheme could get so far.
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”.
And when one considers the arrogance and the scientific dogma that propels Schellhuber’s Social Contract for Sustainability, even the notion of good intentions disappears. From Schellnhuber’s and his peers’ expressed views, one senses the genuine spite they must harbour for today’s modern democratic society and our system of prosperity and freedom. Anyone else would certainly use a different approach to bring about change.
Their manifesto not only calls for a radical overhaul of society, and especially the energy systems that support human life on the planet, but also of our politics and even the way we think. On page 1:
…the requisite transformation encompasses profound changes to infrastructures, production processes, regulation systems and lifestyles, and extends to a new kind of interaction between politics, society, science and the economy.”
Especially disturbing is Schellnhuber’s use of fabricated, junk-science-based horror scenarios for justifying a takeover of today’s democratic and free market system. Although there is a huge body of science showing that CO2 has only a minor, easily manageable impact on climate, Schellnhuber writes on page 1:
This drastic change in direction must be accomplished before the end of the current decade in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum by 2050, and thereby to maintain the possibility of avoiding dangerous climate change. Hence, time is of the essence here.”
Like the Pope Declaring The Islamic World Is To Convert To Christianity By 2020
Worse, the plan callously disregards all the obvious huge risks involved in this great social engineering experiment. The plan ignores science and violates every fundamental economic principle, and so poses a threat of an unimaginable scale to the humankind, society and the environment.  The Social Contract to Sustainability is equivalent to a Chilton’s How To Replace Jet Engines On An Airbus 380 Over To Propellers While In Flight And In Just 10 Minutes. Or, a plan from the Vatican to convert the Islamic World to Christianity by 2020.
More worrisome is that this Green Masterplan is now in the hands of every European Environment Minister, who are drooling over all the power it promises to bring them. It won’t work without something going horrifically wrong. We saw similar results with the Soviet Union.

Not only do the masterplan’s authors want to skip debate and necessary public discussion, which normally precede proposed public endeavours in democratic and open societies, they also  insist that it all has to be done ultra-rapidly, “before the end of the decade”, without debate and always with the fictitious gun barrel of imminent climate catastrophe at our heads. This is a sort of psycho-terror.
Except for their dubious computer models, there is no scientific data to suggest any sort of urgency. It is pure Malthusian paranoia. Don’t let the fuzzy warm platitudes about democracy and human rights in the text at the beginning of the Contract fool you – that’s sheep’s wool over the wolf. In fact the poor will get slammed the hardest.
Denying the poor cheap energy
This is probably the worst part of it all – the plan’s schemes to deny the poor cheap and plentiful energies that would lift them out of their abject poverty. Many poorer countries are planning to use nuclear energies to power their futures, but the masterminds oppose this. Page 3:
Several countries are currently planning to increase their use of nuclear energy. The WBGU urgently advises against this, above all because of the not negligible risks accompanying cases of serious damage, the still unresolved issues concerning final storage, and the danger of uncontrolled proliferation. Existing plants should be replaced by sustainable energy technologies as soon as possible, and, in the case of evident safety deficiencies, be closed down immediately. However, the phase-out of nuclear energy must not be compensated by renewed or intensified brown or black coal based energy generation.
Because it’ll be brutal enough for the richer countries to bear the high costs of renewable energy, you’d think the poor would get a pass be allowed to burn the cheap available energy beneath their feet. Nein! – says Schellnhuber. The council denies them fossil fuels as well, adding later on page 3:
The requisite decarbonisation of energy systems means that the pressure is on to act, not just in the industrialised countries, but also in the dynamically growing industrialising and developing countries. Even the poorer developing countries must veer towards a low-emission development path in the medium-term. The era of fossil energy carrier reliant economic growth must be brought to an end.”
Schellnhuber’s eerie attempts to bring an end to the carbonised society would in fact likely bring about the premature end to millions of lives.
Cost: $1 trillion PER YEAR, and significantly higher after 2030:
Even though many western governments are hopelessly caught in the unsustainable trap of massive debt, printing presses will likely be fired up to print money to pay for it all. The costs even by the masterplan’s admission are staggering. Page 4 states:
Globally, the additional investment required for transformation into a low-carbon society, compared with the cost of ‘just carrying on as we are’, probably lies somewhere in the region of at least 200 to up to 1,000 billion US dollars per year by 2030, and would significantly exceed this amount between 2030 and 2050. These investments will be offset by later savings of a similar size, and the avoidance of the immense costs of dangerous climate change.
This is all to avoid fictitious future “immense costs”. Now one gets a sense as to why this would border on a social and humanitarian folly of unprecedented dimensions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman solar skeptic website SOLARKRITIK.DE here provides the background on the rundown, weed-covered solar facility in former communist (and now “green”) East Germany, which I presented in my last post here.

Solar panel field near Markranstaedt, Germany. Photo taken by Prof. Knut Löschke on June 26, 2011. Source: http://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/
It’s much worse than we thought. The story behind the above photo and the project itself appears here at the online Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper. The facility is sprawled over an area of 20 acres. The Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper wrote just before the facility went into operation:
‘The park is finally realized,’ beams mayor Carina Radon (CDU) nowadays, and praised the 7.5 million Euro investment. 36,300 modules will be installed in the weeks ahead. It will generate an annual amount of 2.7 million kilowatt-hours. The facility will produce a peak amount of 2722 kilowatts.
Wow! With that kind of performance, you’d think the facility would be well-maintained so that it could continue to generate cash – and so save the planet. Letting such investments go to hell is usually the last thing one does with a money making machine like that. The Leipziger Volkszeitung article writes:
The solar park saves the environment an emission of 34,500 tons of CO2 and one expects it will be in operation 20 years.”
20 years? As the date of the article shows, the park was set up in December, 2009 – much less than two years ago. Now it is already overgrown with weeds and on the verge of being useless. Your subsidies at work, folks. The green economy – Germany’s job engine!

This photo also shows that the solar park in no way delivers electricity maintenance-free, as the green lobby likes to claim.
The author of the photo provided the following information along with the photo:
‘A rather large, obviously run down facility, which as one sees is overgrown everywhere. I took this photo on June 25, 2011 shortly before 6 pm as I happened to be driving by (and concerning our ‘renewable’ energy world, it certainly opened my eyes). Exect location: Markranstädt, intersection of Schkeuditzer Str. / Nordstraße.’
It goes to show you that nature cannot be controlled by man. They can’t even get weeds under control, yet they would have us believe they can regulate the climate? In my view, the above facility borders on criminal neglect.
Meanwhile Europe is planning a $600 billion monster solar facility in the SAHARA called Desertec. At least there it won’t have to worry too much about weeds. But what about dust storms, wind and other elements?
A clue of what can happen is provided by Solarkritik.de, which shows us a solar plant on top of an elementary school at Haltern-Flaesheim, Germany taken on 25 April 2011.

The panels on the above pictured elementary school are coated with a heavy layer of pollen and dust. I guess there’s a lesson here for school kids.
And here is another beauty of a solar facility in northern Germany. This is what they really look like after 20 years, photo from Solarkritik.de. Take a look at its condition. Everywhere cells are missing. Now it is out there decaying and its dangerous elements are likely leaking and poisoning the ground by now. Photovoltaic-park from 1989.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWindmills are subject to cyclic loading, which means even small cracks in the load-bearing structure can grow and eventually lead to catastrophic failure. One catastrophic failure occurred yesterday near the Central German town of Kirtorf, read here (in German). Hat-tip Dirk H.
Many photos here
The tower broke 25 meters up. Investigators are now examining the rubble to deterime the exact cause of the failure. Looking at the detailed photos at the above link, it looks as if the failure occurred where two tower segments are bolted together. Maybe cheap, counterfeit bolts were used. Luckily no one was injured or killed.
The mishap occurred at about 11:30 in the morning at a windpark with 7 turbines. The blades, turbine and upper part of the tower crashed onto a path on the ground, reaching as far as 50 meters away. The debris even struck and destroyed a nearby transformer station. Meanwhile officials have called for a shutdown of 17 other turbines in the area and that they be subjected to a thorough technical inpsection before being allowed to go online.
Other news reports say the turbine was erected 11 years ago and that the maximum windspeed recorded yesterday was 57 km(hr – stormy, but usually a wind speed that windmills have no problems coping with.
Reader Andreas Luft at the first link mentioned above wrote:
I also work on wind turbines. This type here must be a D-Wind system. But I’m familiar with onkly the D6 and D8. This could be a D4.
There are many problems with the towers also in Austria. They too also rust, and there is much corrsion damage at the welds of the steel plates. But I’ve never seen such a material fatigue before.
But the photos don’t show any signs of rust.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe have been told that trace gas CO2 dictates the world’s climate, overpowering the oceans and solar factors. So now we should not be surprised when someone tells us that the atmosphere dominates the behavior of the oceans, which are far more massive.
The stream of  junk environmental science doesn’t stop flowing. Again a small group is trying to convince us that the tail wags the dog. Actually in this case, the flea at the end of the tail is wagging the dog (CO2 causes climate change, which in turn causes “ocean change”).
The German warmist website klimaretter (in English that means “climate rescuer”) has become a leading provider of kook warmist stories lately. Their latest is here: Researchers Warning Of Ocean Change, which cites a report officially released today by World Ocean Review in Hamburg.
Climate change will soon profoundly influence the world oceans: This is the conclusion of “World Ocean Review”, the scientists of the Kiel Cluster of Excellence of “Ocean of the Future” in Hamburg released on Thursday.
I thought Halloween season with people running around in costumes was over. No – we are expected to accept this as fact, without skepticm or questions.
With Cancun coming up, and its failure already programmed, the 240-page report, filled with photos and charts, is the latest volume of junk science designed to spread alarm, a Hail Mary attempt to sway a public, which has long since grown deaf to the cries of climate change. Klimaretter writes:

Climate change does not only lead to rising temperatures and rising sea levels, but it also leads to increased oceanic acidification.
According to today’s online Stern magazine, in its article The world’s oceans – exploited and trashed:
‘The world’s oceans are now a high risk patient that has a chance – if given the right therapy,’ says Martin Visbeck, spokesman for the Cluster Of Excellence”
The recent report is the result of two years of work done by 40 researchers.
The Ocean Science and Research Foundation, a foundation set up by Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a fighter for ocean protection, financed the oceans’ status report. Also involved was the International Ocean Institute, which she also created.
There you have it – activist-sponsored science, which means it has nothing to do with objectivity. In the future a World Ocean Review will be released every 2 years. The latest report not only focuses on CO2-caused acidification, but on over-fishing and trash in the oceans.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the German media are now in full panic mode. They can no longer get their stories straight.Desperate to stem the flood of doubt now sweeping Germany, as the country is gripped by its harshest December in 100 years, including record snowfalls in Potsdam, the hyper-alarmist PIK and the German media are now throwing all they’ve got to explain away the embarrassing cold.
For years they preached endlessly that Germany would be experiencing balmy, southern European-type winters. Snow indeed had been relegated to the history books. The tables have since turned.
Everybody had predicted a brutal winter
Back in late summer and fall, meteorologists like Piers Corbyn, Joe Bastardi, and other German private forecasters, were all predicting cold winters ahead. Even Russian and Polish scientists had forecast the possibility of the harshest winter in a 1000 years. But the PIK and Met Office climatologists scoffed. The Met Office in England even went so far as to forecast a mild and wet winter, again.
So far, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Germany have experienced one of the worst Decembers on record, if not the worst.
PIK suddenly sees the writing on the wall
By early November even the climate scientists at the dogmatic PIK eventually recognized the writing on the wall, and so scrambled to fabricate a cartoonish “new study”, authored by PIK scientist Vladimir Petuchov, that suddenly predicted cold winters would be likely for Europe, and claimed it was consistent with global warming. Their models had just uncovered it.
The media blitz – conflicting stories
The heavy snows and extreme cold hit as expected. The public was caught off guard and demanded an explanation. And so the propaganda machinery switched into high gear. FOCUS online, two days ago on Tuesday, had the title Colder Winters Because of Global Warming. Der Spiegel and other major news outlets, along with radio and TV, all joined in spreading the PIK propaganda – all reporting this sudden new discovery by PIK.
Here Focus wrote how a PIK computer model shows how the disappearance of sea ice in the Barents and Kara Seas influences the climate in northern continental regions. Less sea ice in these seas leads to release of energy into the atmosphere.
As a result, large-scale changes in air currents could occur so that polar winds make their way to Europe and North Asia, whereby the probability of cold winters triples.”
Emphasis added. They (PIK) aren’t sure amd are simply floating this out. The study’s lead author Vladimir Petuchov then adds a line, which I think will become infamous down the road:
Hard winters do not refute global warming, instead they more so confirm it.”

So, according to their latest climate models, global warming will lead to colder European winters. The probability of the such is 3 times higher. Now enters Stefan Rahmstorf.
No no…stop! Warming leads to warmer colder winters!
Meanwhile Stefan Rahmstorf is watching the back door. No matter what happens, they’ll all be able to say “We were right”. Also on Tuesday, the online Die Welt quotes Rahmstorf, also from the PIK, in an article titled: Hard Winter Not a Sign of Climate Change. (Petuchov to the contrary said that it was).
We will certainly have to anticipate milder winters rather than cold ones.”
Die Welt then adds:
PIK scientist Prof. Stephan Rahmstorf also points out that the “cold“ winters have gotten warmer.”
Stop right there. These guys can’t even get their stories straight! One PIK scientist says we’ll get warmer winters, while the other one says we’ll get colder ones. Well, which is it? Rahmstorf seems to be saying we’ll get colder winters that will be warmer. Oh, now I get it…global warming will now lead to warmer colder winters!
It was all recently discovered by their climate models
Dr. Peter Werner, also of the PIK, said on NDR Radio (also on Tuesday) that their climate models had just recently uncovered the Barents and Kara Sea phenomena, claiming it’s all consistent with man-made climate change.
Tuesday was a busy press release day for the alarmists in Potsdam. It also appears to have been a very chaotic one too.
Conclusion
So what can we conclude from all this? No matter what the climate does, they will be able to say their models predicted it. Falsification is impossible. Jared Olar of Echo-Pilot.com here says it best:
The natural sciences have terms for that kind of hypothesis. ‘Unfalsifiable’ is one of them. ‘Unscientific’ is another. An idea may be true, but if it is incapable of being ‘falsified’ or proven wrong, then whatever else that idea is, it certainly isn’t science.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNTZ reader and contributor Ed Caryl brings us his newest essay. This one is about the climate’s (low) sensitivity to CO2.
==================================================================
On CO2, Did You Know That… ?
By Ed Caryl
Nearly all the papers on CO2 and high global warming are based on climate models, not actual data.

Did you know that there is one paper that uses satellite data to actually measure CO2’s affect on climate?
Did you know that the temperature figure for CO2 doubling (climate sensitivity) found in that paper is 0.6°C?

Dr. Roy W. Spencer and Dr. John Christy are the “fathers” of satellite based global temperature measurements. Dr. Spencer is also the author of the book, The Great Global Warming Blunder. Dr. Spencer and Dr. William D. Braswell co-authored the above paper.
First, to prepare you, some mathematics:
The formula for the amount of warming due to a doubling of CO2 is:
X = ∆T * (3.7 W/m2)/∆F
Where X is the warming in °C,
∆T is the equilibrium temperature change measured in °C,

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




∆F is the sustained forcing in W/m2, that produced that change,
The 3.7 W/m2 figure is the radiative forcing due to doubled CO2 as measured at the top of the atmosphere. This figure is from the IPCC 2001 report, and is agreed on by most researchers, including Spencer in The Great Global Warming Blunder (page 48).
Any sustained forcing of less than 3.7 W/m2 is positive feedback, resulting in an X of 1°C or more. Any sustained forcing more than that figure is negative feedback, resulting in an X of less than 1°C. If there is no feedback, positive or negative, the figure for CO2 doubling is 1°C. The IPCC figures, 1.5 to 4.5°C, assume positive feedback, mostly from water vapor.
Most of the climate sensitivity calculations use climate models, rather than real-world data. All produce climate sensitivity numbers of more than 1°C, most centered around 3°C. Roy Spencer used actual satellite temperature measurement data to find the real-world climate sensitivity. In another paper, found here, he describes evidence that the forcing is between 6 and 8 W/m2, thus climate sensitivities for CO2 doubling of from 0.46 to 0.6°C, or 0.8 to 1°F. This low number is attributed to negative feedback from clouds. This is an inconsequential amount of warming, and even that may not be reached if CO2 does not double.
This low climate sensitivity along with ocean cycles like the AMO, ENSO, and PDO may be the reason for no warming since 1998. See Bob Tisdale’s post in WUWT here for reinforcement of that idea.
Have those figures been published in a peer-reviewed journal? Yes, in the Journal of Geophysical Research. See: Spencer-Braswell-JGR-2010.pdf
Is there any independent confirmation of such low climate sensitivity? Stephen E. Schwartz (2007) (also peer reviewed in the JGR) has studied the ocean heat capacity, and has produced two significant numbers: 1) the time constant for temperature changes is 5 ± 1 year, not the much longer periods touted by others. And 2) the climate sensitivity measured this way is 1.1 ±0.5°C, very close to the no feedback case, but not excluding Spencer and Braswell’s numbers. Schwartz uses GISS temperature data, not the somewhat lower satellite data, so his climate sensitivity number may be high.
Albert Einstein:
No amount of expeimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.
Well, here are two. (Three, if you count Bob Tisdale’s post.) These are “experiments” that use actual real-world data, not models. The science is settled? You be the judge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnd I’m glad Dr. Spencer is coming out and calling it like it is.
It’s not often you hear a distinguished scientist rip into his colleagues as Roy Spencer does at his blog here yesterday. His essay is a reaction to the House vote to suspend the funding the corrupt IPCC. Here are some excerpts:
On the IPCC:
Politicians formed the IPCC over 20 years ago with an endgame in mind: to regulate CO2 emissions.”
and
Science progresses by investigating alternative explanations for things. Long ago, the IPCC all but abandoned that search.”
On the most vocal AGW scientists (natural climate change deniers):
They apparently do not realize that ‘settled science’ is an oxymoron. The most vocal climate scientists defending the IPCC have lost their objectivity.”

and
They have a theory — more CO2 is to blame — and they religiously stick to it.”
and
I am ashamed for our scientific discipline and embarrassed by their behavior. Is it any wonder that scientists have such a bad reputation among the taxpayers who pay them to play in their ivory tower sandboxes? They can make gloom and doom predictions all day long of events far in the future without ever having to suffer any consequences of being wrong.”
and
They have gotten away with too much, for too long.”
On energy policy:
Making our most abundant and affordable sources of energy artificially more expensive with laws and regulations will end up killing millions of people.”
You really need to read his entire post to appreciate it. And I certainly would love to see Dr Spencer get “the opportunity to cross examine these (natural) climate change deniers in a court of law”. These cowards have ducked debate long eneough.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr Wolfgand Thüne (DerWetterman.de)
At his Der Wettermann website retired German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne is calling for an immediate stop of all state-funded climate research.
h/t DirkH
Dr Thüne, who is sort of Germany’s version of John Coleman, has been one of Germany’s most outspoken critics of climate science and the huge waste of taxpayer money all the research involves.
Dr. Thüne:
For decades billions of US dollars of taxpayer money have been pumped into climate research without getting any detectable progress. Climate experts still have not even succeeded in delivering the physical proof of the claimed “greenhouse effect”.
The meteorological fact is that at no point on earth and at no time of the year do either the daily or yearly air temperature and CO2 concentrations causally correlate. There is no correlation! Also a radical reduction of ‘greenhouse gases’ in Europe, or “achieving a ‘CO2-free Europe’, would have absolutely no impact on the weather over the course of the annual seasons.”

Thüne then blasts EU Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard’s “Energy-Climate-Package” which calls for spending €270 BILLION every year over the next 40 years in order to reduce CO2 emissions by 80%, calling it a “senseless physical endeavour”. He adds:
No state, already under a mountain of debt, can morally justify the burning of  billions, and yes trillions, on the ‘protection of the global climate’ without leaving proof of having any effect whatsoever.
The correlation between the CO2-value in Hawaii and the annually calculated ‘global temperature’ is a fictitious correlation that imposters as causal effect, but is in reality only a make believe correlation.”
Thüne then reminds us that the earth’s climate has been proven to correlate with the angle of the sun’s rays striking the earth’s surface and that ‘it is as old as the planet itself’, has nothing to do with industrialisation and that the calculated temperature increase of 0.7°C  that has taken place since 1860 is a normal earthly process.
Thüne clearly labels the state’s attempt to regulate global temperature, while at the same time delivering social justice, a folly. He adds: “weather cannot be disciplined, and weather alone determines what climate a location or a state has”. Thüne ends by reminding us:
Humankind would be helped in practical ways if 20% of research resources were instead devoted to better weather forecasting and the remaining 80% devoted to combating hunger and poverty.”

My last article, Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real (But It’s Not From CO2, contained the statement: “No one (to my knowledge) has researched what part of the global temperature rise is due to energy use. All energy use ultimately goes to heat. This is what causes the heat islands.” This raised eyebrows in at least one reader, who commented, to paraphrase, that in his opinion, heat islands were caused by solar energy acting on and with the structures in the city, pavements, buildings, etc. The answer is: both solar and anthropogenic heat contribute to heat islands.
There have been studies done on some towns and cities. I cited the study done on Barrow, Alaska in A Light In Siberia. The heat island there is 2.2°C in winter when there is no sunlight at Barrow’s latitude north of the Arctic Circle. At Barrow, it is clear that the heat island is due to the fuel used to heat the village. To quote from that study, “There was a strong positive relation between monthly UHI magnitude and natural gas production/use. Integrated over the period September–May.”
Fairbanks, Alaska, has also been studied for heat island. There, the heat island was shown to grow with increasing population over the 50 year time period from 1949 to 1999. The temperature difference at the end of this period was 1°C in mid-winter at Fairbanks airport, 7 kilometers from downtown, compared to Eielson Air Force Base, about 40 kilometers away, and nil in the summer. Again, as Fairbanks is nearly at the Arctic Circle, solar heating cannot be the cause.
What about heat islands further south? This author has lived in the Pacific Northwest of the US for most of his life, the last 50 years in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. In winter, there have been several hundred occasions when it was raining in the downtown areas, and snowing in the suburbs or surrounding rural areas. These cities are well known for cloudy and rainy climate, especially in the winter, when the sun may not shine for months at a time. These winter heat islands cannot be solar caused.
In Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real, the article stated that the U. S. used 29 PetaWattHours of energy in 2005. This is from all sources: fossil fuels, hydroelectric, wood, solar, wind-turbines, and pedal-power included. The last three contributed insignificantly, so can be ignored. The total land area of the contiguous 48 states is just over 8 million square kilometers. In 2002, urban area was less that 3% of the land area, or 240,000 km2 and 79% of the population lived in these urban areas. If each person consumes roughly the same amount of energy, then roughly 23 PetaWattHours was used in less than 240,000 km2, or almost 1010 WattHours per square kilometer, or 100 kilowatthours per square meter annually in urban areas. This is 6.1% of the sun’s energy on that same square meter. This will raise the temperature in that square meter by 17.4°C.
This figure seems a little high, as it is more than the NASA heat images reveal (10 to 15°C), and more than most studies have stated. This is probably because more energy is consumed between urban areas, for transportation (jet fuel, long-haul trucks, auto travel), farm energy use, electricity transport losses, and losses from the wind simply blowing it away to the rest of the northern hemisphere. But it does indicate that energy use heating may be the large factor in urban warming.

But what about the city structure itself absorbing solar energy and providing it back to the environment? This undoubtedly happens. The ability of a land surface to reflect solar energy is called albedo. The scale is zero for no reflectance, or complete absorbance, to 1 for perfect reflection. Lamp-black has an albedo of nearly zero, and fresh fallen powder snow has an albedo of nearly 1. Cities are fairly dark because asphalt city streets and parking lots, along with most roofing materials, are a large percentage of the surface. Most cities have an albedo of between 0.1 and 0.2. The average albedo of the earth is between 0.29 and 0.35, but it varies widely from about 0.9 or more for Antarctica and Greenland, to 0.2 for forests and vegetated areas. Deserts and dry grasslands have an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5. The oceans have an albedo of less than 0.1.

Figure 1. Terrestrial earth albedo. Source: NASA Earth Observatory, http://www.eoearth.org/article/Albedo?topic=54300
A city with an urban core that has an albedo of less than 0.2, surrounded by desert or grasslands with an albedo of 0.4 to 0.5, will be warmer than the surrounding area because it absorbs more solar radiation. Any heat energy produced by the population will simply add slightly to that heat. Examples would be Phoenix, Arizona or Cairo, Egypt.
There is a study that compared energy use and albedo for several cities. The link is below. If a city is mostly light colored concrete, with an albedo of 0.2, and is surrounded by suburbs with green lawns and asphalt streets, with an albedo of 0.11 to 0.16, the city core may be cooler than the surrounding area because the city core reflects more heat than the darker surroundings. An example would be Los Angeles, California.
Cities north of about 45° latitude, such as New York City, Montreal, Moscow, and of course Fairbanks and Barrow Alaska, will tend to have more anthropogenic heat than solar heat. Cities south of that line will tend to solar heating. A compact city will have more anthropogenic heat than one that is spread out because the anthropogenic heat will warm a smaller area. Again, New York City, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and Moscow, Russia, are good examples of compact cities with extreme heat islands driven by energy consumption. St. Louis, Missouri, USA and Berlin, Germany are the opposite examples with heat islands that are predominately driven by the sun. A city’s location, days of sunshine, density, and the character of the structures, will define whether the heat island is predominately caused by the sun or by the people.
One of the commenters on Anthropogenic Global Warming is Real…wanted an explanation on why some urban surface stations show a cooling trend. The answer lies in the local trends in albedo. If cities or regions get lighter, (white concrete streets replacing asphalt, increasing numbers of white sheet metal, or white painted roofs replacing tarred or composition roofs, increasing parks and open spaces, etc.) conditions would favor declining temperatures. A recent paper about land use changes in Spain cites an example where greenhouse horticulture in the southeastern part of the country changed the albedo locally by +0.09 changing the local temperature trend to –0.3°C/decade. Changes in land use, population density, vegetation, or even changes in local building codes may change the local albedo and change the trend in temperature. Very small changes in local albedo will lead to noticeable changes in local temperature trends.
Temperature change driven by urban warming or cooling, and albedo changes are what makes the total global surface temperature trend so maddingly difficult to ascertain. In the absence of man’s influence on albedo or burning of fossil fuel (ignoring any possible CO2 influence), the earth may be warming, or it may be cooling. We simply do not know. Albedo changes and energy use are masking the truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media reported that because of ash from the 1625m Dubbi volcano in Eritrea in northeastern Africa being blown 15 km up into the atmosphere, Hillary Clinton had to change her travel plans. So did dozens of other flights have to be cancelled.
Satellite photos now show huge clouds of ash blotting out the sky, see left, centre.
The volcano began erupting on Saturday evening – the first time since 1861, the German daily Bild reported here.
But as Der Spiegel reports, French scientists had misidentified the volcano. It wasn’t Dubbi after all. Der Spiegel writes: 
The VAAC volcano monitoring center in south-France Toulouse, which monitors the air space over North Africa, made the volcano Dubbi responsible. But a closer assessment of the satellite photos now show: Not Dubbi, but the Nabro volcano exploded – for geologists that is sensational.
The 2200-meter high Nabro has not erupted since man can remember, it’s been asleep since at least 10,000 years.”

The instability of the magma in the region and the eruption are now so great that the eruption was associated with an earthquake that measured 5.7 on the Richter scale. Der Spiegel writes that VAAC experts were stunned that Nabro had erupted because they thought the volcano was inactive. The huge amounts of ash first obscured the real source (Nabro).
The region is collapsing rapidly
Geologists say that the Eritrea region of Africa is now crumbling rapidly, and soon will be taken over by the Red Sea. We wrote about this back in Jaunary here.

The area between the dotted lines could be submerged – soon! (Photo source: Wikipedia.

The reason for the East African collapse is explained here in a Nature report titled: The protracted development of the continent–ocean transition in Afar
Nabro’s eruption coincides with the South American Puyehue eruption. The Caulle chain of volcanoes in the Chilean Andes 1600 kilometers southwest of Buenos Aires has been spewing a huge amount of ash up to 10 kilometers into the atmosphere since Saturday.
Although none of these volcanoes is large enough to impact the climate on its own, yet together and considering how much tectonic instability now seems to be at play, climatic changes due to these tectonic forces of nature seem to be more in the works. Expect more eruptions soon.
The ash spewed out thus far certainly will not help those betting on more warming, especially in combination with the sleepy sun and the multidecadal ocean cycles.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new book written by University of Konstanz Professor Gerd Ganteför is now being released by science publisher Wiley VCH: Klima – der Weltuntergang findet nicht statt (Climate – The End of the World Called Off).
Although Ganteför is a warmist, he dismisses the notion that a climate catastrophe is coming, and even adds that warming will bring advantages. This sort of optimism has sparked an angry response from the forces of German doom and gloom. The following clip is an interview of Professor Ganteför (in German).

At the start of the clip the interviewer asks Ganteför (right), with amazement: “The climate catastrophe is everywhere in the media, it really isn’t going to take place?” Ganteför responds:
Yeah, I’m really sorry about that, but the end of the world is not going to take place. Indeed we are going to have a warming, there’s going to be drought, there are going to be heavy rains, there’s going to be sea level rise, but these floods will be within the normal range of variation. Normal when you look at what happened over the last 2000 years. At the North Sea coast there have been large floods every 20 years, and it is not going to get any worse or better than what humans have experienced before.”
This kind of optimism and realism of course contrasts starkly with the dark images of catastrophe that get delivered by the crystal balls of AGW fortune tellers. For example, Ganteför’s realism has infuriated the catastrophe-obsessed cultists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PIK, who have since blasted Prof. Ganteför’s book, see Stefan Rahmstorf’s web blog of doom and pessimism Klimalounge.
Klimalounge wasted no time and spared few words in deriding Ganteför’s book, credentials and optimism, saying that he’s not a climate scientist and that any respectable publisher would have refused publishing such a work. Ganteför is just the latest enemy on the PIK’s ever growing blacklist.

Ganteför does not dispute that CO2 is causing warming, but adds:
This warming is neither worse nor better than the warming we’ve had in the past. There has always been climate change in the past. Two hundred years ago there was the Little Ice Age. This caused a lot of hardship for the people back then – with widespread hunger, bad harvests and so on. Back then we had a natural climate change that was negative. Now we are causing a positive climate change. If we didn’t do that, then it would probably get cooler, as we are scheduled for an ice age.”
I’m not sure about CO2 preventing an ice age, but I do get a kick out of the PIK when they claim we’re headed for the opposite kind of catastrophe. Both of these views are wild.
The book is also featured at: Readers Edition, which writes on how the book looks at three main topics:
Topic I: For environmental protection, the standard of living in undeveloped countries has to be improved. To achieve this, modern coal and nuclear power plants are necessary.
Topic II: The consequences of climate warming are not catastrophic, and even bring some benefits.
TpoicIII: The following should be supported to have climate protection: low-emission coal plants, modern nuclear power, wind energy, geo-thermal and nuclear fusion. Subsidies for bio-fuels, wood pellets and solar energy cause more bad than good.
Ganteför’s book is the latest in the starting and growing trend of seeing global warming as positive. Late last year, German news magazine FOCUS had a special called:
Global Warming Is Good For Us, 
which concludes warming has many positive benefits. Then a short time ago a German YouTube video parody featuring Jürgen Klimann appeared – asking where’s the climate change? And says warmth would be a welcome alternative to Germany’s otherwise gray, dreary and cool weather.
So maybe a little sanity and optimism is returning to Germany.

No one seriously expects the Thames to freeze over, like it did during the little ice age of the 17th century. But if the computer forecasts pan out, it could very well be one of the worst winters for northwestern Europe of the millenium – maybe in that elite class of the top 50.

Say Happy New Year! (Graphic: http://www.wetter24.de/de/home/wetter/profikarten)
Sweden in Britain are already well on their way to recording a “December of the century”. Joe Bastardi, like Piers Corbyn, pretty much hit it right on the nail – almost. Joe actually forecast the cold to be more centered in southern Europe, and not Northern Europe. But he wasn’t that far off.

The above graphic shows what the temperatures are going to be like when we’re toasting in the New Year. To the left it shows temperatures 5 days later. No let up! That’s freaking cold! You can view these graphics here at: meteogroup profikarten.
(The DWD says, however, that the forecasts at the moment have a lot of uncertainty, which probably means they are not sure how the storms are going to track.)
Is Piers Corbyn expecting this to continue? For how long? I’ve been hearing until the end of March from various sources. Say it aint true!
If this stuff goes on into March, then the Thames River has a chance of freezing over. If not, then many ports waterways and canals on the mainland will still be in serious trouble.  Things can change of course. There are going to be days where things will thaw a bit, hopefully, later on. Then governments really ought to use these occasions to ensure that supplies get rammed through to the max.
And when you have cold with the pattern shown above, you tend to get lots of snow.
For years we were told that the above charts would be coloured green or even yellow. All the so-called climatologists discounted the NAO and PDO and solar cycles, etc.  They didn’t want to hear it though. They went on preparing for warmth. Now it may end up costing millions of people dearly. Warming is indeed a whole nicer.

Someone needs to tell Romney and Christie because they look awfully silly standing all alone there on the platform, waiting for the train to come. It left long ago with hardly anyone getting on it – just some Europeans and a few panhandlers.
The leftist German daily TAZ reports (bemoans) here that the Kyoto Protocol is dead, this according to former UN Climate General Secretary Yvo de Boer in an interview.
On getting a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, TAZ quotes de Boer (emphasis added):
The spirit of the Kyoto Protocol has disappeared. Its body is being artificially kept alive and perhaps some of the organs may get transplanted. But we have to admit that the Kyoto Protocol is dead.”
This, de Boer says, can be traced back to a lack of political will.

Politicians obviously have come to realize that implementing Kyoto-brand policy is far more risky than alleged climate change itself. The hoax has been exposed, the science discredited, and the tide of public opinion has shifted since Climategate rocked the climate science community in late 2009, causing the Copenhagen Conference and the global warming hypothesis as a whole to crumble to pieces. Resuscitating the climate patient failed – it’s dead on arrival.
Kyoto countries today represent only 20% of the world’s CO2 emissions
Indeed de Boer says the remaining Kyoto countries represent only 20% of the global CO2 emissions, down from 55% back in 1997. The air is out.
Yvo de Boer does not even believe a road map to a new Kyoto is possible.
We had a road map in Rio in 1992, in Kyoto, in Copenhagen, in Cancun. How many more road maps are necessary?”
De Boer favours incentives for saving energy rather than forcing countries to meet targets. But that would only mean more government meddling in markets. Best way out would be to accept the science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Joachim Schellnhuber, German architect of the masterplan, dubbed the Great Transformation, warned back in 2009 that unless the world heeds his message, 6 billion people would perish. This was reported in the New York Times here, which wrote: 
Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said that if the buildup of greenhouse gases and its consequences pushed global temperatures 9 degrees Fahrenheit higher than today — well below the upper temperature range that scientists project could occur from global warming — Earth’s population would be devastated.
According to the New York Times, Schellnhuber also said at a plenary session at the international climate change conference in Copenhagen (emphasis added): 
“In a very cynical way, it’s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something –- namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people.”
What Angela Merkel’s climate advisor is saying is that there are billions of us too many on the planet and that more lebensraum is needed. He then adds:
What a triumph. On the other hand do we want this alternative? I think we can do much, much better.”

Even more bizarre, one year earlier in a Nov. 13th, 2008 interview with news television PHOENIX TV he reveals his thoughts on growing human prosperity and population, see this Youtube video link here:
The video text caption at the start reads:
Already with the current world population of 6.6 billion people, an overuse of resources is taking place. In the year 2050, 9.4 billion people will be living on the planet.”
Well that is simply too many and all very frightening for Schellnhuber. In the video he says with somber tones:
The earth likely will be populated by at least 9 billion people by 2050. You have to imagine that these people will reach an average level of consumption that Portugal has, one of the poorer countries in Europe. When you imagine that if all these 9 billion people claim all these resources, then the earth will explode.”
Of course Paul Ehrlich made similar absurd predictions 40 years ago, and the exact opposite happened. Ehrlich was exposed as a charlatan. So far all the model projections that his Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research have produced in the past have turned out to be all wrong.

Here in Germany the Greens and activists are constantly bemoaning the strong undercurrents of climate skepticism one finds in that “backward country” USA, and claim it’s all fanned by “hack” scientists, like Fred Singer, who are funded by Big Oil, or Koch Industries.
Well guess what? Climate skepticism is spreading way way beyond North America. Not long ago, Portuguese site Ecotretas put together an impressive list of skeptic blogsites and websites that are “in other languages” with “a few in English from non-native English speaking countries”.
ECOTRETAS LIST OF SKEPTIC SITES

Don't despair! Skepticism - the essential element that makes science work - is alive and well in climatology, and spreading! Big blue dots represent the number of skeptic blogsites (not to scale, for illustration only). 
Most of us have long been familiar with sites like Climate Depot, Watts Up With That, Real Science, Climate Audit, etc., but now we see there are many others out there all over the endangered planet.
I counted over 100 on the Ecotretas list.
Skepticism is spreading around the globe faster than Hansen’s phony red warm spots. How many of these foreign sites do you suppose are funded by Big Oil, Big Coal or Koch Industries? Yeah – we wish!
I can’t speak for others, but I can tell you I have not received a single cent of funding from anyone so far. I’m operating solely as a concerned citizen. I’m sure many on the list find themselves in similar situations.
The Ecotretas site is really worth bookmarking as many of these sites offer different perspectives on the issues. But there is one thing that is common to all: They suspect the science underpinning catastrophic man made global warming is a multi-billion dollar heap of rubbish…a scam that is disgracefully defrauding the public.
We’re on to you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany's version of Stephen Schneider (Wikipedia)
I think some people are not aware of, or seriously underestimate, Germany’s contribution to this global warmist movement. It really isn’t scientific at all. It’s purely political. Science (junk science) is just one of the engines they use to propel it.
A reader brought my attention to an interview with Hartmut Grassl at the leftwing newspaper TAZ in Berlin. Grassl is one of the grand-daddies of the German global warming movement.
He was the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI), a member of the Enquête Commission, a main Kyoto Protocal player, director of climate research programs at the World Meteorological Organization, board member of the über-alarmist Munich Re re-insurer and also the Academy of Sciences in Hamburg. He’s kind of like the German version of Stephen Schneider.
Here’s how this seemingly distinguished individual views the growing scepticism (answers from the TAZ interview paraphrased).
On handling sceptics (paraphrased):
Have they ever published anything? In 99% of the cases, that’s already the end of the debate – their literature has nothing to do with science.
What motivates the sceptics (paraphrased)? 
Some get money from oil companies. Others are just people who are against everything. I used to try to convince them with scientific arguments, but it was hopeless. When I get e-mails from them they are highly aggressive and filled with exclamation points and sentences in block letters.
On Climategate (paraphrased)
They were released just before Copenhagen. They always get real loud before major conferences. In the USA the sceptics have been traditionally strong; a lot of money flows in part from the oil industry.
On storms and exaggerations (recall he is a board member at Munich Re!):

One also has to say that people who exaggerate climate change are not helpful. Some environmental organisations even claim that climate change leads to more storms.”
Are there any credible sceptics? (paraphrased)
Yes, but very few. Richard Lindzen from MIT in Boston for example: He doesn’t dispute CO2’s greenhouse gas, but doubts the feedback effects. The climate models have probably gotten better as a result of his critique. But, the debate over his objections is pretty much over.
On Henrik Svensmark
Also Svensmark has been refuted a number of times. But scientists are often unable to let go of worn out theories, especially their own.”
What about the geologists?
Of course there have been temperature rises of 4 to 5 °C over periods of 10,000 years. But today we are talking about a warming of  2 to 3°C within 100 years!
There you have it. Sounds like our reader Dana doesn’t he? I mean that in a friendly way. I really like his answer about Svensmark. It’s kind of like the black pot insisting the white porcelain vase is black.
And shall we add a few more exclamation marks to the last statement and put it in block letters as well? Which 100 years is he talking about anyway? The computer model-fantasy century?
Just for the record, so far in this observed century the temperature has risen 0°C. plus or minus a few hundredths.
Source: http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/rebuking-bs-with-more-bs/
Expected climate warming: +1.5 to +5.5°C.
This century’s trend so far:  – 0.2°C.
I think I’m going to post “This Century’s Trend So Far” every month.
But in the future I will not cheat. and use instead UAH and RSS, which below shows a slight warming of about 0.6°C per century, well below the IPCC scenarios.
So far this century, the temperature is showing a slight increase.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving invested so much in renewables, the German government and Greens apparently are having great difficulties in coming to terms with the recently discovered huge reserves of cheap shale gas worldwide. This source of energy is not only affordable for consumers, but it is relatively environmentally friendly as well. But exploiting the gas would require governments and believers to abandon a big part of the green religion, i.e. renewables.
What do people do when they get so deep into an investment, and have worked so hard to convince everyone it is the right and moral thing to do, and then find out that there’s suddenly a much better and cheaper way? Do they simply abandon the entire endeavour? If the endeavour has become a religion and the meaning of life for them, the answer is no. They continue on a path to self-destruction.
That may indeed be the case for Europe and the Green Movement, who are now so deep into renewable energy that they may have gone beyond a psychological and emotional point of no return, a tipping point, and so they will refuse to abandon it no matter the cost. That could mean that the cheap and plentiful gas beneath our feet will simply be kept there, and we will be forced to continue paying exorbitant prices for an unreliable energy source and endure lots of pain.
Technically and economically, the recent discoveries of these huge deposits of natural shale gas in Europe make all the renewable energy pain completely unnecessary in the future. That ought to be good news, and governments ought to be breathing sighs of relief. But it isn’t so. Many European governments are not about to let anything disrupt their romantic visions of a future of renewables and the Truth.
Remember they are enlightened and infallible. So forget the drilling permits.

Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxiener at the online DIE WELT explain how the discoveries of shale natural gas have rendered renewable energies a complete flop. In a piece called Our Energy Dreamers Are Burning Money Instead Of Gas, they write:
Everywhere globally, huge reserves of natural gas have been discovered, from Israel to Qatar, from South Africa to Ukraine or Poland. The discoveries exceeded all expectations. The USA has found so much gas that it can become completely independent of imports. At current levels of consumption, there are enough for 100 years. And also Europe has gas for at least another 50 years – whereby the second biggest reserve is in North Rhine Westphalia.
Anyone in good psychological health would welcome such a blessing. But it seems we are living in times of increasing power madness. For example Maxiener and Miersch comment on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA), reaction:
But instead of expressing delight over the gas reserves, many of the archictects of our energy future are in a state of shock.
Equally shocked are the German energy dreamers with their solar cells because natural gas is relatively environmentally friendly and far more affordable than the option of Green-romantic alternatives.
So instead of burning the gas, the government will ask its citizens to burn their money to stay warm.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAntarctic sea ice simply refuses to melt, and stubbornly remains at a very high level. In fact in 2010 it reached its second highest level ever since satellite measurement began over 30 years ago. Normally Antarctic sea ice peaks at about 18.3 million sq km around September 20.
But this year, Antarctic sea ice reached that value already on about August 9 or so – over 5 weeks early! I’m using the graphic below to draw up these statements.
Stubborn Antarctic sea ice refuses to melt. 
In 2010 Antarctic sea ice remained at or above the normal high peak (18.3 million sq km) for well over 2 months, from early August until late October. That’s quite awhile for the ice to hang around. I bet lots of penguins are happy about this.
Granted I haven’t gone back and taken a look at the stats over the years, but I doubt you’ll find very many years where this has happened. So you just have to laugh when physicists impostoring as climate scientists tell you the Antarctic is in trouble. 
Fact is, it’s the climate scientist impostors who are in trouble, as we expose day by day. Don’t be surprised if soon another model or paper comes out claiming global warming is causing more ice! Read here. Call it desperate pre-emptive damage control on their part.
Global sea ice
Overall global sea ice was steady until about 2004, then declined for a few short years. Since 2007 it has been trending upwards. We’re at where we were about 20 years ago.
Total global sea ice is trending a recovery. 
Many are now predicting a recovering Arctic over the next couple of years, like Joe Bastardi. With no further ice melt, the peculiar absence of tropical storms, and bitter winters returning, it all means alarmists will have to be content with the meager pickings of isolated heat waves, floods or droughts.

No animal had ever been so instrumentalized by the German media for the purpose of rallying attention and sympathy to the mythical plight of the polar bears in the Arctic. According to Wikipedia:
Knut (born 5 December 2006 – died 19 March 2011) was a polar bear born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological Garden. Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers. He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years. At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success.After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub’s life were sent from around the world.
Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed “Knutmania” that spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books. Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007. Zoo attendance figures for the year had increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history. Knut died at the age of four on the afternoon of 19 March 2011.”
Unfortunately, Knut did not fare well in captivity. His chances surely would have been better if he had lived up in the Arctic (assuming no rejection by his mother), where the polar bear population has quadrupled over the last 50 years or so.
Bild tabloid today has the photos of Knut’s last moments at the Berlin Zoological Garden.
I wonder if Germany is going to declare a national day of mourning. Knut’s death is being reported everywhere. Rest in peace, Knut. Hopefully where you are now, you won’t have hordes of enviro-drones gawking at you all day long.
Am I being too hard on Knut tourists? Was there a “Brennpunkt” news special yesterday evening? Flags flying at half mast?…
Reading the controversy part of the Wikipedia account, I have to say the let-Knut-die proponents have an inhumane view. It wasn’t his fault he was born there. The keepers have a young animal on their hands, and it is their moral obligation to care for it. Sometimes I ask myself what for barbarians are out there. As short as his life was, I’m sure he had many moments of content.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel cover of August 11, 1986
The concept of “climate catastrophe” in Germany was born 25 years ago  writes German meteorologist Dr. Wolfgang Thüne here at his blogsite and, as of today, except for the media bluster, there are still no signs of it. Thüne writes:
Do you remember January 22, 1986? On this day a press conference took place in Bonn at the Hotel am Tulpenfeld. The German Physikalische Gesellschaft e. V. (German Physical Society) invited journalists and presented them with the “Warning of a Pending Climate Catastrophe”. Written on the invitation: ‘The Energy Work Group of the German Physical Society urgently warns in the accompanying document of an imminent threatening climate catastrophe’.
Later that year in August, Der Spiegel came out with its infamous Climate Catastrophe issue whose front cover showed Germany’s beloved Cologne Cathedral landmark half-submerged in sea water. The warning on the cover read: “Ozone Hole – Ice Cap Melt – Greenhouse Effect: Scientists warn of  THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE”.
In its story Der Spiegel wrote:
A consequence of not immediately reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be sea levels rising dramatically and the Cologne Cathedral will find itself in the middle of North Sea water. The Greens reacted spontaneously and produced a paper on September 28, 1986 called:  “Overhaul of the Industrial Society“.
The sudden doomsday predictions even prompted the government in 1987 to launch the so-called Enquete Commission with the task “Precautions for Protecting the Earth’s Atmosphere.” And so the panic in Germany had begun. The following year in the United States, James Hansen gave his infamous, sweaty testimony before Congress.
Today, 25 years after Tulpenfeld, and after 15 UN climate conferences with nothing to show, the climate catastrophe still remains elusive. In fact sea level rise has decelerated over the last 5 years, and the 0.5°C is far less than what was projected 25 years ago, and is likely due to natural causes (PDO). Indeed the accumulated cyclone energy reached a record low last year.
“Utopian pipe dreams”
Dr Wolfgang Thüne
Thüne explains in depth the origins and definitions of the term “climate”, calling concepts like climate catastrophe and climate protection absurd, and reminds us that “climate” is an abstract term, whose currently accepted definition hardly goes beyond a simplistic bureaucratic meaning, and is naively defined as the average of 30 years of weather.
Thüne slams attempts to limit global temperature rise to 2°C, or to steer weather so that it complies with the specifications of a “climate” that is derived by averaging an arbitrary 30-year period of weather. He calls such efforts “utopian pipe dreams”.
In view of our paleo-climatic knowledge that there have been numerous temperature fluctuations during the earth’s history, and picking a random 30-year period as the standard for the quality of the climate is an expression of unprecedented ignorance of nature.”
Even more absurd, says Thüne, is Chancellor Angela Merkel’s concept of implementing: “global climate justice“. Thüne adds:

No matter what is tried, man will never be able to stop the always ongoing process of weather-climate change.”
and:
The German Physical Society, with its climate warning, has outed itself as an anti-scientific lobbyist for special interest groups.”
The sun, not CO2, drives the climate
Thüne clearly thinks the focus on CO2 is grossly misplaced, saying solar and orbital factors play the biggest role by far. Thüne writes (emphasis added):
Suppressing this knowledge and making threats with a climate catastrophe is unforgivable, and is to be tagged as scientifically criminal. The German Physical Society has to know that the climate that it uses as a threat and for spreading fear, does not exist. That climate is an abstract term, a feature or, as Al Gore correctly says, a phantom.
Thüne explains how many people do not even understand the solar constant, which is not constant at all. Radiation is not constant at 1368 watts/m².
In reality, because of the earth’s varying distance from the sun during its orbit, the ‘solar constant’ is between 1320 and 1416 W/m2. That means that at the start of January the earth receives 96 W/m2 more in solar radiation then it does at the beginning of July.”
Thüne reminds that the solar climate on the sun indeed impacts the climate on the earth.
It always comes down to the angle of the sun rays striking the solar energy-absorbing earth’s surface. Every physicist or natural scientist has to know that.
Unfortunately, many are paid handsomely to ignore that, and to focus on CO2.
=========================================================
Dr. Wolfgang Peter Thüne, retired, was a meteorologist at the German Weather Service (DWD), meteorologist for ZDF television from 1971-1986. Received a Dr. phil. summa cum laude in Sociology, Political Sciences and Geography in 1986, was a representative of the Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation for Brazil in Rio de Janeiro from 1986-1990, and then served in the Mininistry of Environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFlorida State University scientist Dr Ryan Maue has an update on global tropical storm activity.
Now if global warming causes more, and more intense storms, then there must be some serious cooling going on right about now. Storms are practically off the radar! Here’s the chart for the last 40 years.

Dr Maue writes, adding his own emphasis:

Global Tropical Cyclone ACE does not show an upward trend in communion with global temperatures.”

Where’s the media? He also writes (emphasis added):
The March 21, 2011 00Z ECMWF deterministic 10-day forecast does not indicate another TC developing during the month. This will bring the previous 12-month total of global TCs down to 63 — by far the lowest in the last 40-years or more.”
Dr, Maue also says that this level is possibly “unprecedented”. 
So what should we start expecting from the “climate scientists? First they said global warming would lead to warmer temperatures. But then they changed their minds and said that it leads to colder winters. That means we can expect them to reverse on tropical storms and claim that warming will cause tropical storm inactivity.
But don’t count on it. For that to happen, the global warming “scientists” would first have to jump out of the pockets of reinsurers and into the pockets of those with interest in no storms, whoever that could be.

There’s nothing wrong with a friendly bet among gentlemen. I’d like to think that Rob Honeycutt and NoTricksZone had a difference of opinion, and so we decided to cordially shake hands on it like two gentlemen would. No one tried to drag the other through the mud.
But what we see at Joe Romm’s Climate Progress here is something totally different. Irked by growing public skepticism and statements made by Joe Bastardi on why he thinks the globe is starting to cool, Romm just couldn’t take it anymore. Frustrated, he lashes out.
Like a schoolyard bully who has just lost his best marbles, he calls Joe Bastardi out to the schoolyard to settle it once and for all, publicly taunting and singling out Joe Bastardi to meet him out there to duke it out in a climate bet. Romm has clearly reduced himself to a sort of schoolyard climate punk, thinking he can drag people through the mud and settle things that way. Clearly he has long exhausted his professional means. 
Romm, you blew it; you’ve shown you got no class acting like that. Twelve-year olds can act like that, but not professionals.
Maybe some other punk in your neighborhood will show up for your classless bet, but Bastardi isn’t coming for it. He’s got something maybe you had long ago – CLASS.
Joe Bastardi has left his response at his European Website here. And he’s right; this is not about meeting out in the schoolyard to settle scores. Things will be settled in time, scientifically, professionally. That’s why I tell the cock-sure warmists…be patient, things will unfold. Qué será, será.
And Bastardi asks what I think is the key question:

But what will you do if it goes down? Will you actually stop your obsession with destroying those that disagree with you and shutting down debate? Can we get your committment to that? If it goes up, I will be forced to become an advocate for your position, which if I am proven wrong, I will. I rather doubt the vast majority of people opposed to me will open their eyes even if we went into a mini ice age, as some have opined. In the end, there is the difference. I am not guided by blind faith, but faith formed from the foundation of facts on past events. If the facts prove me wrong, then I will be guided by what I know to be is right.”
The answer to the above question depends on how much class these people have. So far, it looks like they don’t have much. Joe says that if the temperature rises in the next 10 years, he’ll change his position, not because of losing, but because of what obsrvation and science say. But Bastardi accepts the challenge, like a gentleman with class would.
But at the very least, the challenge has been accepted, and you can keep your money. What you need to do is be rich enough in your heart to open your mind to other ideas, and if need be, like me, change if you are proven wrong over the coming years.
Given what I have experienced so far, it’s much easier to believe the globe will cool than people actually admit it is doing so, no matter what.”
I hope that Joe Bastardi didn’t let Romm get under his skin too much. His reply was too long, meaning he spent too much time responding to a classless person that deserves to be ignored.
Overall in this preliminary wrestling match, Bastardi just pinned his opponent in about 6 seconds flat.

This is no joke. Warming now leads to cooling! That’s the latest scientific news that our tax money has bought from Potsdam – from the house of Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf.This is what happens when you take activist physicists off the street, give them super-computers and a license to forecast. Here’s their press release: =========================================
Global warming could cool down temperatures in winter
11/16/2010 – The overall warming of the earth’s northern half could result in cold winters. The shrinking of sea-ice in the eastern Arctic causes some regional heating of the lower levels of air – which may lead to strong anomalies in atmospheric airstreams, triggering an overall cooling of the northern continents, a study recently published in the Journal of Geophysical Research shows. “These anomalies could triple the probability of cold winter extremes in Europe and northern Asia,” says Vladimir Petoukhov, lead author of the study and climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “Recent severe winters like last year’s or the one of 2005-06 do not conflict with the global warming picture, but rather supplement it.”
The researchers base their assumptions on simulations with an elaborate computer model of general circulation, ECHAM5, focusing on the Barents-Kara Sea north of Norway and Russia where a drastic reduction of ice was observed in the cold European winter of 2005-06. Those surfaces of the sea lacking the ice cover lose a lot of warmth to the normally cold and windy arctic atmosphere. What the researchers did was to feed the computer with data, gradually reducing the sea ice cover in the eastern Arctic from 100 percent to 1 percent in order to analyse the relative sensitivity of wintertime atmospheric circulation.
“Our simulations reveal a rather pronounced nonlinear response of air temperatures and winds to the changes of sea-ice cover,” Petoukhov, a physicist, says. “It ranges from warming to cooling to warming again, as sea ice decreases.” An abrupt transition between different regimes of the atmospheric circulation in the sub-polar and polar regions may be very likely. Warming of the air over the Barents-Kara Sea seems to bring cold winter winds to Europe. “This is not what one would expect,” Petoukhov says. “Whoever thinks that the shrinking of some far away sea-ice won’t bother him could be wrong. There are complex teleconnections in the climate system, and in the Barents-Kara Sea we might have discovered a powerful feedback mechanism.”
Other approaches to the issue of cold winters and global warming referring to reduced sun activity or most recently the gulf stream “tend to exaggerate the effects,” Petoukhov says. The correlation between these phenomena and cold winters is relatively weak, compared to the new findings referring to the processes in the Barents-Kara Sea. Petoukhov also points out that during the cold winter of 2005-06 with temperatures of ten degrees below the normal level in Siberia, no anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation have been observed. These are fluctuations in the difference of atmospheric pressure between the Icelandic low and the Azores high which are commonly associated with temperature anomalies over Europe. But temperatures in the eastern arctic were up to 14 degrees above normal level. However, distinct anomalies in the north Atlantic oscillation could interact with sea-ice decrease, the study concludes. One could amplify the other and more anomalies would be the result.
Petoukhov’s study is not about tomorrow’s weather forecast but about longtime probabilities of climate change. “I suppose nobody knows,” he says, “how harsh this year’s winter will be.”
==================================================================
It would be nice if these guys got their stories straight. First we were told for years that winters in Europe would be a thing of the past – rare and exciting. Snow in the Alps would disappear and devastate the ski industry, palm trees would grow in Scandinavia, Greenland ice would melt and on and on went the heat-stories. Now they tell us it’s going to get bitter cold.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), Germany’s flagship political daily, has a stinging commentary on the “growing green tyranny” in Germany. Its piece titled The Affectionate Ecological Dictatorship takes aim at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), headed by Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, NASA’s James Hansen, and German policymakers. The usually staid and measured FAZ uses a tone that is uncharacteristically harsh.Germany’s first (hardline) green state minister gets sworn in
The article comes at the heels of last Thursday’s swearing into office of Winfried Kretschmann – Germany’s first Green Party state minister in the industrial state of Baden Wurttemberg, home of automotive giant Mercedes Benz and sportscar manufacturer Porsche. The new State Minister Kretschmann means green business, and warns companies will have to change the way they do business.
If one should doubt that Kretschmann and the Greens really mean business, read some of the quotes the FAZ reports:
His words are neither to be taken as political-tactical provocation, nor as lip service to the base, but as dead serious: ‘We have to bring our model for living in agreement with the fundamentals of the planet. With our business and economic practices, we are harming the planet. For the automotive industry: ‘If the automobile industry fails to green up, then it will not have a future’.”
Kretschmann is not mincing any words as Germany begins to get a taste of the country’s first Green authoritarian hardliner, a harbinger of what may be in store for Germany if it continues on its current path to Green tyranny.  The country’s mad rush into ecological dictatorship is underpinned by science from the über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, a science that is packaged and uncritically disseminated to the public by a green cheerleading mainstream media.
“Ecological tyranny is growing”
As Germany rides a wave of environmentalism in the wake of Fukushima, the public as a whole is hardly voicing any opposition to the bold state intrusion into corporate management and private lives. And not only the Greens are spurring on the enviro-movement, but all of Germany’s political parties. Opposition to the green movement is weak, and political leaders feel embolden to grab power. The FAZ writes (emphasis added):
For a long time now it is no longer just the Greens who are intruding into private and company freedoms with the aim of cutting the people down for an ecological lifestyle. An ecological tyranny is growing in Germany; it leans on a large majority. And the German federal government is leading the pack.”
The FAZ then cites a number of examples: the government mandating ethanol fuels that no consumer wants, reducing rental rights of tenants when landlords do ecological renovations, mandating energy saving lights and chimney filters, forcing homeowners to insulate their homes, forcing consumers to buy expensive green electricity, plans to massively subsidise electric cars – to name a few. In a nutshell, property owners are now being told by the power-obsessed state what to do with their property and how to spend their money.
“Forced feeding of ecologically correct products”
Still, for the greens, things are still moving far too slowly. And the federal government is committed to putting Germany on the Great Transformation fast-track, where the state would have full power to decide the future course of its citizens. Guidelines are already being drawn up for deciding what consumers will be allowed to eat and how much energy and water they will be allowed to consume.
On all the government’s intrusion on personal sovereignty, the FAZ writes:
‘Forced feeding with ecologically-correct products’ is what economist Carl-Christian von Weizsäcker called the government’s style of not taking the citizens’ consumer sovereignty and freedom to decide seriously. Those who don’t cooperate, get defamed.”
and (emphasis added):

‘It’s bad enough to be oppressed by a minority, but it’s worse to be oppressed by a majority,’ formulated British liberal Lord Acton more than 100 years ago. ‘We are moving towards an ecological dictatorship,’ Weizsäcker says today.”
Hans Schellnhuber has little patience with democracy.
Losing patience with democracy
Much of the science underpinning the Green tyranny comes from the overzealous and dogmatic Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, led by Hans Schellnhuber. The FAZ appears to be realising this. I don’t know how often I’ve warned how dangerous this Schellnhuber and his greenshirts are, e.g. read here. For them things are not moving quickly enough. The FAZ is beginning to notice and takes aim at both James Hansen and Schellnhuber. The FAZ on Hansen:
Foremost, climate scientists are losing patience with the slow moving democratic processes. The world renown climate researcher James Hansen, who heads the renown NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, regularly expresses doubt on whether democracy can stop climate warming. Recently he praised China’s autocratic regime as hope. There, sustainable living could be ordered.”
The FAZ reports on how Schellnhuber once said that the German Parliament needs to be supplemented by a “Council for the Future” – which would have a 10% say on passing laws. The FAZ focuses on Schellhuber’s 32-page Social Contract For Sustainability, writing:
 It is full of moralization and revolution.”
and:
It overrides ‘interests groups’ and ‘veto players’ who hinder ‘the transition to a sustainable society’.“
This is written by the FAZ – the WaPo of Germany! Clearly the author is spooked, and the rest of us ought to be as well.
Hans von Storch: “quite arrogant”
Now even some renown German warmist climate scientists appear to be concerned by Schellnhuber’s bold master plan to transform the world and the government’s enthusiasm for it as they rush to implement it. The FAZ writes and quotes Hans von Storch:
‘The tenor of the paper reveals a problematic understanding of democracy,’ says climate scientist Hans von Storch. Moreover: ‘The authors reduce the world’s problems to carbon. That is one-dimensional and even quite arrogant.’ There’s global hunger for example, but that is not in fashion today.”
Indeed it is not. Green policies, particularly those promoting biofuels, are about to profoundly exacerbate the problem.
This is the real deal – the rise of green supremacism. This green malignancy will not remain confined to Europe. Make no mistake – it is a global endeavour. This is no time for Neville Chamberlains.

THANKS A MILLION – READERS!
Okay – compared to other blogs, which get this in just weeks, or even days, it’s not so much. Yet, it far surpasses anything I expected when I first got started. The first days of blogging saw a few dozen hits, and I thought maybe some day I’d get 100 or even 500 hits a day. One hundred thousand hits seemed so remote. But here we are – 1,000,000!
The first 6 months NTZ saw 220,000 hits, and the next 6 months and 10 days we got 780,000 hits.
Also thanks to the guest writers who contributed, namely Matt Vooro, Ed Caryl, Juraj, Jimbo (I know I’m missing a person or two here, so please forgive me) and all the regular readers. Readers are always welcome to contribute as guest writers.
And hopefully readers will keep dropping by.
Thanks to other sites for posting and mentioning my posts, particularly Climate Depot, WUWT, Tom Nelson and others. All of this contributes to readers getting stories and insights that they might not otherwise see. My main focus will be to continue writing about climate news in Germany and Europe so that people can get a feel of what is going on here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHat-tip M White.Spaceweather.com has an excellent report today called: ALL-CLEAR IN THE STRATOSPHERE about volcanic aerosols and their impact on the earth’s climate and cooling. Turns out that they have a far greater impact than expected.
Today the earth’s stratosphere is as clean as it’s been in more than 50 years. What does that mean? It means more solar radiation can reach the earth, and is thus contributing to warming. The stratosphere is too clean – because of the lack of volcanic activity over the last 18 years. According to climate scientist Richard Keen of the University of Colorado:
Since 1996, lunar eclipses have been bright, which means the stratosphere is relatively clear of volcanic aerosols. This is the longest period with a clear stratosphere since before 1960.”
Keen examines lunar eclipses and the brightness of the umbra to assess the stratosphere. Here’s how it works:
When the stratosphere is clear, the umbra (and therefore, the eclipsed Moon) is relatively bright. On the other hand, if the atmospheric lens that illuminates the Moon becomes dirty enough, light will be blocked and the eclipse will appear dark.”
A very clean stratosphere leads to warming 
Looking at eclipses of the moon allows you to assess the cleanliness of the stratosphere, or its dirtiness, which plays a major role in global temperatures. If the stratosphere is dirty, like after a massive volcanic eruption, then sunlight gets blocked out, and cooling ensues.
But if the stratosphere is too clean, as is often the case after a long period without a major eruption, then the stratosphere becomes clear and thus more sunlight reaches the earth. This results in warming. Well, Keen says there hasn’t been a major eruption since 1992 and so the stratosphere is very clear today, the cleanest it’s been since 1960. That means more radiation – and more warming.
The comparison of images of the 1992 eclipse to 2003 shows that the stratosphere was very dirty in 1992 after the eruption of Pinatubo. In 2003 it was quite clear.

Dr Keen has an excellent presentation up: Volcanoes and Climate Change since 1980. According to the presentation, the earth has warmed about 0.25°C since 1980. The question is why? Keen suggests it’s in large part due to the lack of volcanic eruptions. To find out more, he conducted the lunar aerosol climate experiment (LUNACE).
A lunar eclipse occurs about once a year. By looking at the umbra, scientists can check volcanic impact on the stratosphere every year. Keen provides a historical background on this in Part 3, how it works (Part 4), and calculations (Part 5) in his presentation.
Interesting is that a major eruption that dirties the stratosphere has occurred about every 10 years during the 20th century. The last one was Pinatubo about 18 years ago. So we are a bit overdue now. The stratosphere is much too clean. Too much light is reaching the earth, and so it’s getting warmer.
Keen writes in his presentation:
Since 1997, when Pinatubo’s aerosol settled out, the stratosphere has been exceptionally clear.
In Part 6, Climate) Dr Keen sums it up.
Half or more of the warming since 1995 may due to the lack of large volcanic eruptions.
That’s about 0.13°C. Keen writes:
The remaining climate change is presumably caused by other forces, such as solar variability, El Nino, Atlantic AMO warming in 1995, lower Albedo and maybe even a little greenhouse gas.
So many factors out there that get ignored. Looks like it’s back to the drawing board for the climate modellers. A little advice: You’ll never get the models right unless you weight the factors correctly. Start by cutting CO2 by 90% or so. And don’t forget the clouds this time!

Erte Ale volcano awakes from it's slumber. Photo source: filippo_jean (Wikipedia)
Volcano Erta Ale (above) in northeastern Ethiopia has begun to gurgle and widespread seismic activity threatens to redefine the map (see below) of the African east near the Red Sea – and to do so very quickly. Der Spiegel (in English) reports on dramatic geological events now unfolding.
The area between the dotted lines could be submerged. (Photo source: Wikipedia.
Der Spiegel headlines and writes:

Violent Seismic Activity Tearing Africa in Two
Researchers say that lava in the region is consistent with magma normally seen on the sea floor — and that water will ultimately cover the desert.
The earth is in upheaval in northeastern Africa, and the region is changing quickly. The desert floor is quaking and splitting open, volcanoes are boiling over, and seawaters are encroaching upon the land. Africa, researchers are certain, is splitting apart at a rate rarely seen in geology.”

For now, the only thing holding back the Red Sea water from the Danakil Depression (see following graphic) are hills, and they appear to be sinking quickly, writes Der Spiegel.
Afar Drape. The Danakil Depression is located in the upper center. Graphic source: Wikipedia). 
And now that the Erta Ale volcano nearby is erupting – something no one anticipated, it could disrupt that last barrier that keeps the Red Sea at bay. Der Spiegel:
The magma coming out of Erta Ale has the same chemical composition as the kind that emerges from deep-sea volcanoes. The entire region increasingly resembles an ocean floor — one without water.”
Magma typically seen under the Red Sea is flowing underneath the continent, and eventually something has to give. Fissures are appearing at many locations in the region. According to geologist Tim Wright, fellow at the University of Leeds’ School of Earth and Environment:
The hills could sink in a matter of days”
Tectonic activity has increased recently not only in that African region, but has also spread into Saudi Arabia. De Spiegel quotes Oxford University’s David Ferguson on his predictions for volcanic eruptions and earthquakes in the region over the next decade, saying they will…:
  …become of increasingly large magnitude.”

The warmists are all confused – most definitely. They want to eat their cake, and have it too. In doing so, they are really looking like real jackasses.
Today they are telling us: warm periods are unstable (and cold is stable). Yet, history shows just the opposite.
Lately we’ve been hearing lots of reports about the floods in Australia and mudslides and rains in Brazil – instability due to global warming, they’re telling us.
And last month they told us that all the cold in Europe and snow in North America were sure signs of instability in the climate system – brought on by all the man-made warming.
And be prepared for more and even worse extremes in the future as human activity pushes global temps higher, they warn. After all, warm is bad (and cold is good).
History shows that warm times are good, cold times are bad
Unfortunately for the media, yesterday Der Spiegel online reported on a new study appearing in Science, which I wrote about here. Der Spiegel writes comprehensively how the cold times in Europe lead to crop failures, starvation, disease, war and death – lots of death. At times large parts of the population were wiped out.
But as Der Spiegel writes: societies prospered during the warm times.
This is not what the warmists want you to hear. It’s the complete opposite of what they believe, or want you to believe. So this new Science report puts the warmist in a bit of a jam. After all, we’re supposed to believe that warm is bad, cold is good.
In covering the new Science report, warmist media outlets are falling all over themselves to avoid connecting the miserable times of history with the cold periods. Instead they are calling these cold times “dry times” or “periods of climate instability”.
For example Reuters, the Wapo and BBC are all reporting on this Science paper – but in unusually acrobatic ways to cover up the fact that cold is bad – and end up falling flat on their faces.

Here’s how Reuters puts it (emphasis added):
Good growth by oak and pine trees in central Europe in the past 2,500 years signalled warm and wet summers and coincided with periods of wealth among farming societies, for instance around the height of the Roman empire or in medieval times.
Periods of climate instability overlapped with political turmoil, such as during the decline of the Roman empire, and might even have made Europeans vulnerable to the Black Death or help explain migration to America during the chill 17th century.
The good times were the warm times, and here Reuters calls the bad times “periods of climate instability” and not cold periods. These  journalists are just making idiots of themselves. They know they’ve screwed up big time by hitching their wagon to the global warming hysteria. History has contradicted everything they’ve been claiming for the last 20 years.
Here’s how Stephen Stromberg of the WaPo puts it.
Writing in the journal Science, the experts claim that Rome’s Third Century Crisis — a period of political and economic unrest that inaugurated the empire’s slow decline — coincided with “distinct drying” recorded in tree rings, which may have rendered European agriculture less productive. Not just that — the appearance of the Plague in Western Europe correlates with a wet period, which may have provided conditions favorable for spreading the Plague.
Stromberg calls the cold time during the decline of the Roman empire “distinct drying”. The time of the Plague he refers to happens to be cooling time, which he dubs a “wet period” – but he just can’t bring himself to say “cold period”. In both cases sneaky little Stromberg tries to hide the fact that these nasty events events occurred in COLD TIMES.

Now here’s how the BBC put it (emphasis added):
A team of researchers based their findings on data from 9,000 wooden artifacts from the past 2,500 years. They found that periods of warm, wet summers coincided with prosperity, while political turmoil occurred during times of climate instability.
Very similar to Reuters. Here the Beeb also cannot bring itself to call the periods “cold”, and so dubs them “times of instability”. None of them mention that these changes were all natural.
Yet today, ignoring and even hiding history, they insist the opposite: claiming that warm is unstable and that cool would mean more stability.
They’ve painted themselves into a corner. Real jack-asses to say the least.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLevermann claims La Nina is warm. (Photo credit: PIK)
The usual German media outlets today feature the usual scientists who are out in force spreading the dreck science that global warming is leading to more weather extremes, and La Ninas.
These “scientists” are from the usual source: the alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).  Amazingly, one of these scientists even claims that the current La Nina is warm, and caused by global warming. 
The interviews come on the heels of Der Spiegel’s report late last week on a paper appearing in Science that shows just the opposite has been true in history: Warming leads to milder climates, which lead to human prosperity.
German Stern magazine did an interview with PIK scientist Anders Levermann, who is a lead author on the IPCC 5th Assessment Report on the subject of sea level.  Here’s his comment on the media-ballyhooed weather extremes we’ve been hearing about:
Certain is: In a rapidly warming world, we will experience more frequent stronger extreme weather events like flooding, droughts and high winds.”
Everything is caused by global warming – even the “record snowfalls in Germany”. Other than sci-fi reports from reinsurer Munich Re, I have yet to see one scientific report that links these weather events to global warming. In fact Accumulated Cyclone Energy last year reached a record low.
On the Australian floods, Levermann attributes them to warm waters around Australia, in combination with the current La Nina, which he says:
Together with the La Niña climate phenomena, which provides a warming of natural origin, the warmer water temperatures lead to the worst rainfalls in a 100 years. The higher ocean temperatures in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming.”
[Update: To be fair, Levermann here most likely meant: The higher ocean temperatures near Australia (and not the Pacific in general) in turn are very likely a consequence of global warming. I guess he wants to say the La Nina pushed the warm water to Australia, and this water is warmer than usual because of warming. The statement he makes above  is very misleading, to say the least].
On weather extremes in Germany this winter, Levermann serves up this observation (fantasy):

In any case one has to say that the snowfall of last winter was unusual. Also this winter was a record winter when compared with the past 100 years. Such 100-year records are tumbling one after the other, and it’s going to happen even more often in the future.”
Rahmstorf says there’s a connection (but he doesn’t see it yet)
The online Handlesblatt also features an interview with PIK Prince of Panic Stefan Rahmstorf about the same weather extremes. The Handelsblatt asks Rahmstorf if it is connected to global warming:
The planet is getting hotter and wetter. 2010, together with 2005, was the warmest year since measurements began, and it was also the one with the most precipitation. Also the increase in devastating floods can be explained by global warming says Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).”
Stefan Rahmstorf (Photo: PIK)
Everything today can be attributed to global warming. The theory is unfalsifiable. If it happens, it’s because of global warming. Anf if it doesn’t happen (droughts), that too is because of global warming.
The Handelsblatt then asks Rahmstorf if the floods in Australia and Brazil are not the results of the La Nina? Here’s Rahmstorf’s reply:
Of course these events are, in the forefront, traced back to La Niña. But the change between El Niño and La Niña is a cyclic phenomena occurring every three to seven years. But that does not explain why this year records which have stood for 100 years  have been broken. There are experts who believe that the fluctuations between El Niño and La Niña are more severe. Right now we are having an Extreme-La-Niña. In 1998 we had the most extreme El Niño.”
His colleague Levermann suggests it’s because of global warming. Note that Rahmstorf cites some experts who say so. But what does Rahmstorf himself believe? Handelsblatt:
 But I do believe that it’s still too early to robustly show there is indeed a change.”
This has been typical of Rahmstorf and PIK lately, having it both ways. Notice how he starts by claiming that the extremes are due to global warming, and that the ENSOs are getting more extreme too. But then he says he can’t robustly show a connection between global warming and ENSO extremes. It’s there, it just can’t be shown.
Just another day at the PIK. Doing all it can to link everything to global warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the rare and exciting snowfall projection? That’s what the leading experts using their tuned models and super-computers told us. And whenever the rest of us had the audacity to doubt these longterm forecasts, we were scolded, got one across the knuckles, and branded as deniers.
The gods are surely laughing.
Germany’s central location in Europe acts as a rough barometer for measuring general weather harshness in Europe as a whole, and so we can say that Europe in general is not getting its promised warmth. Meteorologist Karsten Brandt at Germany’s donnerwetter.de has a report out (in German) titled: Snow Without End – 2010 Is On Track To Set A Record. Here’s what Dr Brandt says:
The year 2010 is about to go down in weather history. The number of snow days is at a record level, between 70 and 110 days so far. By the end of the year Bonn for example could see 80 snow days, in Berlin it will be well over 100, and it will be between 90 and 120 snow days in other cities. As a result, it will exceed the number snow days set in the record year of 1963. In many parts of Germany, so many days of snow have not been counted in the last 100 years.
Note that snow days here means the number of days that have snow on the ground.

Gee, I wonder if the German media are all scrambling to report this? Maybe Der Spiegel will resurrect its old 1974 Ice Age piece I wrote about yesterday. This time, they could blame it on global warming. But don’t get your hopes up – the odds of the media reporting on this are, I’d say, 1 in 10,000.
200% to 300% more frost and snow days.
In addition, Dr Brandt says here that governments ought to be preparing for harder winters and not for warmth.
In the next years we will have to anticipate many more hard winters. Compared to the 1990s and 2000s, the number of frost and snow days is 200% to 300% higher. The reason for this careful estimation is the weakness of the Gulf Stream and the longer-term changeover of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation.
…the trend is definite: colder rather than warmer.”
This of course is all a very difficult act for the government to handle. The people are supposed to believe in warming, yet be asked to prepare for bitter cold and snow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, Germany’s elitst leaders think that by righteously adopting positions of “protecting the climate” and the “responsible” use of energy, they’ll be able to assume the role as the world’s moral leaders.
The pious, like Chancellor Angela Merkel and all the leaders of all other parties, media, etc., all insist they have truly learned the lessons of history and are now ready to take on moral leadership of the world and exercise the authority to admonish the rest of the world for its wasteful energy use.
Almost daily does the German public hear of a new energy-savings plan announced by these annoyingly pious and wise leaders on how to be even more responsible, and demands to make even more energy sacrifices, e.g. like shutting down power plants, installing more solar and wind farms, eliminating light bulbs, imposing tougher auto emissions standards, mandating ethanol, regulating people’s fireplaces, plans to increase tax on energy, and even master plans for the great transformation of world society. The list is endless.
Readers here would think that Germany surely will soon be a carbon-free paradise, an island of nature and morality. Well, think again. According to the Swiss online ee-news, Germany’s primary energy consumption spiked 4.6%  in 2010 – due to the “economic rebound and cooler weather“. EE-News writes:
The higher energy consumption led to an increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions. According to the calculations of the AG Energy Management,  there were very little changes in the energy mix as a whole and about two thirds of the energy increase came from carbon-based energy sources. The increase in energy-dependent CO2 emissions was at about 4%.”
While Germany’s leaders demand other countries reduce their carbon footprints and be more responsible with the use of energy, they have no qualms about their own growing consumption. Especially burning anthracite coal, which James Hansen compared to death trains, shot up 15.4%. The use of anthracite coal increased even much more than the “booming” renewable energies, which increased only a relatively weak 9.9%.
Yet, let’s not blame the average citizen’s desire to stay warm, and to work and use more energy to fill customer orders. I say be happy they are burning more and not less. German products are solutions that make other people’s lives easier all over the world. So hopefully Germans will consume even more in the future, and so continue producing more technology, machinery and solutions to fulfill human needs for comfort and dignity. Indeed, using more energy to help others is arguably a moral obligation.
Here are some of consumption increase statistics (%):
Petroleum: +1.3%
Natural gas: + 4.2%
Anthracite coal: + 15.4%
Brown coal: +0.2
Renewables: + 9.9%

The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research of the Helmholtz Association here reports that its Polar 5 research plane, loaded with measurement instruments, has just completed a 6-week expedition over the high Arctic, along with 2 other planes from the European and American space agencies ESA and NASA, to measure, among other things, the thickness of the ice.
On May 6 the Polar 5 Arctic expedition plane returned to Bremerhaven, Germany, where scientists will evaluate the volumes of data on sea ice, trace gases, aerosols and meteorological parameters that have been collected.
The Polar 5 route started in Barrow (Alaska) went over Inuvik, Resolute Bay, Eureka, Alert (all in North Canada), Station Nord (Greenland) and all the way to Longyearbyen at Spitzbergen. These locations were the base stations for the measurement flights over the uninhabited Arctic regions. The total flight time for measurement and travel was 130 hours. One of the main tasks was large-area sea ice thickness measurement in the inner Arctic, and this was done in close cooperation with the University of Alberta.
Preliminary results show thinner ice?
They used a four-metre long electromagnetic ice thickness probe, also called an EM-Bird. The Polar 5 towed the probe on an 80-meter long cable at a height of 15 meters over the ice surface. The AWI press release states:
A preliminary evaluation shows that one-year ice in the Beaufort Sea (north of Canada/Alaska ) is about 20-30 centimeters thinner this year than in the last 2 years. Ice thickness in 2009 was on average 1.7 meters, 2010 at 1.6 meters and 2011 at 1.4 meters. ‘I would expect this one-year thin sea ice will not survive the melt season this year“, estimates Dr. Stefan Hendricks. In a few weeks his colleagues at the sea ice group at the Alfred Wegener Institute will introduce their model calculations for the 2011 sea ice minimum.”

So the ice in the Beaufort Sea has gotten thinner? How does this assertion compare with PIPS, see here? Here are the PIPS ice thickness charts for the last three years, all for May 1st. Green is thicker and blue is thinner (see their site for the scale). For 2009:
May 1, 2009
and for 2010:
May 1, 2010
and for 2011:
May 1, 2011
Hmm. Clearly we see that somebody is overflowingly filled with crap. The charts show that Arctic sea ice is getting thicker.
So what is going on? We do know that the AWI is funded by the government, which happens not to be  interested in any news that may suggest they have been going down the wrong path and living in a planet-rescue fantasy. No, the ice has to be getting thinner – even if it is getting thicker – and their masterminded plan to rush into renewable energy indeed is going to rescue the planet. The scientists were probably summoned by the Klimateburo and told to watch what they release to the public, or else get the big cut-off! Who knows.
In the meantime maybe we can find an explanation for the huge discrepancy.

Can we provide enough energy to power the world using alternative sources, such as wind, solar, or bio-fuels?
This is a question that has largely been ignored, in hopes that the answer will prove to be in the positive. This article is the first in a series, taking the question one technology at a time.


Figure 1. Solucar PS10 solar concentrator power plant near Seville, Spain. Source: Wikipedia Commons

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PS10_solar_power_tower.jpg
Four problems with wind and solar power are: the area needed for the plants, energy storage when the wind or the sun is not available, transmission costs, and energy losses in storage and transmission. For solar power in the U. S., the power is available in the southwest of the country, and the power is needed in the northeast. In Europe, sunshine is abundant in Spain, but not so much in Germany. In general, environmentalists oppose additional transmission lines nearly everywhere. But let us assume that the transmission problem is solved. Is there enough area to collect sunlight to support all the energy needs? Let us take the area where this author lives as an example.
New Mexico – area 314,460 km2 – insolation 7 kWh/m2/day
Not all of the area is usable. Mountains, forest, wilderness, National Monuments, farm and urban areas, military training areas, bombing and missile ranges, are off limits. Perhaps 10% of the land area might be available for solar if all the ranchers are bought off and the environmentalists are bound and gagged. That likelihood seems very remote, considering that every patch of sagebrush seems to harbor an endangered lizard. (In California the animal holding up solar plants is the Desert Tortoise).

The power available on 10% of the area of New Mexico is:
31,446,000,000 m2 X 7 kWh/m2 X 365 = 80,344,530,000,000 kWh or 80.345 PetaWatthours (PWh)
This sounds like plenty of energy. The U. S. currently uses about 30 PWh per year. But there are problems. This figure is for a two-axis solar concentrator if it runs at 100% efficiency. The real efficiency of a solar thermal plant is in the range of 8 to 15%, about the same as photovoltaic panels. The Sierra SunTower plant in Lancaster California generates 5 MW peak, with no thermal storage, occupies 20 acres of land, about 81,000 m2, or about 62 W/m2. It is in a zone with 7 to 8 kWh of solar radiation available. That is an efficiency of about 8%. The Andasol 1 and 2 plants in Spain claim 15% annual average efficiency with 8 hours of thermal storage.
So, using the above efficiency figures, 10% of the area of New Mexico would supply 6 to 12 PWh of electricity or 20 to 40% of the energy needed for the US. We would need to build the same number of plants in at two or three more states, California, Nevada, and Arizona would be candidates.
Storing the heat for use at night is the next biggest problem. With current technology the most efficient thermal storage (molten salt) stores heat for about 8 hours. The salt used is a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate (fertilizer). It takes about 28,000 metric tonnes of salt to support the Andasol 1 plant for 8 hours of heat storage. Sodium and potassium nitrate are also known as saltpeter, the oxygen source in gunpowder. Now visualize a terrorist-driven airliner full of jet fuel (the carbon source) crashing into the storage tanks at one of these plants. It would be the equivalent of a small tactical nuclear bomb.
The total world production last year for nitrate fertilizers was 154 million tons, but most of that was ammonium nitrate. Chile, the chief supplier, only produced about a million tons of sodium and potassium nitrate. If all one million tons were used for energy storage, that would supply thirty-six 50 MW plants, or 0.018 PWh of electricity annually, 0.06% of that needed for the whole US, and less than 0.15% of that needed for all the above plants in New Mexico. One hundred years of Chilean production would build 6% of the needed solar plants for the U. S. alone.
There are other heat sinks that can be used, but they have problems of their own. The most efficient heat storage is the above described nitrate salts. The other proposals are more costly or have less volume specific heat capacity. One of the cheapest is concrete blocks with embedded pipes. But the structural stability of the pipes and concrete over many temperature cycles is a problem, and the mass needed is 250% of that needed using nitrate salt. For a plant the size of Andasol 1, 70,000 metric tonnes of concrete would be required. That volume takes up ground area, lowering the overall plant efficiency, and requiring more area for a given power output.
Let’s say we have beaten the above problems. We have paved 10% of four western US states with solar plants of 15% efficiency and are providing more than 30 PWh of electricity to the US, all the power we need. The problem then is that we are dumping nearly 200 PetaWh of heat into the environment, almost seven times what we are dumping now, and twice what the whole world is producing. What will happen to the temperature? The southwest US will be uninhabitable at something like 10 or 15°C hotter than at present. If the same thing is done in Europe, the rain in Spain will no longer fall anywhere. It will bring on the catastrophe that Hanson et al have been warning us will happen.
A solar power solution requires vast areas, with a high environmental cost that probably cannot be paid, and the waste heat load would make any projected CO2 warming look benign. Solar plants are not the long-term solution to our energy requirements.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe prophets of doom and gloom insist the end is coming and that we must fight to save the planet. Join the movement for salvation.
It’s supposed to be based on science and data, yet whenever data that contradicts the end-of-world claims appear, which is often, the prophets take on an us-versus-them approach, often portraying skeptics as infidels or even criminals.
So not surprisingly to many observers, a large part of the global warming movement is seen to have long since departed from the realms of science, evolved and moved into a cult-like realm. Has climate catastrophism become a cult?
When one goes down the list of signs that identify a cult in the list below, the similarities are striking.
Definition of a cult
According to Merriam Webster’s dictionary:
1:  formal religious veneration: worship
2:  a system of religious beliefs and ritual; also: its body of adherents
3:  a religion regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also: its body of adherents
4a: system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator (health cult)
5a : great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement, or work (as a film or book); especially : such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad b: the object of such devotion c : a usually small group of people characterized by such devotion.
How do we know if a movement is a cult?
Some cults are benign, while others are dangerous and can lead to tragedy. If many of the following apply, then it’s a sure that we are dealing with a cult-like organization (from www.apologeticsindex.org and other sources):
1. The movement is over-zealous – and regards its belief system, ideology and practices as Truth.
2. The group is elitist, claiming a superior status and purpose (e.g., to be on a mission to save humanity).
3. The group often prophesies the end of the world.
4. The group promises salvation.
5. Dissent is not tolerated and is even punished.
6. The leadership dictates how members should think, act, and feel. Leaders prescribe how they live, whether to have children, etc
7. The group instructs its members not to read information that is critical of the group.
8. The group has a confrontational “us-versus-them” mentality that leads to conflict.
9. The leaders do not view themselves as accountable to authorities, even advocating civil disobedience for the higher cause.
10. The group teaches that the ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may lead members to participate in illegal activities.
11. Mind-altering practices, such as the repeated use of propaganda and denunciation sessions are used to suppress doubts. Character assassination is a sure sign of a cult.
12. The group requires members to radically alter the personal activities they had before joining the group.
13. The group is active in bringing in new members.
14. The group is out to make money.

Dangerous cults are totalitarian and do not tolerate any criticism. Dangerous cults not only dictate what members believe, but also how members live. How often have we heard the climate catastrophism cult tell us what we should eat and drink, how to be mobile, what lights to use and how many children we should have? Cults are the antithesis of individual freedom.
Double standards
According to Apologetics Index, a destructive cult often has double standards. Members are expected to be obedient, while the cult leaders have their own special rules. A destructive cult has only two basic purposes: recruiting new members and making money. Destructive cults claim to be for the social good, but in reality the cult’s real goal is to increase prestige and often the wealth of the leader. In the Climate Catastrophism Cult, we see how leaders are getting wealthier and wealthier, while followers are asked to give up more and more.
A destructive cult claims that it is innovative, progressive and that it offers a new and better way that will cure the world’s ills. But, according to Apologetics Index, “These claims are empty and are only used to recruit members who are then surreptitiously subjected to mind control to inhibit their ability to examine the actual validity of the claims of the leader and the cult.”
Who is susceptible?
A cult needs followers. The more followers it has, the more powerful it becomes. One of the main traits that people who are susceptible to joining a cult have is a sense and desire for idealism. Those prone to joining a cult often display:
1. A desire to belong.
2. A desire for spiritual meaning.
3. The inability to say no or to express criticism.
4. Impaired capacity to question what one is told.
5. A need for quick and absolute answers.
6. Cultural disillusionment (alienation, dissatisfaction with the status quo.
7. Low self-esteem and a general lack of self-confidence.
8. to be naive.
Many followers tend to be young, disenchanted, frustrated, lonely and lacking a perspective for the future. Anyone that is going through a stressful period of transition in life is more susceptible to join a cult. It’s no wonder that older, retired people tend to be more skeptical of climate catastrophe. So, is global warming catastrophism a cult? It’s hard to find a movement that better fits the definition.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith summer officially about to begin, a number of weather services are making seasonal forecasts for Germany and Central Europe. Read here.
The English-language The Local writes:
Donnerwetter.de meteorologist Karsten Brandt said odds were ‘high that the weather will turn out sunny with a tendency to be dry.’
Wetter.net meteorologist Dominik Jung also predicted a warm, albeit changeable summer.
‘Short heatwaves of a few days will be followed quickly by cooling in the form of fierce storms with heavy rains,’ Jung said, adding that tornadoes were possible.”
Surprisingly the DWD German Weather Service, like the Met Office, refuses to make a seasonal forecast, though their forecasts have been better than those of the Met Office (that requires getting it right only once). Interestingly the DWD doesn’t have much faith in forecasts that go beyond 10 days – even with all them fancy super computers that can crank out global warming forecasts 100 years out. The Local writes:
But the official German Weather Service’s (DWD) Helmut Malewski said in a statement that predicting more that 10 days ahead is like ‘reading tea leaves’.”
Clearly Germany is now in a period of unsettled weather, one that looks set to stay for a few more days, but not until June 27 – which is so-called Siebenschläfer Day, which is like St. Swithins Day in the UK. The saying goes: If on St Swithins day comes the rain, for forty days it will remain.
Unsettled weather in Germany on June 27 would mean the chances are about 66% that the summer will be unsettled too – that’s what the statistics show. But right now the forecast for next week (June 27) looks sunny.

Why is this important? This VIDEO CLICK HERE (2 min) explains why. 
When I watched this video, I thought: “Wait a minute – I thought the science was settled, and that the models were pretty much fine-tuned and all.” But as you see in the video, three scientists are telling us there are still lots of data gaps that need to be filled in, and that this will take years to do.
The clip starts with NASA scientists Gary Lagerloef, Amit Sen and Yi Chao explaining why salinity is so important. Amit Sen says (emphasis added):
But yet we do not know one of the fundamental properties that effect climate, which is the density, the concentration of salt of the ocean.”
Yi Chao then says:
Salinity is one of the missing parameters we have never measured from space before.”

Gary Lagerloef:
We have no salinity samples at all from parts of the world, particularly in the southern hemisphere, the South Pacific, South Atlantic and southeren Indian Oceans. So there is a big data gap.”
and later:
Salinity is one of the measurements we need to fill in an important gap to do that very thing.”
Fine. But why not first fill in these “big data gaps” first before drawing final conclusions and settling on predetermined outcomes? Has no one ever told any of you how the scientific process works? And please don’t be so arrogant to think that you know the answer beforehand. Everyone knows that nobody is that clever.
One option I suppose would be to just extrapolate salinity concentrations at locations up to 1200 miles away from measured high salinity points, like your boss Hansen does with surface temperatures. The advantage is that it allows you to get the answer you want. I mean, after all, people in your field do this routinely.
Obviously the status of the science depends on who the scientists are speaking to. When they’re talking to policymakers, then they have have plenty of data to predict the future – even 100 or 200 years ahead! But when they are talking to people who decide the funding, then suddenly there are big data gaps – and everywhere!
Of course, we all know that the latter is true, and lots of data is still needed before one can even start to understand the complex system that is climate. And forget models that can predict 100 years down the road. It’ll be decades, if ever, before we reach that level of performance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAwhile back Steve Goddard was looking at unusual extreme events that occurred – back in the days when CO2 was at benign levels and the weather was supposedly always “normal”. Here’s another one. Anton Yevseyev of the Pravda.Ru news wrote about rare twisters hitting Russia. Though the main part of his report is about twisters that hit in 1984, he mentions one that hit way back in 1904 as well.
He writes:
The most destructive twister occurred in Central Russia in 1904   The twister appeared near Moscow, destroyed two villages and then ravaged the city itself. Over 100 people were killed and over 200 were wounded.”
Imagine the media if something like this happened today. More on the 1904 twister can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1904_Moscow_tornado. Yevseyev reminds us that twisters are not only confined to the American Midwest and South:
This natural disaster is most common for the south of the United States. However, twisters and tornadoes can appear anywhere in the world. The most important condition for them to appear is the presence of the so-called active convection zone in the atmosphere. Most frequently, twisters appear during warm seasons, in the afternoon from 3 to 6 o’clock amid thunder clouds of cold fronts and ahead of them. If a cold front arrives to a warm location, a twister is very likely to appear.
80 years later, in 1984, more twisters hit Russia, but killing fewer people – at least according to the Soviets. Yevseyev writes:
Twenty-seven years ago, on June 9, 1984, three fierce twisters struck several regions in the center of Russia. Such natural disasters have never occurred in Russia before. The unusual natural disaster, which ravaged Russia in 1984, killed 69 people. Fifty-seven of them died in Ivanovo. As many as 804 people were injured. However, one should not trust the Soviet statistics if it goes about catastrophes. The Soviet authorities preferred not to say anything about them at all.
Can’t only not trust the Soviets. The same brand of information politics is also practiced in much of the western media and at GISS. They also prefer not to say certain things.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember the prepsoterous Stern Report claiming warming is costing the planet dearly, and so we should avoid it?
Well, we know climate is always changing, which means only one of two things can happen – either it gets warmer, or it gets colder. We’ve been told time and again that we simply can’t tolerate any more dangerous warming. So what’s left? Cooling.
Many of us are getting a taste of it now. How do you like it?
The high costs of cooling
Airports are closed down, flights cancelled, thousands of travellers are stranded, motorways are jammed to a standstill, supply routes are blocked, railways are paralyzed, car accidents and injuries have skyrocketed, the economy has ground to a halt. Folks, this is going to cost a bundle. How much?
Dr. Karsten Brandt has roughly calculated the cost here at donnerwetter.de in his piece today titled:
Never has a winter been so expensive – 600 euros more costs per household
On average households can expect to incur €600 in extra costs compared to the average over the years. The biggest part of that will be heating and electricity costs of 300-400 euros. In addition there are other winter costs such as salt, winter damage to autos and other losses. The costs for households will reach €30 billion nationwide.
And if you include the waiting times resulting from the massive traffic jams on the motorways, that figure jumps to 80 to 100 billion euros.

This does not include the agricultural losses that are sure to be added. The construction industry is now completely idled as well. And it’s going to get worse.
The economic damage from the winter weather can only be roughly estimated. If the cold winter continues as forecast, we calculate an economic damage of about €100 billion from production shutdowns, losses with the supply chains, price increases in energy etc.
Send the bill to the Munich Re. A hundred billion euros means 2000 euros for each household in Germany. The figures are similar in Great Britain.
Government incompetence and willful neglect
Governments were woefully unprepared for this cooling, all because of close-mindedness and dogmatism.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and most politicians have been an abject failure over the last years. They stupidly based all their preparedness and winter planning for the future on the crystal balls and sorcerers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the the now disgraced Met Office in England. Policy based on fantasy. That’s gross negligence.
Also read how the biased Met Office mislead the public: gwpf.org.
Climategate did nothing to sway them to think that things might be a little amiss at theie climate research centres. Instead, they stuck their heads in the sand when the scandal was uncovered. Indeed they even whitewashed away all the gross deficienies that had been exposed, and continued thinking it’s going to get warmer.  They are completely blinded by radical dogmatism, relying on incompetent scientists and tarot cards. This is horrible judgement and willful neglect on the part of Europe’s leaders.
These leaders need to make a U-Turn or resign. Leaders who cannot get past their dogmatism become menaces to the societies they’ve been entrusted to serve. They are costing us money – and lives.

Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one?
That’s what we’re betting on.
The warmists are betting it’s going to be warmer. But the coolists say it will be cooler because of natural cycles, which are now beginning to have a cooling effect. Here’s why I feel us coolists are going to win:
1. CO2 is wildly exaggerated as a climate driver.
2. The PDO has entered it’s negative phase – meaning more La Ninas in the pipeline.
3. Solar activity is low.
4. The AMO is also about to head towards its negative phase.
5. We are overdue for a disruptive volcano.
6. A growing number of scientists say so.
The following is the latest list of pledges (user names and amounts in US$) in alphabetical order. Newcomers are welcome! (See below on how to bet). Amounts are in US dollars.

This bet by the way is named after the initiator: warmist Rob Honeycutt, who has pledged to match all the bets from the cool side, up to $5000.00, and is happy about the money from the losers going to charity (That’s very generous of him :)). I’ve been in e-mail contact with Rob, and he really is a good guy. He means well.
And if the cool side can get that many pledges from the coolists, then Rob will start looking for more warmists to join in to up the ante. Let’s see how high we can get this.
Payment will be made 2021, and so if you think inflation and/or lack of interest paid, etc. will erode the amount, then just add a little more to your pledge. Again, we want to keep it simple.
If you are interested in joining this bet, you can read how to:
JOIN THE CLIMATE BET FOR CHARITY 
It’s very uncomplicated. Just leave a comment making your pledge, and I’ll put your user name, e-mail address and amount on a list. That’s it! We’ll come knocking at your door in 2021 (if you lose). And hey – it’s for a good cause.
The coming decade is going to settle the science
In fact, it may take only a few years. Here’s the life-story of the AGW scare:
1980s: AGW scare was born.
1990s: AGW scare lived.
2000s: AGW scare was killed.
2010s: AGW scare will be buried.
The oceans are cooling, and cold winters are returning, which is bad news for the planet. We’d be much better off with another one or two degrees of warming. The latest tree ring study we saw in Science clearly shows that warm is better. I hope that us coolists lose this bet. But I doubt we will.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Defence Minister (Dr?) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg is under heavy fire amid allegations he plagiarised other works and included them in his doctoral thesis, read short report here.
Unlike Climategate, the media here is doing its work and reporting on these developments which are now breaking, thanks in large part to the work of bloggers.
The case against zu Guttenberg appears to be hardening, at least that’s what we are hearing from the media. If it turns out that he did indeed plagiarise, then his doctorate will be revoked, and he will be under massive pressure to resign. Others of course say that everyone makes mistakes, and so he ought to stay. I think he ought to resign if he did indeed plagiarise.
Although the media hype surrounding zu Guttenberg is immense, the general public is a bit more calm about it. Most Germans here will tell you that they would not be surprised if many doctoral degree holders probably have done the same to a greater or lesser extent.
This got me thinking about climate science and all the professors and scientists out there. How many were really honest in their doctoral theses? In climate science we’ve seen a lot of shady dealings, criminal activity, corruption and downright fraud. It certainly would be interesting to examine a few theses from some of these leading warmist scientists.
I’ll just come out and say it. Any scientist that has the habit of manipulating, torturing and misrepresenting climate data probably was also less than honest in writing his/her thesis. Dishonesty starts very early on in life. Sure, this is a dangerous path to take, and one that is probably best avoided. It would indeed signal the start of a whole new level of mud-raking that might do more harm than good. Even honest people make mistakes, after all. Everyone has lied at one time or another. Yet, while some people rarely lie, others are pathological.
Shouldn’t the public know?
Sometimes it is not even clear what is a lie. Many tell half-truths, which is a way of deception. At this blog I tend to tell only one side of the story – because I feel the other side has been told ten times already. Does that make me deceptive?
Shall we have a look at some doctoral theses?

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst off, don’t take what this buffoon of a scientist Hoffmann says too seriously. He just serves as an example to illustrate what these self-anointed “elite climate scientists” think of people who don’t believe their junk science and believe in democracy. Some background:
Georg Hoffmann is a German nuclear physicist and worked on climate models at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg. He then worked in Paris at the LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement) on various aspects of paleo-climatology, specialising in climate reconstructions over the last 1000 years. And last I’ve heard, he then got shipped out to some position out in the desert. Except for his rants at Scienceblog, a Google search turns up very little about any real accomplishments.
At the German Scienceblogs blogsite, Hoffmann, in his typical disdainful haughtiness, once again goes after the climate skeptics, this time using the nutty Glenn Beck in an attempt to put all skeptics in Beck’s boat. This is not the first time Hoffmann indulges in juvenile behaviour, see here. In his latest post he labels Beck as “crazy” – like Hannibal Lechter-crazy.
But first, Hoffmann tells us that skepticism “is a dangerous thing”, starting off his post with:
The so commendable ‘I don’t believe that offhand scepticism is a very dangerous thing. Skeptics of this or that easily become conspiracy theorists who are known to be only a step away from psychopathology. Being a climate skeptic is in no way a condition to put someone on this precarious level of increasing confusion, but let us say: It helps.”
In Hoffmann’s view, skeptics have the potential to become crazy, like Hannibal Lector, or Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Yes, we are probably a greater threat to society than nuclear power plants, and so Angela Merkel should shut us down too because of the unacceptable risk we pose.

Remember, Hoffmann is just one of the many Malthusian charlatans in Europe preaching a gospel produced by crystal balls and flakey climate models, who even claim they can mystically foresee the coming climate Armageddon – even 200 years into the future. (This Armageddon is of course unavoidable, unless of course we submit ourselves to their “masterplans”). These religious climate prophesiers tell us Biblical-proportion rubbish like:
– sea levels will rise meters and meters!
– species will die off like flies!
– ocean acidification will kill marine life!
– Himalayan glaciers are going to disappear by 2030!
– the Medieval Warm Period didn’t really exist!
– global temperatures likely will rise 8°C by year 2200, or more!
– coal plants are global warming death trains!
– global warming causes cooling! And so on.
Indeed it makes us wonder who really is just a step away from “psychopathology”.
Thinking he’s really clever and witty, Hoffmann rants on about Beck’s kooky antics, reminding us that the nutty Beck is a skeptic (and so skeptics are like Beck). Finally Hoffmann, who like Schellnhuber, just cannot conceal his disdain democracy, finishes with:
And everyone, everyone is allowed to vote, Beck is allowed to vote, and those who listen to him and think his analysis is interesting, they too are allowed to vote. So humanity, here is the question I ask you: Are we ready for the 21st century?”
That’s right you arrogant, intolerant agitator – WE CAN ALL VOTE.  The world is only in trouble if people listen and believe the crap you and your ilk put out. We saw what happens when a few elite masterminds with the same calibre of arrogance you display think they know what is best for everybody else.
My advice is that you start behaving like a scientist and get back to your work and do something for a change. Authoring childish provocations as you do is a disgrace to your profession. Skeptics have the democratic right to speak out and to do so without your bullying tactics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterQuestion: A man sitting next to a radiator in his living room wants to feel 0.2°C cooler. What should he do?
a) Move his chair a couple centimeters further away from the radiator, or
b) Go out and pay $5000 for a completely new heating system from a shady manufacturer who promises it will be 0.2°C cooler.
Sane persons of course will answer with “a”. But if you’re the European Union and your advisers are German economist Ottmar Edenhofer, and sleazy furnace salesmen Hans Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Malthusian Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK), your answer is “b”.
In fact salesmen Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf have convinced the man that unless he buys the new, cooler furnace today, he’ll soon fry.
Worse, the furnace that promises to solve “the problem”, does not even work when there’s no sun or little wind. No matter though, you still have to buy it. This is what Schellnhuber and Edenhofer of the alarmist/activist PIK are demanding of every global citizen today. The absurdity and arrogance simply could not be more profound.
Call it a field plan for a green September 1, 1939 kind of bank account invasion (US citizens, watch your 401k). It’s that crazy.

According to the green-fundamentalist Klima Der Gerechtigkeit (in English: Climate of Justice), the teutonic Edenhofer of the PIK) on Monday will introduce to the public his master economic plan for mitigating dangerous global warming, dubbedSpecial Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation.
The Special Report sums up 164 existing studies and tries to get an overview of just how much renewable energies can contribute in solving the “climate problem”. This of course involves spending gargantuan sums of money that an almost bankrupt planet does not have. How much will it cost? Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes (emphasis added):
Witha mere twelve thousand billion dollars by 2030, a global energy transformation could be achieved that would lead to about 3/4 regenerative energy worldwide by 2050.”
Yes, for that “mere” amount of money, we can get a temperature change that no one will even notice. That “mere” amount is about 8 times the direct cost of WWII for the planet, see here (h/t ArndB). So far I have yet to find a single language that has the words to describe the magnitude of this proposed folly.
As it stands now for the greenshirts, we are nowhere near where we have to be. Klima der Gerechtigkeit writes:
Indeed the current situation is dismal: Almost the entire energy mix comes from coal, gas and oil. Nuclear energy is only 2% (and growth here is very improbable). About 13% is already generated by“renewables”, by behind this is unfortunately too much biomass that is used conventionally, i.e. firewood, and so directly drives  deforestation (and the climate problem) . ‘Water power then follows (2.3%), wind energy (0.2%), solar energy and geothermal (each 0.1%) as well as ocean energy(0.002%).’ (Zeit)”
How many tens of billions have flowed into renewables so far? 0.3% is all we have to show for it? The 12 trillion number can be doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled, and you still will never reach the 75% target by 2050. In the end as a result, we’ll have a hollowed out society with hundreds of millions more suffering and dying in abject poverty.
What we need is economic sustainability, and not sustainable wealth destruction.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a clip I missed -broadcast late last year by German ARD television in a news show called Report MÜNCHEN (Report Munich). H/T to Rudolf Kipp, who commented at another blog. See video in German:
Report München on biofuels
It’s yet another glittering jewel of an example of the destruction wreaked by the AGW cult movement. It’s scorched earth policy to save the planet. Meanwhile cult leaders are profiting as the world gets burned. The clip description:
Indonesia: Instead of rainforests, more and more palm oil plantations. Palm oil for our kitchens, cosmetics and biofuels. Report MÜNCHEN shows the latest pictures from Borneo and the ecological catastrophe taking place there. A devastating climate result is the bottom line. Yet parts of the EU-Commission obviously wants to cover this up.”
Biofuel deforestation produces 20% of CO2 emissions
It’s the destruction of the rainforest in the name of climate protection. Clearing the land to make way for palm oil plantations. Prof. Jürgen Schmid of the Fraunhofer IWES Institute:
“We have recommended the German government to completely stop its support of bio-fuels.
The ARD calls the clearing of forests in Asia:
An ecological catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions.”
Unfortunately, huge areas of jungle have already been completely cleared so that palm trees can produce a relatively minuscule amount of biofuel to burn in Europe. Burning the biofuels will reduce CO2 emissions a tiny bit. But this is all offset, and then far far exceeded, by the CO2 that is released from the large-scale deforestation. Prof. Florian Siegert, University of Munich:
It is estmiated that the deforestation causes 20% of the total CO2 emissions on the planet.”
Producing 20% of the CO2 emissions to save a few tenths. A proud result of the destructive AGW cult movement. What do the EU leaders have to say? They are covering this up. Report Munich received classified documents showing that EU bureacrats suppressed this information and kept it out of the public’s view. In an e-mail:

Hypothetical values from an indirect land use change should be removed from the texts.”
Sustainability swindle
EU guidelines do state that primary forests may not be cleared to make biodiesel starting in 2012. But Report Munich calls this labelling fraud. Deforestation of primary forests is not restricted when it comes to clearing primary forests for palm oil for the food industry, and as a result, only a shift on paper takes place. That means rainforests may be cleared away also in the future for palm oil for food. On the old plantations, palm oil for biofuels will move in. Now you see it, now you don’t.
That’s how EU bureaucrats are saving the planet from the climate catastrophe. ARD TV calls it “greenwashing”. Prof. Jürgen Schmid calls it:
Sustainability Swindle”
The Fraunhofer Institute presented their urgent warnings to the EU. But the devastating results were simply deleted in reports – whitewashed. The final report on biofuels was only 10 pages long, and there was no mention of the rainforest devastation caused by the EU’s biofuel policy. Infuriated by the EU, the Fraunhofer Institute added their disclaimer to the report:
The final presentation of the results do not reflect the views of the Fraunhofer ISI.”
When confronted by journalists, EU leaders were quick to duck the brutal reality and busied themselves giving sustainability awards to corporations like Mercedes Benz for building bio-fuel cars. Meanwhile, the German government is even now ignoring the recommendations of its own scientific advisory board, and intends to go ahead in boosting the use of biofuels by the year 2050.
Says Prof Jürgen Schmid:
The German government’s target is to boost bio fuels share as a fuel to 90%. That is madness.”
But destructive cults are mad. And that’s the way the green movement is going ahead. That’s how to save the planet: Just burn it!
The video report was produced by Thomas Kiessling, Mike Lingenfelser (29 Nov 2010).

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m a little overdue with the climate bet (FOR CHARITY) update. But here it is.
This bet is also known as the Honeycutt Climate Bet for Charity, named after Rob Honeycutt who first proposed this bet. You can find the background info here.
The cool side takes an early lead!
Will the new 2011-2020 decade be warmer or cooler than the last one? The first month, January – 2011,  came in well below the 2001-2010 average. Call it a 3-pointer for the coolists – a message to the warmists! We’ve taken the early lead. And looking at the La Nina that’s taken hold, that early lead will certainly grow. Is it going to be a blowout?
It’s a long ballgame though – 119 more months! Here are the bets so far (I hope I haven’t left anyone off the list. If so, let me know and I’ll repost the table).
The cool side bets so far:

Also add reader Mathhu ($100) to the above list. New total $5550.
And the warm side bets:

The warmists, though small in number, are indeed a generous bunch.
So far we (both sides) have pledged over $19,000.00. So no matter who wins, some good will come out of this.

Look – it’s a messy job cleaning this up and things will neither go smoothly nor happen right away when you want them to.Right now you’ve got hundreds of thousands of poor earthquake victims outside freezing in the bitter elements and it would be nice if the media focused on them and did something to lift their spirits for once.
That said, here are some good links from calmer heads:
– Firsthand account from someone in Tokyo: chipango blog (hat-tip: oekowatch.org):
And while a momentary increase in radiation has been observed on Monday (which was still an absolutely harmless figure and mostly proves the sensitivity of our measurement processes), the figures have been falling ever since. Since yesterday morning, we’re essentially measuring only the natural background here in Tokyo.”
– More information here at the iaea.org/news:
Japanese authorities have informed the IAEA that engineers were able to lay an external grid power line cable to unit 2. The operation was completed at 08:30 UTC.  They plan to reconnect power to unit 2 once the spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building is completed.
The spraying of water on the unit 3 reactor building was temporarily stopped at 11:09 UTC (20:09 local time) of 17 March. The IAEA continues to liaise with the Japanese authorities and is monitoring the situation as it evolves.”

– More detailed report here at World Nuclear News:
There have been about 50 staff engaged in pumping seawater into the reactor cores and primary containment vessels of units 1, 2 and 3. From time to time these need to vent steam, which causes radiation to rise across the site and required the workers to move to a safer location.
Another 130 were also on site, according to reports, including soldiers from the Japan Self Defence Force.”
and
The Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said at 8.38pm that a cable was being laid to bring external power from transmission lines owned by Tohoku Electric Power Company. This was to be connected when radiation levels had died down after a planned venting operation at unit 2.
In addition, one of the emergency diesel units can now be operated and will be used to supply unit 5 and 6 alternately to inject water to their used fuel pools. Later, the power will be used to top up water in the reactor vessels.”
And here’s a view from Steven Goddard’s site (hat-tip: climatedepot.com). I know some people are addicted to downers and depressing news, but try to balance what you hear from the hysterical MSM and listen to non-wild-speculation reports like those above.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post, I wrote about some German politicians who have woken up to the fact that energy saving lights are highly toxic, and dangerous to use in households.They now want to have them banned, and bring back the old incandescent bulb Edison brought us 130 years ago. I also posted a link to a shocking German documentary that exposes the reckless recycling of the mercury-laden bulbs.
Parts 2 and 3 of the documentary show the horrific handling of the used ESLs, which I describe here in English.
Part 1/3: The North Sea island of Nordeney changes over to energy saving lights in a project with Philips
The 2009 report on NDR German television investigated the energy saving lamps (ESL) in detail and found it is probably far worse for the environment than any one could have imagined. In Part 1, the North Sea island of Nordeney wants to eliminate all incandescent light bulbs, and thus become a model for the world. So Norderney teams up with ESL manufacturer Philips to replace all normal lights with ESLs.
Citizens expressed their concerns about the toxic mercury in the lamps. But the Philips spokespersons downplay the risk and tell lies about the risk. The TV documentary asks the question: “Are ESLs really that good for the environment?” The answer to this question becomes shocking when all factors are examined.

Part 2: The ESLs are transported and reloaded over hundreds of kilometers, leaving a trail of toxic mercury and broken lamps behind. 
As Part 2 shows, many of the residents of Nordeney are worried about the toxic mercury, and want to know how the ESLs are to be safely transported off the island once used. Is it possible to put them in containers without breaking and releasing mercury? In a town meeting with citizens, a Philips sales manager simply answers that it is not the responsibility of the manufacturer, but rather that of the recycling companies. Here the Philips spokesmen underplays the hazards of their ESL’s.
The citizens want to know if recycling companies properly handle the ESLs? To answer the question, the NDR reporter follows the entire recycling route of the ESL. What he finds is horrific.
Taking the old lamps back to the shop
Part 2 of the documentary shows that shops gladly take back the ESLs once used, and carefully collect them for recycling. When you buy a new lamp, then just bring back the old one. The shops collect the old ESLs and a disposal company later picks them up and takes them to a disposal centre. But as you will see, the route to recycling is one that is riddled with released mercury and broken lamps. Work conditions for workers are horrendous.
Toxic work conditions
Used ESLs first are first collected at the Müllumschlagstation (Waste Gathering Station) on Norderney. As the NDR reporter shows, the Müllumschlaganlage Norderney is poorly equipped to handle the old ESLs. The company doesn’t have the proper containers for storing and transporting them. As a result many of the ESLs break and release their toxic mercury into the environment. Here a worker handling the broken ESLs is asked if he was afraid of the mercury. He replied,
“No, we wear gloves – and we have been immunised.”
Immunized against mercury? The disposal company spokeswoman then explains that the correct containers for holding the old ESLs are actually wire mesh boxes, but they don’t have any in Norderney, and then adds that ESL breakage is rare anyway and so it isn’t a real problem. But as the reporter shows, there are broken ESLs everywhere.
Once the lamps are sorted, trucks pick them up and transport them off from the island. Where do they go next?
Unloading and reloading – broken lamps everywhere
The reporter follows the truck on its trip from Norderney to the MKW disposal centre on the German mainland located in Grossefehn, just east of Emden. But here the facility is also not a recycling centre. It is just another logistics collection centre where the “improper” containers are unloaded and the lamps reloaded again (more lamps break). No recycling is done here. Here, the broken ESLs are sorted out by workers who only wear gloves and no masks. One worker is picking broken pieces and putting them in a paper box and brings them to a container – an open wire mesh container. When a wire mesh container is full, it is picked up by a truck and the journey continues.
More unloading and reloading – more broken lamps

From Grossefehn the truck transports the ESLs to a 3rd location where there are many more wire mesh containers filled with old broken ESLs exposed to the air. At this third location, ESLs are also only collected, and not recycled, and then sent to yet a 4th location. But where? The reporter then follows the ESLs, now held in the “correct” wire mesh containers, all the way to Bad Oeynhausen, several hundred km away. But at this location, the reporter is not allowed to film.
The reporter does, however, find out that the next location for the old lamps is the DELA recycling company near the city of Essen. By now the old lamps have travelled more than 600 kilometres since leaving Norderney. Many do not even survive the trip. And the energy the lights had saved by consuming less electricity is certainly used up by the long and complicated logistics chain.
At DELA, the manager spoke openly about the recycling process, proud to be a part of protecting the environment. On the subject of breaking ESLs, he assured that it happened very rarely. Says manager DELA Ralf Kölzer:
Broken glass is immediately sorted out and there is practically no breakage in the wire mesh containers. The amount of breakage is negligible.”
But the reporter then shows a truck being unloaded. As the truck is opened, many small shards of mercury contaminated glass fall to the ground. No problem though. Two workers simply sweep up the broken contaminated glass and throw it away.

Part 3: Horrific work conditions at the recycling plant
Finally at DELA, the 5th location, recycling begins – first the ESLs are unloaded from the mesh containers and thrown into a crusher by hand. The workers here are not even wearing any type of masks. “No problem”, says manager Kölzer, “The mercury vapours are simply removed by the overhead vacuum hood”. The crushed material is then separated according to size and type. The crushed and sorted material is then packed into so called Big Bags (you can see a cloud of dust blowing out from the bag when a worker moves it).
Recycling the ESLs consume lots of energy
The ESLs from Norderney are also crushed in Bad Oeynhausen and then delivered to DELA in big bags. There the crushed material is separated and goes through a complex process that requires a lot of energy. How much energy? No one can answer that question. EU bureaucrats say that the energy savings are worth it, even with the mercury problem. Environmental groups like Greenpeace are also active supporters of the ESLs. But Greenpeace in Hamburg refused an interview with NDR.
I also tried to get a comment from Greenpeace, but got nothing.
Nowhere is it possible to find a complete life cycle study on CO2 and energy that compares ESLs and standard lights. More important, what about the mercury in the environment? What about the health of the workers?

The NDR reporter also researched to see if the ESL lights really do last longer than the normal lights and use less energy. The results show that they do not.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Welt here reports that the EU plans to force consumers to save energy – 1.5% every year.According to plans by EU Commissar Günther Oettinger of Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party, energy suppliers in the future have to assure that their customers use less power and gas. Every year suppliers will have to reduce its market share by 1.5%
If that sounds economically retarded to you, you’re not alone.
I guess that means consumers must forget about expanding the family, or getting a bigger and more comfortable house, or buying an air conditioner. No – in Europe it’s downscale your lives – until you’re living in a cardboard box under a bridge. Die Welt writes:
Oettinger also expects public offices and buildings to join in. The draft law stipulates that beginning in January 2014, 3% of all buildings in all 27 member countries shall be made energy-efficient by renovation according to EU requirements.”
I wonder who is going to pay for all that. This sounds like one of the shovel-ready-jobs programs that worked so well under Obama. The proposed law will be introduced to the Parliament next month.
Of course, all the energy saving will be “voluntary” at first – at least during the years 2012 and 2013. But if the targets are not met, then in 2014 “the second bomb will be lit” and the Commission will enact “binding requirements”, Die Welt writes.
Not everybody is pleased about this state-controlled economy. For example, Herbert Reul, Chairman of the Industrial Committee in the EU-Parliament, says all this will lead to an “over-bureaucratization” and that the State “might as well just take over the entire energy sector and that what the EU proposes no longer has any semblance of a free market”.
For readers outside Germany, now you know how crazy on green Angela Merkel’s government truly is in pushing all this. The German CDU as it is today is a party that needs to go politically extinct – the sooner, the better. I can hardly differentiate it from the East German SED  in some areas.

Many of us have been watching the sunspots every day and wondering if the sun was entering into some kind of Dalton minimum.
Solar Cycle 24 was about three years overdue.
Well, it’s still not sure if a Dalton-sort of minimum will or will not occur, but the latest event suggests that the sun has woken from its long slumber for good. Solar Cycle 24 is alive! This is the latest news from NASA.
====================================================
April 14, 2011:
If you’ve ever stood in front of a hot stove, watching a pot of water and waiting impatiently for it to boil, you know what it feels like to be a solar physicist.

Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet.

NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory recorded this X1.5-class solar flare on March 9, 2011. [movie]

“Ever since, we’ve been waiting for solar activity to pick up,” says Richard Fisher, head of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC. “It’s been three long years.”
Quiet spells on the sun are nothing new. They come along every 11 years or so—it’s a natural part of the solar cycle. This particular solar minimum, however, was lasting longer than usual, prompting some researchers to wonder if it would ever end.
News flash: The pot is starting to boil. “Finally,” says Fisher, “we are beginning to see some action.”
As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of “X-class” solar flares–the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s logical. Bad science leads to bad policy, which leads to bad decisions, which in turn inevitably leads to costly results.
Destructive “solutions”
A perfect example is the science behind palm oil plantations for producing biofuel. Here the costs outweigh the benefits probably 1000 to 1. But can you even put a price tag on rain forest destruction? Then there are the high food prices driven in part by biofuel crops, causing political unrest in poor countries, which now threatens to explode globally. Italy’s first boatloads of economic refugees from Tunisia are making the point clear to stubborn, reality-disconnected politicians in Europe. Another example are mercury-laden energy saving lights. They’re expensive, do little to reduce CO2, and their disposal is now poisoning the planet.
Face it, the preliminary concepts drawn on napkins always look good. That was the case for renewable energy like wind and solar. But when these were put on the test-stand of reality, the renewable energy sources were exposed as unreliable, highly costly, and did nothing for the environment. Wind farms transformed once beautiful landscapes into industrial eyesores that pose a danger to migratory birds. Resistance is mounting.
Worse, all of it is for nothing.
The unsteady supply of renewables, British lives at risk
Today the unsteady supply of energy from renewables is leading to huge costs for consumers. A steady supply of electricity is now in jeopardy. Nothing better illustrates this than Britain’s wind farms last December. Veteran science journalist and hyrobiologist Edgar Gärtner ín a commentary cites the near collapse of the British grid during the bitter cold of December:
Precisely on the bitter cold days did most of the 3000+ British windmills remain idle. On one of the cold days, the 283 wind farms with a total of 3153 windmills supplied a total of just 0.4% of Britain’s energy demand. In order to prevent a blackout, older coal power plants and gas turbines had to be urgently fired up. Large industrial consumers had their power rationed.”
Right when the supply of energy was most needed, was it the most unreliable. If it had not been for the despised conventional energy sources stepping in during the emergency, thousands of British lives would have been put at risk. Britain’s target of producing 30% of its energy demand by using renewable sources looks doubtful. Gärtner writes:
To reach that target, the number of windmills would have to double. At the same times, coal, oil and gas fired power plants would always have to be on stand-by for windless periods. But, according to the wishes of the EU Commission, there aren’t supposed to be any more oil and coal power plants. In any case, the energy costs for private households will double by 2020. every household will have to pay on average a 2,890 euros a year in heating and lighting.”
Soaring energy costs in Germany

The situation in Germany looks even gloomier. With its currently installed wind energy capacity, Germany will have to put old moth-balled coal burning plants back into operation or build new ones to assure capacity for windless days. That means 200% capacity to assure 100% delivery – hardly economical. Consumers will have to pay through the nose, and certainly will be angered by it. Gärtner writes:
In 2009 German power consumers subsidised ‘renewables’ with 9 billion euros, according to Prof. Dr. Ing. Helmut Alt. This year the amount is estimated to be over 14 billion euros. Here social dynamite is being kept tinder dry.
Cheap and plentiful supplies at home
The worst part about it all is that it is unnecessary. German consumers will become especially agitated when they start learning that there are now very cheap and plentiful reserves of natural gas available – right at home. Gärtner writes:
After successful test boreholes by ExxonMobil, Wintershall and BEB in Germany and Poland, it is sure that there are natural gas reserves large enough to supply domestic demand for decades, and thus eliminate the need for natural gas imports from Russia. Worldwide, using a new extraction technique, useable natural gas reserves will be 10 times greater, says a Texas geologist. Obviously this revolution does not accommodate Angela Merkel’s ‘energy concept’ for the simple reason that it was not planned.”
Just at a time when consumers are being punished by high energy prices does a cheap and plentiful supply appear, making future pain completely unnecessary. Gärtner adds:
It can be anticipated that natural gas on the European markets in the coming decades will be so plentiful and cheap that it will become increasingly difficult to continue on the German unilateral, go-it-alone ‘renewables course. It will be increasingly difficult for political leaders to sell a supply of expensive and unreliable energies to a hurting public when there is a a far better alternative readily available, especially in view of the colder upcoming winters forecast by experts.”
Forcing people to freeze in the coming colder winters when there’s a cheap supply directly under their feet can be socially explosive.
Energy snoops and a planned climate economy
For this reason the Dutch European Energy Review already writes of signs of a coming “Energy Civil War” in Germany. This is why the EU and German politicians are getting nervous and pushing hard to invest 200 billion in revamping the energy grid so that it can work with solar and wind sources over international borders. But that won’t be enough to solve the technical problems. Consumers will have to be forced to use less – much less. That’s why the Handelsblatt reported on February 9 of the EU Commission’s plan to prepare a new ordinance that would send inspectors in factories and businesses:
These inspectors will force private industry to move faster so that the EU reaches its 20% reduction target for energy efficiency by the year 2020. This increases the fear that the centrally planned climate economy will make interference in private property rights necessary. Such intervention will certainly be met with massive resistance.”

Kind of like: “If we get more young people to believe it and sway public opinion in our favor, then the science will be settled. Let’s start a campaign against the skeptics, get right in their face, and call them names. Let’s be rap stars!”
What a brilliant strategy.
Unfortunately, this is how juvenile and removed from reality “climate science” has gotten. Just take a look at these idiots, thinking they’re cool:

What’s coming next? Mike Tyson climate science communication? Biting deniers’ ears off?
Got to be their latest 10:10 type-idea of “communicating the message better” to the public. These quack scientists are really in trouble. The only ones left they have a chance of convincing are kids.
We’ll gladly take this “own goal”, thank you. Are these quacks really so naive they think science gets settled by public opinion? Again Einstein, Planck, and a host of other science giants are certainly rolling in their graves.
In that video I was looking for Georg Hoffmann, the “climate scientist” who often behaves like a 6-year old, but didn’t see him. I suppose the video was even too juvenile for him.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a mix of various news stories in Germany.
1. E. Coli epidemic in Germany (and handling with gloves)
Journalist Michael Miersch reports on the double standard in reporting the organic food catastrophe in Germany. Since E. coli bacteria infected the supply of food and so creating Germany’s worst food outbreak and scare in decades, the media have been doing all sorts of fancy acrobatics to play down this glaring Utopian green dream failure.
Officials now claim the source of the E. coli bacteria is indeed a “plant” in North Germany. That “plant” of course is an organic vegetable farm.


 

The above graphic shows the number of E. coli illnesses (and deaths in parentheses) for each German state. Source: http://www.stepmap.de/karte/2011-06-09-ehec-hus-154483 (3 deaths outide of Germany).
Now that we have so many deaths and hundreds ill, we ask: is the German government moving to shut down all organic farms in Germany, to protect the public, in a move similar to the shut-down of nuclear power plants in the wake of Fukushima? The answer is “no”.

Indeed news reports this morning say that the organic “plant” where the bacteria originated will be allowed to remain open!…citing “excellent hygiene standards”. I’m not convinced. A few days ago the Gärtnerhof Bienenbüttel organic farm showed workers in the food processing plant handling raw vegetables with their bare hands. The “bare hands” photos have since been taken down and replaced with scenic outdoorsy nature photos, see here. Hiding something? Noooooo.
2. Energy boss warns of German industrial exodus
Jürgen Großmann, a vocal critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to end Germany’s reliance on nuclear energy by 2022, told the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung the country was jeopardizing its economic foundation.
“Politicians would do well to review their actions, and consequences for the price of electricity,” he told the paper. “Consumers will pay more and many companies will think twice about whether they are in good hands in Germany. Continue reading here…
3. Green politician wants highway robbery of transport
Consumers aren’t paying through the nose enough, and they need more restriction. So says green European Parliamentarian Michael Cramer here. Cramer advocates a hefty “climate traffic toll” all across Europe. He says:
The problem is that the costs caused by trucks are not being accounted for. If they really were taken into account, then the tolls would have to increase considerably. Studies have shown that noise from trucks cause costs of 20 cents per kilometer.”
and (paraphrased):
Member countries should be able to increase toll rates by up to 175% during peak traffic times. The problem is that the EU has a lid on toll revenue. According to the Parliament, the toll rates outside of rush hours should be lower so that the state does not take in more revenue. So now there is no real incentive for less driving, rather there’s an incentive to drive during other times of the day.”
For the greens, it’s all about getting restricting people and stealing your money.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHead for the hills folks! Sea levels are rising. But first read Ed Caryl’s latest essay on sea levels. It sure helps ignoring the climate catastrophe cultists for a few minutes and taking a sane look at the data.
———————————————————————————
A Level Look At Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
Figure 1: Sea level rise since the last glacial maximum 20,000 years ago. (Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Post-Glacial_Sea_Level.png 
One of the tenets of the AGW crowd is the idea that sea level rise is going to be catastrophic in the next 100 or 200 years, drowning our coasts and harbors, and in the case of low-lying countries, like The Netherlands, whole countries. These are not the facts.
Figure 1 shows the sea level rise over the last 20,000 years. In the last 8 thousand, the curve looks flat. It looks like there has been no rise since civilization began, and that the recent rise of about 20 cm (Figure 2) since 1900 is “unprecedented.” That is not true. The sea level has risen and fallen several times in the last few thousand years.
Figure 2: Recent sea level rise. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Recent_Sea_Level_Rise.png
In Figure 3, one can see that the sea level did not abruptly level off after the rather swift rise as the major continental glaciers melted, but slowly continued to rise, with one episode of falling between 3 and 4 thousand years ago.
Figure 3: Magnified view of sea level rise in the last 8,000 years. Chart source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Sea_Level.png 
A closer look at the last 2000 years is wanted. An article describing the sea level at Barrow Alaska was found. Here is the abstract in full:
Eustatic rises of sea level between A. D. 265 and 500 and between A. D. 1000 and 1100 caused the formation of raised beaches. After the first rise, sea level dropped about 2 meters below the present level, permitting Eskimo settlement of Birnirk about A. D. 500. The second rise of the ocean flooded Birnirk. At present, sea level is about 0.6 to 1.0 meter below the high water levels; the ocean partially floods Birnirk.”
The rises and falls at Barrow mirror the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Age Cool Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the last fall in sea level in the Little Ice Age, with a slow rise since then. (See From Hockey Sticks to Boomerangs for the temperatures during this period.) But we are still below the high water levels seen at Barrow. These events are somewhat visible in the data points of figure 3, but the author of that chart has chosen to use a straight line to depict the sea level for the last two thousand years, not showing the natural variation.
 The same rises and falls happened in the Fenlands of eastern UK. This description is from Wikipedia. The Roman period in the UK was from 43 CE to 410 CE, well into the Dark Age Cool Period.
The peak of the water levels in the fens was in the Iron Age; earlier Bronze and Neolithic settlements were covered by peat deposits, and have only been found recently.[11] During the Roman period, waters levels fell once again, and settlements were possible on the new silt soils deposited near the coast. Though water levels rose once again in the early medieval period, by this time artificial banks protected the coastal settlements and the inland from further deposits of marine silts, though peats continued to develop in the freshwater wetlands of the interior fens.[12]”
 Then there are the Roman fish pens. Described at this site, but the story is all over the internet as proof of AGW caused sea level rise. It proves no such thing.

‘The Romans dug these fish pens into bedrock, and the water line in these well-preserved structures shows that the sea level along the Italian coast 2000 years ago was 1.35 metres below today’s levels. “They were used for only a very short time, so they make rather nice markers,’ says Lambeck.”
He then analysed how land elevations changed along the Italian coast due to both plate tectonics and the after-effects of the last ice age. In a paper to appear in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, he concludes that geological processes affecting land levels over the past two millennia accounted for 1.22 metres of the change, which means that the global sea level rose by 13 centimetres.”
The only problem with this story is that the sea level changed several times in the intervening years, both up and down. The fish pens are just one marker in time. They were used only for a short time because after that they were either above sea level and dry, or below sea level and unusable. Is there a chart of sea level over the last 2000 years? There is this one at CISRO, but the error bars are very long and it shows nothing useful. We only begin to get good data from tide gauges in the last 300 years.
 A problem with measuring sea level is that isostatic rebound, post-glacial rebound, or glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), is still happening. It affects tide gauge readings all over Europe, especially in Scandinavia. One way to correct for this is to use GPS readings to find the actual earth movement and subtract that from the tide gauge measurements. When this is done, the real sea level rise in recent years begins to dwindle. This quote is from the abstract of Geocentric sea-level trend estimates from GPS analyses at relevant tide gauges world-wide.
Sea level change in the era of the recording tide gauge. Int. Geophys.Ser., 75, pp. 37–64.] rules, whose estimate is 1.84±0.35 mm/yr after correction for the GIA effect [Peltier, W.R., 2001. Global glacial isostatic adjustment and modern instrumental records of relative sea level history. Int. Geophys. Ser., 75, pp. 65–95.]. We obtain a value of 1.31±0.30 mm/yr, a value which appears to resolve the ‘sea level enigma’ [Munk,W., 2002. Twentieth century sea level: an enigma. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 99(10), pp. 6550–6555]. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
S. Jevrejeva et al (Figure 4) did another sea level reconstruction using several European tide gauges and correcting for GIA in 2008. This shows a steady rise of about 300±100 mm since 1800. This is about 1.5±0.5 mm/year. This is a steady rise since the end of the Little Ice Age, with no unusual rise after the increase in CO2. This natural rise began long before mankind began burning fossil fuel in earnest.

Is sea level rising? Yes, as it has been since the end of the little ice age 200 years ago. It will continue to rise. The remnant glaciers will continue to melt until the next cool cycle. But there is no catastrophe. At 1.31±0.30 mm/year, or 1.5±0.5 mm/year, if the trend is linear, it will be up 10 to 20 cm by 2110. The Dutch will need to put more blacktop in their dike roadways, which they normally do anyway, several times in the next 100 years. But if the current solar minimum continues for a few years we won’t need to worry about it. We will be in a cool cycle.
Anticipating questions, these are provided:
What about Bangladesh? The river silt has kept up with sea level rise so far, and will in the future, in fact, 250 years ago, much of Bangladesh was flooded all the time. To learn more look: here, here, here, and here.
What about the Pacific Islands, the Maldives, etc? Coral grows much faster than 2 mm/year, and has kept up with sea level rise so far, and it will in the future. Many of those islands are only there because of coral growth.
What about our harbors? Infrastructure is continuously wearing out, being torn down, and rebuilt. The docks of 1700 are no longer there. They have been replaced, 300 mm higher.

Frigid cold in the forecast for Europe
If the following chart is anywhere accurate, Europeans better get the heavy winter gear out and heat up the the Gluhwein. If this pans out, the Dutch will surely be ice skating in the canals like they used to do  in the good ol days of global cooling.

Right now snow shovels, snow tires, sleds, road salt and even hip joints are in short supply. So many accidents and slips are occurring, which is resulting in a spike in broken bones, that patients are no longer able to quickly get the replacement joints they need. The hospitals in Germany are running out.
That’s what happens when you depart from reality and start believing the fantasies of junk science. So many have been preparing for warming when in fact the opposite is happening.
