"WASHINGTON  —   Andrew F. Puzder, who as President Trump’s pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder’s views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a   chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings. “My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S.,” Mr. Puzder said in a statement. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. ” Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s chains. Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation. Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. “It’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration,” Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday. Mr. Puzder remains “all in” for the confirmation process, a spokesman said on Monday. He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers. Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Commerce Department, Wilbur Ross, said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years. And Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and the nominee for White House budget director, said that he failed to pay taxes on a nanny that he and his wife employed after their children were born. They had to pay more than $15, 000 in taxes and penalties to the I. R. S."

 _Global Science Report_ is a feature from the _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
We know this: Every holiday season some of our readers make some offhanded comment at a party, to the effect that, well, global warming (or its effects) appear to have been a bit overblown. Before you finish, you’re likely to be assaulted by a sharp ranch dressing-laden carrot stick or you might get a face full of dill-dipped broccoli.   
  
Fight back! Before things escalate to the level of food assaults, trot out some of the facts in this, our annual guide for holiday parties.   
  
First of all, the tendency for prominent findings about the impacts from human-caused global warming to be “worse than we thought” is not only a pure play for press coverage, but also strains, if not obliterates, scientific credibility.   
  
The unscientific preponderance of “worse than we thought” stories is starting to become more widely recognized (although we have been talking about it for years). And it is having consequences. Fresh from accepting his Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine, University of California’s Randy Schekman announced that his lab would no longer be sending any research papers to “luxury journals” like _Science_ and _Nature_ because of their preference to select papers “that will make waves because they explore sexy subjects.” Schekman explains that “These journals aggressively curate their brands, in ways more conducive to selling subscriptions than to stimulating the most important research.” Global warming alarmism is a prime example of this.   
  
In fact, there _are_ scientific studies that conclude that things aren’t likely to be worse than we thought, but looking to the “luxury journals” or to the press to highlight them is a fool’s errand.   
  
But that’s where we can help!   
  
In the spirit of this season of good cheer, and as a respite for the increasing number of those out there suffering from “apocalypse fatigue,” your obedient servants at the Center for the Study of Science are here to bring you a little holiday joy and good news.   
  
Below, we’ve collected some clips and quips culled from the recently published scientific literature (and observations) that show that perhaps the impacts from climate change resulting from our production of energy from fossil fuels isn’t going to worse than we thought—and, in fact, may not prove to be so bad at all.   




**Coral Reefs**   
  
Coral reefs are supposed to suffer badly under a process called “ocean acidification” in which the pH levels of the oceans drop as more carbon dioxide (a result of burning fossil fuels) is absorbed by ocean waters. The resulting pH drop is supposed to erode the shells of calcifying organisms such as those that build coral reefs. A recent study summed up the doom and gloom outlook:   




Coral communities may have limited capacity to adapt to levels of acidification projected for the 21st century, and that healthy coral reefs could cease to exist within this time frame. [citations omitted]



Yikes!   
  
But new research by Kathryn Shamberger and colleagues describes the existence of coral reefs in locations that, for a variety of reasons, have naturally occurring acidification levels on par with those projected to result from human carbon dioxide emissions. The authors write:   




Here, we report the existence of healthy, diverse coral reef communities living under levels of natural acidification approaching those projected for the tropical western Pacific open ocean by 2100. Understanding the combinations of genetic and/or environmental factors that enable coral reefs to thrive under relatively extreme conditions … will help to improve projections of reef health.



Apparently, in the real world, coral reef communities can well-adapt to the prevailing conditions.   
  
**Arctic Sea Ice**   
  
A new paper characterizes the situation with Arctic sea ice:   




The observed reduction in sea-ice extent has been significantly faster than projected by most numerical models using realistic anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. The mismatch between observations and models can arise from: model underestimation of the sensitivity of sea ice to radiatively forced climate change, incorrect or missing types of radiative forcing, and/or nonmodelled natural variability. [citations omitted]



The first two potential reasons why the observed Arctic sea ice decline (note that in the Antarctic, sea ice has increased contrary to model projections) has been faster than model projections imply things are “worse than we thought.” But this new research favors the latter explanation—that is, the decline from global warming has been boosted (temporarily) by natural variability acting in the same direction. From a paper by Martin Miles and colleagues:   




These results imply that the AMO [natural variability operating over the Atlantic Ocean basin] may be an important factor in the faster-than-projected decreases in sea ice, in qualitative agreement with a recent modelling–satellite-data analysis [ _Day et al._ , 2012] that attributes up to 5–30% to the satellite-era (1979–2010) summer sea-ice decrease to the concurrent AMO warm phase, and an even higher proportion for the winter sea ice.



In other words, the influence from human-caused global warming is not “worse than we thought.”   
  
**Great Lakes Water Levels**   
  
Another doom and gloom climate change projection is that the water levels in the Great Lakes will fall dramatically, interfering with (degrading) all sorts of environmental and economic activities. Last year’s Midwestern drought was a sign to some that things were even worse than we thought.   
  
A new paper by Carl Watras and colleagues sums up the situation:   




During the past decade, unusually low water levels have been observed in both the NHLD [Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin] and the upper Great Lakes. Following a peak in 1998, NHLD water levels have trended downward for roughly 12 years—reaching a record low elevation in 2010. Similarly, the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron recently dropped at a rate not seen since the 1930s mega-drought. Both Lake Superior and Lake Michigan-Huron have been consistently below average level for the longest sustained period in their historical records; and in January 2013 Lake Michigan-Huron reached an all-time low water level. [citations omitted]



Watras et al. go on to conclude that the low water levels of the past 12 years may “mark the onset of a new hydroclimatic regime.”   
  
But, in what is an incidence of unfortunate timing, just as the Watras paper was being published, Mother Nature has made her own announcement. After reaching historic (or nearly so) low lake levels during the beginning of 2013, over the course of this year, and as a result of ample precipitation, the water levels in the Great Lakes have risen rapidly. The _Detroit Free Press_ observes:   




A snowy winter and wet spring and summer led to an almost unprecedented recovery of Great Lakes levels this year, officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association said Wednesday.



The extended lake level forecasts keep the water levels near or just-below normal for the foreseeable future.   
  
Perhaps a new climate regime of low Great Lakes water levels is not upon us. In fact, the situation doesn’t look to be worse than we expected after all.   
  
**Gulf Stream**   
  
Global warming has been variously predicted to slow down, or even shut down, the Gulf Stream, wreaking havoc on the climate on both sides of the North Atlantic and leading to sea level rise along the U.S. East Coast that may even be worse than expected from warming oceans and melting ice.   
  
Last summer, an article in _USA Today_ stoked these fears with its coverage of a just-published article in the one of the “luxury journal” offshoots— _Nature Climate Change_ :   




From Cape Hatteras, N.C., to just north of Boston, sea levels are rising much faster than they are around the globe, putting one of the world's most costly coasts in danger of flooding, government researchers report.   
  
U.S. Geological Survey scientists call the 600-mile swath a ""hot spot"" for climbing sea levels caused by global warming. Along the region, the Atlantic Ocean is rising at an annual rate three times to four times faster than the global average since 1990, according to the study published Sunday in the journal _Nature Climate Change_.   
  
It's not just a faster rate, but at a faster pace, like a car on a highway ""jamming on the accelerator,"" said the study's lead author, Asbury Sallenger Jr., an oceanographer at the agency.



Now, a newly-published study says “nonsense” to this claim. Tom Rossby and colleagues looked at 20 years of direct measurements of Gulf Stream behavior and found no evidence at all that it is slowing down or effecting sea level rise along the East Coast. Rossby et al. took direct aim at the findings highlighted by _USA Today_ :   




Recently, two papers have suggested that the [Gulf Stream] may be weakening based on the well-documented accelerated Sea Level Rise (SLR) along the U.S. east coast (Sallenger et al., 2012; Ezer et al., 2013). …In contrast to these recent assertions of a weakening Gulf Stream our direct measurements of Gulf Stream currents for the past 20 years indicate no such trend...”



Not only is the situation not “worse than we thought,” but it is leaning toward being even “not as bad as we thought.”   
  
**North American Pika**   
  
And we’ll end with something warm and fuzzy—the North American pika. This little critter has long appeared on global-warming-is-going-to-kill-all-things-cute-and-cuddly posters, alongside polar bears, puffins, sea turtles, etc. The story goes that as the climate warms, the high-altitude, cold weather-loving pikas will be pushed off their mountain-top refuges and into extinction.   
  
New research, however, shows that the pikas aren’t quite so prone to climate change extermination after all. According to the authors of a soon-to-be-published paper in the _Journal of Mammalogy_ , by altering their foraging behavior and diet,   




""[Pikas] may be more resistant to climate change than we thought.""



Call us stunned—not!   
  
So there you have it, a stocking’s full of good news regarding climate change.   
  
All of this could come in handy during holiday cocktail parties and post-dinner conversations—FIGHT CARROT STICKS WITH FACTS!!!

From the:

…comes this press release that makes me wonder why the University of Virginia spent close to a half million dollars trying to keep Dr. Michael Mann’s emails out of an FOIA request and lawsuit by the State attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli and the American Tradition Institute. I think with this new revelation of apparently widespread funding duplication in science, and the active reticence to produce those emails demonstrated by UVA, the justification to see those emails has now increased.
“… over the past two decades funding agencies may have awarded millions and possibly billions of dollars to scientists who submitted the same grant request multiple times — and accepted duplicate funding.”
I’m sure that if there is no issue, UVA will work quickly to put the issue at rest. It may be nothing, and there may be no duplication of any kind, but it would benefit everyone involved to put all the UVA email issues to rest. As it says in the Nature article: “There is no implication that McIntire or any of the other researchers connected to the cases in this news story committed any wrongdoing.”. However, I don’t think that “academic freedom” ensures full autonomy with grant money. Grant recipients are still beholden to the issuing agency and the taxpayer. I’m sure if nothing else, this revelation will cause some additional investigations, and if there was any grant duplication at UVA, it can likely be determined independently as the authors have demonstrated, and confirmed with grant papers and emails.
Scientists may have received millions in duplicate funding
Virginia Tech scientists use text-mining software to find cases of duplicate funding
Big Data computation at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech reveals that over the past two decades funding agencies may have awarded millions and possibly billions of dollars to scientists who submitted the same grant request multiple times — and accepted duplicate funding.  
An analysis led by Harold R. Garner, a professor at Virginia Tech, not only indicates that millions in funding may have been granted and used inappropriately, it points to techniques to uncover existing instances of duplicate funding and ways to prevent it in the future. The analysis was presented in the comment section of this week’s Nature.
Submitting applications with identical or highly similar specific aims, goals, objectives, and hypotheses is allowed; however, accepting duplicate funding for the same project is not.
To estimate the extent of double-funding, Garner and his team, including programmer Lauren McIver, systematically compared 858,717 funded grant and contract summaries using text-similarity (text mining) software followed up by manual review.
These summaries were downloaded from public websites in the U.S. for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
Although the researchers could not definitively determine whether the similar grants were true duplicates — this would require access to the full grant files, which were not publicly available — they found strong evidence that tens of millions of dollars may have been spent on grants where at least a portion was already being funded. In the most recent five years (2007-2011), they identified 39 similar grant pairs involving more than $20 million.
“It is quite possible that our detection software missed many cases of duplication,” Garner said. “If text similarity software misses as many cases of funding duplications as it does plagiarism of scientific papers we’ve studied, then the extent of duplication could be much larger. It could be as much as 2.5 percent of total research funding, equivalent to $5.1 billion since 1985.”
Co-researcher and medical science ethicist Michael B. Waitzkin said, “In line with the Government Accountability Office report issued February 2012, these findings suggest the research community should undertake a more thorough investigation of the true extent of duplication and establish, clearer and more consistent guidance and coordination of grant and contract funding across agencies, both public and private.”
The researchers did not reveal specific principal investigators or research organizations identified as double-dippers, but said that no instances of double dipping were found at Virginia Tech.

"**A former magistrates' court is to reopen in a bid to deal with a ""record high"" backlog of 1,000 legal cases.**
Cirencester Court will be used for magistrates and crown court hearings, Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has said.
Martin Surl said: ""Waiting lists are already higher than they've ever been and according to worst-case scenarios, it could be at least 2022 before they catch up.""
Hearings will begin from January.
""Behind those 1,000 cases there are more than 1,000 victims, witnesses and defendants with a court appearance hanging over their heads,"" Mr Surl added.
The PCC, who is independent, offered to loan the building seven months ago.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice announced it would adopt the building as a so-called Nightingale court.
Mr Surl said: ""Be in no doubt, coronavirus has brought our only remaining courts to their knees.
""The magistrates' court in Cheltenham has been unable to function fully and without the first rung in the justice ladder, little can go to the crown court.""
Maintenance work is under way to bring the building back into use.
Cirencester Court adjoins the town's police station and used to operate as a magistrates' court and reserve crown court.
It closed in 2012 as part of national spending cuts and was acquired by the PCC to ""protect the integrity of the police estate"".

President Obama and his supporters have had a turbulent relationship with Supreme Court. It reached a low point when he said that striking down his massive health care overhaul — which he said “was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress” — would be an act of illicit “judicial activism.” Though the president later backtracked, his allies continue to lament the prospect that the Supreme Court will do its job — most recently in a _Chicago Tribune_ op‐​ed penned by House Minority Nancy Pelosi this week.



The episode harkens back to a nasty chapter in legal history: the clash between the Court and President Franklin Roosevelt during the 1930s. Fortunately, today’s Americans are unlikely to welcome a repeat of that confrontation, and President Obama would be wise not to try impugning the High Court, as Roosevelt did.



FDR’s fight with the Court began after the justices struck down some of the New Deal’s largest components. It is well to remember how absurd these programs were: in _Schechter Poultry v. United States_ , for example, the justices invalidated a law that barred grocery shoppers from choosing which chicken they wanted — buyers were forced to reach into a cage and pick a random chicken, the idea being to protect farmers from having to charge less for scrawnier birds. That law — like other programs forcing farmers to destroy food to raise prices — was meant to boost farmers’ income, but it meant less food for everyone, an awful idea in the depths of a Depression, and one that overstepped constitutional boundaries. The Constitution only allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce — not to control prices at neighborhood farmer’s markets.





Everyone disagrees with Supreme Court decisions from time to time.



The justices unanimously ruled that law invalid. But Roosevelt — who said the Constitution was “superseded entirely by what has happened and been learned” since its ratification — was furious. Accusing the justices of “activism,” he proposed a bill that would “save the Constitution from the Court” by allowing him to appoint six new justices, a new majority.



Republicans and Democrats alike denounced the “Court‐​Packing Plan” as an effort to exempt the president from checks and balances. Journalists called it “revolutionary,” and a “bloodless coup.” Polls showed 60 percent of people opposed the plan, wary that neutering the Court could endanger their rights under future administrations. Congress killed the proposal, but not before it became an albatross for the Administration, and one with lasting consequences. Historian Jeff Shesol argues that Roosevelt’s “hubristic” plan “wrenched” the Democratic party in two and “helped fracture the New Deal coalition.” President Obama has even less to gain by picking a fight with the Court, since polls now show that two‐​thirds of Americans, including most Democrats, hope the Court will strike the down the individual mandate.



But in 1937, in a very different political climate, the justices gave in. They began upholding New Deal laws, expanding Congressional power under the Commerce Clause and erasing long‐​standing constitutional protections. Those precedents later proved powerful obstacles against the next generation’s efforts to secure individual freedoms. Over the following decades, the Court slowly began to protect privacy rights, religious liberty, and racial equality — but only over the objections of Roosevelt appointees who argued that New Deal precedents allowed lawmakers to override those freedoms. For instance, in 1943, when the Court ruled that states could not force Jehovah’s Witnesses to pledge allegiance to the flag, Justice Felix Frankfurter — an FDR favorite — dissented, arguing that since the 1937 cases let government dictate how people use property and what prices businesses can charge, government should also be free to control people’s religious expression. Likewise, Justice Hugo Black refused to join the Court’s 1965 ruling that the Constitution protects personal privacy, because it relied on “cases from which this Court recoiled after the 1930s, and which had been, I thought, totally discredited.” Progressives would do well to remember how hard it was for civil rights activists in the 1960s to overcome the pro‐​government precedents established by the New Deal Court.



Everyone disagrees with Supreme Court decisions from time to time. But Americans understand that majorities are not always right, and that our Court plays a crucial role in the system of checks and balances that protects the rights of minorities and individuals who lack political influence. President Obama should recall how Roosevelt’s war on the Court backfired — not only on him, but on the cause of justice in general.

"**Losing the Isle of Man TT is ""a massive nail in the coffin"" for the island's tourism industry, businesses have said.**
On Monday, the Manx government announced the 2021 TT Festival would not go ahead due to the ongoing pandemic.
It is the second time that Covid-19 has halted the event which is worth nearly Â£40m a year to the island's economy.
Hotelier Michael George said cancelling the festival had ""blown a hole"" in hopes the tourism sector might recover.
This year's TT event was also scrapped at the start of the pandemic to protect ""critical care services"".
In 2019, more than 46,000 people travelled to the island for the TT, spending Â£37.5m over the two weeks, a government survey found.
Guesthouse owner Gillian Salmon said next year's TT had been a ""beacon of hope"" that had been ""quashed"" by the announcement.
Hosting the event, which was due to take place from 29 May to 12 June, would have been a ""signal to the world that we are open for business"", she added.
Mr George said the decision to cancel the 2021 event was ""devastating news"" which had ""blown a bit of a hole"" into hopes that the tourism sector could start returning to normal.
Pub landlord Rob McAleer said losing the TT was a ""disaster"" but ""if we go back into a lockdown then we would be harder hit than those two weeks"".
Three support schemes for tourism businesses have been extended by a month to 30 April.
Government-backed loans have also been made available to help firms cope with the financial burden of refunding deposits.
The Manx border has been closed to most non-residents since March."
"**England has exited lockdown but for nearly all the country, Wednesday marks just a small step back towards normality.**
With the exception of Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly, strict restrictions mean people's lives are being curtailed.
A crucial factor - ministers have argued - is that the NHS risks being overwhelmed without the tough curbs on freedoms. But is this really true?
A quick glance at the latest data on hospital beds shows there were nearly 13,000 beds free at the end of November.
That's 50% more than last winter.
There are also several thousand beds available in private hospitals that the NHS has paid for until the end of the year that could be used for non-Covid patients.
It means, in theory, there are enough beds available to cope with a doubling of Covid patients - there are currently about 14,000 in hospital.
In practice, the NHS is meant to keep at least a tenth of its beds free to create flexibility to admit patients and cope with surges in demand.
It also allows time for cleaning and infection control - something that is, of course, particularly important during a pandemic.
In fact, the need for social distancing and infection control has meant hospitals have had to be reconfigured significantly, leading to 13,000 beds being lost from the system.
What is more, the pressures are not felt evenly around the country.
The past few months have been marked by individual hospitals getting dangerously close to full, with some reporting more than a quarter of beds occupied by Covid patients.
But the flip side of that is that some are not. Explaining why he was voting against the new tiers, Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said his hospital had just four Covid patients.
These differences matter. Hospital capacity is one of the five key tests for working out which tier local areas are in.
While doing this, the NHS is playing a juggling act. In the spring, a lot of planned work, including some cancer care, was cancelled.
The decision was taken because of the fear that hospitals could be completely overwhelmed. But it meant significant numbers of beds were left unused as the data for June in the chart below shows.
But this chart also demonstrates how the NHS has tried to get services back to normal over the summer and autumn with the number of non-Covid patients in hospital (shown in green) climbing.
This is deemed essential because of the growing backlog in numbers waiting for treatment. Macmillan estimates there are more than 40,000 missing cancer patients.
Meanwhile, the numbers waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip operations, is at its highest level since 2008.
It is easy to think these sort of treatments can wait. But as Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen says, these are patients whose lives are on hold left waiting ""potentially in pain"".
The desire to keep the non-Covid work going is strong - and when you put this all together, it leaves very little wriggle room.
It means any significant increase in Covid patients above the level seen now has a direct impact on non-Covid care.
All this is being done while staff are exhausted with significant numbers - 30,000 at last count - off work for Covid-related issues.
England has a network of seven field hospitals known as Nightingales. These were built during the spring, again on the assumption that hospitals could become overwhelmed.
One of the challenges the NHS has faced is that it has fewer doctors, nurses and beds per head of population than many other western European countries.
Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal in calling for the Nightingales to be used, accusing those making dire warnings of trying to ""scare"" the public. Between them they could provide care to several thousand patients.
But the problem is they need staff. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, says they were only ever built as an ""insurance policy"" to be used as a last resort if hospitals were overwhelmed.
To open them would mean spreading staff more thinly across hospitals and the Nightingales. That, of course, has consequences for the quality of care. It is the reason why only two have been pressed into action during the second wave.
Stretching the NHS beyond the point it is at currently is certainly possible, but it will have consequences.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe preliminary numbers for August’s weather are coming in from some countries. For western Europe the picture is becoming clear: August was cold and wet, with strong notes of winter.
Germany: 1.5°C cooler than normal, snow
Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) reports that August in Germany, at a mean temperature of 16.0°C, was 0.5°C colder than the mean of the international 1961-1990 reference period. Compared to the 1981-2010 reference period, August 2014 was 1.5°C colder than normal. It was Germany’s coldest August in 8 years.  The summerlike temperatures at the start of the month faded as the month progressed and the weather turned autumn-like, especially the last third of the month. The result in total was a cooler, wetter and less sunny August.
The Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) collects and evaluates data from 2000 measurement stations scattered across the country. On August 24 it even snowed 4 cm on Germany’s highest peak Zugspitze (Read here).
Overall the data show that Germany’s annual mean temperatures have been dropping over the last 17 years (a period, some scientists say, that is necessary before one can speak of a climate trend):

Germany’s mean annual temperature plot over the last 17 years. Source: EIKE
As Germany cools, one has to ask how much longer the DWD intends to keep misleading the public with its logo at its website, which depicts an accelerating warming. When asked about the reality-remote logo, the DWD said they would consider the matter when it revamps its website in the future. They didn’t seem too concerned about possibly misleading the public (also read here).
Also Germany’s long-term summertime precipitation trends show absolute normalcy, see Grafik 4 at EIKE.
Austria: “1.1 °C colder than climatological mean”

Austria’s national ZAMG weather service also is reporting a cold and dark August: 19% less sunshine, the 14th least sunny August since sunshine measurements started in 1884. In Austria it also was much cooler than normal, posting an anomaly of -1.1°C.
Like Germany, Austria also saw its coldest August since 2006. Austria also had forecasts of snow already in mid August.
UK: “…one of the chilliest in decades”!
Not only Central Europe saw a cold August, but so did the United Kingdom. Once again the once-predicted global warming-caused barbecue summers remain elusive.
The UK Met Office here announced that the UK’s mean August temperature came in at 13.8°C , or 1.1°C below the long-term average. That would make it the coolest August since 1993. Also the UK’s Daily Mail writes of an August charcterised by forecaasts of snow that included warnings of the “coldest August spell in a century“.
The Weather Channel (TWC) earlier this month was calling August in Great Britain and Europe “one of the chilliest in decades“.
Also even last winter’s snow refused to melt. The online SCOTSMAN writes (my emphasis):
RECORD numbers of snow patches have remained on Scottish mountains this year despite warm summer temperatures and the impact of global warming, a new survey has revealed.
The annual study, carried out every August by a team of volunteers and published by the Royal Meteorological Society, showed nearly 300 remnants of last winter’s snowfall have failed to melt.
This is the highest number since a Scottish national snow survey began seven years ago, and a dramatic increase on the 24 to 81 patches recorded in previous seasons.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new study by researchers in England claim that people who eat lots of meat emit much more CO2 than vegans. Worse: the nutty scientists are urging governments to change dietary guidelines.
At the journal of Climatic Change, Peter Scarborough et al claim that “reducing the intake of meat and other animal based products can make a valuable contribution to climate change mitigation.”
Moreover they urge: “National governments that are considering an update of dietary recommendations in order to define a ‘healthy, sustainable diet’ must incorporate the recommendation to lower the consumption of animal-based products.”
The team of scientists computed the average daily CO2 emissions for 6 different diet groups. Here are their results:
1. high meat eaters: 7.19 kg/day
2. Medium meat-eaters: 5.63 kg/day
3. low meat-eaters: 4.67 kg/day
4. fish-eaters: 3.91 kg/day
5. vegetarians: 3.81 kg/day
6. vegans: 2.89 kg/day
The paper’s abstract follows:

The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods. The objective of this study was to estimate the difference in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK. Subjects were participants in the EPIC-Oxford cohort study. The diets of 2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, 8,123 fish-eaters and 29,589 meat-eaters aged 20–79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Comparable GHG emissions parameters were developed for the underlying food codes using a dataset of GHG emissions for 94 food commodities in the UK, with a weighting for the global warming potential of each component gas. The average GHG emissions associated with a standard 2,000 kcal diet were estimated for all subjects. ANOVA was used to estimate average dietary GHG emissions by diet group adjusted for sex and age. The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were 7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters ( > = 100 g/d), 5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99 g/d), 4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters ( < 50 g/d), 3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for, 3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians and 2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans.
In conclusion, dietary GHG emissions in self-selected meat-eaters are approximately twice as high as those in vegans. It is likely that reductions in meat consumption would lead to reductions in dietary GHG emissions.”

The science road to disaster
It’s rather frightening that scientists are now attempting to urge governments to promote extremely dubious if not dangerous diets onto the population, all based on the junk science of global warming. Should scientists narrowly focused on one topic be in the business of advising governments on matters concerning nutrition.
The low-fat/high carb diet massively promoted by western governments and corrupt food and pharmaceutical industries over the course of the 21st century, and based on junk science, has already led to a nutrition genocide where tens of millions of people are now dying slow/painful deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancer, record obesity and diabetes. Now a worsening of the human diet is being pushed.
Governments are gearing up to take an already catastrophic nutritional situation and to turn it into global mass murder by mal-nutrition and starvation. It’s mass human sacrifice, all being justified by the superstition and nonsense of a man-made climate catastrophe – in the year 2100 or 2200.
Skeptical climate scientists who have remained silent so far better start speaking up very soon. This movement has been taken over by some real nut-cases, and threatens to really get out of hand.

The Obama administration filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization on Monday alleging that the Chinese government is bestowing various prohibited subsidies upon Chinese automobile and auto parts producers to the tune of $1 billion and that Beijing is, accordingly, in violation of its commitments under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.   
  
There are reasons to shake one’s head at this move, including the apparent hypocrisy it reveals of an administration that spins the $85 billion of subsidies it heaped upon two U.S. car companies and the United Autoworkers union as its chief economic accomplishment. Of course that figure doesn’t even include the $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM under the bankruptcy terms; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM's former financial arm GMAC (which received taxpayer support to facilitate GM auto sales); GM's portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt, and more. (Full story here.)   
  
To complain about $1 billion of Chinese subsidies is – shall we say – a bit rich.   




Moreover, the filing of the WTO case reveals some of the unseemly perquisites of incumbency. A large concentration of the beneficiaries of the GM bailout resides in Ohio, a state that has had the administration’s strategic attention since its reelection campaign began in November 2008. But in case that largesse wasn’t enough to secure their support in November 2012, a large concentration of the beneficiaries of a successful U.S. WTO complaint also resides in Ohio, which is where – by Jove – the president was speaking when word of the WTO complaint became public.   
  
It is all exasperating, no doubt.   
  
But the bigger and more disconcerting story in all of this is the apparent ascendancy of economic nationalism within the GOP. Romney’s persistence in trying to brand himself the ""most protectionist"" or ""biggest China basher"" in the presidential race sort of forced Obama to bring the WTO case -- or at least expedited the timetable. Have you seen the Romney ads? Have you read the shrill RNC taunts that cite the widely-discredited, union-funded Economic Policy Institute’s figures on job losses caused by trade with China? Strange bedfellows, indeed!   
  
It was once the case – not too long ago – that Republican candidates argued in support of trade and the freedom of Americans to partake of the opportunities afforded by the global economy. But things, apparently, have changed. The nationalistic strains within the Republican Party have strengthened since 2009. I explained why this was happening in this 2010 Cato paper, which is excerpted below: 



Frictions in the U.S.-China relationship are nothing new, but they have intensified in recent months. Tensions that were managed adeptly in the past are multiplying, and the tenor of official dialogue and public discourse has become more strident. Lately, the media have spilled lots of ink over the proposition that China has thrived at U.S. expense for too long, and that China’s growing assertiveness signals an urgent need for aggressive U.S. policy changes. Once-respected demarcations between geopolitical and economic aspects of the relationship have been blurred. In fact, economic frictions are now more likely to be cast in the context of our geopolitical differences, which often serves to overstate the challenges and obscure the solutions.   
  
A sign of the times is a recent commentary by _Washington Post_ columnist Robert J. Samuelson, in which he declares: ""China’s worldview threatens America’s geopolitical and economic interests."" That statement would seem to support a course of action very different from the course implied by the same columnist 18 months earlier, when he wrote, ""Globalization means interdependence; major nations ignore that at their peril."" That change of heart appears to be contagious.   
  
Understandably, there is angst among the U.S. public, who hear frequently that China will soon surpass the United States in one economic superlative after another. Some worry that China’s rise will impair America’s capacity to fulfill or pursue its traditional geopolitical objectives. And those concerns are magnified by a media that cannot resist tempting the impulses of U.S. nationalism. Woven into stories about China’s frantic pace of development are reminders that the Chinese have not forgotten their two-century slumber—a period of humiliation and exploitation by foreign powers.   
  
A recent _National Journal_ cover story describing areas of bilateral policy contention—which the article laments as ""frustrating"" the fact that U.S. experts see ""few alternatives to continued engagement"" —features three menacing photographs of Chinese military formations, one picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il flanked by members of the Chinese military, and one photo of the Chinese foreign minister shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   
  
Subtly, and sometimes not, the media and politicians are brandishing the image of an adversarial China. In Chinese reluctance to oblige U.S. policy wishes, we are told that China selfishly follows a ""China-First"" policy. In the increasing willingness of Chinese officials to criticize U.S. policies, we are told of a new ""triumphalism"" in China. In the reportedly shabby treatment of President Obama by his Chinese hosts on his recent trip to Beijing, we are told that the ""Chinese have an innate sense of superiority."" But indignation among media and politicians over China’s aversion to saying ""How high?"" when the U.S. government says ""Jump!"" is not a persuasive argument for a more provocative posture.   
  
China is a sovereign nation. Its government, like the U.S. government, pursues policies that it believes to be in its own interests (although those policies—with respect to both governments—are not always in the best interests of their people). Realists understand that objectives of the U.S. and Chinese governments will not always be the same, thus U.S. and Chinese policies will not always be congruous. Accentuating and cultivating the areas of agreement, while resolving or minimizing the differences, is the essence of diplomacy and statecraft. These tactics must continue to underpin a U.S. policy of engagement with China.



In this campaign, the RNC seems to be fighting to position itself to the protectionist side of Obama, daring the president to take action – a dare the president has accepted, inflating his political credit in places like Ohio. In response to Governor Romney’s assertion that the president had been soft on China and that he, Romney, would label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, Obama created the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, which resonated politically with the target audience. While the challenger blathers about the president’s alleged fecklessness in dealing with China, the president responds by bringing new WTO cases against Beijing. The most recent complaint, relative to the strident tack Mitt Romney is advocating, is the more responsible, more pro-market course of action. If Romney is to be believed, his trade actions would have far worse consequences for the economy.   
  
Instead of focusing on the real sources of economic stagnation in the United States – including the uncertain business climate inspired by the bailouts, the proliferation of costly and superfluous new environmental, health, and financial regulations, a tax code that is in constant flux, frivolous torts, an education monopoly that fails to produce enough talent backstopped by an immigration system that chases it away – Mitt Romney has chosen to blame America’s woes on China. THAT is the message the Republican presidential candidate, with the full backing of the RNC, brings to the voters in Ohio, whose fortunes are increasingly tied to America’s engagement in the global economy. As of July, Ohio’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, more than one full percentage point lower than the U.S. rate of 8.3%. Ohio’s economy is growing on account of trade – particularly with China, the state’s third largest market and destination of $2.7 billion worth of Ohio’s output in 2011. Just look at this bar chart that depicts the importance of China to Ohio, and conversely, the costs of a real bilateral trade war.   
  
Governor Romney should ditch his trade warrior schtick pronto, and start explaining to the electorate how pro-trade policies – including the freedom of corporations to invest abroad (to offshore a la Bain Capital)– help enlarge the economic pie. Puffing out the chest to appear the biggest protectionist in the race is bad economics and bad politics.

Steven Joyce may not be popular, but no one can deny his economic ability. Those who disliked him in the past obviously had no idea how inept and incompetent the next government was going to be. Steven Joyce belongs to an era, only recently ended, where we expected skill and ability from our politicians. How I miss those days.



Steven Joyce was Finance Minister for a short time, but he knows what makes our economy successful, and if he were still in that position, we would not be going backwards, as we are now.



It was [confirmed this week ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/115813023/economy-loses-some-steam-as-gdp-growth-slips-to-05pc)that New Zealand is now running at little more than half speed.  
From growing at rates of 3½ to 4 per cent three years ago our economy at the end of June was only 2.1 per cent larger than it was the previous June.  
That’s a problem firstly because our population is growing at about 1.6 per cent a year, so if our economy grows at 2 per cent then the amount of additional wellbeing per person (to coin a phrase) is three fifths of not very much. 



Never underestimate the effect of a growing population. It is conveniently forgotten in most current discussions about our economy.



The second problem is that our terms of trade (the prices of our exports versus our imports) are still very strong so [we should still be cranking along](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115915004/new-zealands-slowing-gdp-economic-vandalism-or-business-as-usual). It’s a problem if we are slowing down when the world really wants to buy what we are selling. What happens if the world actually falls out of bed? 



The world situation is volatile, but not very bad as yet. This may change, but if it does, it will simply mean that our economy is affected more than it needs to be. We could still be growing at 4% if this government had half a clue.



But they don’t.



The government has been quick to blame the world economy for our lower growth rate this week, but our terms of trade put the lie to that.



The third problem is that there is no sign of anything on the horizon that will lead to much of an upturn, and in fact all the signs are that we are going to slow further. Our businesses are in a funk because of what is known as regulatory overhang. In short, they are too fearful to invest because the government is making lots of rule changes that could mean they don’t get much of a return for the risk they take.



Uncertainty changes everything. The fact that our exports are still holding up is a good thing, but if government policy was more business-friendly, we could be rocking along as we did during the GFC when most countries were struggling. What exactly was it that made the difference back then?



We had a competent government with a business-friendly attitude. 



The fourth problem is that lower growth means less to go around. If we were still growing as fast as we were then in real terms our economy would be around $5 billion bigger this year than it is. That means more money for higher pay and more jobs, and of course about 30 per cent of it goes into the government coffers – which would pay for a lot more cancer drugs, teachers or electric vehicle subsidies. 



Oh dear. What can I say?



Its time to rein in some of his [the Minister of Finance] ministerial colleagues who are wreaking havoc with business confidence.



For example he should suggest the Minister of Immigration sort out his portfolio so that [horticulturists can find seasonal workers ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/115922923/growers-warn-of-jobs-losses-unless-immigration-decision-comes-soon)and the international education sector can get up off its knees. He should tell the Minister for the Environment to come up with a more reasonable plan for [water quality improvements](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/113949705/do-new-zealands-climate-change-plans-live-up-to-the-hype) and methane emissions reductions so farmers step back from the cliff edge, and the Minister of Education to stop stuffing about with the apprenticeship system.



He should encourage the Reserve Bank Governor to be less heroic on [bank capital requirements](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/111226761/economist-bank-capital-changes-would-add-thousands-to-borrowers-bills?rm=m), persuade his colleagues to do a backtrack on gas exploration now it is proven the ban is simply value destroying and does nothing for climate change, overrule the Greens to permit some gold mining, and stop taxing tourists more so the tourism sector starts growing again. He should cancel the return to industry-wide pay bargaining given that NZ First are never going to vote for it anyway, tell the Transport Minister to get on with building at least some of the stalled roading projects, particularly given that light rail is years away, and reverse at least one of the petrol tax increases.  
Then he could watch the economy recover and start thinking about how he’s going to allocate the increased government revenues. And New Zealand will be in much better shape if the world economy does get worse. 



Some may disagree, but I feel that Adrian Orr’s policy of dropping interest rates to zero per cent (yes, he will) while forcing a more conservative policy on capital held by banks cancel each other out. Banks are under more pressure to hang on to your money, while interest rates are so low that they are ineffective. None of this is working in any positive way.



Unfortunately none of that is likely to happen this year, which means as a country we will be poorer and there will be less rather than more to go around. The Government has outsourced economic policy to the Reserve Bank Governor so interest rates will keep dropping, which brings its own risks, and the government will simply cross its fingers and hope the world keeps growing.



 **It’s a massive missed opportunity. Our country should be doing so much better.**



We could be doing so much better if we had a competent government. But we don’t.



I miss Steven Joyce. And John Key and Bill English. Yes, some may have disliked them as politicians, but they knew what they were doing. Can you say that of the current government?



No. You can’t. And we will all suffer as a result of their ineptitude.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the claims of lots of signs and evidence of man-made global warming, no one has yet to find it.

Stefan Rahmstorf, German alarmist scientist and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research claims that it was briefly sighted by GISS last month. Yet upon closer inspection no global warming has been seen since way back in the 1990s.
Warming has also been completely absent from Germany as well. Die kalte Sonne site here presents the latest May data for Germany.

Mean May temperatures for Germany for the last 17 years, from the original data of the DWD German Weather Service. Chart shows a sharply declining trend. Chart by: Josef Kowatsch
But May is only one month. Better would be to look at the annual mean temperatures, and over a longer time period. The next chart shows the mean annual temperatures for Germany since 1990. No change!

Okay, I agree. Let’s stop playing around and look at the whole global temperature, and do so over a really meaningful time period. The next chart shows global mean temperatures for the last 3200 years.

 Chart source: EIKE.
Note the 1000-year natural periodicity and that there is no sign of man-made warming today. The overall trend is cooling, and that ought to be disturbing. The warming remains missing.
UPDATE: A reader has sent me the following UKMO chart. No warming seen in Central Europe!

"DENVER  —   The Army approved the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Tuesday, paving the way for an infrastructure project that has been surrounded by protest and controversy. Robert Speer, the acting secretary of the Army, announced the decision to Congress, saying he was ready to offer the pipeline’s owner a   easement on a disputed patch of land. The move drew outrage from opponents, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation in North Dakota sits less than a mile from the proposed pipeline route. And it drew cheers from supporters, who said the planning process for the completion of the $3. 7 billion project had already lasted too long. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, Dave Archambault II, responded to the decision by vowing to fight it in court. “As native peoples, we have been knocked down again,” he said in statement. “But we will get back up, we will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. ” The pipeline is set to run under the Missouri River near the reservation. It is opposed by many members of the tribe. Construction of the route has become a global rallying point for environmental and tribal activism, drawing thousands of people to a sprawling protest camp and sometimes prompting clashes with authorities. They had objected to the pipeline’s path running so close to the source of the tribe’s drinking water, noting that any spill could poison water supplies for it and others downstream. Members of the tribe also said the pipeline would cross through sacred ancestral lands. The move comes two weeks after President Trump ordered an expedited  review of the pipeline, part of his administration’s goal of supporting fossil fuel development and lowering barriers for major infrastructure initiatives. The project would carry 470, 000 barrels of oil a day. In the decision, Mr. Speer said he would halt the preparation of an environmental impact statement meant to assess the effects of the pipeline, adding that he had sufficient information to support approval. The move will allow for the completion of the last mile and a half of the   project, connecting oil production areas in North Dakota to a crude oil terminal near Patoka, Ill. The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. The decision prompted immediate outcry from people within the protest camp, which now numbers about 400 people, according to Manape LaMere, 38, a leader living by the route since October. “All of our hearts are broken,” said Linda Black Elk, part of the protest’s healer council, in an emotional video live from the camp. “I’m just going to ask you guys to keep us all in your prayers. Pray for the water. Pray for the people. Pray for the water protectors. Pray for the tribe. ” The decision left some feeling whiplashed. Two months ago, under the Obama administration and in the face of global protests, the Army said that it would explore alternative routes for the pipeline. In a statement on Tuesday, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a Republican, applauded the Army’s decision. “This is a key step toward the completion of this important infrastructure project, which has faced months of politically driven delays and will allow for safe transport of North Dakota product to market. ”"

Vancouver was once the mecca for foreign money, which resulted in skyrocketing home prices, a bit like Auckland was until the foreign buyer ban. However, the worm has turned and now real estate developers are panicking as homes go unsold. Sounds like Kiwibuild, except the developers here had Phil and, now, Megan standing by with chequebook in hand to buy the unsold properties.



So here is a novel way for Megan to move the properties on and keep Genter happy at the same time.



“For every home you purchase we’re going to include a free Tesla,” said Celia Chiu, sales manager for Viridian Homes. 



Developer Century Group is offering a Model 3 Tesla base model with each of the remaining 10 homes in its [Viridian](https://viridianhomes.ca/) development overlooking the Nicomekl River.



The Teslas being offered are valued at CA$55,000. The promotion will be available starting Saturday, and it will continue until Oct. 31 or until the final 10 units in the development are sold. 



Chiu said the remaining homes have been on the market for the last year, but the entire community has “been around for two years and with a market having kind of a subtle stall, we wanted to take it to the next level.”



The townhouse project contains 57 total units, each one featuring more than 2,000 square feet of living space and a pricetag starting at just over CA$1 million. […]



“An incentive like this does have to have a wow factor,” Chiu added.



Each of the remaining units comes equipped with an electric vehicle charging station, something Century Group president Sean Hodgins said in a release reflects the project’s “innovative design with energy-efficient capabilities.”[…]



Go on, Megan – we taxpayers would be overjoyed to fund this as well as the Kiwifail houses.

Dictators have been falling in the Middle East, but that doesn’t mean freedom is inevitably expanding. Unfortunately, the Arab Spring has turned into something far different than hoped. Especially for religious minorities.



The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has released its latest report with grim news. According to USCIRF: “Across the global landscape, the pivotal human right of religious freedom was under escalating attack. To an alarming extent, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief was being curtailed, often threatening the safety and survival of innocent persons, including members of religious minorities.”



Religious liberty matters even to people who are not religious. Everyone has a transcendent worldview. Protecting the right to believe also means protecting the right not to believe.



Moreover, religious liberty is an important indicator of political freedom and other human rights. A society and state which refuse to respect the most fundamental right of conscience in religion are unlikely to respect it elsewhere. Religious liberty is the proverbial canary in the mine. If people are oppressed because of their religious faith, they are likely to be victimized for holding other unpopular beliefs.



The problem is not just direct state oppression. Some governments aid and abet persecution by not protecting religious minorities. Noted the Commission: “The failure to prevent or punish violence against vulnerable religious minorities provided a grim portrait of how states can create or fuel a culture of impunity, encouraging private citizens or groups to threaten, intimidate, and even murder others.”



Religious persecution is widespread, but it is not in America, where the First Amendment guarantees Americans a degree of religious liberty that is almost unique in the world. Cultural hostility to religion exists, but is not the same as religious persecution.



The Commission focused on 25 particularly egregious countries. It advocated that the State Department rate 16 of them as “Countries of Particular Concern” because they are responsible for “particularly severe” violations of religious liberty. USCIRF put another nine nations on its “Watch List” because of “negative trends that could develop into severe violations.”



Alas, the CPCs included many supposed American allies and friends.



 **Burma**. The military junta relinquished power to a nominally civilian government, which is liberalizing the political process. Nevertheless, the legacy of past abuses lives on. Reported the Commission: “Religious groups, particularly ethnic minority Christians and Muslims and Buddhist monks suspected of engaging in anti‐​government activity, faced intrusive monitoring, arrest, mistreatment, destruction or desecration of property, severe restrictions on worship, education, and religious activities, and targeted violence.”



However, if present trends continue, Burma may fall off of the list of its own accord. For instance, the government has reached a ceasefire with the rebellious Karen National Union, which represents the predominantly Christian Karen. Moreover, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has gone from house arrest to parliament. Much more remains to be done, but for the first time in decades the prognosis appears positive.



 **China**. The People’s Republic of China is far freer than it was during the maniacal and murderous reign of Mao Zedong. However, noted USCIRF: “The Chinese government continues to violate severely its international obligations to protect the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief. Religious groups and individuals considered to threaten national security or social harmony, or whose practices are deemed superstitious, cult‐​like, or beyond the vague legal definition of ‘normal religious activities’ face severe restrictions, harassment, detention, imprisonment, and other abuses.”



Proselytizing Christians and the orthodox, non-“Patriotic” Catholic Church, face significant repression. However, added the Commission, “religious freedom conditions for Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims remain particularly acute.” It isn’t just religious believers who face persecution. Said USCIRF: “The Chinese government also continues to harass, detain, intimidate, disbar, and forcibly disappear attorneys who defend vulnerable religious groups.”



 **Egypt**. The problems with the so‐​called Arab Spring are on dramatic display. The overthrow of dictator Hosni Mubarak has made a bad situation worse.



Noted the Commission: “Over the past year, the Egyptian transitional government continued to engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief. Serious problems of discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims, remain widespread in Egypt.”



Unfortunately, Islamists are likely to dominate Egypt’s future. And no one scrambling for power seems very interested in protecting unpopular minorities. Concluded USCIRF: “In 2011, violent sectarian attacks, targeting primarily Coptic Orthodox Christians, have resulted in nearly 100 deaths, surpassing the death toll of the previous 10 years combined. During the transitional period, the lack of adequate security in the streets has contributed to lawlessness in parts of the country, particularly in Upper Egypt.”



 **Eritrea**. This relatively young country emerged from years of conflict with Ethiopia with independence, not liberty. The Commission wrote: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea. These violations include: torture or other ill‐​treatment of thousands of religious prisoners; arbitrary arrests and detentions without charges of members of unregistered religious groups; a prolonged ban on public religious activities; revocation of citizenship rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses; interference in the internal affairs of registered religious groups; and inordinate delays in responding to registration applications from religious groups.”



No one is safe from the brutal attentions of the authoritarian government, but minority sects are particularly vulnerable. Noted USCIRF: “The situation is particularly dire for Jehovah’s Witnesses and members of other small and non‐​traditional religious groups, such as Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians.”



 **Iran**. It should surprise no one that Iran is inhospitable to religious liberty. Said the Commission: “The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.”



All religious minorities are at risk, “most notably Baha’is, as well as Christians and Sufi Muslims,” upon whom “physical attacks, harassment, detention, arrests, and imprisonment intensified. Even the recognized non‐​Muslim religious minorities protected under Iran’s constitution—Jews, Armenian and Assyrian Christians, and Zoroastrians—faced increasing discrimination, arrests, and imprisonment.” So, too, dissenting Muslims “were intimidated, harassed, and detained.”



With the regime under increasing domestic pressure after the disputed 2009 election, “religious freedom conditions in Iran have regressed to a point not seen since the early days of the Islamic revolution.” Unfortunately, the situation is likely to worsen as foreign pressure directed at Tehran’s alleged nuclear program increases.



 **Iraq**. The U.S. invasion of Iraq was supposed to “drain the swamp” of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship. However, the situation has deteriorated dramatically for religious minorities. Reported the Commission: “The Iraqi government continues to tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations. In the past year, religious sites and worshippers were targeted in violent attacks, often with impunity, and businesses viewed as ‘un‐​Islamic’ were vandalized.”



The worst recent attacks were against Shi’as. However, religious minorities have suffered the most since the U.S. invasion. According to USCIRF: “Large percentages of the country’s smallest religious minorities—which include Chaldo‐​Assyrian and other Christians, Sabean Mandaeans, and Yazidis—have fled the country in recent years, threatening these ancient communities’ very existence in Iraq.”



 **Nigeria**. Violations of religious liberty are on the increase in this religiously‐​divided country. Noted the USCIRF: “The past year saw a dramatic rise in sectarian or religiously‐​related violence.”



Although these attacks, largely directed by radical Muslims against Christians, are not new—some 14,000 have died since 1999—they have escalated, explained the Commission, with the rise of “Boko Haram, a militant group that espouses an extreme and violence interpretation of Islam, [which] has been emboldened by the climate of impunity. Boko Haram has shifted its tactics and emphasis by targeting, killing, and bombing Christians and Christian clergy and threatening to kill all remaining Christians in the north.”



 **North Korea**. There may be no more oppressive state than the so‐​called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Getting reliable information about the DPRK is difficult, but, reported USCIRF: “There continues to be reports of severe religious abuses occurring during the past year, including: discrimination and harassment of both authorized and unauthorized religious activity; the arrest, torture, and possible execution of those conducting clandestine religious activity; and the mistreatment and imprisonment of asylum‐​seekers repatriated from China, particularly those suspected of engaging in religious activities.” There is no sign of liberalization after the death of long‐​time “Dear Leader” Kim Jong‐​il in December.



 **Pakistan**. Although nominally democratic, Pakistan is not liberal in any sense, especially when it comes to religion. Reported the Commission: “The government of Pakistan continues to both engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief. Pakistan’s repressive blasphemy laws and other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism. Sectarian and religiously‐​motivated violence is chronic, and the government has failed to protect members of the majority faith and religious minorities.”



In Pakistan the lack of religious liberty signals significant threats to other freedoms. For instance, liberal Muslims are threatened by the same extremist forces. Noted USCIRF: “Growing religious extremism threatens the freedoms of religion and expression, as well as other human rights, for everyone in Pakistan.” Unfortunately, the country is growing less rather than more stable and dangerous.



 **Saudi Arabia**. Another thuggish U.S. “friend” is Riyadh, which uses its abundant oil revenues to promote Islamic radicalism around the world. Reported the Commission: “systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continued in Saudi Arabia despite improvements.” A decade after 9/11 “the Saudi government has failed to implement a number of promised reforms related to promoting freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief.”



Moreover, Riyadh bans any non‐​Muslim worship. Even private religious activities are suppressed if they are discovered. Religion combined with politics is especially toxic for the Saudi royals. Explained USCIRF: “There have been numerous arrests and detentions of Shi’a Muslim dissidents, partly as a result of increasing protests and demonstrations related to 2011 uprisings in the region.”



 **Sudan**. Millions of people have died in recent decades in Sudan. Between 1983 and 2005, the Commission “identified Sudan as the world’s most violent abuser of the right to freedom of religion or belief.” The brutal civil war, thankfully, has ended. However, conflict between Muslim‐​majority Sudan and the newly created nation of South Sudan, dominated by Christians and animists, looks increasingly possible.



Beyond war, reported USCIRF: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue in Sudan. Violations include: the criminalization, subject to the death penalty, of apostasy; the efforts by the government in Khartoum to impose its restrictive interpretation of Shari’ah (Islamic law) on Muslims and non‐​Muslims; attacks and threats against the Christian community,” as well as “the denial of public religious expression and persuasion of Muslims by non‐​Muslims, while allowing proselytizing of non‐​Muslims by Muslims; and the difficulty in obtaining permission to build churches.”



 **Tajikistan**. The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have turned into human rights black holes. Observed the Commission: “The religious freedom situation in Tajikistan further deteriorated during the reporting period as it has over the past several years, leading to systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief. The state suppresses and punishes all religious activity independent of state control, and imprisons individuals on unproven criminal allegations linked to religious activity or affiliation.”



Government policies “target minority communities viewed as foreign‐​influenced, particularly Protestants and Jehovah’s Witnesses.” However, the country is an equal opportunity oppressor. Even majority Muslims are victimized by the government.



 **Turkey**. USCIRF’s most surprising (and divided) designation went to NATO ally Turkey. Explained the Commission: “The Turkish government, in the name of secularism, has long imposed burdensome regulations and denied full legal status to religious groups, violating the religious freedom rights of all religious communities. These restrictions, including policies that deny non‐​Muslim communities the rights to train clergy, offer religious education, and own and maintain places of worship, have lead to their decline, and in some cases, their virtual disappearance.”



Even Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Turkey’s population, have suffered for years under heavy‐​handed secularist policies. As for other faiths, USCIRF pointed to “the Turkish government’s intervention into minority religious communities’ religious affairs; societal discrimination and occasional violence against religious minorities; limitations on religious dress; and anti‐​Semitism in Turkish society and media.”



 **Turkmenistan**. This Central Asian state long was a North Korean wannabe—a repressive, isolated totalitarian system with suffocating personality cult. The death of one dictator only led to the elevation of another one. Reported the Commission: “Severe religious freedom violations and official harassment of religious adherents persist in Turkmenistan.” Despite some minor political reforms in recent years, “the country’s laws, policies, and practices continue to violate international human rights norms, including those on freedom of religion or belief. Police raids and other harassment of registered and unregistered religious groups continue.”



 **Uzbekistan**. No better is neighboring Uzbekistan. The government, observed USCIRF: “has systematically and egregiously violated freedom of religion or belief. The Uzbek government violates the full range of human rights and harshly penalizes individuals for independent religious activity regardless of their religious affiliation.” The objective is to maintain political control, resulting in restrictions on Muslims, who make up a majority of the population. Explained the Commission, “The government continues to arrest Muslims and repress individuals, groups, and mosques that do not conform to officially‐​prescribed practices or that it claims are associated with extremist political programs.”



 **Vietnam**. This nominally communist country remains hostile to religious liberty. Concluded USCIRF: “The government of Vietnam continues to control all religious communities, restrict and penalize independent religious practice severely, and repress individuals and groups viewed as challenging its authority.” Despite some improvements in recent years, “individuals continue to be imprisoned or detained for reasons related to their religious activity or religious freedom activity.”



In fact, Vietnam appears to be regressing. The Commission warned that “in the past reporting period, there were marked increases in arrests, detentions, and harassment of groups and individuals viewed as hostile to the Communist Party, including violence aimed at peaceful ethnic minority gatherings and Catholics protesting land confiscations and harassment.” Hanoi may be friendlier toward Washington, but it remains ruthlessly hostile to religious belief.



Religious persecution is serious but less pervasive in another nine countries, which made USCIRF’s Watch List.



 **Afghanistan**. Liberated from the extremist Taliban by allied forces, Afghanistan nevertheless remains inhospitable to religious liberty. Reported the Commission: “Conditions for religious freedom are exceedingly poor for dissenting members of the majority faith and for minority religious communities.” The constitution “contains a repugnancy clause stating that no law can be contrary to the tenets of Islam, which the government has interpreted to limit fundamental freedoms. Individuals who dissent from the prevailing orthodoxy regarding Islamic beliefs and practices are subject to legal action.” Like Saudi Arabia, there is not even one Christian church operating openly.



 **Belarus**. This former Soviet republic still operates much like the old Soviet Union. Explained USCIRF: “The government of Belarus, through intrusive laws and policies, continues to violate the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief throughout the country. Religious communities and individuals found to have violated these restrictive laws have been harassed, raided, fined, and detained. Vandalism of religious properties has occurred with impunity.”



 **Cuba**. This poor island nation has not abandoned the formal pretense of communism, but appears to be informally giving up the practice. Unfortunately, though, the Commission found that “Serious religious freedom violations continue in Cuba despite some improvements. Violations by the Cuban government include: detention, sporadic arrests, and harassment of clergy and religious leaders, as well as interference in church affairs. The Cuban government also controls and monitors religious belief and practices through surveillance and legal restrictions.”



 **India**. The world’s largest democracy does not itself persecute, but has proved unable or unwilling to stop religious repression at the provincial level as well as communal violence. Noted USCIRF: “intimidation, harassment, and occasional small‐​scale violence against members of religious minority groups continued, particularly against Christians in states with anti‐​conversion laws. While there has been no large‐​scale communal violence against religious minorities since 2008… the deleterious pace of the judicial responses and the adopted anti‐​conversion laws enable impunity.”



 **Indonesia**. The most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia has moved steadily along the democratic path. However, reported the Commission, “the country’s tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism has been strained. While the government has addressed past sectarian violence and curtailed terrorist networks, religious minorities continue to experience intimidation, discrimination, and societal violence… and national laws and provincial decrees have restricted religious freedom.”



 **Laos**. Another communist relic, noted USCIRF, “the Lao government restricts religious practice through its legal code and has not curtailed religious freedom abuses in some rural areas. Provincial officials continue to violate the freedom of religion or belief of ethnic minority Protestants through detentions, surveillance, harassment, property confiscations, forced relocations, and forced renunciations of faith.” Thankfully, the status of religious liberty has improved in urban areas.



 **Russia**. The former communist motherland tragically is regressing. The Commission explained: “The government increasingly used its anti‐​extremism law against peaceful religious groups and individuals, particularly Jehovah’s Witnesses and Muslim readers of the works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi. National and local officials also apply other laws to harass Muslims and groups they view as non‐​traditional or alien. These actions, along with rising xenophobia and intolerance, including anti‐​Semitism, are linked to violent or lethal hate crimes.”



 **Somalia**. This failed state lacks any effective government. USCIRF wrote that “Egregious religious freedom violations by the U.S.-designated terrorist group al‐​Shabaab continue in Somalia, including: the violent implementation of its extremist interpretation of Islamic law and use of hudood punishments; execution of those it deems ‘enemies of Islam;’ and killing of Christian converts.”



 **Venezuela**. President Hugo Chavez may be dying, but his system of repression remains brutally healthy. Reported the Commission, violations of religious liberty include: “the government’s failure to investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of attacks on religious leaders and houses of worship, and virulent rhetoric from president Hugo Chavez, government officials, state media, and pro‐​Chavez media directed at the Venezuelan Jewish and Christian communities.”



Even these states do not end the parade of evil. Assaults on religious liberty occur elsewhere. USCIRF pointed to serious abuses in Bahrain, Bangladesh, and Kazakhstan. Violations are even evident in Europe, most notably Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where Muslim women have been barred from voluntarily wearing the hijab.



Despite its best efforts, America cannot make the world free. But at least Americans can work to make the world freer. They should support religious liberty as they go out into the world.

From The Hockey Schtick
A paper published Tuesday in the Journal of Climate finds tiny variations in solar activity over 11-year solar cycles have greatly amplified effects upon climate via changes in the Arctic Oscillation, North Pacific sea surface temperatures & sea level pressure, and via changes in stratospheric ozone from solar UV. The authors find the Arctic Oscillation evolves from a negative mode a few years before solar maximums to a positive mode at and following solar maximums. The IPCC claims the tiny variations in solar activity during solar cycles cannot affect climate, but this paper and many others demonstrate solar activity has greatly amplified effects upon climate via ocean oscillations, atmospheric oscillations such as the Madden-Julian oscillation and Quasi-biennial oscillation, stratospheric ozone, and sunshine hours/clouds.
Here is the paper:

The Surface Climate Response to 11-Yr Solar Forcing During Northern Winter: Observational Analyses and Comparisons With GCM Simulations
Abstract
The surface climate response to 11-yr solar forcing during northern winter is first re-estimated by applying a multiple linear regression (MLR) statistical model to Hadley Centre sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) data over the 1880-2009 period. In addition to a significant positive SLP response in the North Pacific found in previous studies, a positive SST response is obtained across the midlatitude North Pacific. Negative but insignificant SLP responses are obtained in the Arctic. The derived SLP response at zero lag therefore resembles a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Evaluation of the SLP and SST responses as a function of phase lag indicates that the response evolves from a negative AO-like mode a few years before solar maximum to a positive AO-like mode at and following solar maximum. For comparison, a similar MLR analysis is applied to model SLP and SST data from a series of simulations using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. The simulations differed only in the assumed solar cycle variation of stratospheric ozone. It is found that the simulation that assumed an ozone variation estimated from satellite data produces solar SLP and SST responses that are most consistent with the observational results, especially during a selected centennial period. In particular, a positive SLP response anomaly is obtained in the northeastern Pacific and a corresponding positive SST response anomaly extends across the midlatitude North Pacific. The model response versus phase lag also evolves from a mainly negative AO-like response before solar maximum to a mainly positive AO response at and following solar maximum.

Thinking about our relationship with the UN, who comes to mind? Her mentor would be proud of her pupil, and possibly even wrote Ardern’s National Statement for her, delivered at the UN General Assembly to a sparse, disinterested and partially comatose audience.



Predictably, Ardern spoke of “kindness” and “climate change” but nestled in there were a couple of never-before-mentioned nuggets. Thank goodness some people back home were paying attention!



Judith Collins was most unimpressed, her hackles rose and she tweeted **“Borderless!!! What in the world is this PM doing? Open borders??”**



Indeed, what was Ardern thinking? Well, first and foremost we must remember that Ardern is a UN sycophant, more than happy to sit back and let them tell her how best to run the country – including opening our borders.



But Winston Peters was also paying attention, but more likely he was privy to the speech before it was delivered, because three days ago (Ardern delivered her speech two days ago), he preempts the question, furiously backpedalling on his pre-election promise to “cut immigration by up to 60,000 people a year.”



“Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters says the Government is striving to address the quality of immigration, saying ‘it’s not whether it’s too high **it’s whether you are getting the right people** ‘ that matters most.”



  
A divided CoL aside, Ardern, crucially, **gives us our first insight into her patsy role at the UN** for Aunty Helen which is much **more about driving change than about representing us**. She begins with Security Council reform.



“[…] ultimately it is up to us – the Member States – **to drive change at the UN. This includes reforming the Security Council**. 



If we want the Council to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international peace and security, its practices need to be updated so it is not **hamstrung by the use of the veto**.” 



  
The power of veto is available only to the **five permanent members** of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States) and can only be used to prevent the adoption of any “substantive” resolution. It is arguably the most important distinction between permanent and non-permanent members and also the most controversial aspect of UN operations. 



“Permanent members use the veto to defend their national interests, to uphold a tenet of their foreign policy or, in some cases, to promote a single issue of particular importance to a state. 



Since 16 February 1946—when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) cast the first veto on a draft resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon and Syria (S/PV.23)—the veto has been recorded 290 times.



 **In the early years, the USSR cast most of the vetoes** , with a considerable number of these used to block the admission of a new member state. Over the years, 



the **USSR/Russia has cast a total of 141 vetoes, or close to half of all vetoes**. **The US cast the first of its 83 vetoes to date on 17 March 1970** (S/9696 and Corr. 1 and 2).



  
Playing out in the UN is the struggle between the two most powerful nations – the USSR/Russia and the USA. The temptation for large nations to become catalysts for the decimation of much tinier nations in the Middle East and Africa because of their valuable national resources and strategic import can be too great to resist, and the UN has been largely impotent in stopping them. 



Until the USA began exercising its veto right at the UN the USSR/Russia had dominated the Security Council but they are now arguably neck and neck, meaning removing the right to veto will equally dis-empower both. **But behind this move is another.** For the past year, the UN has been discussing reforming the Security Council, whether to add to the five permanent members or abolish the permanent member’s veto power, or both, because African nations feel neglected and are clamouring for better representation. 



“Sierra Leone’s representative, speaking on behalf of the African Group, spotlighted that most issues discussed in the 15?member organ are related to his continent. Its 54 nations must be involved in decisions concerning not only international peace and security, but its own very continent. **Africa demands no less than two permanent seats, including the veto power, if it remains, and five non?permanent seats.** Widespread support from Member States for this position means that it is time to **“redress the historical injustice of not being represented in the permanent category”.**



  
It seems highly likely Ardern is preparing the ground for satisfying African demands by the UN granting them permanent member status, but not the power of veto which it will deprive them of by removing it entirely.



It appears Ardern has waded into the dispute at someone else’s behest and whether she represents our values or not, she represents us. 



“I’m struck as a leader attending my first United Nations General Assembly by the power and potential that resides here. But in New Zealand, **we have always been acutely aware of that**.”



  
Ardern’s claim of NZ awareness is not true. Given the UN’s ineffective history **most New Zealanders would not recognise either its power or its insidious destructive potential,** but Arden’s patsy role in driving change within the UN has become clear.

"LONDON  —   In November 1967, four years after her husband’s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy traveled to the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia on a   trip with David Ormsby Gore, a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower. There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down. In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead. “If ever I can find some healing and some comfort  —   it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,” she wrote. “I can find that now  —   if the world will let us. ” The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked   cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore, who died in 1985. They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house. The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore, also known as Lord Harlech, dated Nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In it, Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967. “We have known so much  shared  lost so much together  —   Even if it isn’t the way you wish now  —   I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. ” Writing from Mr. Onassis’ yacht in Greece, on stationery with the ship’s crest, a clear if cold message, Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore: “You are like my beloved beloved brother  —   and mentor  —   and the only original spirit I know  —   as you were to Jack. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis, and she tried to respond. “Please know  —   you of all people must know it  —   that we can never really see into the heart of another,” she wrote. “You know me. And you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that I could marry. ” Mr. Onassis, she wrote, is “lonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. And he is wise and kind. Only I can decide if he can, and I decided. “I know it comes as a surprise to so many people,” she continued. “But they see things for me that I never wanted for myself. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was an old friend of John F. Kennedy, whose younger sister Kathleen, or Kick, married Mr. Ormsby Gore’s first cousin. After the election of the young president in 1960, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sent Mr. Ormsby Gore to Washington as Britain’s ambassador. The two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and President Kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of Vietnam and nuclear disarmament. Robert Kennedy said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “almost a part of the government,” adding that the president “would rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. ” Among the letters is one in which President Kennedy praised the ambassador: “I appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment  —   which I have found to be uniformly good and true. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore inherited the noble title, Lord Harlech, when his father died in 1964. His grandson Jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at Bonhams, London, in an auction scheduled for March 29. Some of the letters will be on view on March 2 in New York at the Bonhams showroom, at 580 Madison Avenue. In total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from Mrs. Kennedy to Mr. Ormsby Gore, as well as other papers. Those include a pass admitting him to the White House on Nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from Robert Kennedy, signed “Bobby” and instructions for pallbearers for Robert Kennedy’s funeral. The papers also include a letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Mr. Ormsby Gore after the death of his wife, Sylvia, known as Sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. “Your last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness  —   I would do anything to take that anguish from you,” she wrote. “You want to patch the wounds  match the loose pairs  —   but you can’t because your life won’t turn out that way. ” One of the most moving documents is a draft letter Mr. Ormsby Gore wrote to Mrs. Kennedy after she turned down his proposal. “All the pathetic plans I had brought with me for visits to Cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer  —   plans which I saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the Cape and in Cambodia for the next wonderful ten days  —   all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in New York,” he wrote. “As for your photograph I weep when I look at it. Why do such agonizing things have to happen? Where was the need for it?” The Kennedys and the Ormsby Gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. There were small dinners at the White House and shared vacations. One   “incoherent letter as written on Martini” from Mrs. Kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the America’s Cup races. Others mention her love of dance. Matthew Haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said that “you just don’t get this quantity of insight into Jackie’s personal life and that level of intimacy. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was her husband’s great friend, but “the fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,” he said, even if built on shared sadness. Contacted about the letters on Friday, a representative of the Kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of President and Mrs. Kennedy, said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “the pivotal relationship Jack had in the presidency,” a man he trusted almost as much as Robert Kennedy. “Jackie loved in Jack the man he wanted to be, and David was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man Jack wanted to be,” she said. The distress that followed Robert Kennedy’s assassination in June 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of Mr. Onassis, Ms. Leaming said. “It was the second great trauma for her,” Ms. Leaming said. “She was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to Joe Alsop in a letter. She was seeking safety. ” As for Mr. Ormsby Gore, “of course he fell in love with her  —   she understood him so well,” Ms. Leaming said. “But I have no idea if it was consummated or not. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore did marry again, in December 1969, to Pamela Colin, an American who bore more than a passing resemblance to Mrs. Onassis. He died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. Mrs. Onassis attended his funeral."
"**Tesco has announced that it is repaying the Â£585m worth of business rates relief that it received as support during the coronavirus pandemic.**
The supermarket giant said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time.
The move comes after Tesco was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders.
Tesco said its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full.
""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said.
Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March.
At that time, there was ""a real and immediate risk to the ability of supermarkets to feed the nation"", Tesco said.
""We are immensely grateful for the financial and policy support provided to us by the governments of the UK. This was a game-changer and allowed us to ensure customers got access to the essentials they needed,"" it added.
In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy.
In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help.
The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms.
Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy.
""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium.
""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this Government relief.""
While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout.
When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant.
Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs.
The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not.
And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals.
Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers.
""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received.
""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us.""
Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders."""

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



PNAS has struck again. That’s the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,_ which, according to bibliographic metrics, is the second‐​most influential science journal published in the U.S. _Science_ , from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, is in first place. 



As I have discussed previously (http://​www​.forbes​.com/​s​i​t​e​s​/​p​a​t​r​i​c​k​m​i​c​h​a​e​l​s​/​2​0​1​1​/​0​6​/​1​6​/​p​e​e​r​-​r​e​v​i​e​w​-and-…) the procedures for publishing in PNAS are not those typically associated with rigorous peer‐​review, and much more resemble “pal review”. As a result, sometimes some rather strange papers appear.



A textbook example is this paper by Antonella Zanobetti, Marie O’Neill, Carina Gronlund, and Joel Schwartz.



Zanobetti, from Harvard, and her colleagues attempt to answer the question as to whether or not summer temperature _variability_ —not temperature itself—is associated with an increase in mortality in elderly people with chronic disease.



While the accepted wisdom is that heat waves can lead to elevated mortality (for those unprepared), what is not so widely known, but nonetheless obvious to those who think in economic terms, is that the more frequent high temperature extremes are, the lower the overall rate of heat‐​related mortality becomes. Pure and simple, people adapt.



(The EPA, in its zeal to regulate carbon dioxide, has it completely wrong on this association, claiming that increased heat wave frequency and magnitude constitute endangerment to the public health and welfare, when, in actuality, the data clearly show that more heat leads to a lower heat‐​related morality rate.)



This is obvious from Figure 1, which is taken from some heat‐​related mortality research that I was involved in (Davis et al., 2003). The heat‐​related mortality rate in each of 28 cities across the country for three different decades (1970s, 1980s, 1990s) is represented in Figure 1 by a set of three bars plotted at each city’s location on the map. The higher the bars, the greater the heat‐​related mortality.



Note that the cities along the southern tier of the U.S.—the ones with the hottest summers—have much lower rates of heat‐​related mortality than do the cooler cities in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. Where people are used to very high temperatures, they are adept at dealing with them. In the Midwest and the Northeast, where heat waves are rare, more people die.



Note also that the height of the bars in virtually every city is declining with time. In other words, more people died from heat waves in the 1970s than did so in the 1990s—in spite of generally rising summer time temperatures during that period (the mortality trend is indicated by the “+” or “-“ sign below each set of bars). In fact, in many cities across the southern and central portion of the country, there is no bar at all during the 1990s, indicating that heat‐​related mortality was statistically undetectable during that decade. Taken as a whole, the heat‐​related mortality in major U.S. cities declined by 75% across the last decades of the 20th century, despite rising summer temperatures. Clearly, we are adapting well to increased frequency and intensity of heat waves.



The one exception, which proves the adaptational rule, is Seattle—which has the coolest average summers and shows an increase in mortality.









_Figure 1. Annual heat‐​related mortality rates (excess deaths per standard million population on days in which the decadal‐​varying threshold apparent temperature (AT) is equaled or exceeded) by city and decade, and long‐​term trend in summer afternoon AT. Each histogram bar indicates a different decade: from left to right, 1960s‐​1970s, 1980–1989, and 1990–1998. Decades without histogram bars exhibit no threshold ATs and no heat‐​related mortality. Decades with gray bars have mortality rates that are statistically significantly different from the decades indicated by black bars. The average excess deaths across all 28 cities is shown at the lower left. AT trends are indicated beneath each city abbreviation (Davis et al., 2003)._



But there were some interesting questions raised concerning the interpretation of our results—in particular, about the role of temperature variability in shaping our findings. We noted (Davis et al., 2003):



“One current hypothesis is that individuals are stressed during the summer by significant temperature changes, particularly minimum temperatures. High minimum temperature variability has been linked to higher mortality rates in northeastern and northern interior cities.… This observation could partially account for the spatial pattern of decadal mortality declines across the United States, because mortality rates in the 1990s remain elevated in the Northeast and West Coast, where summer temperature variability typically is higher because of air mass changes associated with more frequent frontal passages.



So the idea that temperature variability may give rise to some of the patterns of heat‐​related mortality in the U.S. (also noted in the new Zanobetti paper) is not a new one.



In our work, we did a cursory examination as to whether changes in summer temperature variability over our study period may have influenced our results. But we found that in only three of the 28 cities we examined, was there a statistically significant trend in temperature variability (an increasing trend in two cities and a decreasing trend in another) over our study period (the early 1960s to the late 1990s). Thus we concluded that changes in temperature variability were largely absent in our data and therefore “played little role in the observed mortality declines.”



Zanobetti and colleagues report otherwise.



They used a fairly complicated methodology to determine that there is an association between high intraseason temperature variability and the survivorship of a cohort of elderly, previously ill persons. Greater day‐​to‐​day temperature variability during the summer led to more mortality in their subset of the elderly population.



However, Zanobetti et al. found that the association was only statistically significant in the portions of the country with the lowest average summer season day‐​to‐​day temperature variability (typically the southern portions of the country—their zones 4 and 5 in Figure 2).









_Figure 2. Climate zones (in colors) used by Zanobetti et al. and the level of day‐​to‐​day variability in summer temperatures in each city studied (the degree of shading in each circle). Open circles indicate lower degrees of temperature variability than darkly shaded circles (from Zanobetti et al., 2012)._



Table 1 is a breakdown of their results for the different climate zones when the temperature variability for a particular summer is 1°C above normal. “HR is the “hazard ratio”, including the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the HR value. If the 95% CI includes the value of 1.0, then there is no statistically significant difference from the average mortality. The climate zones are numbered 1 to 5 with climate zone 1 typically characterized by more summer day‐​to‐​day temperature variability than climate zone 5 (see figure 2). The different elderly population cohorts with pre‐​existing medical conditions are listed as CHF (congestive heart failure), MI (myocardial infarction), diabetes, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).









The take‐​home message from these results is that only in climate zones 4 and 5 (the zones with the _least_ amount of average daily summertime temperature variability) is there a statistically significant reduction in survivorship when the variability is 1°C above average. This suggests that people in cities that typically experience a high degree of day‐​to‐​day temperature variability during the summer are better adapted to extremes in temperature variability than those people living in cities where day‐​to‐​day temperature variability is low. Just as is the case with heat waves, more exposure leads to less susceptibility.



Pretty straightforward. Here is how Zanobetti et al. sum things up:



“Our data suggest that long‐​term increases in temperature variability may increase the risk of mortality in different subgroups of susceptible older populations.”



Huh? 



“Taken together, our present findings and previous evidence suggest that summer temperature variability could plausibly impair the health and shorten the life expectancy of older adults, particularly those with chronic medical conditions… A 1 °C increase in temperature [variability] is a plausible increase in some regions. Based on our findings, this increase in temperature [variability] would increase all‐​cause mortality in our MI cohort by 5%, for example. Based on an average of 270,000 deaths per year across all four cohorts, a 5% increase in mortality would correspond to ~14,000 additional deaths per year due to an increase in temperature variability in the United States.”



Come again?



“In addition to an increase in temperature, climate models predict an increase in summer temperature variability in mid‐​latitude Northern Hemisphere land areas, which may be a major public health concern.”



That is just the opposite to what a more enlightened view of their results suggest.



Zanobetti et al.’s data pretty clearly show that cities with a climate characterized by high summer temperature variability have _lower_ rates of mortality in the cohorts they studied. This should lead directly to the conclusion that if climate change were to result in increasing summer temperature variability, then there should be a reduction in the mortality rate as the population becomes better adapted to higher temperature variability.



Instead, the authors conclude the opposite, the paper appears in the pal‐​reviewed PNAS, and headlines are made—global warming to kill more people.



Such is the state of climate “science” these days.

"**The rules for licensed venues have been turned on their head by the first minister following his announcement on Monday of**sweeping restrictions **to the hospitality trade. Let's take a closer look.**
From Friday at 18:00, licensed pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to stop serving alcohol on their premises. Those with an off-licence can sell alcoholic drinks to be taken away.
They will have to close at 18:00 every day until further notice. They can operate a takeaway service for food and drink after 18:00.
The regulations will be reviewed on 17 December.
In a word, yes. Some people have questioned whether this is fair on pubs, but as stated above, pubs which have the correct licence can provide ""off-sales"", ie alcohol to take away.
According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the majority of pubs tend to have an off-licence as part of their trading conditions anyway. But under the Business and Planning Act 2020, all premises have now been given temporary extensions to their licences allowing off-sales until September 2021.
It's important to be clear that alcohol sales are not banned in pubs - you just can't drink it there. This is not Prohibition Mark II.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said they had considered bringing in a 18:00 cut-off time for alcohol sales in shops but had decided people would just stock up before that time, so it would have been ""an action without a consequence"".
We're a land of wine (and beer), (bar-)women and song apparently, with 2,190 pubs in Wales, according to House of Commons figures from May.
This means Wales has the second-highest number of pubs per population in the UK, at 70 per 100,000. Only the south west of England has more.
The accommodation and food sector in Wales employs 106,400 people according to the latest statistics. It accounts for 3.2% of all industries and is worth Â£2.1bn to the Welsh economy.
Of those jobs 27,400 are in Wales' 1,200 cafes and 1,500 restaurants, according to UK Hospitality.
Beyond that, the food and drink supply chain employs 229,500 people in Wales, including in catering, retail and wholesale, agriculture and fisheries, and manufacturing and packaging.
The news is already having a big impact. Wales' largest brewer, Brains, is closing 100 of its managed pubs on Friday and putting 1,500 staff on furlough. Not much Christmas cheer or singing there.
It's bad news for a sector which was already in trouble prior to Covid striking. Despite that high per capita figure for pubs, Wales had the biggest proportionate decline in pubs in the UK, with 1% closing even as pub numbers were increasing across the UK as a whole.
Good question. It's not entirely certain who has the answer to that.
In the briefing, Mr Drakeford said the evidence ""was there"" that the virus was spreading in hospitality venues, and that with cases rising, without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
However, when asked for this evidence, the Welsh Government initially pointed back to a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) report from September which said there was ""moderate impact"" from taking action on pubs.
This is what the advice said: ""Potential reduction in Rt [reproduction number] of 0.1-0.2, though precise estimation very difficult. Environmental risk in bars, pubs etc is likely to be higher than many other indoor settings due to close proximity of people, long duration of exposure, no wearing of face coverings by customers, loud talking that can generate more aerosols.
""Some venues are poorly ventilated, especially in winter. Consumption of alcohol impacts on behaviour.""
But - and it is quite a big but - this was talking about the impact if you close pubs entirely. Not the impact of stopping serving alcohol, although that is referenced, and crucially, not closing them early.
In fact the advice goes on to say: ""Curfews likely to have a marginal impact. Low confidence [in the outcome].""
So is it ho, ho, hogwash?
When asked for more specifics, the Welsh Government then referred to another Sage report which it said had concluded that measures being taken in Scotland's level three and England's tier three coronavirus restrictions were effective.
England's measures once again involve closing hospitality venues entirely, which is like comparing apples with pears.
However, Scotland's - finally - do apply the same measures as Wales will be taking, namely venues closing at 18:00, and no alcohol being served.
However, these restrictions were only brought in on 2 November, and it is worth bearing in mind that many of the areas now in Level 3 or 4 had previously been under restrictions which had seen pubs closed entirely.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We know that as the consumption of alcohol increases, social distancing and the perception of risk decreases.
""Wherever people mix, there's a risk of coronavirus being passed on."""

 **I. Introduction**



My name is Robert J. Michaels. I am Professor of Economics at California State University, Fullerton and an independent consultant. I hold an A.B. Degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles, both in economics. My past employment as an economist includes the Institute for Defense Analysis and affiliations with consulting firms. I am also Senior Fellow at the Institute for Energy Research and Adjunct Scholar at the Cato Institute. I attach a biography to this testimony. The findings and opinions I am presenting today are entirely mine, and they are not the official views of any of my professional or consulting affiliations.



For over 20 years I have performed research on regulation and the emergence of markets in the electricity and gas industries. My findings have been presented in peer‐​reviewed journals, law reviews, and industry publications and meetings. I am Co‐​Editor of the peer‐​reviewed journal _Contemporary Economic Policy_ , an official publication of Western Economic Association International with a circulation of 2,800. I am also author of _Transactions and Strategies: Economics for Management_ (Cengage Learning, 2010), an applied text for MBA students and advanced undergraduates. My consulting clients have included state utility regulators, electric utilities, independent power producers and marketers, natural gas producers, large energy consumers, environmental organizations, public interest groups and governments. My services have at times entailed expert testimony, which I have presented at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, public utility commissions in California, Illinois, Mississippi and Vermont, the California Energy Commission, and in three previous appearances before other House committees.



 **II. Background and Purpose**



The Committee today is exploring the economics that underlies H.R. 2915, and in particular the consequences of repealing the Western Area Power Administration’s (WAPA) $3.25 billion borrowing authority under The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. That Act authorizes borrowing to construct new or upgraded transmission lines interconnected with WAPA, and specifically mentions lines “delivering or facilitating the delivery of power generated by renewable energy resources.“1 Numerous individuals and agencies have alleged that the increased investment in “renewable” sources of power is a worthwhile national objective on two grounds:2 [1] it will provide environmental and climate benefits that outweigh their higher costs, and [2] these investments will favorably impact employment, particularly in a time of recession. If these statements were even approximately true, they could justify support and subsidization of renewable power. Unfortunately, they are not.



My testimony addresses the realities of renewable electricity. It first addresses the very minor contribution of renewables to the nation’s power supply, and how that contribution reflects subsidies and regulations rather than market factors. It continues with a summary of the actual subsidies to various power sources, showing that some renewables receive highly disproportionate treatment that is unjustifiable on economic grounds. The third part questions the logic behind any policy that purports to “create jobs.” Even if government can create them, energy policy is one of the poorest possible vehicles with which to do so. Renewables are seldom sources of durable jobs, and their actual importance for the nation’s employment is negligible. On closer examination, most of the millions of frequently touted “green” and “clean” jobs have little to do with either existing or proposed energy policies. I conclude that federal policies toward renewables are due for a complete rethinking, and that the WAPA authorization may be a useful starting point for that process.



 **III. Renewables and reality**



 **A. Renewables in the U.S. power supply**  
Exhibit 1 shows the amounts of the nation’s power coming from various sources. In 2010, 44.9 percent came from coal, 23.8 percent from natural gas, 19.6 percent from nuclear, and 4.1 percent from renewables (excluding hydropower).3 Note the recent drop in production from coal, the longer‐​term increase in production from gas and the remarkable constancy of nuclear generation. Renewable power is a small fraction of today’s total, but its contribution was even smaller in the past — 2.1 percent in 1990 and 2.2 percent in 2005, when its current growth began. Exhibits 2 and 3 show that the mix of renewable sources has changed substantially over the past 20 years. In 1991, over 95 percent of renewable electricity was from geothermal sources, biomass and waste burning. These technologies were viable because their unsubsidized power was (and still is) competitive with fossil‐​fuel generation in a few areas. They were also dispatchable, operable when their power was valuable and left idle when it was not. All three of them have since stagnated. In 1992 they produced 70.5 million kilowatt‐​hours (gigawatt hours or gwh) and in 2009 slightly more, 72.2 gwh. Solar power remains a minor presence despite its substantial subsidies. Its 1993 output of 0.45 gwh grew to only 1.29 gwh in 2010, under 1 percent of renewable power and 0.03 percentof all U.S. power. Exhibit 4 shows that the growth of renewable electricity since 2000 has been almost entirely in wind power, which by 2010 accounted for over half of all renewable generation capacity. Explaining that growth is our next task.



 **B. Costs of power and costs of reliability**  
Wind power is both intermittent and expensive, and official expectations are that it will remain so. Exhibit 5 shows the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) projections of the levelized cost per megawatt‐​hour (mwh) of various technologies (including fuel where applicable) for plants expected on‐​line in 2016 (in 2009 dollars). The three most costly sources are solar thermal ($312/​mwh), offshore wind ($243) and solar photovoltaic ($211). The cost of onshore wind is $97/​mwh. Compared with a conventional (not an advanced) combined cycle gas‐​fired generator ($66/​mwh) the cheapest intermittent source is almost 50 percent more expensive. Intermittent renewables are even likely to be poor investments under a carbon tax or cap‐​and‐​trade system. The costs of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology are still highly uncertain, but EIA estimates that adding it to a combined cycle gas unit still leaves it 8 percent less expensive per mwh than the cheapest wind turbine. At carbon prices typically projected for cap‐​and‐​trade regimes the wind plant still loses.



Technology and economics both tell us that intermittent wind capacity carries costs that will likely exceed those the same dispatchable fossil‐​fueled capacity. Small amounts of wind can easily be integrated into a regional grid because a sudden calm is operationally indistinguishable from a minor outage. Larger amounts of wind capacity, however, require costlier backup arrangements, including operating reserve generators. In most regions wind blows most strongly when its power production is least valuable. In 2006, California had 2,323 MW of wind capacity and was operating under record loads in early summer. Wind’s average on‐​peak contribution (over the diverse northern and southern climates) was 256 MW.4 For system planning purposes, ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, currently sets a wind turbine’s “effective capacity” at 8.7 percent of its nominal amount for planning purposes.5



Because wind requires fossil‐​fuel generation as backup we cannot simply conclude that a mwh of wind power eliminates the pollutants in a mwh of conventional power. Research by gas marketer Bentek Energy found that in some areas additional wind power has strikingly perverse consequences. Bentek found that large increases in Texas and Colorado wind capacity indeed led to less coal‐​fired generation. Emissions of EPA “criteria pollutants” from these plants, however, actually increased, and CO2 emissions were unchanged.6 Operating data showed that wind’s variability required numerous quick adjustments by coal‐​fired units, which were responsible for the added pollution. Bentek’s controversial conclusion was that the total load in the area could have been served with lower total emissions had the wind units never existed.



 **C. Who gets what subsidies?**  
Subsidies and regulations can explain wind power’s rise quite graphically. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) extended wind’s sporadic production tax credit (PTC, now also applicable to some other renewables) through the end of 2012. Before the PTC’s first enactment in 2000, only 67 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity were built. That figure grew to 1,697 MW during its initial year of 2001. For 2002 (credit not in effect) and 2003 (in effect) the figures are 446 and 1,687 MW; and for 2004 (off) and 2005 (on) they are 389 and 2,431 MW.7 Many other factors influence investment, but total investment in years with the tax credit was 544 percent greater than in years without it. (We cannot go beyond these years because subsequent extensions have included retroactivity provisions that investors may have come to expect. ) There is, however, no evidence of changes in market conditions that would diminish the importance of subsidies, as was recently noted by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). In mid‐​2010 it claimed that ARRA’s subsidy provisions (which included an investment tax credit option) had been responsible for an increase in small turbine installations:



“The ITC was perhaps the most important factor in last year’s growth … [it] helpedconsumers purchase small wind systems during a recession when other financingmechanisms were hardest to obtain. The enactment of the ITC [was] the industry’s toppriority…“8



Alongside such subsidies, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and related regulations in approximately half of the states require utilities to obtain certain quantities of power from renewable sources. Although quantification is difficult it is likely that some wind investments have been made solely for RPS compliance, rather than because they were cost‐​effective choices.



Energy subsidies are a sensitive issue in part because they have no generally agreed‐​upon definition. For fiscal 2010 the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) produced what are the currently authoritative estimates. Its authors took particular care in calculating the effects of subsidies to various fuels on the actual amounts of power they produced. Thus a subsidy to the oil industry will only be relevant to the extent that it affects the (negligible) amount of oil used to generate power. Exhibit 6 presents the basics. Per mwh of power that it actually produced, wind received a subsidy of $56.29 and solar received $775.64. Wind gets 88 times more funds per mwh than coal, and the same multiple more than gas and oil.9



Taken by themselves, these figures alone cannot determine the desirability of subsidies. For example, the newness of renewable technologies might provide an economic rationale for subsidies to fund basic research that if successful could render them truly competitive. (Justifying the subsidy, however, also requires a demonstration that renewables somehow differ from other leading‐​edge industries in their unique needs for support.) Even if so, the current form of the subsidy is inappropriate. A targeted research subsidy might make sense, but one that simply lowers prices paid by purchasers of renewables or reduces the taxes of investors is harder to rationalize. EIA’s report states that “tax expenditures” (i.e. reductions) to the coal industry (including those for coal not used to produce power) were $561 million in fiscal 2010, while R&D subsidies (possibly necessary if we are to have “clean coal”) were $663 million. Tax expenditures for renewables were $8,168 billion, primarily the production tax credit for wind, while the R&D that might make them competitive was only $1,409 million for renewables as a group with $166 of that going to wind.10



 **IV. Renewables and employment**



 **A. “Green jobs“**  
It is rapidly becoming apparent that renewable energy is failing to produce the promise of painless prosperity embodied in “green jobs” that will simultaneously decrease unemployment rates and reduce pollution. Begin with some principles:11



1\. The proper goal of energy policy is to support the efficient provision of energy. The lower the cost of energy to the economy, all else equal, the higher will be job creation and economic growth outside of the energy sector. Raising energy costs by forcing the use of uneconomic technologies that create more job slots will have exactly the opposite effect. Put simply, more workers in energy reduce the production of non‐​energy goods and services.



2\. Any analysis of job creation by green energy must consider the simultaneous effect of job destruction. Policies that raise the cost of energy to households and businesses must leave them with fewer funds to spend elsewhere. Such policies include the spending of tax revenues to support green activities instead of other government purchases or returning the funds to taxpayers. To a first approximation the net effect of such programs on employment will be zero. This is particularly important here because the new job slots are often visible, while the losses are dispersed among the thousands of goods and services that households and businesses will spend less on. Jobs that cost more to create will generally have higher costs in terms of lost jobs elsewhere.



3\. Double counting of jobs and unrealistic assumptions about labor markets.Although they seldom say so explicitly, the models that underlie most studies of green energy and job creation assume that there is a limitless pool of idle laborers with just the right skills to fill the job slots created by the spending. As always happens in labor markets, many such jobs will in fact be filled by already‐​employed workers, whether the nation is in prosperity or recession. Even if green policies moved massive amounts of labor between jobs they would have little impact on the national unemployment rate.



 **B. How Government Models Job Creation**  
Much federal research on both the technology and economics of renewables is in the hands of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), where a now‐​standard computer model of the economic impact of renewable projects originated and continues to be maintained. During my appearance at a 2010 hearing before the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee the discussion turned to what was known about the effects of renewables on unemployment. After a representative of NREL testified about the optimistic findings of that standard model, known as JEDI (Job and Economic Development Impact), I commented that its use was entirely inappropriate. I noted that JEDI is structured, by NREL’s own admission, in a way that makes any outcome other than job creation mathematically impossible.12 It is thus a worthless tool for analyzing the actual employment effects of renewables, because it can only produce favorable ones. NREL’s representative disputed my statement, and that person and I agreed to submit supplemental testimony on the matter.13



As I detail in that testimony, JEDI is one of a large class of “input‐​output” models that analyze the effects of a project by examining the payments its owners make to workers and suppliers of materials. The monies they receive will in part be respent on other goods, and a “multiplier” effect brings further increases in incomes, outputs and employment across potentially many industries. I noted that



“[t]here is nothing in the model that could conceivably decrease employment or output in other sectors of the economy. Any project consider by JEDI, no matter how efficient or inefficient as a source of electricity, will show a positive effect on employment. That increase may be large or small, but we can be certain that it will not be negative.“14



I further noted that most of the effects will be transitory, since most of the positions created will be in construction rather than operation.



JEDI’s creators appear to have consciously chosen to avoid discussing the sources of the workers or the funds for projects under study. Even if there is a vast pool of unemployed workers in the project area who just happen to have the right skills, we can say nothing about its effect on overall employment. JEDI does not net out jobs lost due to taxes paid by consumers and businesses elsewhere that they cannot spend as they wished to. Even if the project is funded by private or public bond issue, alternative projects with their own employment consequences could have been undertaken. It is not even enough to have workers in the project area with the right skills, because net increases in employment usually happen only if those persons have also been suffering long‐​term unemployment.



NREL’s disregard of elementary economics and continued reliance on this model is remarkable, particularly in light of its’ creators’ acknowledgments of its inadequacies:



On occasion [the creators] have cited the works of others who use more complex models capable of forecasting both job creation and job destruction. Such models can incorporate factors that include responsiveness to higher power prices, reductions in employment in conventional power, and the‚ ‘crowding out’ of other capital spending by increased investment in renewables. Sometimes such models produce negative effects on employment in the long run. NREL’s researchers are thus aware that other models that capture important complexities are available (or they could surely create their own). For unknown reasons, they instead persist in using a model that can produce only the single result of job creation from renewables.15



The “green jobs” claim is logically insecure at best, and models like JEDI mask that insecurity by invariably finding that the jobs are created. Interestingly, however, I am aware of no published research in which the predictions of JEDI or a similar model for some project have been compared with the actual results. Apparently the model’s own creators also take its claims on faith, and that faith appears to be without foundation.



 **C. Which jobs are green?**  
Even if there were a usable model to analyze job creation, we are left with the problem of identifying which jobs are actually “green.” A renewable project can result in the employment of technical personnel trained to specialize in operating or maintaining its technology (whom we presume are green), as well as additional bartenders who will help the workers to enjoy their evenings (harder to classify as green). The matter is important because any type of governmental or private spending might open up slots for bartenders. Renewable technologies, however, have been viewed as the foundation for a massive increase in skilled workers whose human capital will provide them with higher lifelong earnings.



Two recent studies point up that the choice of definitions can affect estimates of the green workforce, and show that an extremely small fraction of jobs defined as green are in renewables. The Brookings Institution recently estimated 2.7 million jobs associated with the “clean economy.” The categories include “Agricultural and Natural Resources Conservation” (18.9 %), “Regulation and Compliance” (5.3%), “Energy and Resource Efficiency” (31.0%), and “Greenhouse Gas Reduction, Environmental Management, and Recycling” (39.6%).16 The clean economy expands its bounds by creative classification. Thus we find that energy efficiency includes 350,000 people in public mass transit, mostly bus drivers, and environmental management includes 386,000 people in waste management, formerly known as trash disposal. The researchers chose not to use an alternative definition that would have been far more helpful to most readers: how many clean jobs have (or will) come into being as a result of recent and proposed energy, environmental and climate regulations? (And, of course, how many others will vanish.)



Some additional insight is possible when we consider the Brookings’ final category. “Renewable Energy” contains 138,000 clean jobs, only 5.1 percent of the total. If we subtract the 55,000 of them in hydropower, which most data sources class as nonrenewable, the figure is down to 84,000, or 3.1 percent of all clean jobs. 29,000 of this remainder are in solar (thermal and photovoltaic), which accounts for under 1 percent of actual renewable power production. 24,000 more are in wind (17.4 percent of renewable power workers and under 1 percent of total clean workers).17 Even if we are willing to assume very large “multipliers” from renewable power, its impact on employment will be trivial, whether taken as a fraction of all energy, clean economy jobs, or the entire labor force.



As a check on those figures we examine Washington State, where environmental awareness is high and renewable energy (non‐​hydro) is a significant presence. Its four base categories are [1] Increasing energy efficiency, [2] Producing renewable energy, [3] Preventing and reducing environmental pollution, and [4] Providing mitigation or cleanup of pollution.18 Again, a significant fraction of its green workers are bus drivers, trash handlers and the like. The Washington data show that renewable energy occupies 3,464 workers, 3.5 percent of the state’s 99,979 green jobs.19 Its current wind capacity is 2,357 MW, ranking it sixth among the states.20 Washington is one of the most active states in wind investment and production, but still only a small percentage of its green workforce works with renewables, including wind. The Washington study’s authors further note that “construction-relat¬≠ed industries and occupations, as well as professional and techni¬≠cal services occupations, accounted for the majority of all [renewable] positions.21 The majority of these jobs are in manufacturing and construction. Per project, both are short‐​lived, and once in operation “most renewable energy facilities operate with a relatively small number of operations and maintenance employees… The proportion of part‐​time positions is higher for renewable energy than for any other private‐​sector core area (35 percent).“22



Both the Brookings and the Washington data tell similar stories. Green or clean jobs are not objectively definable, and cases like the bus drivers tell us that they are easy to inflate. Under both studies’ definitions, renewable power jobs are small fractions of the total, and most will be short‐​lived construction work performed in the main by people with skills that are usable in almost any type of project. Washington’s wind units produce a higher fraction of the state’s power than those of most other states, but their existence has not created any discernible difference in Washington’s labor market performance. Similarly, it appears that most of the solar work force is in construction, where opportunities will diminish with the growth of installations. The past three years have led many to question the federal government’s ability to create new employment and the odd logic that lies behind that hope. The data, however, should make it clear to both believers and nonbelievers that renewable power is a singularly inappropriate and ineffective way to increase employment.



 **V. Summary and Conclusions**



The reality of most renewable electricity, particularly from intermittent sources, is easy to summarize. It is expensive, undependable and environmentally problematic. Some renewables such as biomass and geothermal are exceptions, often capable of passing market tests that wind and solar cannot. Unchallenged data from the Energy Information Administration show that the subsidies per kwh actually generated by wind and solar power are over 80 times those received by non‐​nuclear conventional sources, and over 15 times those for nuclear power. Most subsidies to wind and solar are politically‐​inspired wealth transfers, rather than tools to incentivize improvements in their competitiveness. In all but the most extreme scenarios, the Department of Energy projects that they will be uncompetitive with conventional resources, even if carbon policies come into being.



The economic theory behind claims that renewables will increase employment applies (if at all) to an economy that hardly resembles today’s. Advocates of job creation almost invariably fail to note the concomitant destruction of jobs in industries whose products are no longer bought because consumers must pay taxes or higher prices for the renewable power. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s models of job creation are curiosities devoid of policy relevance, mathematically structured to render any possible job destruction an impossibility. Even if we only look at jobs in renewables, their impacts on employment are minimal. The Brookings Institution estimates slightly over 80,000 renewable energy jobs, many of which are short‐​term construction work. The millions of “clean” or “green” jobs mentioned in the media are overwhelmingly positions that would be filled even if all renewable electricity vanished — bus drivers, refuse workers, and some building trades, to name a few. Calling these workers part of the “clean” economy can only mislead the public about the likely effects of energy and climate policy.



Any choice by government to financially support one energy source over another is by definition an exercise in picking winners. All too often such spending generates forces that make it very difficult to abandon the non‐​winners. The stories of synfuels and ethanol are back today in wind and solar power, which have many friends in Washington. Whatever happens there, the real future of energy has already arrived, and the winner was picked by the market, with virtually no help from the District of Columbia. Independent risk‐​takers devised ways to access shale gas for the simplest of reasons — there was profit to be made by alleviating a scarcity of conventional gas. Shale is competitive on costs, compliant with environmental rules and in the main within state jurisdiction, under which it is producing prosperity. The jobs shale creates are the kind that have always powered the country, and their finance comes from the voluntary savings of households and businesses. The nation is looking at centuries of low‐​cost, clean, secure fuel that creates the kind of jobs that are really worth creating — in the making of goods and services that people voluntarily trade because doing so makes both sides better off. Wind and solar largely exist because government can coerce payments for them.



The subject matter of this hearing is a seemingly minor provision in a far larger and more pervasive law. ARRA and many other recent laws contain language that prioritizes facilities associated with renewable power in ways that I believe are unwarranted. This testimony has summarized some facts about renewable energy in order to shed light on its true costs, benefits, and labor market effects. These facts clearly show that this committee must rethink ARRA’s statement that WAPA pay particular attention to renewable energy. I am not testifying about the organization or performance of WAPA, or about the costs and benefits of any specific transmission project. Rather, I am stating that power from renewable sources should compete for transmission resources on the same terms as power from conventional ones.

Guest post by Viv Forbes
There is a persistent green myth that coal-fired power generation causes city smogs. It does not.
City air pollution is nothing new. King Edward I complained about London pollution in 1306, as did Queen Elizabeth I in 1578, long before the first steam engine operated.
Let’s look at the causes of some famous smogs – London/Pittsburgh, Los Angeles/Santiago, the Dust Bowls and the Asian Smogs.
The London smogs were caused by open-air combustion of newspapers, wood and cheap high-sulphur unwashed coal in domestic fires, stoves and boilers; by coal-burning blacksmiths, brewers and ironworkers in smoky forges, furnaces and coke plants; and by many smoky steam locomotives; all with inefficient combustion and no pollution controls. The smog was slowly eliminated by clean air regulations and by changing to “clean coal by pipe” (town gas) and “clean coal by wire” (electricity).

The Los Angeles smogs were caused mainly by backyard incinerators, vehicle exhausts and natural air inversions. They were reduced by using cleaner fuels, better engines and compulsory pollution-control equipment. Santiago has undergone a similar clean-up.
The Dust Bowl conditions of the Great Plains in USA were caused by drought and wind erosion of newly cultivated soils. Gobi Desert storms produced the Yellow River and the Yellow Sea and contribute to the Asian Brown Cloud today.
Today’s Asian smogs have many sources – forest fires in Indonesia; open air cremations in India; dust from volcanic eruptions and desert storms; soot, ash and other pollutants from millions of domestic rubbish fires, mosquito fires, cooking fires and heaters using anything combustible – cow dung, wood, paper, cardboard, plastic or cheap unwashed coal; and soot and unburnt hydro-carbons from millions of vehicles, many with engines needing maintenance and no pollution controls. Beijing today combines the 1950’s problems of both London and Los Angeles.
The Asian smog is NOT caused by producing electricity in modern power stations with closed boilers, pollution controls and using high-quality washed coal such as exported by Australia to Asia. The “power station pollution” pictured so eagerly in ABC and Green propaganda is actually steam from the cooling towers.
The main products released by modern coal-fired power stations are water vapour and carbon dioxide – both are essential life supporters. Neither one is dangerous. Both make our climate more liveable, but the contribution of carbon dioxide to climate is tiny. And the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal has done more to encourage the growth of plants and the greening of planet Earth than Greenpeace will ever do.
“Clean coal by wire” into every home is the one thing that could solve much of the Asian air pollution.

"**There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D can help fight coronavirus.**
The Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition and the health watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have done a rapid review of the evidence.
With more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some may have been deprived of vitamin D.
Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun.
The NHS says people should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors.
Scottish and Welsh governments and Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency issued similar advice during lockdown.
Before the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March.
Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if:
People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement.
There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people have a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus.
Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults.
There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections.
Some studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help when we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent.
The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) says studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this.
A review of research by NICE suggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus.
But experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible.
Some researchers have suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes if someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making it hard to draw conclusions.
Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses.
This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed.
No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run.
If you choose to take vitamin D supplements:
Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency.
Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D.
Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet.
The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants.
Vitamin drops are available for babies.
Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels.
It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone.
Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic.
It can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D.
Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun.
Cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage.
The advice is:
The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women. A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies."

As I [reported recently](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/union-goes-nuclear-on-albanese/), nuclear energy is emerging as yet another issue on which the Labor party is moving further and further from its blue-collar base. One of Australia’s biggest unions, the Australian Worker’s Union is advocating that Australia drop its sanctions and adopt nuclear power.



A new survey shows that a majority of Australians agree.



A narrow majority of 51% (up 16% since July 2011) of respondents say Australia should develop nuclear power to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions. Just over a third 34% (down 24%) say no, Australia shouldn’t, while 15% (up 8%) can’t say.



Much of this support is specifically down to the issue of climate change. Many Australians realise that “renewable” energy just isn’t up to the task of powering a modern, affluent society. If Australians want to go carbon-neutral and still remain a modern society, nuclear is the only viable present option.



However, without the reference to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, only 45% (up 11% since March 2011) of respondents say Australia should develop nuclear power plants to supply electricity to Australians while 40% (down 21%) say no, Australia shouldn’t, and 15% (up 10%) can’t say.



The NIMBY factor is also coming into play.



If Australia were to develop nuclear power plants a majority of 58% (down 17% since March 2011) of respondents would oppose a nuclear power plant being built in their area while 42% (up 17%) wouldn’t oppose. Of those who wouldn’t oppose 23% (up 10%) would be anxious about the nuclear power plant being built and 19% (up 7%) would agree to it being built in their area.



What really stands out, though, is the gender divide. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that protest groups so often seem to be dominated by frightbats and nosey-nannas.



Support [for nuclear power] is driven by men (65% support) rather than women (38% support).



This same gender split is replicated on all the questions asked as part of this survey…



Gary Morgan, Executive Chairman, Roy Morgan says:



“Australian views on nuclear power have changed significantly over the last eight years with a majority of 51% now supporting the development of nuclear power in Australia to reduce carbon dioxide emissions – up a significant 16ppts from July 2011…[The] stark divide between the two sexes indicates the difficulty facing any policy-maker attempting to develop an on-shore nuclear power industry in Australia. The issues surrounding nuclear power are incredibly divisive – even within households.”



At the same time, other surveys show that women are more likely than men to fret about climate change. Which begs the question: why won’t they support the one energy generation technology we have which can keep the lights on and emissions low?



Far easier to glue yourself to a road and frighten a few schoolchildren, I guess.

Dear Editor



I am going through a pessimistic stage over the future of New Zealand. I can see Western civilisation being defunct in about 20 years and climate change has nothing to do with it.  
The problem as I see it is a combination of immigration, declining European birth rate, these stupid socialists and their tax-everything approach and the undue influence of the Muddy browns (What you get when you cross green with red: the Greens). 



These idiots are succeeding in alienating the petrochemical industry and persecuting farmers. There is undue pressure to change to renewable resources (even though the generation capacity is doubtful), the alienating of social groups – think legal gun owners and now the abandonment of Christian values. There is the Islamisation of our society, the failure of ministers to supervise their portfolios and their obvious lack of business acumen. Then there are the scandals swept under the carpet, the foreign journalists’ adulation of a totally inadequate figurehead for our country, the abandonment of reason and the death of common sense and the weaponisation of our young people by those in their 40s.



And that is only a start. **Seriously, I think Western society has had its day.** Even Trump can’t hold the Dems in check and roll out his MAGA policies. Europe is stuffed, Soros with his countries without borders and uncontrolled immigration has seen to that. Britain has no future without separating from the French influence.



Cheerful little fellow, am I not?

"**An MP has called for the Home Office to urgently review conditions at an accommodation centre for asylum seekers which was hit by a Covid-19 outbreak.**
Urban House in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was forced to close in July after dozens of residents tested positive for the virus.
Sheffield Hallam MP Olivia Blake said not enough food or PPE equipment were being provided for residents.
The Home Office ""rejected these claims entirely"", a spokesperson said.
Ms Blake has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel urging her to review conditions at the centre, which is run by the Mears Group.
More stories from around Yorkshire
The Labour MP said: ""Despite Mears having a Â£1.15bn contract with the Home Office, volunteer groups including Yorkshire Refugee Foodbank are having to provide food, PPE, clothing and toys to Urban House residents due to Mears' failure to support them.
""Residents are being forced to share toilets and bathrooms, going long periods without access to soap, and struggling to access healthcare.
She added: ""I asked Home Secretary Priti Patel why Urban House was permitted to reopen when the conditions that led to a Covid-19 outbreak in July still remain, and called on her to urgently review Mears' operations during the pandemic, and the conditions residents have been subjected to.""
A Mears Group spokesman said: ""Mears have followed public health advice on the running of the facility throughout the pandemic.
""Urban House is operating with arrangements agreed with Wakefield Council's Public Health Department and PHE as well as in consultation with the Home Office.
""Arrangements include reduced capacity to support social distancing, no unrelated individuals sharing a room and health checks on site for new arrivals.""
He added three nutritionally-balanced meals a day were provided, and food ""is of good quality"".
A Home Office spokesperson said they ""entirely"" rejected the points raised by Ms Blake.
They added: ""The wellbeing of all those in the asylum system is taken extremely seriously, and we have taken many measures to reduce the risk of transmission in these unprecedented times, working closely with health partners in Wakefield throughout lockdown to ensure guidance is followed and will continue to do so.
""Asylum seekers have access to legal and medical support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year through the Migrant Help helpline, for support and advice.""
Following the Covid-19 outbreak, a report by the Commons Home Affairs Committee said the continued use of shared rooms in asylum accommodation made it ""extremely difficult"" for people to follow social distancing advice.
Campaigners South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) also said it had raised concerns of poor hygiene standards and the welfare of residents at Urban House.
Ms Blake is acting in her role as a member of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects.

Yesterday a bunch of woke wankers decided that their fears and worries should command more attention than honest, hard-working taxpayers and so, aided and abetted by _Stuff_ reporters jizzing their y-fronts, they decided to disrupt Wellington.



Jacinda Ardern got the tone right stating:



“I’m never going to be opposed to someone being able to express their opinion and express their voices but blocking people from being able to go and do their day-to-day job doesn’t necessarily take us closer to the climate action they’re calling for,” 



**They aren’t calling for climate action, they are calling for the destruction of the economy.**



So, what does the Boss Womble of the ~~National~~ Womble party say with regards to the disruption to citizens going about their lawful daily routine?



 **Simon Bridges is telling Extinction Rebellion protesters** in Wellington **to march on the “woke” Government** doing “nothing” about climate change. 



The National leader described the Monday morning protest – blocking the entrance of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) on Wellington’s Stout St – as “nonsense”. 



**“I think climate change is real and think we’ve got to act,”** Bridges told Magic Talk.



Has Bridges not heard of the saying, ‘Go Woke, Get Broke’? 



He’s limper than a week-old lettuce sandwich at a Lambton Quay cafe.



In the contest of ideas in politics, he’s just given up and decided that he wants to out-woke the Greens and Labour.



To paraphrase Henry Curtmantle, will no one rid us of this turbulent weasel? Has he not learned the lesson from the Liberal victory in Australia?



My god, he’s such a womble. Is he saying he’d do something?[ ](https://whaleoil.slack.com/archives/CAWQVDU1H/p1570414967282800)Is he saying he’d be more woke than Labour and the Greens?



It is clear that Simon Bridges believes in climate change and not only that, **he believes that we HAVE to act.**



He clearly doesn’t want to be called a denier. But this shows that **he is definitely in the wrong party.**



Whilst he may think the voting public think he’s cool for singing syrupy renditions of Elvis Presley, most of us just look on in astonishment that the ~~National~~ Womble party caucus think that he’s the one to take them to victory next year.



The reality is becoming more apparent by the day: that he’s a dud. Time for him to go…quietly or otherwise, it matters not, he just needs to go. 



I can’t wait to see Paula Bennett announce that the ~~National~~ Womble Party theme song for the election will be:

"WASHINGTON  —   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump’s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president’s criticism of independent judges “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation’s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings “disgraceful” and described the courts as “so political. ” Those remarks followed Mr. Trump’s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a “  judge” whose “ridiculous” ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump’s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even “a bad high school student would understand. ” “This is highly unusual,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. “Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. ” Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump’s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump’s comments “extremely   and  ” because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. “Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it’s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,” said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. “But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it’s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,” Mr. Rosen said. “Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,” he added, “and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. ” Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. ” Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched “in amazement” Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. “I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. ” His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  —   the audio of which was carried live on national television  —   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump’s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, “I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. ” The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. “If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they’d do what they should be doing,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s so sad. ” By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. “Right on  —   they were perfect,” Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton’s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  —   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  —   on an insignificant matter. “I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,” said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. ” Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts’ legitimacy. “It’s not illegal, it’s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it’s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,” Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, “I always cringed. ” Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with “very evil intentions,” to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump’s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. “Believe me, I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,” Mr. Trump said. “But we’re going to take care of it. We’re going to win. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf anyone thinks Germany’s move to renewable energies has been a success, you may want to take a few minutes and read what center-left news weekly Der Spiegel has just written.
Overall Germany’s energy revolution has made the country’s energy unaffordable, unreliable and has ruined its own idyllic landscape, and ravaged rainforests abroad as well.
Spiegel focusses on the costs in its article titled: Cost explosion with electricity, oil, gas: energy poverty in Germany is increasing drastically. The online flagship news weekly writes:
Rising energy costs are becoming a problem for more and more citizens in Germany. Just from 2008 to 20111 the share of energy-poor households in the Federal Republic jumped from 13.8 to 17 percent.”
Energy poverty is defined by the number of households that must pay more than 10% of their net income on energy. All told 6.9 million German households (every 6th household) finds itself in energy poverty, Spiegel writes.
Much of the rapid increase in energy prices is owing to Germany’s growth in expensive wind and solar energy. Ironically, despite more than 20% of Germany’s energy now being supplied by renewables, CO2 emissions have been rising just the same.
Spiegel calls the energy poverty rate “alarming”. However, when it comes to finding the cause for the runaway increase, the German Greens are blaming all the misery on the rising costs of oil and gas, and even hint that just more expensive, unreliable green energy is all that’s needed to get the costs back in line.
Natural gas in Germany costs three times more than it does in USA. The Greens are also demanding that the government pass legislation that would lead to residential units being renovated and better insulated. But critics say such a measure likely would make the situation even worse because landlords would benefit from the subsidies and pass the renovation costs to low income tenants.
The more the greens try to fix the mess, the more they screw it up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned Swedish sea level expert and climatologist Nils-Axel Mörner also responded by e-mail on the Antarctic sea ice expansion.
Here’s his view:
=====================================
The Antarctic sea ice and sea surface temperature
Nils-Axel Mörner
Whilst there is a general hysteria of global warming, increasing temperature and rising sea level, new records from Antarctica indicate the opposite: a significant increase in the extent of sea ice over the last 30 years (in the order of 1 million square km) and a decrease in sea surface temperature south of Lat. 60°S (in the order of 0.4 °C).
Why is this?
First, the global warming hysteria is just what it is: a large-scale hysteria, which is primarily based on disinformation:
– The warming during the 20th century seems primarily driven by the Sun.
– There is negative evidence of CO2-driven process.
– The cooling over the last 17 years and 11 months is predominantly driven by the Sun.
– Sea level is by no means rising at an alarming rate.

Secondly, events taking place south of the Circum-Antarctic circulation belt are bound to be driven by other, often negatively correlated, effects than those recorded north of this belt:
– South of the Circum-Antarctic circulation belt ocean circulation and wind currents may generate climatic signals quite opposite to those in the north.
– An expansion of the sea ice over the last 30 years is not surprising.
– Nor is an increase in sea surface temperature of 0.4 °C since 2003 surprising.
But it all calls for an observationally based view of climate; in stead of a general hysteria.”

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Whau Ward**



It’s been a wild ride, but now we approach the final ward contest. 



There are 5 candidates contesting the Whau ward. The two-term incumbent is Ross Clow from Labour.



[ **Ross Clow – Labour Party $$$**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=fd4215ff-c988-47ed-ae33-5ce7f1459f6c&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward)



Prior to the Super City amalgamation, Clow was on Waitakere Council serving as finance chairman. He narrowly lost to Noelene Rafills in 2010 but was successful in his second attempt in 2013. Phil Goff appointed Clow Chair of the Finance and Performance Committee.



Clow is also President of the Portage Licensing Trust which administers a monopoly over liquor sales in West Auckland and chairman of The Trusts Community Foundation which runs pokie machines in the trusts’ outlets around NZ and in some parts of West Auckland. That alone demonstrates why Clow doesn’t deserve to be a Councillor, but I’ll return to that in the final rating articles to come in a couple of days.



Clow’s voting record in the 2013-16 term includes some good



But mostly bad



Voting against intensification and for maintaining minimum floor sizes does far more to hurt housing affordability than token requirements to build affordable houses which are simply subsidised by higher prices in the rest of the development.



Ross Clow was naturally the first port of call when [The Spinoff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/local-elections/27-08-2019/can-we-find-a-single-councillor-who-supports-john-tamiheres-rates-freeze/) asked him what he thought of Mayoral candidate John Tamihere’s plan to freeze rates for three years. Clow didn’t seem to have a clear idea of how that saving would be achievable. Neither did Desley Simpson surprisingly, considering she has been vocal about saving $260 million over the past two years through her ‘Value for Money’ programme, on top of the $62 million in efficiency savings the Council has budgeted for over the next three years. Tamihere’s rates freeze is expected to cost $180 million.



On the other hand, Clow was part of a minority of councillors who voted to give Eden Park a no-interest loan, with no end date for payment, worth $53 million, payable if the Eden Park Trust is wound up and the land sold. Unfortunately, that vote was won by 12 councillors who elected to give Eden Park a no strings attached grant instead. I’d prefer the Council finally dealt to Helen Clark and her obstructive neighbours who must take some responsibility for the economic unviability of the stadium.



Clow is also pragmatic when it comes to managing the Council’s portfolio, in clear contrast to ideologues such as Mike Lee. In April, the Council sold its Graham Street offices in Auckland CBD for $58m. It is expected the sale will also save the Council $117m in maintenance costs over the next decade.



However, when it comes to Mayor Phil Goff, Clow is firmly in his corner. Whether that is due to being appointed Chair of the powerful Finance and Performance Committee is for you to decide. In 2018 he rated [Goff an 8/10 for his performance, saying](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12153375) “Introducing comprehensive water quality and environmental programmes, that will achieve in 10 years what previously would have taken 30 years, may well be the Goff legacy”.



[ **Paul Davie – Community Independents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=908cf97d-d271-4d5e-838a-c4b5799c74f6&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) ****



I first came across Paul Davie when the Free Speech issue became hot in New Zealand, following Phil Goff’s false claim that he was stopping Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern being permitted to hire the Bruce Mason Theatre. I’ve regretted doing so ever since.



I spoke in favour of free speech because I believe it is impossible to preserve our liberal democracy without it. Davie spoke because he actually supports Molyneux and Southern. 



Davie has previously been a candidate for the Conservative Party in 2014, earning a perfect score in [Family First’s Value your Vote survey](http://valueyourvote.org.nz/2014-general-election/candidates/paul-davie) and in 2017, quoted as saying New Zealand was “God’s land not Maori land,” but left to form a breakaway party because the Conservatives weren’t Conservative enough. That resulted in the founding of One New Zealand which split into two One New Zealand Parties when the majority of the party board kicked [Davie and some other reprehensible creatures out](https://www.rightminds.nz/articles/paul-davies-statement-one-new-zealand-controversy).



Davie describes himself as steadfastly independent, serving no political master. Yet, he belongs to a ticket called Community Independents. You’re either independent or you’re on a ticket. Community Independents is a ticket.



Paul and Kathryn Davie lost their jobs as real estate agents for Ray White after historic comments about Muslims, Africans, Australian Senator Fraser Anning, multiculturalism and a warning by Kathryn that “civil war was coming” over the issue of teaching Te Reo in schools that were screenshotted and spread by far-left radical groups.



Don’t vote for him. Seriously…just don’t.



[ **Anne Degia-Pala – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b0e67abe-a197-417f-b211-75c44943d233&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) **$$$**



Degia-Pala stood in the 2016 election, finishing fourth with 12.2% She is also one of the few Council candidates to sign the Auckland Ratepayers Alliance pledge to never vote for a measure which will result in rates increasing more than 2%



Degia-Pala has also been a [candidate for New Zealand First](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96124428/seeing-first-home-buyers-outbid-led-a-tearful-degiapala-to-run-for-parliament), her candidacy announced by “the Maestro himself.” She is a Fijian-Indian who moved to New Zealand 30 years ago and switched from Labour after witnessing a young couple being out-bid at an auction next door by an Australian purchaser who owned seven other properties.



In 2017, a controversy brewed over a planned visit by prominent ex-Muslim speaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which was shortly cancelled due to fears for Ms Ali’s safety. [Anne Degia-Pala is Muslim](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/04/freedom-of-speech-under-attack-at-new-zealand-universities.html) and said while Ali’s talk may be interesting it isn’t representative of everyone’s experience. She disagreed with Ali’s views but agrees the threats go too far.



Anne is a board member of Drowning Prevention Auckland, NixCrew Road Safety Trust and a committee member of the National Lottery Outdoor Safety Committee. Previously she has held the roles of Waitakere Ethnic Board President, Auckland Council People’s Panel and Generosity New Zealand.



Her priorities should she be elected include upgrading footpaths and cycleways, financially responsible and accountable for debt reduction, supporting partners in environmental groups for healthy waterways and sustainable living programs and accessible public transport to ease traffic congestion and reduce emissions.



[ **Jessamine Fraser – Green Party**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=12d3c3df-5ba4-4feb-84b3-48511c7a0354&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) ****



Oh dear. It’s unicorns and rainbows should Fraser be elected. Her priorities include addressing housing issues whilst retaining accessible public spaces and protecting the unique environment. That translates to throwing your money at social housing (not a Council function), causing the waiting list for social housing to explode because if you fund it, they will come.



She wants to make Whau climate resilient by reducing waste through addressing the volume of “stuff wrapped around goods.” If she’s referring to produce sold in plastic bags, she is ignorant of the significant extension in shelf-life plastic packaging delivers and clueless about the impact removing “stuff wrapped around goods” will have on the poor as food waste and prices increase.



She wants income-linked Council housing expanded ensuring people aren’t forced out of their communities by development and rising house prices. The dingbat doesn’t understand that development, increasing the supply of housing on the market, relieves the pressure on house prices.



Fraser is excited by the strong sense of political engagement in the area (this was written pre-lowest voter turnout ever) and wants to be part of realising the potential that carries for grassroots action for arts, culture and heritage. She’s gonna splash your cash at artists producing crap nobody would willingly purchase.



[ **Tracy Mulholland – C &R – Communities and Residents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=3aaaa2ad-450c-484f-84c6-2027d84049f3&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) **$$$**



Mulholland is the current Chair of Whau Local Board, though no longer a member of the Labour Party. She is also the New Lynn Business Association Manager.



While Chair Whau Local Board, she was involved in delivering a new Avondale Community facility and library, playgrounds and town centre upgrades. She also mentioned $105m for the Whau Pool and Recreation Centre, though a figure that high doesn’t come from local boards alone.



Whau Local Board is the first in Auckland to launch a specific plan for its ethnic population. A bit ignorant when you consider there are over 100 ethnicities in Whau, though not all will be considered ‘ethnic.’ I think this virtue signalling treads a dangerous line.



The only reference I can find to the reasons for Mulholland’s switch to C&R is hidden behind a Herald paywall.

I have confirmed that www.drroyspencer.com has been hacked and rendered inoperable.
Dr. Spencer confirms this in an email exchange with me this AM and writes:

“Apparently some Indonesian female hacker.”
Whether this is a direct attack on his views about climate, an indirect attack via a hired gun, or just some kid looking to hold up a trophy for others to see is unclear at this point.
It does point to the risks though of running an independent server. My best advice to anyone in the climate issue is to run on wordpress.com rather than an independent server as they keep everything running smoothly and up to date against the latest security threats.

"**The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for widespread use in the UK.**
British regulator, the MHRA, says the jab is safe to start being used from next week.
The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus.
It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.
The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells.
The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective.
The vaccine is given in two doses - three weeks apart - and offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19.
This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans.
The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases.
The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.
In the UK, older care home residents and their carers are top of the priority list in the first phase of the vaccination programme. They are followed by frontline health and social care workers and the over-80s.
Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list.
The first jabs may take place within days now approval has been given.
There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population.
The vaccine will be delivered through care homes, GPs and pharmacists as well as ""go-to"" vaccination centres set up in venues like sports halls.
However, there are logistical challenges to overcome:
It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting.
If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu.
The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities.
Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine.
Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks.
The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported.
If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent.
However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised.
Hopefully yes, but not for some time.
If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures.
However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time.
So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet.
The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property.
They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further.
The announcement gave us the headline, but there is a still lack of fine detail.
We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups.
These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used.
It is good news - it shows that a coronavirus vaccine is possible,.
About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages and those produced by Oxford University/AstraZeneca and Moderna have also proved successful in trials. The UK has ordered supplies of both."
"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Months after intense fighting between the Afghan government and the Taliban subsided on the outskirts of Kunduz, Hajji Habib Rahmani’s family decided to go ahead with a delayed wedding. Amid the festivities, Abdul Basit, one of the children playing behind the house, picked up an unexploded shell, and it blew up. Basit, 14, and his brother Haroon, 8, were killed, and 12 other children ages 7 to 15 were wounded. The shell had been “fired from a helicopter during the fighting, and it hadn’t exploded,” said Mr. Rahmani, an uncle of the two brothers. On Monday, the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan reported that 2016 had been another year of record civilian casualties in the country, and it expressed particular concern about a 65 percent jump in the number of children killed or wounded by explosive remnants as fighting has spread to heavily populated civilian areas. The report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or Unama, said overall civilian casualties had continued their steady increase in recent years. In 2016, 3, 498 civilians were killed and 7, 920 others wounded  —   a rise of 3 percent over the previous year, the report said. “I am deeply saddened to report yet another year of increase in civilian casualties  —   another    figure for the number of civilian casualties,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan and the head of Unama, said at a news conference on Monday in Kabul, the Afghan capital. “The killing and maiming of Afghan civilians is deeply harrowing and largely preventable. ” According to the report, Unama documented “record numbers of civilian casualties from ground engagements, suicide and complex attacks, and explosive remnants of war” in 2016. The report also said casualties caused by aerial operations were the highest since the mission started systematically tracking them in 2009 and had doubled compared with 2015. Afghanistan is still having to clear what remains of the hundreds of thousands of   mines and explosive remnants dating as far back as the   war with the Soviet Union and the subsequent factional fighting, even as newer explosives take lives on a daily basis. Just as the conflict is restricting the movements of demining crews, civilians are being killed and maimed by homemade roadside bombs planted by insurgents, as well as unexploded ordnance left behind by coalition forces around bases they abandoned. And now, more children are dying not long after battles in their neighborhoods have ended, as none of the combatants bother to clear explosive remnants afterward as sought by international conventions. About 61 percent of the civilian casualties are attributed to what Unama calls “antigovernment elements,” largely the Taliban. But civilian casualties caused by local affiliates of the Islamic State also increased tenfold compared with 2015, with 899 casualties claimed by Islamic State in 2016.   forces caused 24 percent of the civilian casualties, the report said, significantly higher than in 2015. The United Nations mission was especially concerned about an overall 24 percent rise in casualties involving children compared with 2015, with 3, 512 such episodes in 2016 causing 923 deaths and leaving 2, 589 wounded. More than half of the child casualties occurred during ground engagements. Afghanistan has successfully carried out one of the world’s largest demining efforts over several decades, removing nearly two million items of explosive material, more than 700, 000 antipersonnel mines and more than 29, 000 antitank mines, according to the United Nations Mine Action Service. The efforts have resulted in a 65 percent reduction in casualties caused by mines and explosive remnants since 2001. But in recent years, as the   international coalition has closed down bases ahead of its withdrawal from the country, more casualties have been reported from ordnance exploding in areas that had been used as firing ranges and then abandoned by coalition forces. From 2009 to 2015, the United Nations recorded 138 casualties resulting from explosive remnant accidents in or around facilities used by the international coalition, and it said that 75 percent of the victims were children. A clearance operation to start getting rid of the explosives was introduced in 2014 to clear dozens of these sites. The United Nations said many of last year’s casualties involving children and unexploded ordnance were caused by new explosive items left behind after recent fighting. “My team tracks the location of every one of the detonations, and the trend we have documented was a direct correlation between casualties from exploded ordnance and areas where the heaviest ground fighting happened,” said Danielle Bell, the director of the human rights unit at Unama. “The majority of casualties resulted from new unexploded ordnance from the current conflict. ” The United Nations is urging the Afghan government to comply with international rules requiring it to clear explosives after a battle."

There’s lots of hullabaloo over the supposedly tied all time temperature record of 117°F in Las Vegas on June 29th, and the potential for a new all-time temperature record in Death Valley, which would negate the all time world record of 134F set on July 10th, 1913, since the previous world record in Libya of 136.4°F (58°C) was recently said to be unreliable. More on Death Valley in the next post, but for now let’s look at Las Vegas.
I don’t know where NBC news got 117°F where they say:
The high temperature officially hit 117 degrees at Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport — equaling the airport’s record
Even Drudge reported this.
Did NBC make this up? It wouldn’t be the first time they made up a news report to make it more spectacular. The official report from NWS Las Vegas for June 29th says 115°F:

Interesting to note that NWS Las Vegas has followed the lead of the Surface Stations project, and on their main web page today, provided photos of each weather station…well almost, they don’t have photos of the Ellis AFB weather station, just the tarmac. 5 out of six isn’t bad though, I’ll give them props for effort.

Their caption reads:
Although there are 6 official weather stations in the Las Vegas Valley, our long-term climate station is at McCarran Airport. Most weather stations are located at airports since the aviation community relies heavily on weather data for flights. 
UPDATE: The new record report (preliminary, pending certification) for June 30th, today does show that the temperature reached 117F:

With the election over, pressure is sure to build on President Trump to submit the Kigali Amendment on hydrofluorocarbons to the Senate. It is an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. HFCs are currently the refrigerants of choice, appearing everywhere from your home heat pump to your car’s A/C.



On June 4, 13 Republican senators sent a letter to President Trump urging him to submit Kigali to the Senate for ratification. They said it would result in a lot of HVAC sales. Together with the 49 Democrats, that would leave the amendment only five votes short of the 67 needed to ratify or amend a treaty.



Kigali is no gain and all loss for almost everyone. The effect of HFCs on stratospheric ozone has been estimated from very slim (a theoretical reduction of 0.035 percent is too small to measure) to none. But the effect on wallets will also be stratospheric.





Kigali is a big wealth transfer from the people of the U.S. to Honeywell, Dupont, and big machine producers like Carrier. That’s not exactly Making America Great Again.



While HFCs are out of patent and cost a mere $7 a pound, their patented replacements, branded as Solstice (Honeywell) and Opteon (Dupont) go for around $71 a pound. They are known as Hydrofluoro‐​olefins (HFOs). The raw material cost (not including labor and installer markup), to fill a new residential HVAC system will be about $1,000 more than the cost of HFCs. Your existing unit likely cannot use HFOs, so you’re going to have to shell out several thousand more for a new heat pump, along with the installation cost. All of this will be required when your old HFC‐​driven system goes on the fritz.



Recognizing the virtually nonexistent ozone‐​depletion potential of HFCs, proponents of Kigali switched to global warming, saying banning HFCs will prevent 0.5°C of dreaded global surface heating. That’s an awful lot more than the mere 0.1 degree that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that continued use of HFCs will cause this century.



This was also mirrored by Andrew Jones, who runs the policy‐​tracking firm Climate Interactive. He told _Science_ magazine that “I’m not really buying it”, meaning the 0.5°C saving, and also noting the IPCC figure.



A Senate ratification is likely going to be on the fast track to the Supreme Court. Because the ozone‐​depleting effects are, at most _de minimus_ , and the (purported) climate effects are, relatively speaking, orders of magnitude larger, the Kigali Agreement is about global warming. It should therefore be an amendment to the 1992 United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change, not the Montreal Protocol.



The 0.5&degrees; warming, absent an effective Kigali Agreement, is predicated upon the notion that there will be, in the words of the four scientists who calculated the outlier number, a “complete market saturation” with HFCs by 2050, which continues as population and air conditioning demand increases to the year 2100. It seems hard to believe that refrigeration technology will be so stagnant. If the same applied to automobiles, all U.S.-built economy cars would be Ford Pintos and Chevrolet Vegas.



The June 4 letter from the Republican Senators projects dramatically increased sales of HVAC equipment as a result of Kigali. Given that the average home unit lasts around 15 years, after that time each replacement will be a much more expensive chiller run on a refrigerant costing ten times as much as what it replaces. Owners, employees, and stockholders of the big HVAC companies will no doubt be very happy with Kigali—and the rest of us, well, not so much. Kigali is a big wealth transfer from the people of the U.S. to Honeywell, Dupont, and big machine producers like Carrier. That’s not exactly Making America Great Again.

During his confirmation hearing last week, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, took a tough stance on Russia, describing it as “a danger to our country,” even as Democrats criticized him for being insufficiently harsh. This is typical in the era of Trump, when those on both sides of the aisle routinely portray Russia as a dire threat to the United States. This bipartisan enmity toward Russia has pushed even Trump, whose rhetoric on the country often vacillates between open hostility and admiration, to adopt reflexively hawkish policies, from purposeless sanctions to nuclear saber rattling.



But rather than altering Russian behavior, these policies are all too often making the situation worse. A more effective Russia policy is possible. It would acknowledge the difficult realities of today’s U.S.-Russian relationship while focusing on both deterrence and reengagement, as needed. Regrettably, it cannot be achieved so long as the United States’ reaction to Russian actions is reflexive hostility and confrontation.



 **The Confrontational Status Quo**



It is not surprising, given Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, that many Americans are hostile to Russia. Although the scope of the interference remains unclear—and the impact questionable—it nonetheless feels like a violation. Yet today’s inflammatory rhetoric is still notable. Former Vice President Joe Biden recently wrote, for example, that “the Russian government is brazenly assaulting the foundations of Western democracy.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has called on Trump to “train his fire on the foreign adversary, Russia, that attacked us.” And Democratic Representative André Carson of Indiana warned of a “new Iron Curtain descending across Europe.”





Even if it proves impossible in the Trump administration to develop a long‐​term strategy for U.S.-Russian relations, today’s focus on hostility is fundamentally counterproductive.



Unfortunately, this threatening rhetoric not only serves to keep tensions high but also produces knee‐​jerk policy responses focused on mindless confrontation. Take last year’s sanctions legislation, theCountering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Although sanctions are rarely effective, the Obama administration’s Russia sanctions were at least narrowly targeted and included clear conditions—notably Russia’s compliance with the Minsk process to end the war in eastern Ukraine—under which they could be removed. CAATSA, in contrast, is largely punitive and offers no clear path for Congress to consider lifting the sanctions, thus providing no incentive for Russia to change its behavior.



The Trump administration, although reticent at first, has also taken confrontational steps in recent months. Some of these steps were clearly justified, such as the expulsion of Russian diplomats in response to the attempted murder in the United Kingdom of a Russian defector using a banned nerve agent. Yet others were far less so. In December, for example, the administration agreed to provide lethal aid to Ukraine—a step the Obama administration had avoided for fear of escalating the conflict there—despite any clear rationale for how it might improve the situation.



The White House’s policy documents have also presented a belligerent stance toward Russia. The National Security Strategy, released in December, describes Russia as one of the “revisionist powers,” listing it as a challenge along with “rogue regimes” such as Iran and North Korea. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, meanwhile, includes provisions for new low‐​yield nuclear weapons and cruise missiles explicitly designed to counter Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Many experts, such as Olga Oliker and Vipin Narang, worry that such weapons may simply make conflict with Russia more likely.



Even the recent strikes on Syria reflected this animosity. The strikes were limited, largely avoided Russian targets, and did not result in escalation. Yet some officials in the administration had argued for broader strikes that would affect Russian assets; the president even went so far as to taunt Russia about potential strikes in tweets. Thankfully, it appears that the more cautious approach advocated by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis prevailed.



 **How to Reengage**



Today’s confrontational rhetoric and policies toward Russia often ignore reality and highlight the need for an alternative approach. A more accurate assessment of Russia today would certainly acknowledge that the country has engaged in belligerent behavior, including repeated attempts at election meddling and violent murders of Russian defectors inside Western countries. It would also recognize Russia’s continued aggression toward its neighbors, including military action in Georgia and Ukraine, and its profoundly undemocratic political system. Yet at the same time, it would affirm that there is an underlying rationale for many of these actions. Some, such as the seizure of Crimea, reflect security concerns—in that case, the need to maintain Russian military bases inside Ukraine. The same can be said of Russia’s development of new nuclear weapons, which is a response to the George W. Bush administration’s decision to withdraw from the Anti‐​Ballistic Missile Treaty, which effectively initiated a new arms race. Domestic politics play a role, too. Russian President Vladimir Putin fears the West’s more open political systems, and he benefits from today’s antagonism, which helps prop up his domestic popularity.



A more realistic U.S. approach to Russia would reflect the limits of what Washington can and cannot achieve and thus define U.S. interests far more narrowly.



Ultimately, a more realistic U.S. approach to Russia would reflect the limits of what Washington can and cannot achieve and thus define U.S. interests far more narrowly. At the most basic level, Washington has a clear interest in preventing Russia from dominating Europe, a possibility that is today so far‐​fetched as to be laughable. Despite the talk of a new Cold War, Russia is not the Soviet Union. The United States also has a clear interest in preventing Russian from meddling in the United States’ domestic politics and in the domestic politics of its closest allies, whether that takes the form of hacking, election meddling, or other violations of sovereignty.



At the same time, the United States also has an interest in avoiding pointless conflict with Russia over states that are simply not that important to U.S. national security, including Syria and Ukraine. Although Washington’s broader stake in regional and global stability may extend to diplomatic or humanitarian engagement in these countries, it is not sufficient to justify military involvement or the risks of inadvertent escalation with Russia. It is unfortunate that in recent years, policymakers in Washington have often construed U.S. interests so broadly as to be meaningless. Instead, they should focus on—and more clearly define—the U.S. interests that are of true concern. This includes maintaining Russian cooperation on key global issues, such as nonproliferation, Iran, and North Korea. The good news is that these narrow interests are actually achievable. By shifting away from confrontational rhetoric and policies, Washington can lower tensions, create effective deterrence on issues of critical importance, and reengage with Russia on topics of mutual interest.



 **A Better Way Forward**



First on Washington’s to‐​do list should be to establish redlines with Russia. One of the biggest problems in U.S.-Russian relations in recent years has been the failure to effectively communicate U.S. interests. There is ambiguity over whether NATO will expand further, whether Washington will respond to cyberattacks, and whether it is willing to go to war to defend non‐​NATO members such as Georgia and Ukraine. A clearer indication of redlines would help deter Russia. Some, such as further meddling in U.S. elections, other violations of U.S. sovereignty, and Russian military action against a NATO treaty ally, are obvious and the crossing of them should be met with a clear response. Other possible redlines will require careful consideration: for example, when does Russian interference in the domestic politics of close allies require a U.S. response?



Violations of these more definite redlines should be met with responses that are not just clear but also flexible and creative. Rather than imposing another pointless round of sanctions or focusing on a military buildup, for example, the United States could react to future election meddling by using its extensive global financial intelligence network to publicly release information implicating key Kremlin figures in corruption. Diplomatic expulsions and financial restrictions on Russian state companies, meanwhile, may be a proportionate and effective response to meddling in the domestic politics of allies. Military options—from troop deployments to arms sales—should always be the last resort.



Second, Washington needs to understand that many of Russia’s actions against Western countries in recent years would not have been possible without the existence of vulnerabilities within the West, whether the increasingly partisan nature of politics in the United States, weak cybersecurity provisions, or a NATO alliance in which members rarely contribute to the common defense. Although some of these problems are easier to fix than others, they nonetheless point to how to shore up U.S. defenses.



Two key problems should be prioritized. Whether through the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or through the congressional intelligence committees, the American people deserve to know the scope and impact of Russian involvement in the 2016 election. A coherent picture of actual events is the only way to move toward effective safeguards against future meddling. At the same time, policymakers should build on recent improvements in NATO members’ military spending to spread the burden of defense more equally. Military spending should not be the only metric here. Washington must push other NATO member states to develop the capacity to contribute to the alliance’s military capabilities, making NATO less a U.S.-led organization and more an alliance of equals.



Finally, U.S. policymakers must try to reengage with Russia; the heated rhetoric of the last few years has seen the virtual dissolution of U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties. This has inhibited the capability of Russia and the United States to resolve crises and work together on mutual interests. The ability of U.S. and Russian diplomats to cooperate on nonproliferation issues, for example, ultimately helped produce the Iran nuclear deal.



North Korea is a key issue for both states; bringing Russia into multinational discussions on North Korea could help with crisis resolution while improving deteriorating U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties. More important, however, is a return to arms control negotiations, because many of the current generation of treaties are failing or are scheduled to lapse soon. The Intermediate‐​Range Nuclear Forces Treaty—of which Russia may today be in violation—offers one such negotiating opportunity, as does the pending expiration of the New START treaty in 2021.



 **A Political Roadblock?**



Ultimately, the key barrier to improving U.S.-Russian relations is political: in the current U.S. domestic climate, the incentives to emphasize hostility are heightened. The Trump administration is motivated to act harshly toward Russia to counteract suspicions tied to the ongoing special counsel investigation, and the president’s opponents find hostility an excellent way to implicate Trump in Russia’s bad behavior.



These incentives have led to an incoherent overall approach to Russia. Just this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announced new sanctions on Russia related to its actions in Syria, a policy that was almost immediately contradicted by the White House. The administration’s approach to Russia appears to be caught in a stalemate between Trump’s more conciliatory impulses and the more hawkish instincts and rhetoric of his advisers and of Congress. Meanwhile, the White House seems to have no plans to prevent or deter future election meddling by Russia.



Yet even if it proves impossible in the Trump administration to develop a long‐​term strategy for U.S.-Russian relations, today’s focus on hostility is fundamentally counterproductive. Policymakers on both sides of the aisle should bear in mind that knee‐​jerk hostility to Russia—whether overblown rhetoric or confrontational policy responses—is likely only to make the situation worse in the long run.

Earlier this week, Vox’s Sean Illing asked 10 law professors whether President Trump’s sweeping refusal to cooperate with congressional investigators has plunged the nation into “a constitutional crisis.” I recommend the article, and I also observe that I’m 100% on Congress’s side regarding the legitimacy of its information queries. Indeed, I’m with my colleague Gene Healy, who has rightfully Tweeted that, “#ExecutivePrivilege is something judges just made up out of penumbras and emanations of Article II.”   
  
  
For this post, however, I argue that congressional oversight, _per se_ , is in its own state of “constitutional crisis” wholly independent from Trump. Specifically, I will make two claims. First, I explain why congressional oversight always has been sub‐​optimal. Then, I explain why contemporary oversight is acutely awful.   
  
  
Even decades ago, when Members of Congress were policy savants relative to now, congressional oversight was known as the body’s “neglected duty.” In a famous 1984 article, Professors Mathew McCubbins and Thomas Schwartz lent a conceptual framework to explain this inadequacy. Their core insight was to identify two types of congressional behavior regarding oversight. The first was the “police patrol,” which describes ongoing monitoring of the law’s execution. The second type was “fire alarm” oversight, by which the professors meant that lawmakers snap to attention only when hot‐​button issues become sufficiently politicized.   
  
  
Quite obviously, the “police patrol” method is superior because, if it is done faithfully, then such supervision could head off the crises that lead to “fire alarms.” Nevertheless, the “fire alarm” approach takes less work, and it reaps more political currency in the form of attention. Due to these incentives, Congress has underinvested in oversight for as long as legislators have delegated power to execute the law.   
  
  
In this manner, oversight was shortchanged in Congress during the first three quarters of the Twentieth Century. Back then, however, a decentralized power structure within the legislature provided a counter‐​incentive for the use of preferable “police patrol” techniques. As I explained in a prior post, Members of that period cared about policy because policy chops were necessary to succeed in Congress. At that time, committees and subcommittees competed with the president to manage administrative agencies, and, as with life generally, competitors do their homework.   
  
  
Starting in the 1980s, however, power in Congress shifted from committees to party leadership. Many factors were at play in causing this change. Crucially, congressional leaders, such as Reps. Tip O’Neil and Newt Gingrich, altered the rules to facilitate centralization. The modernization of mass media played another important role, in that it allowed to party leadership to push a national message. Finally, recurrent impasses with the president over spending and budgets—known as the “fiscalization” of politics—facilitated the centralization of power by creating the necessity for high‐​level negotiations, which, naturally, would be conducted by congressional leaders and thereby enhanced their power accordingly.   
  
  
Due to this shift, partisan affinity now trumps institutional prerogative, such that one party loses interest in oversight whenever “their guy” occupies the White House. Also due to the shift to centralized power, Members of Congress know less about policy‐​making because there’s little incentive to have such knowledge. Each of these factors works to undermine the occasion and performance of “police patrol” superintendence of the administrative state.   
  
  
Yet the current contretemps between Congress and the Trump administration reveals that the legislature’s oversight function has withered further, such that “fire alarm” investigations, too, are falling by the wayside. To be precise, they’ve altered from an inferior form of oversight (relative to “police patrols”) to a worthless form.   
  
  
Historically, “fire alarm” oversight pertained to catastrophes or governing scandals. In either case, the investigatory lodestar was reform. That is, congressional investigations traditionally sought to discern how something bad happened, and then how to try to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Even investigations that don’t easily fit this usual framework—such as Watergate—shared a nexus with governmental reform. Nixon’s excesses inspired institutional responses, including the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the 1977 Legislative Reorganization Act.   
  
  
As I survey the current landscape of fire‐​alarm investigations, I see a qualitatively different application in the present day. When it comes to resource allocation for oversight, I can think of any number of “fire alarms” to sound, including:   




Despite these—and many more—worthy targets for serious congressional oversight by opponents of the Trump administration, House leadership is pouring resources into getting Trump’s tax returns and relitigating the Mueller Report. I find Trump as off‐​putting and dangerous as anyone, but these strike me as the silliest possible subjects for oversight.   
  
  
On the one hand, I think these investigations don’t inform anyone. Who doesn’t think Trump would fire subordinates—and then Tweet about it—to head off an investigation? And who doesn’t think Trump exaggerates his wealth all the time? Notwithstanding these qualities, which are baked into Trump’s brand, the American people elected him president, alas. The upshot is that I’m not convinced that these investigations bring much new to the table.   
  
  
More importantly, I fail to see any prospect for reform. Neither of these investigations bears any relationship to a specific policy outcome. It’s all about Trump, the man, and none about Trump, the policymaker. Nor am I sanguine about the prospect that these investigations ultimately could inspire institutional reforms the way that Watergate did. Well into the third year of this presidency, I have not once seen the democrats reach out to Never‐​Trumpers to explore curbing the power of the office. Instead, the majority in the House seems to want only to damage Trump politically, and otherwise maintain the president’s power for when their party takes control.   
  
  
In sum, I wholeheartedly support Congress’s right to information from President Trump, but I also bemoan its present use of that right.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbsurd PIK construct on the verge of extinction: North American cold spell in January 2014 was not the result of global warming
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated, edited by P Gosselin
Earlier this year the USA was tested by unexpectedly cool temperatures. Die Welt summed up the situation on January 9, 2014:
According to the German Weather Service (DWD) the current cold wave in North America is the harshest in 2 decades. […] The peak of the cold snap was reached on January 6-7 when polar air dipped down to southern USA and Northern Mexico, said a published report by DWD expert Susanne Haeseler and Christina Lefebvre on Thursday. At night temperatures dropped to 30 below zero, and even down to 40 below in Central Canada. In Chicago the high temperature on January 6 was only -25.5°C.” 
If it had been a heat wave, then a connection to the projected climate catastrophe would have been fabricated in short order. However, extreme cold snaps such as this recent one traditionally had been simply played down as “weather and not climate“. But over the last few years it appears a new strategy has been put to use by IPCC scientists: Not only heat waves are a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but now so are cold snaps. A double-pack is always better. And the German end-of-world believers at Klimaretter are always front and centre in this respect (excerpt from 8 January 2014):
Is the icy cold in North America a result of climate change? Indeed the weather pattern that is currently freezing Americans is very unusual. But whether or not this has something to do with global warming is still being controversially discussed by experts.”
Next Klimaretter explains that climate change nailed down the Jet Stream in the atmosphere and that in turn impacted low pressure system “Christina” so much that it was able to intensify over North America. Klimaretter adds:
This is how climate scientist Thomas Jung of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research sees it. “It cannot be dismissed altogether that this situation has something to do with climate change. However, in my opinion the probable explanation is that this situation is a random variability of the atmosphere. It happens sometimes.” Other scientists like Dim Coumou of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research [PIK] see a connection to climate change. The extreme cold waves have become more frequent over the last winters, Coumou told news agency AFP. His explanation: The polar vortex feeds on the temperature difference between the Arctic and the middle latitudes. Because the Arctic is warming faster than average, this temperature difference is decreasing – and with it the strength of the polar vortex. As a result it can break out more easily, says Coumou. However, Thomas Jung of the Alfred Wegener Institute has some doubts: From our research we are able to confirm a connection between the retreat in Arctic sea ice and the colder winters in Europe. This impact however is relatively small and thus in my opinion cannot alone explain such extreme weather events.’ Works from climate scientist Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University indicate that the unusual stability of the Jet Stream can be linked to climate change. Also Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research assumes the same. “The rare temperature pattern is connected to the wild jet stream”, the scientist twittered.”

Klimaretter does allow a few skeptic opinions, but mostly the alarmist blogsite provides an extensive platform for those proposing the Jet Stream blockade. That these are fringe opinions is not at all clear in the Klimaretter article. Most fellow scientists in the field view the ideas of Coumou, Rahmstorf and other PIK scientists with skepticism. There are even opposing, counter publications (see out blog article “Study from Colorado State University contradicts the PIK: retreat of Arctic sea ice does not lead to extreme weather“). Also Judith Curry thinks little of linking US cold snaps to climate change. At her blog Climate Etc. she wrote on January 7, 2014:
Is global warming causing the polar vortex? In a word, no. […] The media are mostly in stupid mode over this one. Cliff Mass provides a good overview, the punch lines:
The bottom line: the claims that greenhouse warming causes more cold waves like we have seen this week really seems to be without any basis in observational evidence or in theory. The media needs to stop pushing this unsupported argument. It is SO frustrating that every major weather event causes such claims and counterclaims to be aired, with many media outlets unable to do the minimal research that would allow them to give the public more dependable information. All this bogus reporting has done substantial damage, with many American’s believing that global warming is already causing our winter weather to become more extreme, while the observational evidence suggests no such thing. One day some sociologists will study this situation and the psychological elements that drove it.”
So is the Jet Stream today really flowing more slowly than it did in former times? A team from the University of Reading and the British Antarctic Survey lead by Tim Woolings published an analysis of the Jet Stream’s development in the North Atlantic over the past 140 years in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society in August 2013. The result was clear: The Jet Stream escapades today are no different then in the past. The current behavior is completely within the range of known natural variability. In the paper’s abstract Woolings and his colleagues write:
When viewed in this longer term context, the variations of recent decades do not appear unusual and recent values of jet latitude and speed are not unprecedented in the historical record.”
Also Italian meteorologist Guido Guidi was not able to discover any long-term trend in an analysis of data over the last 66 years. Moreover climate models are still unable to reproduce the polar vortex, so reported Horwitz et al. 2009. Interestingly Veretenenko and Ogurtsov (in print) have even found a relationship between the development of the polar vortex and fluctuations in solar activity. Curiously, in 1974, Time Magazine interpreted similar polar vortices as being the result of global cooling.

Climategate was the term quickly applied in 2009 to the mysterious appearance on the internet of large numbers of emails and documents belonging to some of the world’s leading climate scientists.
This happened just a month before the Copenhagen climate change conference, which failed to meet the expectations of many for agreement on international action. The timing may not be coincidental.
For some climate change sceptics, the emails were a disturbing revelation of the real thoughts and manoeuvrings of scientists at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Centre and their international colleagues. The scientists argue that while some of the phrasing may have been unfortunate, there is nothing in the documents to undermine the validity of mainstream climate science.
Climategate certainly inflamed the debate over climate change, in the UK, the US and elsewhere.
In 2012 the Norfolk Police announced they were abandoning their investigation into who hacked into the university’s computer and then distributed what they found.
But what have been the longer-term consequences of this incident, for public opinion, media reporting and international policy-making on climate change? Chris Vallance investigates, asking if this was it a political crime, and, if so, how effective has it been?

From the Oh noes, we’re almost doomed department:
For the first time in roughly 5 million years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere could top 400 parts per million in the Northern Hemisphere next month.
Full story at USA Today. 
What Doyle Rice is writing about is this Tweet from Scripps:



399.72 parts per million CO2 in air
April 25, 2013
http://t.co/5Q2FLbb4ix
— Keeling_Curve (@Keeling_curve) April 26, 2013

Interesting how a single Tweet can become an entire news story, especially since Mauna Loa data still has a ways to go. It’s almost as if Doyle can’t wait for this to happen.
Expect a plethora of gloom and doom stories next month or maybe the month after when MLO hits 400.
 
Note that the seasonally corrected trend number has a ways to go and Doyle in his article cites the unofficial number, not yet released, and often corrected later:
As of Tuesday, the reading was 398.44 ppm as measured at Mauna Loa.
At Scripps, they are already gearing up for the announcement, trying to visualize what 400 PPM looks like. Apparently, it looks like a fossil skull (see their story below). For the average person, they won’t notice anything, pre 400 CO2 will look exactly to them like post 400 CO2, and just like the Y2K bug, it is nothing more than a number, and nothing will happen when that threshold is crossed. Though, if there is any severe weather anywhere in the world within that month, you can bet some fool (like Joe Romm) will try to link the two events.
From Scripps:




What Does 400 ppm Look Like?


April 25, 2013 



As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, scientists look back four million years for answers on what to expect from climate
The Pliocene is the geologic era between five million and three million years ago. Scientists have come to regard it as the most recent period in history when the atmosphere’s heat-trapping ability was as it is now and thus as our guide for things to come.
Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
As for what life was like then, scientists rely on fossil records to recreate where plants and animals lived and in what quantity. Pliocene fossil records show that the climate was generally warmer and wetter than today.  Maps of Pliocene vegetation record forests growing on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, and savannas and woodlands spreading over what is now North African desert. Both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were smaller than today during the warmest parts of the Pliocene. 

In the oceans, fossils mark the spread of tropical and subtropical marine life northward along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.  Both observations and models of the Pliocene Pacific Ocean show the existence of frequent, intense El Niño cycles—a climatic oscillation that today delivers heavy rainfall to the western U.S. causing both intense flooding but also increasing the river flows needed to sustain salmon runs. The absence of significant ocean upwelling in the warmest part of the Pliocene would have suppressed fisheries along the west coasts of the Americas, and deprived seabirds and marine mammals of food supplies.  Reef corals suffered a major extinction during the peak of Pliocene warmth but reefs themselves did not disappear.
Richard Norris, a geologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, said the concentration of CO2 is one means of comparison, but what is not comparable, and more significant, is the speed at which 400 ppm is being surpassed today.
“I think it is likely that all these ecosystem changes could recur, even though the time scales for the Pliocene warmth are different than the present,” Norris said.  “The main lagging indicator is likely to be sea level just because it takes a long time to heat the ocean and a long time to melt ice. But our dumping of heat and CO2 into the ocean is like making investments in a pollution ‘bank,’ since we can put heat and CO2 in the ocean, but we will only extract the results (more sea-level rise from thermal expansion and more acidification) over the next several thousand years.  And we cannot easily withdraw either the heat or the CO2 from the ocean if we actually get our act together and try to limit our industrial pollution–the ocean keeps what we put in it.”
Scientists can analyze the gases trapped in ice to reconstruct with high accuracy what climate was like in prehistory, but that record only goes back 800,000 years. It is trickier to estimate carbon dioxide levels before then, but in 2009, one research team reported finding evidence of carbon dioxide levels ranging between 365 and 415 ppm roughly 4.5 million years ago. They based their finding on the analysis of carbon isotopes present in compounds made by tiny marine phytoplankton preserved in ancient ocean sediments.
That estimate made Earth’s last experience of 400 ppm a much more recent event than scientists have commonly thought. There has been broader consensus that carbon dioxide concentrations have been much higher than today’s but not for tens of millions of years. The assertion that Earth passed the 400 ppm mark a mere 4.5 million years ago has been supported by other analyses, many of which also concluded that the temperatures at that time were higher than previously estimated.  These studies suggest that the traditional way scientists currently rate Earth’s long-term sensitivity to extra doses of CO2 might not sufficiently take into account the slower effects of climate change on the sunlight-absorbing properties of the planet, such as ice sheet melt and changes in plant cover on land.
What that means is that Earth might react even more strongly to the increases in CO2 measured by the Keeling Curve. Several prominent questions remain to be answered, though, before accurate scenarios can be created. The extreme speed at which carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing is unprecedented. An increase of 10 parts per million might have needed 1,000 years or more to come to pass during ancient climate change events. Now the planet is poised to reach the 1,000 ppm level in only 100 years if emissions trajectories remain at their present level.
“Our grandchildren will inhabit a radically altered planet, as the ocean gradually warms up in response to the buildup of heat-trapping gases,” said Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego geoscientist Jeff Severinghaus.

However, the question was not, “How to wreck an economy?” The question was about dealing with the climate crisis. Since this answer was proposed by Billy Fleming, a US landscape architect, we had better sit up and take notice.



Safeguarding New Zealand against the devastating impact of climate change could mean seizing the means of production.



US landscape architect Billy Fleming has a radical vision for the country’s future if it’s going to survive rising sea levels and extreme weather, and it involves the dreaded s-word: socialism.



Billy, the landscaper, is obviously a bright lad:



“So much of Auckland is right up against the water and on fill, so a lot of the terrain is quite soft. You’re probably going to need walls.”



Holland keeps the rising seas at bay through the use of dikes and drainage canals along the Dutch coastline, but Auckland will require more robust structures including pumps to drain seawater when it encroaches on the city.



The strong implication from that statement is that the Dutch system simply drains into the sea whereas Auckland will need pumps. Since about one-third of the Netherlands is below sea level and a great chunk of Rotterdam is 5m below sea level, it is clear to anyone with a brain that any water will not drain away on its own. The Dutch have been pumping water for centuries.



Remind me not to get Billy to design a garden water feature.



Poor Billy really is a little short on facts:



You’re not in the position Australia or Canada are where they have lots of land you can imagine people moving to as sea levels encroach. That process in other places will be incredibly expensive and politically fraught and hard, but they have the option of thinking about that. 



Have a look at the map, Billy.



Should all your doom come to pass, there appears to be plenty of land to live on.



For Fleming, socialism is inextricable from the issue of climate change. Capitalism, with its relentless growth demanding more and more of the Earth’s resources, is inherently incompatible with sustained human life. Things need to change, and they need to change fast.



“We’re going to have to do a whole lot of things really quickly, faster than we’ve ever done them, better designed than ever, and we’re going to have to balance that with a very real need to make sure there’s deliberation and public ownership over that process,” he says.



“Part of that means discarding the idea that markets can solve all of these problems for us, which is not a radical statement at all in most parts of the world, but in the United States is something that gets you thrown out of rooms.”



The thing about capitalism is that it also drives efficiency. Equivalent vehicles now are far more fuel-efficient than they were twenty years ago. Many previous ‘luxury’ food items are now available every day at the local supermarket. Clothes can be supplied more cheaply and so on.



Obviously there are some abuses, like child sweatshops, that need to be eliminated but the bald fact remains that socialism has never ever worked anywhere. 



It would be a wonderful service to humanity if all the socialism advocates took themselves off to Venezuela to show the locals how to ‘do socialism’ properly, while the rest of us got one with allowing capitalism to make our lives and our environment better. 



Haiti (left) has per capita GDP of around $US 760. They chop down the forest to make charcoal for heat and cooking. Dominican Republic (right) has a per capita GDP of just over $US 7,000, they do not need to use the forest as an energy source.



It may be simplistic but it seems that the wealthier a nation, the more money it can spend on cleaning up and caring for the environment.



I prefer the capitalist idea of having lights at night time.



Don’t ever forget what one of the originators of the IPCC said back in 2010:



Basically, it is a big mistake to discuss climate policy apart from the big issues of globalization.   
The climate summit in Cancún at the end of the month is not a climate conference but one of the biggest business conferences since the Second World War. […]  
  
But one has to say clearly: we are effectively redistributing world wealth through climate policy. 



Billy is correct, the end goal of climate alarmism is Socialism.

For more than a decade, the Heartland Institute has tried to explain to the public, in courteous terms, that the idea of a human-caused global warming catastrophe is a delusion, and that its proponents should not be allowed to waste the world’s economic resources through arrogant efforts to alter the planet’s climate.
Tim Ball, Ph.D., takes up the issue with strong words in his new book, The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science. He argues, with overwhelming evidence, that in fact the global warming debate in the halls of science has been an unmitigated fraud perpetrated by people who no longer have the right to be called scientists.

"MANILA  —   A fire raced through a squalid Manila shantytown teeming with people on Tuesday night, as residents armed only with buckets of water tried to fight the inferno. As day broke on Wednesday, more than 15, 000 people found themselves homeless, bereft of their few worldly possessions and forced to sleep on the Philippine capital’s streets. “It spread fast across the neighboring homes made of light materials,” said Wilberto Tiu, Manila’s fire chief. “Firemen had trouble reaching the area because of small alleyways,” Mr. Tiu said of the warren of closely built homes, some constructed of no more than plywood and scrap metal. He said the alleys between homes were too narrow for fire trucks. Residents tried to outrun the blaze, grabbing whatever they could carry: pots and pans, family pets, washing machines and electric fans. Dozens of people were injured in the stampede, but miraculously, officials said, no one was killed. The blaze had been brought under control by Wednesday morning. Fires in the country’s slums are a regular occurrence. About 1, 200 families were left without homes in January after a fire in Navotas, a suburb of Manila. Residents of shantytowns are at particular risk in the months of February and March, as the weather warms and the rains stop, officials said. In March 2015, more than 7, 000 families were left homeless when a blaze tore through the same slum, Parola Compound, near the capital’s main port. In 2014, the homes of at least 2, 500 families in the slum were destroyed in a predawn blaze. Investigators said they believed Tuesday’s blaze was caused by faulty electrical wiring or a malfunctioning gas stove. By Wednesday morning, hundreds of families were left to sleep on the street, some at a makeshift shelter at a covered basketball court, disaster officials said. Television footage showed children sleeping on sidewalks along streets near the slum, as health workers distributed food and other supplies."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
About a year and a half ago, we were co‐​authors (along with Dr. Oliver Frauenfeld from Texas A&M University) on a paper published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research_ in which we presented a nearly 225‐​year reconstruction of surface snow melt across Greenland (Figure 1).   
  
  
Our reconstruction was based on long‐​term temperature records from the southern Greenland coast along with historic indicators of the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. We found that in addition to the period since about the year 2000, there was an extended (multi‐​decadal) period in the early portion of the 20th century where the amount of surface snowmelt was elevated above the long‐​term average. We concluded from this that since there did not appear to be a large increase in the rate of global sea level rise during the early 20th century period of elevated ice melt—a melt driven primarily by warmer than normal temperatures—that Greenland’s contribution to global sea level rise during the current period of high temperatures was likely to remain relatively “modest,” at least for the next few decades.   






Figure 1. Reconstructed history of the total ice melt extent index over Greenland, 1784–2009. Observed values of the ice melt index (blue solid circles), reconstructed values of the ice melt index (gray open circles), the 10 year trailing moving average through the reconstructed and fitted values (thick red line), and the 95% upper and lower confidence bounds (thin gray lines) (from Frauenfeld et al., 2011).   
  
  
Neither our methods, nor or findings were overly controversial—or so we thought.   
  
  
Shortly after our paper was published, one of the reviewers of our paper, a noted snow/​ice researcher who has spent a lot of time studying Greenland, Dr. Jason Box, came forwarded and denounced our work. On his blog (in posts he has subsequently removed), he attacked our work both from a scientific standpoint as well as deriding it with a few _ad hominems_ (for example “Examining the 2nd [Knappenberger] and 3rd [Michaels] authors’ credentials, a climate change denialist pattern emerges”).   
  
  
On both accounts we felt he was wrong (of course) and offered a rebuttal.   
  
  
But perhaps the strongest argument that our results were scientifically sound comes from an ironic source—the results of new research findings from Jason Box himself!   
  
  
These new findings from Box, although not yet fully available, have been incorporated into another research project that has recently been published (Gregory et al., 2012) and thus we can get a sneak peek at them.   
  
  
The solid black line in Figure 2 (below) shows Box’s reconstruction of the sea level rise contribution from Greenland back into since the mid‐​1800s.   






Figure 2. Various estimates of the time series of the Greenland ice‐​sheet mass contribution to global‐​mean sea‐​level rise. The reconstructions are plotted as ten‐​year running time‐​means of the sea‐​level equivalent of the rate of change of mass of the Greenland ice‐​sheet with respect to the mean of 1961–1990. The solid black line, labeled “B” is the net mass balance, including both surface mass balance and ice discharge from Jason Box. The horizontal dotted line indicates zero. The vertical lines indicate the years in which major volcanic eruptions occurred (from Gregory et al., 2012).   
  
  
Notice the strong resemblance of Box’s reconstruction of the sea level contribution from Greenland with our reconstruction of the surface snow melt across Greenland. The snow melt/​sea level contribution is currently very high, was relatively low in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, was high from the mid‐​1920s through the late 1960s, and was lower in the 1800s.   
  
  
Considering that there are other factors besides snowmelt (like snow accumulation and calving glaciers) that contribute to Greenland’s net contributions to sea level rise, the two curves are remarkably similar. This is a strong indication that whatever is driving snowmelt (regional temperature) is also driving the net sea level contribution.   
  
  
All of which we wrote in our paper:   




This record of ice melt indicates that the melt extent observed since the late 1990s is among the highest likely to have occurred since the late 18th century, although recent values are not statistically different from those common during the period 1923–1961, a period when summer temperatures along the southern coast of Greenland were similarly high as those experienced in recent years. Our reconstruction indicates that if the current trend toward increasing melt extent continues, total melt across the Greenland ice sheet will exceed historic values of the past two and a quarter centuries   
  
  
…The forces acting in concert with ice melt across Greenland to produce higher global sea levels currently, should also have been acting during the extended high‐​melt conditions from the mid‐​1920s to the early 1960s.



And we also added this concerning the significance of Greenland’s contribution to the total global sea level rise:   




[T]here is no indication that the increased contribution from the Greenland melt in the early to mid 20th century, a roughly 40 year interval when average annual melt was more or less equivalent to the average of the most recent 10 years (2000–2009), resulted in a rate of global sea level rise that exceeded ~mm/​yr. This suggests that Greenland’s contribution to global sea level rise, even during multidecadal conditions as warm as during the past several years, is relatively modest.



Figure 3 (anther figure from the new paper from Gregory et al., 2012) shows the breakdown of the factors contributing to the global rise in sea level of the past century and a half. Greenland’s contribution (based on Box’s reconstruction) is the pale green line (labeled “Greenland‐​B” in the legend). I think it is pretty fair to characterize this as “modest.”   






Figure 3. Observational (black) and a reconstructed (red) time series of global mean sea‐​level rise (thick lines, with 5–95% observational uncertainty shaded), also showing the contributions to the latter (thin lines), identified by the time series initials in the key (from Gregory et al., 2012).   
  
  
Why was such a big deal was made about our research results and “denialist” credentials when subsequent results, made by the very person who went _ad hominem_ , completely replicate our findings?

Somewhere, weepy Bill McKibben is weeping and Al Gore is raging, because they won’t be able to say “2012, the hottest year ever, caused more tornadoes” So much for “dirty weather” Heh.
The NOAA Storm Prediction Center just updated their 2012 tornado count graph to the end of November. While the year is not over, the average number of 25 tornadoes expected in December (or lower if the below normal trend holds) would suggest that 2012 will end with well below normal tornado activity.
NOAA SPC’s Greg Carbin writes:
After a busy start, tornado events in the U.S. in 2012 have dropped well below the expected norm. The preliminary total of 886 tornadoes through 30 November 2012 is nearly 400 tornadoes below what might be expected in a “normal” year.


The chart above shows that at this time in 2011, the annual running total was about 400 tornadoes *above* normal; a mirror opposite of 2012.
The chart is meant to depict the dramatic variability that can occur in tornado numbers from one year to the next. On average about 25 tornadoes occur during the month of December based on data from the last 30 years. Click for full image or see the detailed written summary to date below.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWillis Eschenbach is starting to remind me of Michael Mann, the global-warming obsessed alarmist who tries to destroy everyone while crying like a little sissy as soon as someone criticizes back. Willis commented here:
Finally, attacking me for what I said, without using my name and without quoting what I said? Really? Is this your idea of proper behavior?”
Right Willis, you’re just the right guy to tell us what proper behavior and attacks are. Please spare us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski at the online Spiegel writes a report on the warming stop, reaffirming that it indeed has stopped for 16 years. But at the same time the article says, citing NASA, we that could  see a record warm 2014. The heat is out there, somewhere.
Interestingly, Spiegel now says it’s the atmosphere near the surface that has paused, and not the globe or climate. 10 years ago, on the other hand, atmospheric warming was called global warming.
More than 97% of all models are wrong
The big questions is why the near-surface atmosphere has not warmed like all the models said it would. Spiegel writes:
Computer models did not predict the development. Only three of 114 climate simulations have correctly shown the trend of the last years, summed up the UNIPCC in September in its fifth assessment report.”
A variety of possible explanations
The reason for the pause, Spiegel writes, is unknown. Spiegel describes 5 different reasons: 1) drying out of the upper atmospheric layers, 2) Pacific oscillations, 3) weak solar activity, 4) increased levels of aerosols and 5) well, warming hasn’t really stopped – a gap in Arctic data is concealing the warming.
And in almost every case, data are sorely lacking and so no sound conclusions can be drawn. This is the state of the science that scientists claim is more than 95% certain. We notice that all the warming still remains hidden in model projections, oceans and missing data. They tell us it’s there, but they just haven’t measured it yet.

NASA moves the goal posts to 30 years 
Spiegel then cites NASA in claiming that 16 years are not enough after all, and that at least 30 years are needed.
Temperature developments over a few years are in any case not sufficient to establish a trend says NASA: Data from at least 30 years are necessary.
Will 2014 be hottest ever?
Next Spiegel writes about NASA’s prediction that 2014 may be the globe’s hottest year ever, but that it depends on the ENSO. Spiegel writes:
A new El Niño could put 2014 at the top, NASA explained – also the 16-year temperature trend could once again head upwards.”
That makes perfect sense: 16 years is not a trend, but one single year can make a whole new warming trend!
Overall it was an overly warmist article from the somewhat usually a bit more skeptical Bojanowski. The editorial desk must be pressuring him.

"Donna Hubbard, a flight attendant who lives outside Atlanta, has no problem speaking forcefully about the issue of human trafficking in the United States. But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life  —   how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. “For many years, I couldn’t talk about being an addict,” she said. “I couldn’t talk about being imprisoned. I couldn’t talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. ” She paused to fight back tears. “I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. ” But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. “We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the   personnel,” Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year  —   the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a   partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris’s chief executive. “We don’t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we’re learning about more cases, the crime is increasing,” Mr. Myles said. “It’s actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. ” Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being “bought and sold, traded and bartered. ” “Usually, the traffickers play on people’s ignorance and naïveté,” she said. “Traffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. ” That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will  —   often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to a traveling companion. American Airlines, Ms. Rivard’s former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American’s employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines’ existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. “It doesn’t cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training” from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. “It was an amazing event,” Ms. Hubbard said. “I give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. ” Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence  —   from Polaris or elsewhere  —   to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. “We don’t think it’s useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time,” Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department’s vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. “We had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place,” Captain Harris said. “The only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. ” While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. “If someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane,” she said. “So it is my responsibility to make sure that these people  —   whose lives are in my hands while they’re on board my aircraft  —   are safe. ”"

My wife and I were in Moscow in early April. With temperatures of -50 C, there was no sign of spring. This continuing winter freeze reflected the mood of most of the participants at the annual international academic conference organised by the Higher School of Economics, which I had come to attend. With Putin set to rule for another 12 years, what are Russia’s prospects?



Though high oil prices have shored up Russia’s fiscal and current account balances at this time, and allowed GDP growth to pick up to about five per cent in the last quarter, the economic development minister, Elvira Nabiullina, warned of a quick drop to two to three per cent if Russia continues to be a resource‐​dependent economy, with unreformed institutions and a hostile business climate. And the deputy chairman of Russia’s central bank, Alexei Ulyukayev, saw inflation accelerating from the current 3.7 per cent to five to six per cent by the end of the year.



Even this downgrading of Russia’s short‐ to medium‐​term prospects was seen as too rosy by former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, who argued that the sovereign wealth fund he had set up to channel Russian resource rents was being raided for various populist handouts to counter dissent — and if oil and gas prices fell, Russia would not be able to manage the resultant fiscal and balance of payments crises. There was a consensus that, unless Russia weaned itself off its natural resource‐​led, statist growth model, its future prospects looked bleak.



This is underlined by the growing emigration of Russia’s skilled youth and increased capital flight (private sector net capital outflows in the first three months of 2012 were $35 billion compared to $20 billion in first quarter of 2011). The dismal condition of Russian business was underlined in a remarkable paper by a brave lawyer, Vladimir Radchenko, (the first deputy chairman of the supreme court, 1989–2008). He claimed that the Soviet mode of justice still continues. There are three million small‐ and medium‐​scale business entrepreneurs in jail for economic crimes. He contrasted this with conditions during the 1920s’ New Economic Policy when the share of output from small and medium enterprises in GDP was about the same as today — however, at the time, not only were there few listed economic crimes, but the punishment for them was a fine, not imprisonment. By contrast, today, ordinary profit‐​making has been criminalised. This lack of the rule of law has led Russian oligarchs to register their companies abroad, fight their legal battles in London, and move their assets and families to the West.



Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox Church has resumed its promotion of Caesaropapism (“render unto Caesar not only what is Caesar’s but also God’s”). This deviant Christian doctrine had prompted Vladimir, the ruler of the Kievan state (the precursor of the Russian empire), to choose the Greek over the Latin Church. This doctrine has underwritten the autocratic Russian state ever since. Not only did the Moscow Patriarch urge his flock to vote for Putin, calling his rule a “miracle of God”, but he was caught in a photoshopping scandal when he tried to doctor a published photograph showing him wearing a $30,000 Breguet watch, purportedly a gift from Putin.



What then of civil society and the middle‐​class protests after the Duma elections which rattled Putin? They are part of a 200‐​year‐​old tradition when Russia’s intellectuals and literary figures come out of their cafes and salons onto the streets to fight an oppressive state apparatus, and then at the first whiff of grapeshot rush back. The anti‐​Putin protests followed the same pattern. Then why have they rattled the President‐​elect?



In a recent biography, Masha Gessen ( _The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin_ , Granta) delves into whatever is known about Putin’s past and his motives. She describes him as growing up in a shabby flat, fierce and vengeful in street fights and dreaming to join the KGB. Having returned home 10 years after his dream was fulfilled, he unexpectedly found himself the _de facto_ Tsar of Russia. He used the art of secrecy learnt from his time in the KGB to control personal information and create his own myth. Putin, argues Gessen, wants to “turn the country into a supersize model of the KGB, where there can be no room for dissent or even independent actors”.



In a remarkable article in _The Moscow Times_ (April 4), Yulia Latynina, a radio talk‐​show host, reports on Putin’s plan to create a 400,000-strong personal National Guard; an institution adopted by dictators in West Asia and South America, where a working‐​class man’s best option was to join the Presidential Praetorian guard, unconnected to the army or the police: the Haitian President “Papa Doc” Duvalier’s infamous Tonton Macoutes being the most sinister example.



Putin wants his Praetorian Guard, as the siloviki — who were supposed to break up anti‐​government demonstrations in return for the freedom to extort, steal and kill — turned out to be unreliable, only turning out on the street with pay rises. Russia’s Federal Security Service, FSB, is more interested in its lucrative side businesses than the thankless task of dealing with street protests. On the other hand, the inefficient army, starved of resources because of Putin’s fear of a _putsch,_ is incapable of guarding Putin from the mob. The Nashi youth groups from depressed towns around Moscow, bussed in for pro‐​government demonstrations and to break up those against the government, turned out to be more interested in drinking and partying at the government’s expense. Hence a National Guard of young men without any chance of a career in the stagnant economy. It will protect the ruling elite from public anger at its siphoning off of the country’s petrodollars abroad and curtailing freedom.



Clearly, Russia will have to wait for its Spring.

"**A polythene bag manufacturer has been left with seven million items of personal protective equipment (PPE) after being ""dropped like a stone"", it has claimed.**
Polythene UK started making the aprons during the first lockdown.
Managing director James Woollard said its orders were cancelled ""overnight"" leaving it in a ""horrendous"" situation.
But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said huge global demand had created a ""highly competitive market"".
Mr Woollard said the Witney-based company supplied the PPE packed loose, and was dropped once the NHS could get hold of PPE on a roll.
He said it was also impacted by cheaper PPE from overseas.
Mr Woollard first had the idea to start making aprons when orders for his regular products stopped during lockdown.
The company adapted a design used to make jackets for lambs, and soon had orders of 1.2 million.
He said: ""We started manufacturing these things as fast as we could.""
The company made 30 million items of PPE in total, but demand suddenly fell.
It has since given away a million items to care homes for free.
The company has already lost Â£160,000 because of the project, with pallets of PPE stockpiled ""as far as the eye can see"".
Mr Woollard said: ""We naively thought that because we were there when the pandemic hit that these guys would be there to help usâ¦ [but there was] no warning at all.""
Ian Hudspeth, leader of Oxfordshire County Council, called the situation ""unfortunate"".
He said: ""It's disappointing that he has been left with all this supply because he changed his production so he was able to step up and manufacture aprons which were massively needed at the time.""
A DHSC spokesperson said it received an ""extraordinary response"" to its call for PPE and ""all offers were prioritised based on volume, price, quality and lead time, with proper due diligence carried out on contracts"".

Cryosphere Today – Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois – Click the pic to view at sourceAt the blog “sunshine hours” it seems the Antarctic has set a new record. He writes:
As you may know, I have been using Cryosphere’s Antarctic Sea Ice Area data to show the record levels of Antarctic Sea Ice.
But I just found another data set, NOAA’s Sea Ice Extent here. (thanks to commenter HaroldW at the Blackboard)
And it turns out day 265 set an all time record, and then day 266 (Sept 22nd) broke that record. Days 265 through 270 are now the 6 highest Antarctic Sea Ice Extent’s of all time (in the satellite record)!

11 of the top 15 extents are now in 2012.
Anyone wonder why NOAA isn’t making a fuss about this?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt turns out that because of the emissions of extraordinarily potent greenhouse gases NF3 and SF6 and energy during the manufacture of solar modules, solar energy ends up being worse for the climate than burning coal (assuming the global warming hypothesis is valid).
A Swiss engineer has made a thorough analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacture, transport and operation of solar panels. His conclusion:
Solar energy in Germany is climate killer no. 1!” 
Ferrucio Ferroni writes here how China is the number 1 manufacturer of solar panels globally and that the production of solar panels there requires immense amounts of electricity, which in China is mainly produced by coal power plants. Moreover the manufacture of solar panels also involves substantial amounts of potent greenhouse gases that leak out into the atmosphere.
The result Ferroni writes:
The comparison on CO2 emissions of a modern coal power plant and that of a PV system shows that per kilowatt-hour of power produced, PV systems damage the climate more. This statement is true if the hypothesis of the IPCC is correct to start with.”
Ferroni writes that it is accepted as fact the coal power plants emit carbon dioxide. But what is little known is that PV systems also lead to the emission of considerable quantities greenhouse gases – not during their operation, but during their manufacture.
Ferroni writes that when calculating the climate impacts of PV systems per unit, it is first necessary to account for the energy used in their manufacture in China, which involves the processing of solar silizium. Silizium processing involves considerable amounts of chemicals and raw materials. Also the manufacture of peripheral systems and their subsequent transport of materials to Europe and North America and their modest outputs in many northern locations have to be taken into account.
In comparison, modern steam power plants using clean-coal-technology now reach an efficiency of 52%, which means they emit 846 grams of CO2 per kWh when powered with stone coal (heat value: 30 MJ/kg). Moreover, nowadays highly efficient filters keep dust emissions to a minimum.
Producing 1 square meter requires 300 kg of coal
The manufacture of the silizium for the panels is immensely energy-intensive. According to Prof. Jian Shuisheng of the Jiatong-University in Peking, one square meter of solar module production requires more than 300 kg of coal, which leads to more than 1100 kg of CO2 emissions.
Also the production in China of peripheral systems for PV systems, like frequency converters, batteries, copper cable, switches, instruments etc., require fossil energy. According to literature this is estimated to be an additional 13%. Thus so far the emission for one square meter of solar module now adds up to 1243 kg CO2.
Potent gases needed for manufacturing solar modules

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




According to Ferroni, the other huge drawback presented by PV systems are the nasty chemicals and industrial gases used for their manufacture. The production of solar panels in China entails nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are extremely potent heat-trapping gases that leak out during the process. NF3 has a greenhouse gas potency that is 16,600 times greater than CO2; SF6 is 23,900 times more potent. Reports show that these gases emitted annually into the atmosphere from the manufacture of solar panels is equivalent to over 70 million tonnes of CO2 in terms of greenhouse effect. In 2010 over 17.5 GW of rated capacity of solar cells were installed. Thus the emissions per square meter of solar panels comes out to be 513 kg CO2 – a huge amount!
Other chemicals in the production process
The manufacture of solar cells also uses other chemicals like (HCl), silizium carbide, and silver among others. The total alleged warming potential of these chemicals comes out to be an estimated 30 kg CO2 per square meter of PV module. Oddly (likely to avoid embarrassment) the solar industry has yet to release any detailed data on the warming potential and impacts of the chemicals used in their manufacture.
Emissions-intensive transport 
Also the transport of the PV systems and modules represent a considerable source of emissions. Ferroni writes that the transport of the systems from China to Germany results in 23 kg CO2 per square meter of solar module, more than what is used to transport coal from South Africa to Europe.
In total 1809 kg of CO2 equivalent is emitted into the atmosphere per square meter of solar panel manufactured and transported.
Ferroni then calculates that over the entire lifetime of a solar panel (25 years) one square meter will produce a total 2000 kwh in Germany. But then there are losses from conversions and so the real value is closer to 1850 kWh.
Over the entire lifetime and taking all factors into account, Ferroni finds that each kwh of electricity produced by solar modules emits 978g of CO2. How does this compare to coal? Ferroni:
In comparison, a modern coal power plant emits 846 g CO2/kWh, i.e. about 13% less. As a result, under German conditions, PV modules are the no. 1 climate killers. By comparison a gas power plant is more advantageous because its CO2 emissions are about half as much: approx.: 400g CO2/kWh.”

 **Manurewa-Papakura ward**



 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



I’m a Manurewa native myself having grown up in Wattle Downs until moving to Mt. Roskill aged 14. Started school at St. Annes Primary School. Their carelessness in permitting space and dinosaur books in the library ensured I was an atheist by the time First Communion was due. I attended Manurewa Intermediate and then spent Years 9 and 10 at James Cook High School. Apparently it wasn’t a great school at the time but I can’t say I noticed. I also played cricket for Weymouth for 4 seasons which I willingly admit to being crap at. Top figures of 20 runs and 3-14 attained in the season I was placed in a team 3 grades below my age group.  
  
Manurewa-Papakura ward has been poorly served since the 2010 amalgamation, by representatives that supported Len Brown and his 9.9% rates increase or who slept through meetings. That started to change in 2016…



There are six candidates contesting this two member ward. Daniel Newman of Manurewa-Papakura Action Team is the only incumbent.



 **[Angela Dalton](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=709e9c5b-30c4-43e2-9193-f401c4890f91&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)** – Manurewa-Papakura Action Team **$$$$**



Angela has been well known and enormously popular figure in South Auckland politics for quite some time, having topped the polls for Manurewa Local board in 2016 and 2013. The 2010 results are a bit more difficult to find. Her leadership has been competent and firm, though that hasn’t been without controversy in this year’s local board contest.



Manurewa has its own [particular challenges](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/01/manurewa-locals-forced-to-live-with-stench-from-rubbish-filled-property-for-months.html) with illegal rubbish dumping and escalating numbers of [homeless rough sleepers](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12248737), but they’re issues that Angela’s chairmanship has excelled in dealing with. Other successes resulting from Dalton’s time on the Manurewa Local Board include opening the Manurewa Sports Centre, the recovery of Netball Manurewa at Browns Road and the transformation of Riverton Reserve in Randwick Park.



A playground at Randwick Park was completed in April of this year. While Jacinda Ardern has allowed school children to influence Government policy on climate change and banning plastic bags, Manurewa Local Board were a bit smarter, giving children from Randwick Park School the opportunity to design 3D models of what they wanted the playground to look like. It includes a Kuzebo structure, a rocktopus and a flying fox.



With Councillor Daniel Newman, Angela Dalton and the local community successfully put a stay on the repurposing of a Oranga Tamariki care and protection facility into a youth justice residence. There had been no prior consultation of the local community on having the facility in a residential area and taking the Ministry of Children to court was a win for local residents.



I don’t always see eye to eye with Angela on some issues. Her wowserish campaigns against on-license bars and new liquor stores have been very effective, no doubt pleasing existing liquor retailers who have fewer competitors to deal with. Recently a proposed upmarket sports bar in the former Manurewa RSA premises has been blocked from opening, one of many businesses prevented and jobs not created. 



There are a lot of candidates making wild promises to voters that they simply cannot achieve. The complexity of the Council’s functions makes it difficult for voters to know just what candidates can actually deliver and many of the candidates themselves either exploit this confusion for votes or simply don’t know themselves. Angela knows exactly how local government works and isn’t shy about[ truthfully communicating ](https://www.facebook.com/daltonmanurewa/posts/2380594881989952)what can or can’t be done to voters.



[ **Karin Kerr**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=ecbe9701-17b6-413d-b157-3cc1954be165&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Independent **$$**



Kerr’s candidate profile is very brief and contains little to inspire. No signs and a sad statement to accompany voting papers don’t fill me with optimism at her chances. I’d have left it at that and moved on, but there are people in the ward who have insisted I look a bit closer.



Karin Kerr is a property manager and the founder of Homestar Rentals. This is her first attempt at local body politics and she is running a low budget campaign. Working in the rental market brings with it knowledge and abilities that complement being a local representative. I’m advised that there is a grassroots buzz that is growing but I have no way of verifying that.  
  
Maybe in three years.



[ **Ilango Krishnamoorthy**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=78100d58-d927-4ec9-8919-319899d654ab&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Labour **$**



Auckland is a bit odd politically. South Auckland is painted red every election in central government but when it comes to Council, fiscal conservatives seem to have staked out some secure territory.



Krishnamoorthy has lived in Manurewa for thirty years, owns a printing business and is very active in the Indian community. He is a Trustee of the South Asian Trust which provides counselling support to ethnic groups and is a founding member of the NZ Hindu Temple Society. The Indian News Link describes him as “one of the most popular community leaders.” I’ve never heard of him but we probably go to different bars.



From his candidate profile: “Ilango’s focus is preserving and promoting the amazing natural environments and public facilities that Manurewa-Papakura has to share with all Aucklanders”.



Maybe he needs to build some amazing public facilities before promoting them?



Both Labour candidates finish their statements with: Voting for all our Labour endorsed Mayor, Councillors, Local Board and DHB candidates guarantees you the most effective advocates working with Manurewa MPs Louisa Wall and Peeni Henare. #VoteLabour #LetsDoThis



It’s a bit sad that they have to resort to name dropping the local MP to get people to vote for them. Probably because in the 2016 local board elections the top 8 positions went to Manurewa Action Team, followed by three Independents, followed by four Labour candidates, followed by It’s Worth It Manurewa, followed by Ilango Krishnamoorthy.



[ **Peter Neilson**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=65e91098-b620-4198-a171-005089c05ce5&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Labour 



Local boards are where political careers are born and sometimes where they go to die. Peter Neilson was in parliament for 9 years and Minister for Revenue, Works and Associate Finance. I’ve never heard of him and can’t remember when I last heard of a Minister of Works.



Wyatt Creech was the last Minister of Works in 1993 while Neilson held the post for 9 months in 1990. 



So, Neilson was a Minister in the greatest New Zealand government of all time and I’ve still never heard of him.  
In his [blog](https://www.peterneilson.nz/blog/2019/6/21/peter-for-manurewa-papakura-ward-on-auckland-council), Peter hinges his strategy for winning the ward on getting non-voters out to vote. Sounds like a Labour party strategy in the 2014 election that planned to win by getting 1 million non-voters out to vote. That didn’t work. This won’t either. The problem with non-voters is that they don’t vote.



Neilson loves “the optimism of the people he meets while walking the streets of Panurewa (sic).” His priority if he is elected is to unite the community by holding a 2 day 2020 Vision conference involving community organisations, sports clubs, churches, local councillors, the Local Board, our MP’s, the Mayor and others. On day 1 they will agree on what needs to be done. One day 2 they would decide what they need to do in the next 3 years and the following 7 years.  
  
Manurewa MP Louisa Wall asked this guy to run for Council.



[ **Daniel Newman**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=bdf967d8-e52b-4d2e-b3d1-5bccdb4ca6ec&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Manurewa – Papakura Action Team **$$$$$**



Uttering this guy’s name in the ward generates very strong feelings for positive and negative reasons alike. I had to take a closer look. He lives in Wattle Downs and (unlike me) attends St. Annes Catholic Church because he actually wants to.   
The _Whaleoil_ blog called “Daniel ‘Vlad’ Newman the most formidable man in Auckland Politics.” _NZ Herald_ writers Bernard Orsman and Simon Wilson both [rated Newman’s performance](https://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2019/09/wilson_and_orsman_rate_the_auckland_councillors.html) 8/10; the highest rating for anyone on Auckland Council.



Newman is a fiscal and social conservative, practical and with a no-nonsense approach to his role as Councillor. When Auckland Council announced that the CRL was facing a $500 million cost blowout, Mayor Goff was said to have weakly said, “nobody is surprised no matter how unwelcome these costs will be.” I preferred Newman’s approach. He said parts of the funding formula [gave him “the shits”](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/112383569/city-rail-link-auckland-councillors-to-consider-500m-extra-for-underground-tunnels) and he expects Crown Company City Rail Link Ltd to pay the added cost.



It’s not hard to find stories about the larger than life Councillor over the past term. They include small scale practicality such as when a [Papakura art group](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2019/03/papakura-art-group-needs-a-hand/) went to their local board about difficulties accessing a community hall since changes to the carpark had made things difficult for members on the upper-end of the age scale. Within weeks Newman and board chairman Brent Catchpole were at the site, working with the art group and Council officers to get a simple, quick fix.



A Summerset Retirement Village resident finding it increasingly more difficult to enjoy visiting Karaka Lakes due to an absence of seating and this was brought up at a local board meeting last April. Newman shares my impatience with getting things done the [bureaucratic way](https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2019/04/local-board-asked-to-install-memorial-seat/), saying they would have a chat with developers to get it done without going through workshops and board meetings.



In a ward where illegal dumping and poor health outcomes are common, Daniel has taken Housing New Zealand to task for trying to reduce its spend on rubbish collection with 125L bins for 3 bedroom houses. In South Auckland, 3 bedrooms notoriously means much larger families living there and the bins are not adequate for many tenants.



When Councillors Darby and Hills teamed up with Goff to announce free bus rides on weekends for kids under 15, potentially costing $643,000, it was dismissed by Newman as a “schooze” which wouldn’t help the majority of Aucklanders who depend on private vehicles.



“An election year sweetener on public transport fares will be paid for by foregoing other urgent initiatives, including new public transport services,” he said. 



Daniel Newman is widely considered to lead the so-called B team, who oppose Phil Goff’s mayoralty (vs the A team councillors who vote with Goff). His manner is blunt and can be divisive but Newman shows no sign of caring.



[ **Veronica Turner**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a9f0a27f-90ae-495d-aa05-b7fe163c05d9&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Manurewa-Papakura%20Ward)– Justice for Families 



Veronica’s affiliation is a bit strange for local body politics but I knew I had seen it somewhere before…



Susanna Kruger is running for Mayor yet again. Each time she pledges to implement some business or education project owned by her company. That’s where I had seen it…



Veronica Turner runs South African market days to share her South African culture with New Zealanders. She also organises networking teas and ladies’ retreats. Kruger has clearly trained her apprentice well, the website for these ladies’ retreats is included in Turner’s candidate profile. ( [ladyinbusiness.info](http://ladyinbusiness.info/) )



Turner’s priorities are introducing a low-cost housing scheme yet to be introduced by Justice For Families and assisting families to become financially independent through Create Your Own J.O.B. workshops. Something like [this?](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/create-your-own-job-course-tickets-56256516756#)



What a bloody cheek!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt their Die kalte Sonne site here, Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning write how a philosophy professor and a communication professor tried to portray climate science skeptics as ‘conspiracy theorists’ and how their attempt backfired.
It’s the latest example of German academia trying to smear those who express other views made in the true spirit of science.
*********************************
Scientists at University of Augsburg with dubious study on “climate skeptical emotionalization strategy
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2014 a study appeared in the journal GAiA which dealt with climate skeptical views. The authors are Jens Soentgen and Helena Bilandzic of the University of Augsburg in Germany:
The structure of climate skeptical arguments. Conspiracy theory as scientific criticism
Climate skeptics go against the mainstream and claim that not only the scientific consensus over the causes of global warming are false, but that they also have been falsified. They assume a conspiracy among climate scientists. The following analysis of climate-skeptical argumentation deals with an assessment of German and English language science books. It reveals the function and basis of the climate skeptic emotionalization strategies.”
Abastract:
Questioning and rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change causes, climate skeptics argue that climate science is involved in a global conspiracy, guided by self-interest and aspirations of societal change. On the basis of 97 climate skeptical non-fiction books, this article reconstructs the logical structure of climate skeptical (or denialist) arguments, with a special focus on the construction of the causes for climate change. The analysis shows that climate skeptical arguments are made on three levels: on the level of insight from climate science, on the level of an intuitive sociology of science and on a political/economic level, thus achieving the desired effect of moving the audience emotionally. The reconstruction of arguments may serve as a basis for more quantitative research, but it is also useful for entering the debate with climate skeptics as it allows anticipating climate skeptical objections.”
The pdf file of the German-language study is available free of charge as a download. Conveniently Soentgen happens to be a co-publisher of the journal. Of course many of us would like to know more about how the peer-review process really took place. In the study the authors also discuss our book “Die kalte Sonne”. Fritz Vahrenholt made the effort to write a letter to the lead author:

Dear Herr Soentgen,
I have read your study sub-titled ‘Conspiracy theory as scientific criticism’. You did not spend much time with the scientific assertions of our book. Thus it wasn’t necessary for you to point out that we hold CO2 does have an impact on climate, but one that is only half as large as what is claimed by the IPCC in its 2007 report. Since then, climate sensitivity has been significantly reduced in numerous peer-reviewed publications – down to one half and even less. Even the IPCC reduced the lower limit of climate sensitivity to 1.5°C in its latest report and found itself unable to assign any supportable probable figure. Shouldn’t that fact alone make us skeptical of the climate models, 95% of which falsely projected the development of the global mean temperature over the last 15 years? These models, which were unable to forecast 15 years ahead, provide the framework for a 100-year prognosis and lead to the adoption of political action of the sort we are already observing in Germany today.
At the end you write: ‘If the global mean temperature continues to remain flat or even drop over the next decade despite continuously rising CO2 emissions, then the position of the climate skeptics in the public will grow.’ Is that your only conclusion? Could one not also reach the conclusion that the climate models obviously do not reflect reality because they are not taking the natural effects (clouds, sun, ocean currents) numerically into account? Shouldn’t that have consequences for the speed and extent of a controversial required CO2 reduction…one that would have a less dramatic, economical and environmental consequences?
But then again this would be skepticism, and that we know is now verboten because it’s part of a conspiracy theory.
Yours truly
Fritz Vahrenholt
*************************************
When asked if he ever heard back from Soentgen, Vahrenholt wrote back that the philosophy professor indeed sent a response, but one that didn’t answer the questions. Paraphrasing Vahrenholt: Soentgen’s response was an impressive acrobatic breakdance around the flagpole.

The legacy of Franklin Roosevelt is harming American science.



At the end of World War II, President Roosevelt asked Vannevar Bush, who oversaw the explosively successful Manhattan Project, if there was a way that the horde of scientists recruited to produce The Bomb could somehow be kept in government employment.



Within eight months, Bush sketched out a blueprint in which the Universities, not the government, would be the employers, but that the pay, either for faculty or for hired researchers, would actually originate from federal science agencies, cabinet departments, or the clandestines.



The consequences were obvious. Universities charge 50 percent overhead on federal grants, using these profitable science Department monies to pay for unprofitable Art and Music Departments. The seeds of political correctness—which requires big, expensive, expansive government—were planted as the schools became addicted to federal welfare.





The search for knowledge has become the search for funding, and funding agencies tend to frown upon negative results.



Under unforgiving competition to secure funding for their institutions (and promotion for themselves) some scientists are behaving badly.



Last week, a technical publication, _Journal of Vibration and Control_ , retracted _sixty_ papers, after an internal investigation revealed a fraudulent “peer review and citation process” that greased the skids for a small number of authors to have an enormous number of citations in what is a prestigious engineering specialty. At least one of the authors even managed to review his own papers under an alias.



That’s symptomatic of a larger sickness raging in what should be our most sacrosanct of institutions. If we can no longer trust science, what do we have as the basis for knowledge?



It is a fact that the policy world—particularly the environmental policy world—claims to base policies on “science,” such as the reports of United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s periodical “National Assessments” of the impact of climate change on our country.



These influential documents are essentially large reviews of a voluminous scientific literature. The tragedy is that literature is being insidiously poisoned by the incentive structure for science itself.



The evidence is increasingly compelling. University of Montreal’s Danielle Fanelli has written several comprehensive reviews of the content of published science and he found, in the last twenty years, that the number of “positive” results is increasing dramatically. That’s when the data confirm a proposed hypothesis rather than suggesting rejection or modification.



In a real world where scientists are answering real questions, that would be impossible. People have not suddenly become smarter, except, perhaps at how to advance in academia. There, candidates for promotion in the sciences are basically asked two questions: What did you publish, and how much taxpayer money did you bring in to support your research?



If an Assistant Professor, up for tenure, answers either insufficiently, he’s likely to be looking for another job. It’s amazing how many of these wind up staffing Congressional Committees, or better yet, on programmatic committees for the big science agencies.



The money part is of paramount importance. At a tier‐​one University, to publish the requisite number of papers for promotion in, say, the Environmental Sciences, probably requires a minimum of $2.5 million. That’s a lot of overhead for the Germanic Languages Department.



Does anyone seriously think that a young researcher is going to get that kind of funding by going to federal agencies with a proposal that global warming’s amount and effects have been dramatically overblown (as they have)? The mere proposal threatens to derail everyone else’s gravy train. It won’t get funded, and the researcher soon won’t be paid.



Dr. John Loannidis, now at Stanford, may have been the first person to detect the illness when he wrote, in 2005, a then‐​iconoclastic paper, “Why most Published Research Findings are False”. His thesis is the demands to publish and get funding are so strong that many studies are poorly designed in order to force a positive result and rapid publication.



Since then, the number of retracted papers has gone through the roof. The winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Randy Scheckman—on the eve of his award—wrote a _Guardian_ op‐​ed, “How journals like Nature, Cell and Science are damaging science”, and he vowed to never send them another manuscript.



Scheckman noted that publishing in _Nature_ and _Science_ is a ticket to tenure and enhanced research funding, but that these two magazines—the most “impactful” science magazines on earth, gravitate towards “flashy” science to draw attention themselves (and thereby inflating their “impact factors”). This is done at the expense the day‐​to‐​day grind science that is perhaps more important, but won’t land you on CNN. Knowing this, people will gravitate towards flashy fields, like global warming, at the expense of others, and burning our scientific talent for a mess of pottage.



So the search for knowledge has become the search for funding, and funding agencies tend to frown upon negative results. Who is seriously going to get a federal grant that can ultimately diminish the power of the federal government? No, instead we read in the recent _National Assessment_ , silly positive associations, like global warming is associated with more mental illness. This can only mean that people in Richmond are loonier than here in Washington DC, and that they must be crazy in Miami.



That makes about as much sense as compromising science to serve the federal funding behemoth.

Alternate Title: Climate Science Community Continues to Lose Sight of Reality
SkepticalScience is promoting the Holland and Bruyère (2013) paper Recent Intense Hurricane Response to Global Climate Change as proof positive that hypothetical human-induced global warming has caused more intense hurricanes. See Dana Nuccitelli’s post New Research Shows Humans Causing More Intense Hurricanes. My Figure 1 is Figure 1 from Holland and Bruyère (2013).

Figure 1
The abstract of Holland and Bruyère (2013) begins:
An Anthropogenic Climate Change Index (ACCI) is developed and used to investigate the potential global warming contribution to current tropical cyclone activity. The ACCI is defined as the difference between the means of ensembles of climate simulations with and without anthropogenic gases and aerosols. This index indicates that the bulk of the current anthropogenic warming has occurred in the past four decades, which enables improved confidence in assessing hurricane changes as it removes many of the data issues from previous eras.
That’s right; referring to Figure 1, Holland and Bruyère (2013) created an index by subtracting the multi-model mean of climate models forced by natural factors (variations in solar activity and volcanic aerosols) from the mean of the simulations that are also forced with anthropogenic factors like manmade greenhouse gases—as if the two types of model simulations and their difference represent reality. They then used that model-based index, with little to no basis in the real world, for comparisons to hurricane activity at various hurricane strengths.

Hurricane activity is influenced by tropical sea surface temperatures. Yet, we know climate models cannot simulate sea surface temperatures over the past 31 years, which is included in the 1975 to 2010 period studied by Holland and Bruyère (2013). Refer to the post here for a model-data comparison of satellite-era sea surface temperature anomalies. And we’ve also discussed for 4 years how ocean heat content data and satellite-era sea surface temperature data indicate the oceans warmed naturally. Refer to the illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” [42MB]. The models are obviously flawed.
Hurricane activity is also influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are fewer Atlantic hurricanes during El Niño years due to the increase in wind shear there. On the other hand, there’s an increase in the intensity of eastern tropical Pacific cyclones during El Niño years. See Table 1, which is from the NOAA Weather Impacts of ENSO webpage.

Table 1
Does Holland and Bruyère (2013) consider ENSO? No. The words El Niño and La Niña do not appear in the paper, and ENSO appears only once, when they’re discussing the reason for the use of 5-year smoothing.
All variance numbers use the 5-years smoothed annual time series to remove ENSO type variability.
Can climate models simulate ENSO? The answer is also no. Refer to the post Guilyardi et al (2009) “Understanding El Niño in Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models: progress and challenges”.
Guilyardi et al (2009) includes:
Because ENSO is the dominant mode of climate variability at interannual time scales, the lack of consistency in the model predictions of the response of ENSO to global warming currently limits our confidence in using these predictions to address adaptive societal concerns, such as regional impacts or extremes (Joseph and Nigam 2006; Power et al. 2006).
The multidecadal variability of the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO. There are numerous papers that discuss the influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on hurricane activity. In fact, the NOAA Frequently Asked Questions About the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) includes the question Does the AMO influence the intensity or the frequency of hurricanes (which)? Their answer reads:
The frequency of weak-category storms – tropical storms and weak hurricanes – is not much affected by the AMO. However, the number of weak storms that mature into major hurricanes is noticeably increased. Thus, the intensity is affected, but, clearly, the frequency of major hurricanes is also affected. In that sense, it is difficult to discriminate between frequency and intensity and the distinction becomes somewhat meaningless.
The AMO began its multidecadal rise in temperature in the mid-1970s. See Figure 2. By focusing their analysis on the period of 1975 to 2010, Holland and Bruyère (2013) appear to be, in part, attempting to blame manmade greenhouse gases for an increase in activity that’s already been attributed to the natural variability of the AMO.

Figure 2
Off topic note: Referring to Figure 1 from Holland and Bruyère (2013), notice how the surface temperature data ends in 1999 in cell b, while the models continue for a number of years beyond then, probably to the 2005 end year of the historic CMIP5 simulations. Apparently, some climate scientists haven’t figured out what assumption a reader is forced to make when he or she sees disparities in the end dates of model-data comparisons—that the models would show very poorly if Holland and Bruyère (2013) had extended the data to the end year of the historic simulations, 2005, or to the end year of their study, which was 2010. Note also that the data begins after the start year of the models, too. In other words, most readers wonder what the authors are hiding and assume the worst.
CLOSING
Holland and Bruyère (2013) appears to be a flawed attempt to counter the findings of the recent (2012) IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). See the Summary for Policymakers here. The IPCC writes:
There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.
Holland and Bruyère (2013) is yet another peer-reviewed study that relies on climate models as if the models represent reality, when climate models clearly do not. Eventually, the climate science community will have to come to terms with this—possibly not in my lifetime at the rate they’re going. And the portrayers of gloom and doom at SkepticalScience like Dana Nuccitelli somehow find papers like Holland and Bruyère (2013) to be credible. Nothing surprising about that.

"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve mass use of a Covid vaccine for people aged 16 and over.**
Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, approved by the British medicines regulator, the MHRA, could start early next week for people in some high-priority groups, with 800,000 doses arriving in the UK in the first delivery.
**When will I get a vaccine?**
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that people are given the vaccine in the following order, although there is likely to be some overlap between groups:
The complex logistics of distributing the vaccine mean that hospitals, which have the large-scale storage required at freezing temperatures, will act as vaccination hubs at the start, and NHS staff are likely to be protected first.
The priority groups cover 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19, according to the JCVI.
The older you are, the higher your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus - and that risk rises sharply beyond 70. People with underlying health conditions are also vulnerable to the virus.
After these nine priority groups, there will be a second phase of vaccination for younger groups in the population.
Local NHS and public health teams will be given some flexibility to allocate vaccines to other at-risk groups, including people from ethnic backgrounds and deprived communities.
People will be vaccinated twice - 21 days apart - and immunity starts seven days after the second dose.
You'll be invited to book an appointment to get a vaccine as soon as it's your turn, probably by letter.
In England, more than 1,000 GP surgeries will act as local vaccination centres, and sports stadiums and conference centres will act as major vaccination hubs.
The first doses are likely to be given via 50 hospital hubs next week, which means healthcare staff and patients will probably be immunised first, followed by care home residents.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday in Scotland.
Northern Ireland will receive 25,000 doses next week and NHS staff have been told they will be vaccinated on 14 December, although this could be brought forward.
The roll-out of the vaccine in Wales will start in a matter of days.
The NHS is recruiting 30,000 volunteers to help with the rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff and students - who will be trained to give the jabs.
No - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS.
You can't jump the queue by paying for it, but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round.
If you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab.
Having both infections at once this winter could be dangerous.
At its last meeting, the JCVI recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.
The UK medicines regulator does not authorise any vaccine unless it believes it is safe.
The MHRA assesses all the data, ensures a vaccine works and that all the necessary trials and checks have been completed.
It studies:
It is doing this as quickly as possible without cutting corners, because these vaccines are a priority.
Drug companies making the vaccines have continually been sending trial data to the regulator for review, which has also shortened the process.
The MHRA also seeks advice from another independent body, the Commission on Human Medicines, before advising the government on a potential vaccine.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the fastest ever to go from concept to reality, taking just 10 months.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca team has now sent all the data on its vaccine to the MHRA for approval, and other vaccine developers will follow.
In the event the UK has a choice, the JCVI would advise on which vaccine should be used for different groups of people.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to be approved in the UK, is being manufactured and distributed from Belgium.
The vaccine will be packed in specially-designed ""thermoboxes"" containing dry ice, and transported to the UK by lorry or plane.
It will go straight to major hospitals to be stored at freezing temperatures of about -70C, which is required to keep the vaccine stable.
It can only be moved once from there, and must be kept in batches of 1,000 doses.
At that point, it's a race against time - they can be kept at fridge temperatures (2-8C) for five days and up to six hours in a cool bag to enable them to be taken to care homes and other sites.
The first batch of 800,000 doses is expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days.
The eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 16 receive a Covid-19 vaccine.
If everyone over 16 in the UK is offered one, that would be more than 50 million people - a huge challenge.
There is no timeframe on this momentous task, but it's clear that's the long-term plan in 2021.
The NHS has plenty of experience delivering vaccines to huge numbers of people, for example this winter's flu jab should reach 30 million.
A Covid vaccine won't be compulsory though - no other vaccines in the UK are, and experts say this approach doesn't help create confidence in the vaccine.
At present, the government has ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 355 million doses, including 100 million of the Oxford/AstraZeneca one.
If everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK."
"**It is not yet known when all care home residents in Wales will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
But Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton could not say when care home residents would receive it due to storage temperature requirements.
Care home residents and staff are among those identified as a top priority.
Other priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s.
The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
But Dr Atherton said getting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress"" and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Initially it will have to be provided to a limited number of sites, he said.
""We're trying to find ways, even with this vaccine, to provide a more disseminated approach to distribution.
""There are of course other vaccines in the pipeline - the Oxford vaccine for example which doesn't have such stringent requirements around temperature management and control.
""As that comes online, as we hope, that will that will give us a further ability to work our way through those priority lists.""
Dr Atherton added: ""I can't give you an exact date or a time frame, but we're working through that process as quickly as we can.
""Because those elderly residents, usually elderly in care homes, are one of our highest priorities.""
Everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr Atherton said, adding it would be ""a massive undertaking"".
Vaccines for younger people will be available after the over-50s have had their jabs, according to Gill Richardson, who chairs the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board.
Dr Richardson said the Welsh Government was taking steps to ensure the vaccination programme did not affect other NHS services.
""People will be invited to come and have the vaccine through the NHS - we'll be holding special vaccine clinics to make sure people can receive the jab, while keeping normal NHS services free to see people,"" she said at the Welsh Government press briefing.
""The vaccine is the best way to protect people, but no-one will be forced to have it if they don't want it,"" Dr Richardson said.
Dr Atherton added that a Public Health Wales survey had shown that 70% of people would be willing to have the vaccine, and 60% would want their children to have it.
There are plans for people who have had a jab to be given a record card but it is not anticipated that hospitality businesses in Wales will turn away people who cannot prove they have been vaccinated, according to Dr Richardson.
""We hope that people will come and have this extremely precious and significant commodity for free of their own volition, but there's no compulsion,"" she said.
The Welsh Government said two areas had been identified as appropriate delivery sites for the vaccine and local health boards would collect the vaccines directly from these sites.
Dr Richardson declined to say where the sites were, but added: ""We have looked very carefully at all the storage parameters and also ease of distribution so we can get this vaccine out as swiftly as possible to the immunisers who will need it in each of the health boards and trusts.""
People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are in the schedule and risk, it added.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Today's news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel...
""We must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus - regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.""
Dr Richardson said serious side effects from the new vaccine were ""extremely rare"".
She said people might get a sore arm or occasionally a raised temperature, but ""it's a very safe vaccine"".
She added that the ""safety profiles"" were ""really good"" for the elderly and those that have clinical conditions.
""We are extremely pleased to be offering what we feel is a very safe vaccine to the Welsh population,"" she added.
Dr Atherton said it was not yet known whether the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus.
He said it is known from data submitted by the company ""it's pretty good"" at stopping people getting infected and having serious infections.
""We just don't know yet whether it will stop transmission,"" he told the press briefing.
""That will only be known to us in the fullness of time when vaccines are rolled out.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""This is fantastic news and is what we have all been waiting forâ¦ it is vaccines like this one that will give us the protection needed to reclaim our lives.""
Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster and MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said the news was ""fantastic"" and there was ""a cloud beginning to lift"", especially for those in care homes and people who have been isolated.
""There's this prospect of being reunited with loved ones,"" she said. ""We really need some hope. It's such good news.""
Conservative MS for Aberconwy Janet Finch-Saunders said she had no concerns about the plans for the mass vaccination.
""The concern was always about whether a vaccine could be found and whether it would be approved, so today is a good day,"" she said.
As the NHS prepares for a challenging winter, with the additional pressures of delivering the vaccine, staff welcomed the news.
Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital who had coronavirus earlier this year, said: ""Excellent news and reflects the immense efforts and superb work undertaken by the medical research community.""
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, as two shots are needed.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade."
"Was it just a year ago that Katie Holmes, Jennifer Hudson and Lucy Liu snatched up most of the light and much of the air at Zac Posen’s fall show? A scant six months later, Mr. Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent, one that included Malin Akerman, Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo. (Who?) Last February, Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their aggregate star power to Narciso Rodriguez’s show. By September, the designer’s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld. So it went. And now, on the eve of another round of New York shows, it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks, as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded   perches, their dwindling presence matched only, some say, by their diminishing impact. “You can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row,” said Tommy Hilfiger, who began trumpeting his alignment with entertainment world players as far back as the 1980s. But these days, Mr. Hilfiger suggested, designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies. In itself, he said, “a star’s presence does nothing to move the needle. ” That realization, somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles, accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance. “In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the shows were really ” said Billy Farrell, who heads BFA, an events photography agency. “As a house photographer, I used to get a long list of faces. Now at any given show, one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes. ” That paucity of   personalities is ascribed to a string of factors: celebrity overexposure, a generalized fashion fatigue and, chief among them, shrinking fashion budgets. “People don’t have as much money as they used to, and they’re scared,” said Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist. Aware that the payoff may be negligible, many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of, say, a Jessica Chastain, a Julianne Moore or, for that matter, a Lady Gaga, pop culture luminaries who, once they arrive, may or may not deign to speak to the press. For designers, the topic is a touchy one. Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Mr. Rodriguez, Jeremy Scott, Diane von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Vera Wang. But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble, citing, among other causes, a certain jadedness among consumers. “People can tell it’s a paid front row,” Ms. Cutrone said. “Does anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans?” More troubling, still, is the widening view that fashion itself is losing much of its vaunted cachet. “The shows are not cool anymore,” said Teri Agins, the author of the 2014 book “Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers,” which chronicles the evolution of the celebrity front row. European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber, Ms. Agins noted, some drawn by Europe’s cachet, others compelled by   cosmetic and marketing contracts. But in New York, she said, “the novelty is gone. ” Oversaturation has played a role. In recent years, invitations were issued, vetted and approved by teams of publicists, Hollywood agents,   stylists and, as often as not, the stars themselves, many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show, their influence diluted by their ubiquity. “We sort of cooked our golden goose,” said James LaForce, a veteran fashion publicist. “At the end of the day, all their pictures seemed to run together. ” “We’re at the end of that cycle now,” he added. “It feels   something from another era. ” By most accounts, that era dawned in the early to   when the shows, once scattered in showrooms, galleries and ballrooms all over town, were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park. At the time designer front rows were judiciously seeded with “friends of the house,” among them society figures, and the occasional television personality, Broadway ingénue or authentic megastar. “They were people we dressed, people I often had dinner with, people whose children we knew and sometimes dressed,” the designer Dennis Basso said. At Mr. Basso’s fashion extravaganzas over the years, Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders with Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart spied sitting flank to flank alongside Mary J. Blige. “The celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment,” Mr. Basso recalled. It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide. In that seemingly innocent era, shows were   trade events, largely the province of store buyers, journalists and a smattering of   ladies who lunched. That picture altered in the   when Uma Thurman wore a   Prada dress to the Oscars. “It was a sort of milestone,” said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, “a sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity. ” So groovy, in fact, that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion’s main event, transforming, as Ms. Agins writes, “what was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print, on TV and everywhere on the internet. ” In those heady days, she observed, the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show. Today, some argue, that content is debased. “What constitutes a celebrity now has changed,” said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “It’s no longer necessarily that   Hollywood diva. ” The diva, it seems, has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk, pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack the gravitas of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers. “The rise of celebrity bloggers, reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off,” said Leslie Sloane, a prominent Hollywood publicist. “Those girls may be lovely, but they’re not fashion. ” Just as   is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum. Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell, her    posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters. Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen, and Zoê Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang, whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. That kind of drawing power does not come cheap. Hard figures are elusive, but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $25, 000 to more than $100, 000. In the   practice known industrywide as    an   attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $1 million, Mr. Hilfiger said. Such sums, which vary according to a celebrity’s clout, are expected to cover the cost of   airfare and hotel accommodations, as well as wardrobe, hair, makeup and other amenities. They are   numbers, for sure. But just two or three years ago, they were routinely factored into many designers’ marketing budgets. In distributing funds, Mr. LaForce said, “we would game the situation. ” It was a little like a commodities market, sums parceled out “based on who was available and who would take what,” he said, adding, “Still, in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it. ” For some designers, it still is. “To have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality,” said Michael Kors, whose celebrity turnout last season included Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo, the   winning Broadway star and Sienna Miller. “You see the clothes on the runway, then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row, and you get it. The message has come full circle. ” No one would argue that the fame game is entirely played out. But for some designers, attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars. “A handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings, Gigi Hadid being the leader,” Mr. Hilfiger said. “She’s the girl next door with an exotic twist. ” (Ms. Hadid’s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian.) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid’s growing global appeal, enlisting her to walk his runway, appear in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her own. The success of those moves was measurable, he said, in 2. 2 million social media impressions, a 900 percent increase in total   over the previous year, and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line. Plenty of people were impressed, among them designers of an altogether different ilk. “We understand the power involved in that alignment we won’t pretend that we don’t,” said Ryan Lobo, who, with Ramon Martin, designs Tome, a collection aimed largely at a haute bohemian clientele. Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin, however, prefer a nuanced approach that takes celebrity marketing back to its roots. At their shows they tend to seat loyalists, prominent clients like the artists Shirin Neshat and Kara Walker, alongside such    personalities as Sandra Bernhard. “We aim to make the mix intriguing,” Mr. Lobo said, “like a dinner party with people who don’t normally have access to each other. ” Picking up the analogy, Mr. Martin added: “These people are our personal icons, and there will be others. You know we’re always going to add a chair to the end of the table. ”"

A climate science bombshell: New proposal from NASA JPL admits to “spurious” errors in current satellite based sea level and ice altimetry, calls for new space platform to fix the problem.
People send me stuff. Today it is a PowerPoint presentation from NASA JPL that touts the new GRASP (Geodetic Reference Antenna in Space) satellite project. I’d say it is more than a bit of a bombshell because the whole purpose of this new mission is to “fix” other mission data that apparently never had a stable enough reference for the measurements being made. This promises to rewrite what we know about sea level rise and acceleration, ice extent and ice volume loss measured from space.

What is most interesting, is the admissions of the current state of space based sea level altimetry in the science goals page of the presentation:


The difference between tide gauge data and space based data is over 100% in the left graph, 1.5 mm/yr versus 3.2mm/yr. Of course those who claim that sea level rise is accelerating accept this data without question, but obviously one of the two data sets (or possibly both) is not representative of reality, and JPL’s GRASP team aims to fix this problem they have identified:
TRF errors readily manifest as spurious sea level rise accelerations
That’s a bucket of cold water reality into the face of the current view of sea level rise. It puts this well-known and often cited graph on Sea Level Rise from the University of Colorado (and the rate of 3.1 mm/yr) into question:

What’s  a TRF error? That stands for Terrestrial Reference Frame, which is basically saying that errors in determining the benchmark are messing up the survey. In land based geodesy terms, say if somebody messed with the USGS benchmark elevation data from Mt. Diablo California on a regular basis, and the elevation of that benchmark kept changing in the data set, then all measurements referencing that benchmark would be off as well.
USGS Benchmark on Mt. Diablo – Image from geocaching.com
In the case of radio altimetry from space, such measurements are extremely dependent on errors related to how radio signals are propagated through the ionosphere. Things like Faraday rotation, refraction, and other propagation issues can skew the signal during transit, and if not properly corrected for, especially over the long-term, it can introduce a spurious signal in all sorts of data derived from it. In fact, the mission summary shows that it will affect satellite derived data for sea level, ice loss, and ice volume in GRACE gravity measurements:

In a nutshell, JPL is saying we don’t have an accurate reference point, and therefore the data from these previous missions likely has TRF uncertainties embedded:
The TRF underlies all Measurement of the Earth
Without that stable Terrestrial Reference Frame that puts the precision of the baseline measurements well below the noise in the data, all we have are broader uncertain measurements. That’s why the plan is to provide ground based points of reference, something our current satellite systems don’t have:

To help understand the items in the side panels:
GNSS = Global Navigation Satellite System – more here
SLR = Satellite Laser Ranging  – more here
DORIS = Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite – more here
VLBI = Very Long Baseline Interferometry – more here
Taken together, these systems will improve the accuracy of the TRF, and thus the data. It’s rather amazing that the baseline accuracy didn’t come first, because this now puts all these other space based measurement systems into uncertainty until their TRF issues are resolved, and that’s an inconvenient truth. We’ll never look at satellite based sea level data or GRACE ice volume data in quite the same way again until this is resolved.

The world lost a great champion of liberty with the passing of Allan Meltzer, a longtime Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University. Allan was a prodigious worker who wrote hundreds of articles and more than ten books, including his monumental _A History of the Federal Reserve_ and more recently _Why Capitalism?_ The latter provides a strong defense of limited government, the rule of law, private property and free markets, which he saw as the surest means to increase the wealth of nations.   




Allan had a passion for ideas and a desire to influence policy; he sought to make the world a better place by safeguarding economic and personal freedom. He became a major player in the marketplace for ideas — writing, teaching, advising policymakers, serving on editorial boards, co-founding the Shadow Open Market Committee with his close colleague and lifelong friend Karl Brunner, acting as president of the Mont Pelerin Society founded by F. A. Hayek, chairing the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (also known as the “Meltzer Commission”), and participating in numerous conferences. He continued working right up until his death on May 8, at the age of 89.   




I first met Allan in the early 1980s, when he began to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference. His paper “Monetary Reform in an Uncertain Environment” was delivered at the first conference, in January 1983, and published in the _Cato Journal_ later that year; it was reprinted in _The Search for Stable Money_ (University of Chicago Press, 1987), a book I co-edited with Anna J. Schwartz.   
  
In that article, Allan examined alternative monetary regimes and their implications for reducing risk and uncertainty. He sought a rule-based regime that would minimize uncertainty and best allow markets to flourish. He preferred, at the time, a quantity rule that would have the monetary base grow in line with the growth of real output adjusted for changes in the velocity of base money. Such a rule, he argued, would anchor expectations regarding the path of nominal income and achieve long-run price stability. However, the rule had to be credible and be supplemented with a fiscal rule that limited the taxing and spending powers of government. He did not want the Fed to finance government deficits or to allocate credit.   




It is important to note that Allan was not opposed to private money. At the 1983 monetary conference and in his paper, he held that   




individuals or groups should be permitted to issue and use privately produced money or monies. . . . The objective of policy rules is to reduce the uncertainty that the community must bear, not to prevent voluntary risk taking.



Allan was open-minded and was willing to change his policy advice based on logic and evidence.   
  
He continued to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference for many years and contributed 15 articles to the _Cato Journal_ (see Table 1). Although he was often critical of Fed policy, he thought Paul Volcker was correct in ending double-digit inflation by slowing the growth of money and credit, and that Alan Greenspan was correct in following an implicit monetary rule to prevent wide fluctuations in nominal income during the “Great Moderation.”   
  
Meltzer, however, was highly critical of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy and wrote in the Spring/Summer 2012 _Cato Journal_:   




Overresponse to short-run events and neglect of longer-term consequences of its actions is one of the main errors that the Federal Reserve makes repeatedly. The current recession offers many examples of actions that some characterize as bold and innovative. I regard many of these actions as inappropriate for an allegedly independent central bank because they involve credit allocation, fill the Fed’s portfolio with an unprecedented volume of long-term assets, evade or neglect the dual mandate, distort the credit markets, and initiate other actions that are not the responsibility of a central bank.



He kept up his criticism until the end, writing articles for the Hoover Institution, where he was a distinguished senior fellow, with such titles as “Fed Up with the Fed” ( _Defining Ideas_ , February 17, 2016), “Fed Failures” (March 9, 2016), and “Reform the Federal Reserve” (October 12, 2016). His last article in Hoover’s online journal appeared on April 25, less than two weeks before he died.   
  
The last time I saw Allan was in Switzerland, in September 2016, where we had enjoyed many discussions at Karl Brunner’s Interlaken Seminar on Analysis and Ideology. He was in Zurich to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Karl’s birth, sponsored by the Swiss National Bank, and to deliver a paper discussing Karl’s many contributions to monetary theory as well as to political economy in general. In his paper, “Karl Brunner, Scholar: An Appreciation,” he emphasized that Karl   




highlighted information, institutions and uncertainty as well as the importance of microanalysis in macroeconomics. Karl Brunner explained that nominal monetary impulses changed real variables by changing the relative price of assets to output prices. And he concluded that economic fluctuations occurred because of an unstable public sector — especially the monetary sector — that disturbs a more stable private sector, a policy lesson forgotten or never learned by many central banks.



Those ideas also were central to Allan’s work — both with Karl and independently — and they are evident in his interpretation of Keynes’s monetary theory.   




In a careful study of John Maynard Keynes’s writings, Meltzer argues that the vast literature on Keynes neglected the importance he placed on credible rules, which he thought would reduce uncertainty and improve economic welfare (see _Keynes’s Monetary Theory: A Different Interpretation,_ Cambridge University Press, 1988).[i]   
  
In particular, Allan was influenced by Keynes’s classic _A Tract on Monetary Reform_(1923), which discusses rules for domestic (internal) price stability and for international (external) price stability — that is, exchange rate stability. In thinking about a rule to reduce the variability of unanticipated changes in prices and outputs, Meltzer ([1987] 1989: 78–81) draws on Keynes’s distinction and his recognition of the benefits of reducing both internal and external instability.[ii] The problem, of course, is to choose the appropriate institutional framework. Countries operating _independently_ cannot achieve both internal and external stability, argued Keynes, unless a key country anchors its price level by enforcing a credible rule.   
  
Building upon Keynes’s insights, Meltzer (p. 78) notes that if each major trading partner makes domestic price stability a priority, then uncertainty about the future path of prices will diminish and exchange rates among the partners will be more stable. To realize both internal and external stability, Meltzer proposes a simple rule: each major country should set “the rate of growth of the monetary base equal to the difference between the moving average of past real output growth and past growth in base velocity” (p. 83). If each country complies, the rule will reduce the “variability of exchange rates arising from differences in expected rates of inflation.”[iii]   
  
Meltzer’s proposed rule is “forecast free” and adaptable; it is mildly activist but nondiscretionary, similar to Bennett McCallum’s monetary rule.[iv] By choosing to stabilize the _anticipated_ price level rather than the actual price level, there is no need “to reverse all changes in the price level,” argues Meltzer (1989: 79). Instead, the actual price level is allowed “to adjust as part of the process by which the economy adjusts real values to unanticipated supply shocks.” In other words, Meltzer’s monetary rule “does not adjust to short-term, transitory changes in level, but it adjusts fully to permanent changes in growth rates of output and intermediation (or other changes in the growth rate of velocity) within the term chosen for the moving averages” (p. 81).   
  
In the current environment — with the Fed paying interest on excess reserves (in excess of what banks can get on highly liquid assets), no competitive fed funds market, banks subject to uncertainty about future monetary policy and complex macro-prudential regulations, and depositors holding more cash due to ultralow interest rates, Meltzer’s monetary rule would be severely constrained. The link between base money and broader monetary aggregates has weakened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy.   
  
Before serious consideration can be given to implementing any rule-based monetary regime, the Fed needs to normalize monetary policy by ending interest on excess reserves and shrinking its balance sheet to restore a pre-crisis fed funds market. Once changes in base money can be effectively transmitted to changes in the money supply and nominal income, Meltzer’s rule would reduce uncertainty and spur investment and growth.   
  
The key point, however, is that Allan wanted to explore alternative monetary rules and select those he thought would work best to reduce the variability of prices and output. That comparative-institutions approach was evident in all his work. But he recognized that, ultimately, the choice of a rule would be heavily influenced by the political economy. His careful scholarship was intended to help shape the climate of ideas and public policy in the direction of what Richard Epstein has called “simple rules for a complex world.”[v]   




Although Allan was known primarily for his work on monetary theory and history, he was deeply interested in the role of government in a free society; the relation between institutions, incentives, and behavior; the determinants of economic growth; the theory of public choice; the damaging effects of official foreign aid; and the distribution of income.[vi] He wrote many articles for the popular press, including the _Wall Street Journal_ , _Los Angeles Times_ , and _Financial Times_ , and he was always willing to help younger scholars and students understand the complexities of political economy.   




Allan Meltzer was a great scholar and teacher, a friend of liberty, a man of integrity who kept his word, and a fine human being. He was persistent in his research and his life. Allan taught at Carnegie Mellon for 60 years and was married to his lovely wife Marilyn for 67 years.   
  
When Allan was five years old, he lost his mother and went to live with his grandmother for several years until he moved to Los Angeles where his family ran a business. Reflecting on his early years, Allan said, “Her most important influence on my career and my outlook was her strongly held belief that, in America (and only in America), there were no real limits other than ability to what one could achieve by personal effort.”[vii]   
  
In his many accomplishments and honors, Allan certainly realized the American Dream, and had a life well lived.[viii] He will be sorely missed, but his work will live on.

"**John was 40 when his relationship broke down. He had been with his partner for 15 years and they had bought a house together, but it didn't work out.**
He carried on with life, working for the insurance company he had worked at for decades, seeing friends and family - but he felt like something was missing.
Then one night, six years later, he was flicking through the TV channels and landed on a programme about single women adopting children.
""It just sparked my interest, really,"" he explained.
""I had always thought I'd be a dad. But I thought it would happen naturally really, but time went on and I had been single for a few years.
""I started to feel like, 'I'm 46 now, time's ticking on a bit, if I want to be a dad it's now or never'.""
He is one of a growing number of men embarking on fatherhood alone.
John, who adopted before the pandemic, phoned his local adoption services department, the Vale, Valley and Cardiff Adoption Service.
After a three-day ""warts and all"" training course, John decided adoption was the route for him.
But social services were concerned he might not have enough experience with children, so for six months he volunteered to mentor a teenager.
""After that we got back into the process - every fortnight or three weeks I had a meeting with my social worker who went through lots of scenarios with me: 'What would you do if this happened? What would you do if that happened?',"" John recalled.
""He met my ex-partner and my other family members to find out more about me and see if it was a solid environment I could provide.""
In 2011, after a three-year process, John was approved by an adoption panel, who decide whether potential adopters are suitable. The next week his social worker came round.
""I went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea, by the time I came back into the lounge he had four photos of boys laid out on the table for me to look at and said 'do any of these strike your interest?'
""Immediately one stood out to me - he is now my son.""
John said he found it difficult to describe the feeling to someone who had not been through the adoption process, but said it was ""like when you're looking for a house and you walk into a house, and you get the feeling that this is the house you want"".
""It's not a great comparison but that's the nearest I can get to it,"" he added.
The photograph John had settled upon was of six-year-old Chris, not his real name, who had been with foster carers for 18 months after being put up for adoption because of concerns he was not being looked after properly.
John met Chris's social worker, then his foster mother and finally - five months later - Chris himself.
""Ten days later he had moved in with me. And that was it,"" John said.
Overnight John had become a dad - and he said it was a big change for both of them.
""It was a bit of a culture shock. You go from being on your own for a certain amount of time and all of a sudden you've got someone there to look after.
""On the first night everything was fine, quite exciting and everything. But on the second evening he went to bed and was crying and he was like, 'I don't like it, I want to go back'.
""My heart sank, I was like 'what do I do, what do I do?'""
Unable to get hold of his social worker that night, John struggled to sleep, worrying whether this was the right thing for Chris.
But the next morning, his social worker called him back.
""He said 'it's fine, it's just a normal reaction, just carry on and see how things go'. And after that he was fine.""
Interest in adoption has gone up ""significantly"" during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Suzanne Griffiths, of Wales' National Adoption Service.
The service had around 250 more enquiries in the first six months of 2020-2021 compared to the same period in 2019-2020 - an increase of more than a quarter.
""Families have had time to think about what's important to them and we believe that's influenced the increase in interest,"" she said.
Although very few single men adopt each year - the numbers are in ""single figures"" in Wales - she said there had been a bit more interest in the last two years.
She added: ""Some of the traditional stereotypes about the role of women being mothers, care-givers and the people that look after children are changing.""
Nine years on, Chris is now a teenager and John says they are a tight family unit.
""It's great for me because I've been a dad and that's what I wanted.
""And it's great for him because I've given him a better opportunity than he would have had.
""It's given me a purpose really, I suppose.
""I just want him to be the best he can be really. What I'm looking for, for him, is to be a good person and to do the best he can with his life and I've played a small part in helping him have a better life than he would have maybe.
""He'd probably say I'm a good dad, apart from banning him from his Xbox and making him do his school work.
""But that's just normal teenage boys isn't it? That's what he is. He's not an adopted boy of mine, he's a normal teenage son.""

For this nation to survive as a self‐​governing republic, we need to motivate our public‐​school students to become active, knowledgeable, critical‐​thinking citizens.



Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York (a renowned education foundation), frames the challenge: “Today’s students must experience, debate, understand and argue about what it means to be a citizen. There is no better place to transmit the ideas — and the challenges — inherent in our democracy.



Showing what it takes for this to happen in schools is Diana Hess, a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Wisconsin‐​Madison.



In “Discussions That Drive Democracy,” she insists: “Discussing controversies about the nature of the public good and how to achieve it is essential if we are to educate for democracy.”



Among the examples she gives: “Should the federal government grant amnesty to people living in the country without legal documents? Should my state guarantee health care to all its residents?”



These kinds of interactive discussions cannot come into being by teaching only for standardized tests. These are town meetings, of which there ought to be many more for adults, as well. In the classroom, Hess continues:



“Often, highly debatable issues are directly linked to the lives of students in our classrooms. Students need to recognize that their views matter — not because there is something special about young people, but precisely because there is not. Their views matter because all views matter in a democracy.”



She then emphasizes why now in America there is a special need for students to think about and express their views and become aware of other students’ questions and convictions.



American adults, she writes, “increasingly interact and socialize in ideologically homogeneous communities. … People increasingly talk primarily with people who already share their views, access media that reinforce what they already believe, and ruminate on what they hear within an echo chamber of like‐​mindedness.”



When I was teaching graduate‐​level journalism at New York University, I would begin by telling the students: “If you are a reader of _The Nation_ or _The New Republic_ or similar liberal publications, you must also become familiar with the views and news analyses in _The National Review_ and _The Weekly Standard_.”



I also gave each student pocket‐​size editions of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence because both of those founding documents should often be in the rhythm section of the symphonies that are our classroom discussions and debates.



Were I still teaching, the required‐​reading list would begin with the book _Controversy in the Classroom_ (Routledge, 2009) by Diana Hess. In her introduction, she tells of visiting a U.S. history class “at a public charter school in a large Midwestern city.” Involved in a debate on whether abortion should be legal or illegal in the United States were 19 juniors: “Half were African‐​American, the other half Latino — a composition that mirrored almost exactly the student population of the school. Almost all of the students were from poor families with only one parent or guardian at home.



“The students were not engaging in the class discussions to win over or beat up on their peers.” Speaking of their teacher, one student told her: “Mr. Dunn really gives us a chance to say what we beleive and he gives us space to voice our opinions. His classroom gives us space so our opinions aren’t shut out … (and) where we can all work together and figure out a problem. … I enjoy it a lot.”



As rocky as our economy is and will continue to be for some time, there is no financial cost in bringing active democracy into public‐ and private‐​school classrooms.



In “Discussions That Drive Democracy,” Hess shows the way for teachers and school systems — through their students — to nourish the self‐​identity of this self‐​governing republic:



“I encourage teachers to take up the challenge of teaching students how to deliberate controversies by creating a climate of respect, holding students accountable for norms of civil discourse, and teaching the skills at the root of civil exchanges. Each teacher will find his or her own best way to accept this challenge, depending on the unique community and — possibly — local obstacles.



“But each must start by showing respect for students and for the intrinsic relationship between controversy and democracy.”



Abraham Lincoln, not yet president, described in 1858 the root of “our own liberty and independence. It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, the guns of our war steamers, or the strength of our gallant and disciplined army. These are not our reliance against a resumption of tyranny in our fair land. … Our reliance is the love of liberty. … Destroy this spirit, and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own doors.” (my book, _Living the Bill of Rights_ , University of California Press, 1999).



Students experience the love of liberty by learning to be actively engaged citizens in their classrooms. And as they come to vote in our elections, they will invigorate our democracy through their knowledgeable independence.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you don’t have the truth, then some folks rely on lies and hope others will be fooled and stay so. Such is the case with global warming climate science. Almost every measure of global warming has stopped cooperating with the alarmists over the last 10 years. Now they have to make things up.
At Weatherbell Analytics Joe Bastardi has another outstanding Saturday Summary, which every week I look forward to like I looked forward to the Saturday morning cartoons when I was 8 years old.
This week I was fascinated by the number of falsehoods coming from the global warming industry that Joe debunked, and how he did it so quickly. The veteran meteorologist exposes all of them for what they are – in less than 10 minutes!
The string of debunking begins at about the 4-minute mark with the so-called claimed “record drought” that is supposedly gripping Texas and America’s heartland. Joe calls that claim “a lie”. With charts he clearly shows that the recent drought was not even close to being the worst, and that the drought of the 1950s was considerably more intense.
Secondly at the 7:55 mark, he debunks the claims of the upcoming “super El Niño” that the “Church of Super El Niño”, who want to see high temperatures, were ballyhooing earlier this year.
Chart right: Weatherbell
Again Joe presents charts that show the current development resembles nothing you’d expect from a super El Niño and that the current situation looks more similar to 2002/03 or 2009/10. All models have long since downgraded their forecasts. The missing heat remains missing.

google_ad_height = 200;

Thirdly at the 10:00 mark Joe shows how the leading weather services are diametrically opposed when it comes to their forecasts using the Madden Julian Oscillation. While the European model shows the MJO will be in Phase 6, meaning US temps will be cool in July, the US models show that it will be in Phase 1, which means it will be warm over the US in July.
Fourthly, at the 10:55 mark, Joe shows that although tornado activity in the US has risen over the last weeks, the overall activity is still well below normal. How is that “extreme”?
Fifthly at the 11:15 mark, Joe tells the real story about wildfires, whose seemingly increased intensity is claimed to be yet another ominous of climate disaster. Here too we see that wildfire activity is being wildly exaggerated and is well below normal. Currently this year there have been 24,124 wild fires, normal is 31,758. As far as acreage is concerned, things are even less worse look worse for the warmist extremers. Normal acres burned is 1,777,552 acres. So far it is only 826,471 acres. Joe emphasizes, “We’re way the heck below the average.”
Finally at the 12:00 mark, Joe debunks falsehood Number 6 by presenting global sea ice for 2014 so far, and here we see that it is not even close to the ice-free conditions some were predicting some years ago.
Chart right: Weatherbell
In the Arctic sea ice is now headed toward normal levels. Around Antarctic sea ice remains stubbornly close to record levels.
Joe adds, “It may break the all-time record, let alone the daily record“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s worrisome enough that the German government itself recently issued a brochure singling out, naming, and defaming German and American climate science skeptics. Today we have one of Germany’s most prestigious science associations actively backing adolescent-level attacks on skeptics who have decided not to take part in the collective climate hysteria.
This morning on Twitter I happened to come across the following tweet:

Helmholtz Center’s Climate Service Center displays its ugly ideological side in defaming skeptics as deniers. Click here to view video.
Inhofe, Morano, Michaels, Bachmann labeled “deniers”
The above tweet comes from the Climate Service Center, which provides a link to an intolerant video called “The League of Deniers“, which was produced by Kickstarter.com. In summary the video portrays skeptics as “deniers”, claims that “the public is misinformed” and that skeptics’ words are “human foolishness”.
The Climate Service Center even uses the derogatory label “Leugner” (denier) to describe the skeptics in its tweet (my emphasis):
Interesting #Kickstarter project on #climate changel deniers https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/787934767/the-league-of-deniers-jokes-from-climate-change-de …“
So why is the Climate Service Center stooping to such sophomoric behavior and what organization is behind the Climate Service Center? The answer to the first question is purely the subject of speculation. The answer to the second question is clear, if not surprising: It is Germany’s prestigious Helmholtz Center Geesthacht.
At its website we learn that the main function of the Climate Service Center is to act as the communications “connection between science on one side and business and politics on the other side“. We have to wonder what it is that the center and the Helmholtz Center wish to communicate.
Obviously some activists at the Helmholtz Center’s communications arm are sending an activist, sophomoric message these days. They seem to have no idea of the importance skepticism has in science, and why there are even climate science skeptics at all. Skeptics in science? What for!
To help them understand why there are skeptics when it comes to climate science, below are some questions that us skeptics have been waiting 15 years to receive answers.

1. Why has there been no global warming for 17 years?
2. Why have 97% of the climate models failed to foresee this?
3. Why has Antarctic sea ice been well above normal for more than 2 years?
4. Why are northern hemispheric winters getting colder?
5. What makes the present warm period any different from that of the Medieval Warm Period?
6. Why is it that CO2 has been suddenly assumed to be the major climate factor and the rest like the sun and oceans are ignored?
7. If there is consensus on man-made climate change, then why is there so much controversy over it?
8. Do you think it’s not necessary to have skeptics in order for science to progress?
Perhaps instead of wasting taxpayer resources on the sophomoric defamation and ridicule of those who legitimately ask questions, the Helmholtz Center ought to focus on providing some clear answers for the above questions for once.
In the portrait video of the Climate Service Center featuring director Guy Brasseur, he tells us that the Climate Service Center’s job is to communicate science to society for the purpose of decision-making. Again, with its tweet, what message are they really trying to communicate by linking to defamatory Kickstarter video?

Climate Service Center director Guy Brasseur says they provide valuable information to re-insurance companies. Photo cropped from portrait video.
What was set up as a valuable communication organization, the Climate Service Center appears today to have devolved into a propaganda arm of a state-sponsored ideology – especially when one looks at the quality of the climate information they disseminate: Think for a minute, for example, how the Met Office has gotten 11 of the last 12 winter forecasts wrong and that 97% of the climate models have been wrong over the last 15 years. Is this really the information quality the public wants to have communicated to them? When information is that bad, and is packaged by ideologues with an agenda, then it is certainly not helping society. Rather it is harming it.
What’s really frightening is the seemingly close relationship that the Climate Service Center keeps with the re-insurance industry, as is exposed by the portrait video. For almost an entire segment Brasseur speaks of the valuable services they provide to the insurance industry and how important they are in helping them set their premiums! I kid you not. Brasseur proudly says:
And naturally they come to us and say, ‘Could you please tell us what we can expect in the future?'”
Wink, wink.
Gee, does anyone think there could be a conflict of interest there. This reminds us of how the Munich Re is very close to the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research (PIK). This is just explosive corruption waiting to happen. You produce the horror scenarios; we jack up the premiums!
A close look at the supervisory boards of the various institutes and insurance companies probably would yield some very interesting results and revelations. The undue influence and closeness that major reinsurance companies have with German scientific institutes is worrisome and the potential for corruption there is far too great.

"The last time we saw John Oliver on “Last Week Tonight,” the weekly comedy series he hosts for HBO, he was blowing up a giant 2016 sign in a soccer stadium, bidding farewell to a year that seemed unmatchable in its capacity for tumult and   news events. Then 2017 came along. As Mr. Oliver prepares for the   premiere of “Last Week Tonight” on Sunday, he returns to an arena where President Trump, the bête noire of the   shows, has been in charge of the country for nearly a month. During that time, the Trump administration has already made the picture more complicated for many issues that Mr. Oliver has addressed in his   segments, like net neutrality, voter fraud, torture and nuclear weapons. Now, who wants to hear some jokes? In an interview on Monday at HBO’s New York offices, Mr. Oliver, 39, said that despite some clear challenges to his way of looking at the world, he did not believe his past work had been in vain. “I’m not a complete nihilist,” he said with a laugh. “I haven’t quite got to the point where I’m going, ‘What’s the point in anything? Burn it down. ’” Though he was mum on the subject of Sunday’s episode, Mr. Oliver said “Last Week Tonight” would continue to resist the impulse to go “all Trump, all the time,” and instead try to focus on subjects not addressed by his   peers. “It’s a lot of people feeding on the same carcass,” he said. “We try to pick a different carcass because of how many different beaks have already gotten to it. ” The   Mr. Oliver did talk about how his   perspective and   experiences have informed his takes on the presidential election, the Brexit vote and Mr. Trump’s travel ban why you’d have to be a “sociopath” to think   comedy programs helped Mr. Trump win and the relationship between his show and what he considers real journalism. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How did you spend your election night? I just watched it at home, but it was the same muscle memory as the Brexit vote, as those early returns came in  —   I think I know what’s going to happen here. You’ve been living in the United States for about a decade. Do news events in Britain still have a visceral impact on you? I hadn’t left much of a career behind in England  —   I pretty quickly had flipped the switch in my head. This is my home. But Brexit was awful because it reminded me of a certain blatant ugliness in the country that I was raised in. I’d just had a baby, so I liked the idea that he’d have a British passport as well  —   which is a European passport, meaning he can live and work anywhere in Europe. From that vote, you realize his horizons have been contracted dramatically, and that becomes a physical manifestation of what is true for a lot of people. I’m very happy that he doesn’t understand anything that’s happened in the last year. You’re a   holder and the husband of a former United States Army medic. Do you fear any personal ramifications from the travel ban, which created widespread complications for immigrants and residents? Practically speaking, I should be O. K. but it’s kind of scary in a way. That pales into insignificance next to the   trauma of other people. My wife’s been in Iraq. She had a translator. So I know IRAP [the International Refugee Assistance Project] very well. They were there the whole time at J. F. K. I know some of the people who have bled for this country and are now not being let in. When I was still on a visa, I remember the third or fourth time I landed back in J. F. K. from England, catching myself thinking, Oh, great to be home. And then realizing, that is a dangerous thought when there is someone behind a glass panel deciding whether this is your home or not. I still have the basic immigrant’s crush on this country. I like the point of America, that it is diverse  —   not a reactionary idea of an America that happened after the fact. When, say, you do a long segment on “Last Week Tonight” about the importance of the   fiduciary rule, and then Trump signs an executive order that could put a halt to it, does that frustrate you?  No, but it hurts more. We’ve spent so long looking at those stories, we know how important it is. Even something like the fiduciary rule, which can seem like a luxury issue  —   that, in very meaningful ways, affects people’s lives down the line. Our researchers have been looking at the [hiring freeze on federal workers]  —   there’s a lot of veterans who are going to be adversely affected and they don’t even realize it yet. With some of these E. O. s [executive orders] it’s like a tsunami warning. You’re in real trouble and you don’t yet know because the sea looks calm. Do you accept the argument that   comedians helped Trump win, either by insulating Clinton voters from the possibility she could lose or egging on his supporters to vote for him? That is just a stick to hit someone with, knowing that it’s something that could hurt someone. What’s a thing that you like? I’ll attach something you don’t like to it. “Pancakes  —   this is why Trump won. ” But I like pancakes! I’m not saying that comedians are not, by their nature,  . But if you, as a comedian, think you got Donald Trump elected, you’re a sociopath. The election and its aftermath have brought attention to the problem of fake news. Do you think shows like “Last Week Tonight” contribute to this problem?  The phrase “fake news” has now been used so liberally, it’s meaningless. The problem with aggregation is that the very act of aggregating a piece of information assumes that somewhere along the line, there was a level of  . We are very, very strict about making sure that every piece of information that we pass along, we   independently. I do not, for a second, say that our sourcing is transferable across other political comedy shows. Mr. Trump has vociferously criticized the media  —   news outlets as well as comedy shows like “Saturday Night Live. ” Do you fear he might actually try to retaliate against his critics? What he says about journalists is a serious, lasting concern. He has proven these threats are not entirely empty. They’re sometimes promises. But “S. N. L. ” is a comedy show. What would he do, get “S. N. L. ” taken off the air? “S. N. L. ” is something he cares about. We are a meaningless mosquito that he barely hears buzzing by his ear. There is a nonzero chance that he’ll do anything. There’s a nonzero chance you and I are taken to the border this evening and deported as Mexicans. That’s probably not going to happen, but it’s not zero. [laughs] Do you feel as if you were seeing more TV journalists use some of the basic techniques “The Daily Show” developed, like juxtaposing video clips of an administration official contradicting himself?  What you’re describing just seems like basic   to expose hypocrisy. I always find it pretty dispiriting if ever I see journalists trying to tell a joke. This is not your concern. Pick a lane. You don’t need to do this. Also, almost 100 percent of the time, you’re less funny than you think you are. Although, you could absolutely apply that to most comedians. [Laughs.] In all my working years at “The Daily Show,” whenever [a TV journalist] said, “I wish we could do what you guys do”  —   you can. Just don’t tell jokes at the end. Because you can’t, and you shouldn’t. Have you been approached about hosting the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner? Oh, no. God, no. That is just such a noxious concept. I have such contempt for that, as an evening. It would seem really [awful] to go and say, “This whole thing is a horrendous farce. ” I don’t need to go and ruin their unearned evening of celebration. Any of that commentary, I can do on my own show."
"Mary McCormack Hughes has a vivid recollection of the phone call she got 35 years ago this week from Robert Durst, her   . “Have you seen Kathie?” he asked. Kathie was Kathleen Durst, Ms. Hughes’s younger sister, who at 29 was in the final months of medical school. Her marriage to Mr. Durst, the eccentric scion of a prominent New York real estate family, had splintered under Mr. Durst’s efforts to control her, repeated rounds of quarreling and, finally, violence. No, Ms. Hughes, said she had responded, but I’ve been meaning to talk to you about Kathie. Mr. Durst cut her off, saying he was going to the police, and abruptly ended the call, she said. Ms. Hughes remembers that as she hung up the phone in her East Side apartment that February evening in 1982, she turned to her husband, Tom Hughes, and said, “I think he killed her. ” Today, Mr. Durst, 73, sits in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of murder  —   not of Kathie, but of Susan Berman, a confidante who, investigators say, knew his secrets and shielded him from newspaper reporters after his wife vanished. John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, claims that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of her head at her Los Angeles home in December 2000, fearing that she would cooperate with a newly revived investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance. Mr. Durst was never charged with his wife’s killing, nor was anyone else. (Ms. Durst’s body has never been recovered.) He and his battery of lawyers have insisted that he did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know what happened to his first wife. Ms. Hughes has not paid much attention to events in Los Angeles. “I think it’s going to be a disaster,” she said, with bitterness, of the coming trial during her first interview in more than three decades, at an Upper East Side apartment building where her sister once lived with Mr. Durst. A large photograph of Kathie Durst dressed in an Annie   dress and a   hat from the Wild West hung over the fireplace. “Hollywood and publicity,” Ms. Hughes said. “They’re not really interested in my sister  —   they’re interested in Bob. I just want to find out what happened to my sister. ” The obsession nearly destroyed her. Kathie was the youngest daughter and the fifth child of a telephone company representative, who died in 1966, and a working mother. After graduating from high school in New Hyde Park on Long Island, Kathie trained as a dental hygienist and moved to a building owned by the Durst family on the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Durst oversaw the building and when the two met, there was an instant attraction. “It was a mutual attraction, a chemistry,” Ms. Hughes recalled. “He had a magnetism. Kathie had the same thing. ” The Hugheses liked Mr. Durst when he started dating Kathie, then 19, in early 1971. He was nine years older and from another world. His father, Seymour Durst, presided over a Manhattan real estate company whose towers formed the skyline. The Dursts were low key, not the stereotypical    developers. For a while, Ms. Hughes said, her sister was unaware just how wealthy the Durst family was. After their second date, Mr. Durst asked Kathie to move with him to Vermont to run a health food store. But after a short time in Vermont, the couple returned to New York, and Mr. Durst resumed working at the family real estate business. They were married in a private ceremony on his birthday, April 12, in 1973. The couple partied at Studio 54, the   disco that was a haunt for celebrities and others. They sailed on the Mediterranean Sea and traveled to Thailand. Bob and Kathie socialized with Mary and Tom, even buying a racehorse together from a friend who was a breeder. “He heard it was a tax deduction,” Tom Hughes said. “I think he liked that part of it. ” But the Dursts’ relationship took a dark turn after 1976, when Mr. Durst forced his wife to have an abortion. He didn’t want children she did. “That’s when it went south,” Mr. Hughes said. Ms. Durst sought independence, enrolling in nursing school in Danbury, Conn. The couple bought a cottage nearby, on Lake Truesdale in South Salem, N. Y. in northern Westchester County, but also had a   on Riverside Drive in Manhattan and rented an apartment on the East Side. After graduating from nursing school, Ms. Durst immediately started medical school at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, hoping to become a pediatrician. “She was excited to be a medical student,” recalled a classmate, Dr. Alicia  . “She worked hard. She always took a seat in the front row and took notes. ” By 1980, the couple quarreled frequently, Ms. Hughes said, adding that her sister often called her with accounts of their latest fight. Ms. Durst contacted a divorce lawyer. She gathered damaging material about her husband and the Durst family, she told friends and her sister. Mr. Durst has long acknowledged his marijuana use, and his wife used cocaine, according to friends and members of her family. Both had affairs, his and her friends and relatives say. Mr. Durst, they say, cut off her credit cards to keep her close. “Bob’s possessiveness was escalating into physical violence,” said a nursing school classmate of Ms. Durst’s, Eleanor Joy Schwank, during an interview in 2000. “I never witnessed it, but Kathie would call me saying, ‘Bobby is really violent. ’” Mr. Durst, impatient to leave a McCormack family gathering, yanked his wife’s hair, shocking her family, Ms. Hughes said. On another occasion, he stormed into their East Side apartment, where Ms. Durst was talking with friends, and kicked an acquaintance in the face. The man later settled a lawsuit over the episode with Mr. Durst. Three weeks before Ms. Durst disappeared, she was treated at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx for bruises she suffered during an argument with her husband, according to several friends and medical records later recovered by investigators. Ms. Durst told her sister, her friends and virtually anyone who would listen, “If anything happens to me, don’t let Bob get away with it. ” Geraldine McInerney, a friend of Ms. Hughes’s, said she had met Ms. Durst at the couple’s East Side apartment on Jan. 29, 1982. Ms. Durst wanted someone she knew to sublet the apartment so that if “the situation between her and Durst became too threatening, she would have an alternative place to stay,” Ms. McInerney said in a 1983 affidavit. It was the last time Ms. McInerney saw her. A week later, Mr. Durst walked into a Manhattan police station to file a missing person’s report. He carried a copy of New York magazine with his father’s picture and the headline “The Men Who Own New York. ” Mr. Durst told the police that he had put his wife on a train to Manhattan from Westchester County on Sunday night so that she could attend school the next day. He said he had later spoken to her by phone, after she arrived at their Riverside Drive  . Soon, the story was splashed across New York’s tabloids. Mr. Durst, who hired detectives and offered a reward, told his family, friends and the police that his wife might have run away with a drug dealer. Her family found that implausible, since she was only months away from graduating. “She always wanted to take care of children,” Mr. Hughes said. Decades later, in an interview with the producers of the   HBO documentary “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,” Mr. Durst acknowledged that much of what he had told the police was a lie. Why did he lie? “I wanted them to leave me alone,” he explained to Mr. Lewin, the Los Angeles prosecutor, during an interrogation after his 2015 arrest in New Orleans on gun charges. “I wasn’t used to somebody questioning my veracity. ” Frustrated by what they regarded as a desultory investigation by New York City detectives, Ms. Hughes and a small band of friends became amateur sleuths, tracking sightings of her sister and Mr. Durst and scouring phone records. By March 1982, they were making furtive   visits to what they believed was the scene of the crime, the stone cottage at the edge of Lake Truesdale. On one trip, Mr. Hughes found an ominous list in Mr. Durst’s handwriting in a garbage can: “town dump, bridge, dig, boat” and “shovel. ” They found Ms. Durst’s diamond earrings in her drawer at the Riverside Drive apartment, which Mr. Durst had told the police she was wearing when she disappeared. To this day, Ms. Hughes is shocked that New York City detectives never searched the cottage. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney pored over pages and pages of phone records from the cottage, the apartments and the Durst Organization that they had gotten from the detectives. Night after night, the two women matched the phone numbers to names until they discovered that Mr. Durst had made collect calls to his family’s business from Ship Bottom, N. J. shortly after his wife vanished. The calls, coupled with the list of words, led them to suspect that Ms. Durst might be buried somewhere in the nearby Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney borrowed a car and drove the investigating detectives down to Ship Bottom. But the detectives seemed uninterested, Ms. Hughes said, and the case was no longer generating headlines. Mr. Durst was not charged with any crime. Ms. Hughes and her family wrestled with Mr. Durst in Surrogate’s Court for control of Ms. Durst’s estate, but suffered another defeat in 1983. “I was just so fed up,” Ms. Hughes said. “I broke down. I couldn’t do it anymore. ” For a long time, she refused to drive a car or even leave her apartment. She focused on her two daughters, whom she had long neglected. In the end, Ms. Hughes was left without answers as to her sister’s fate. But she never lost her conviction about Mr. Durst’s culpability. Ms. Hughes, her husband and Ms. McInerney cooperated with an investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance that was started in 2000 by an enterprising State Police investigator, Joe Becerra, only to be disappointed again when the local district attorney did not indict Mr. Durst. In recent years, Ms. Hughes and other members of her family have gone back to Surrogate’s Court to fight Mr. Durst and to have her sister declared dead as of Jan. 31, 1982. Their mother, Ann McCormack, died in May at 102, without knowing what happened to Kathie. “It’s absurd that after 35 years New York has not charged him with murder,” Robert Abrams, whose law firm, Abrams Fensterman, is representing Ms. Durst’s family, said of Mr. Durst. “If they’re not going to do it criminally, we’ll do it civilly. ” Whatever happens in Los Angeles, Mr. Durst will return to federal prison to serve the remaining time on a   gun conviction. “We want some sort of peace, some answers as to where she’s at,” Ms. Hughes said. “Why couldn’t he just tell us? He has nothing to lose. He’s going to stay in jail. ”"

Yesterday Jim Hansen, now with Columbia University, and several of his colleagues released their summary of 2017 global temperatures. Their history, published by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has constantly been evolving in ways that make the early years colder and the later years hot. I recently posted on how this can happen, and the differences between these modified datasets and those determined objectively (i.e. without human meddling).   
  
  
For a couple years I have been pointing out (along with Judith Curry and others) that the latest fad—which puts a _lot_ of warming in recent data—is to extend high‐​latitude land weather station data far out over the Arctic Ocean. Hansen’s crew takes stations north of 64⁰ latitude and extends them an astounding 1200 kilometers into the ocean.   
  
  
This, plainly speaking, is a violation of one of the most fundamental principles of thermodynamics, which is that when matter is changing its state (from, say, solid to liquid), a stirred fluid will remain at “freezing” until it is all liquid, whereupon warming will commence.   
  
  
This also applies in the Arctic, where the fluid is often stirred by strong winds. So if, say, Resolute, one of the northernmost land stations, is 50⁰F, and the Arctic is mixed water‐​ice (it always is), that 50 degrees will be extended out 1200 kilometers where the air‐​sea boundary temperature has to be around 30⁰F, the freezing point of seawater up there.   
  
  
Hansen et al. did pay some attention to this, noting this extension, which they normally apply to their data, was responsible for making 2017 the second‐​warmest year in their record. If they “only” extended 250km (still dicey), it would drop their “global” temperatures by a tenth of a degree, which would send the year down a rank. The result of all of this is that the big “spike” at the end of their record is in no small part due to the 1200km extension that turns thermodynamics on its head.   
  
  
There’s another interesting pronouncement in the NASA announcement; many people have noted that the sun is a bit cool in recent years, and that it continues to trend slightly downward. The changes in its radiance are probably good for a tenth of a degree (C) of surface temperature or so. Hansen et al. use this to provide covering fire should warming stall out yet again:   




Therefore, because of the combination of the strong 2016 El Niño and the phase of the solar cycle, it is plausible, if not likely, that the next 10 years of global temperature change will leave an impression of a ‘global warming hiatus’.



The significance of this will all fall out in the next year or so. If temperatures head back down all the way to their pre‐​El Niño levels, that will ultimately bring back the post‐​1996 “pause.” We’re going to guess they are going to remain a couple of tenths of a degree above that, based on what happened after the big one in 1998, where they settled a small amount above the pre‐​El Niño of the earlier 1990s.   
  
  
If the recent warming rate (adjusting for El Niño) continues, we’ll hear that it is doing so “despite” the sun. Given that one year (2018) can have little influence on a recent trendline, that copy may already have been written!   
  
  
All of this begs the question: Hansen notes in his release that the warming rate since 1970 has been fairly constant, about 0.17⁰C per decade, and didn’t note that the average of the UN’s climate models say it should be about twice that now. More lukewarming.

The clownshow that is Tasmanian politics careens on, honking and hooting, overstuffed with idiots playing to the children in the crowd. Launceston City Council, which is the political equivalent of being appointed General Manager of your local Bunnings sausage sizzle, is going all-out to cement Tasmania’s status of capital of virtue-signalling numpties.



Launceston will shift its citizenship ceremonies and awards to January 25, shunning Australia Day for its links to Aboriginal dispossession.



The Launceston City Council on Thursday unanimously voted to shift the January 26 ceremonies to the preceding day.



We in the north of the island used to pride ourselves on being the sensible half of the state, leaving all that “woke” business to Sandy Bay wankers in Hobart and nosey-nanna Boomers in their Glamorgan retirement villages. Not any more, unfortunately.



Never mind that Launceston’s CBD is a wasteland of empty shopfronts, local roads are potholed and gridlocked, and the northern campus of UTAS is shedding students at a rate of knots, this muppet-collective of watermelons and theolibs have got the really **important** stuff to deal with. After all, they’ve already saved the planet by declaring a “climate emergency”.



Of course, there’s no clownshow in Tasmania without Punch. Competing with Sue Hickey for the dubious distinction of being the biggest pimple on the arse of Tasmanian politics is professional whinger extraordinaire, Michael Mansell.



“They are trying to be inclusive and to represent all people in their jurisdiction, not just white people, and their decision is full of common sense,” said veteran Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell.



With his race-blinkered vision, Mansell apparently fails to notice the scores of Australians of all ethnicities and colours who joyfully celebrate their national day on 26 January every year.



He urged the federal government to stop threatening councils who shifted citizenship ceremonies from January 26, claiming it was losing the battle.



“The federal government is saying ‘there’s no freedom of speech here — you will do it our way or you will be punished’,” he said. “That approach is doomed to fail because you can’t make 24 million people abide by something that is irrational.”



That’s never stopped Mansell before. Despite his bluster, 24 million Australians completely disagree with him. That’s the number of Australians whom recent polls consistently show are opposed to changing the date of Australia Day. **This isn’t about “freedom of speech”, either.** No-one’s stopping these cretins babbling whatever they like about Australia Day. The government is simply under no obligation to alter a gazetted public holiday because of it.



Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz accused the Launceston council of putting “virtue signalling” ahead of the wishes of the majority of ratepayers.



“It is out of touch with the ratepayers — we know that 75 per cent of Australians support Australia Day on the 26th of January,” Senator Abetz told The Australian. “Why on earth do you pick the 25th of January? What’s the tradition? What’s the historical reason for it?’



“The only rationale that can be offered is that it’s not the 26th of January. That’s hardly the basis to make a considered decision.”



I’m not a huge fan of Eric, either, but he’s bang on the money, here.



In the end though, the council will have to reckon with the Commonwealth, who actually hold responsibility for Australia Day. Hopefully, Scott Morrison will give them the thick ear they deserve.



“If some councils, as we’ve seen, want to play games, well, you don’t have to run citizenship ceremonies, other arrangements will be made,” the prime minister said. “But we will not undermine Australia’s national day […] I’m a prime minister for standards.”

Love him or hate him, he’s making an impact. I thought it worthwhile to make his testimony available to read.

Submitted Written Testimony of Climate Depot’s Marc Morano at Congressional Hearing on Climate Change: ‘The Origins and Response to Climate Change’


Morano to the U.S. Congress: ‘The scientific reality is that on virtually every claim — from A-Z — the claims of the promoters of man-made climate fears are failing, and in many instances the claims are moving in the opposite direction. The global warming movement is suffering the scientific death of a thousand cuts.’

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
England's month-long lockdown ends on Wednesday, with a ""three-tier system"" due to return following a vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.
All areas in the Eastern region were due to be in tier two - high alert, meaning people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule-of-six applying outdoors.
The rate in Luton was above 250 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 27 November - the 32nd worst council district in England - but it continues to see a fall in cases week on week.
Northampton, Peterborough, and Broxbourne in Hertfordshire have a rate above the England-wide average, but all have fallen week on week.
Every district in Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire have falls in their case rates, except for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire.
Below is a table showing the rate of cases per 100,000 people by council district in the week to 27 November, and the figure at the same point a week ago.
Below is how many people have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 November per county, and the figure at the same point a week ago.
The table below shows how many people have died from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBerlin’s leftist, climate-cultie TAZ here reports on how indoor pot growers are switching over to LED lighting to grow their clandestine cannabis. Like, we’re saving the planet too, dude!

Image cropped from Cheech and Chong film: Up in Smoke, Paramount Pictures.
The TAZ article features a photo of a US grower with the caption:
Indoor growing in Denver: Works better with LED lamps and supposedly more environmentally friendly.”

The problem with regular lamps is that they consume up to 600 watts per square meter and lead to really high (no pun intended) electric bills. Not only does this cut into growers’ profits, but excessive power consumption also raises suspicions at the power companies. The energy saving LED lights now do a better job at hiding suspicious electricity consumption and at the same time solve the problems of keeping the growing basement or garage cool, the TAZ writes.
There’s another security advantage: high electric bills are not the only way of detecting illegal indoor growing activity, the TAZ writes that the German government, for example, uses helicopters equipped with infrared cameras to sense the heat generated by indoor growers. The TAZ writes that this method of detection will have a much more difficult time now that growers are switching to the low-energy LED lighting.
Another savings, the TAZ writes, is that LED lighting with a rating of 50,000 hours have a far longer lifetime before they burn out.
Now comes the really good news for cannabis connoisseurs: LED light frequency can be precisely adjusted and thus help to yield crops that have premium quality, i.e. more high for the light.
Wow, now growers can feel good about growing climate-friendly pot. And potheads will soon be able to smoke weed without leaving a much of a carbon footprint. Smoke a joint – save the planet!

"WASHINGTON  —   Margaret Thatcher famously declared that “we must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend. ” In a speech 32 years ago, Mrs. Thatcher, the British prime minister facing a threat from the Irish Republican Army, said she was not calling for censorship but proposing that “a voluntary code of conduct” for journalists might keep them from aiding “the terrorists’ morale or their cause. ” It was a   statement of a familiar point, one made repeatedly in the decades since: that the news media plays a crucial role in amplifying the effect of terrorist violence and giving it exactly the political import the terrorists crave. So for some experts who study terrorism, President Trump’s assertion this week that the news media has actually been ignoring and covering up terrorist attacks came as a surprise. “It’s totally astonishing,” said Martha Crenshaw, a Stanford scholar who has written on terrorism since the 1970s. “It has no basis in fact whatsoever. The criticism has always gone the other way. ” Other experts said Mr. Trump’s claim had less to do with the facts about terrorism coverage than with the new administration’s political goals, notably defending his executive order that temporarily bans refugees and visitors from some Muslim countries. In the face of the onslaught of legal challenges and outspoken opposition to the order, they said, the president has an interest in persuading Americans that the terrorist threat from abroad is worse than the news media has revealed. Years of books and articles critiquing the “symbiosis” of terrorism and news media coverage have pointed out that terrorists usually seek to promote a political or ideological cause and use spectacular violence with the specific goal of attracting attention. News executives, while sometimes expressing mixed feelings about giving terrorists what they seek, have generally felt obligated to give such attacks ample coverage. “It’s incredible to say that the media does not give enough attention to terrorism,” said David C. Rapoport, a retired U. C. L. A. political science professor considered a founder of terrorism studies. He said modern global terrorism arose in the 1880s in Russia in parallel with, and partly owing to, the rise of mass daily newspapers. In the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage  —   think of the fizzled   underwear bomb on a   airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V.   to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010. Though no target was harmed, both attempts drew mountains of coverage, much of it focused on how terrorists went undetected. But in an appearance Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Trump reviewed the horrors of more recent attacks, including those inspired or directed by the Islamic State, and pronounced the coverage inadequate. “Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on   as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino,” he said at the headquarters of Central Command, which carries out military operations in the Middle East. “All over Europe it’s happening. It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. ” The president did not explain the reasons he believed journalists might have for not reporting Islamist terrorism. But in response to a wave of skeptical comment, the White House on Monday night released a list of 78 attacks around the world since September 2014. “Most have not received the media attention they deserved,” the accompanying statement said. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, stood by the point on Tuesday, though adjusting the language. “It’s becoming too often that we’re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve,” he said. “And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. ” It was a subjective judgment only a dozen of the 78 listed attacks occurred in the United States, and most resulted in few or no deaths, reducing their prominence in American news reports. The list omitted terrorist attacks by   including white supremacists like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine   at a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015. But news databases show virtually all 78 attacks got some coverage, and the big attacks in Paris Brussels Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. played out for days or weeks on cable television and news sites. Peter D. Feaver, a political scientist at Duke who studies public opinion on national security issues, said he saw no basis for the White House claims. “I don’t think there’s evidence of the press underreporting terrorism,” he said. “The corporate incentives run the other way. ” But Mr. Feaver, who served in the George W. Bush White House but publicly opposed Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, said the president’s remarks, if not literally true, nonetheless play out in a larger, partisan debate about terrorism. Democrats sometimes accused the Bush administration of exaggerating the terrorist threat. Republicans often charged President Barack Obama of minimizing the danger and embellishing his own successes against Al Qaeda. By suggesting that the news media is hiding the truth about the menace from “radical Islamic terrorists,” Mr. Trump may rally his base behind the executive order and other measures still to come. Mr. Spicer suggested as much, saying the executive order and the president’s remarks in Tampa have the same motive: “because he cares about making sure that we don’t have attacks in this country, that we’re protected. ” Mr. Trump wants Americans, he said, to “understand the unwavering commitment that the president has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. ” Preventing terrorist attacks is, of course, a goal that is pretty much universally shared. But Mr. Trump’s loose relationship with facts, and his eagerness to fault journalists and judges, make some think he has a less lofty goal as well: to find scapegoats for terrorist attacks that sooner or later are certain to happen. “  blame,” said Ms. Crenshaw, the Stanford terrorism researcher. “Nothing’s happened. But if something does happen, he can blame the judiciary and the news media. ”"

Press Release: **New Conservative**



Mainstream media, as the purveyors of truth and source of balanced information, took another backward step yesterday with the announcement by _Stuff_ that most New Zealand organisations had joined 170 media outlets from around the world in the “Covering Climate Now” project.



“The last bastion for protecting free speech, which indeed advocates for independent and informed thought, has been media. Stuff’s announcement shows how far we have strayed from this value,” observes New Conservative Deputy Leader Elliot Ikilei.



With the comment by _Stuff_ editor in chief, Patrick Crewsdon, that the aim will be to “make the realities of climate change feel urgent, tangible and unignorable for New Zealanders”, it is clear that the objective is to present **selective information** designed to adjust public thought to what some think ‘should’ be thought.



“One of the principles of free speech is that there be opportunity for open, informed discourse on important issues”, says Elliot Ikilei. “When the media advises that they will present information that dictates the conclusions that are to be reached, they fail the foundations upon which journalism was built.”



Working extensively with young people and at-risk youth, Elliot is only too aware of the stresses and anxiety that exist. Failing to present balanced and detailed information, and robbing individuals of the ability to draw their own conclusions, is unnecessarily adding to a sense of despair and panic.



“This approach, to manipulate mainstream media leading up to the United Nations Climate Action Summit, is irresponsible and does a disservice to those working in journalism who are committed to presenting facts rather than opinion”, observes Elliot.



“New Conservative believes that to achieve real pollution solutions we must have information that can be relied upon, and most New Zealanders rely on media sources to at least introduce this information”, concludes Elliot.



“To have a media outlet as popular as _Stuff_ openly state that they will only present information that pre-determines public opinion, highlights the importance of protecting the freedom of individuals to openly debate issues of the day.”

Willis recent post “Modern Piracy” is the inspiration for the title, along with math challenged pirate marketing team. This in-your-face sales pitch to renew my Avast Antivirus popped up today on my desktop, but the piracy is in the math:


Gosh, should I really renew with a company that can’t offer sales incentives rooted in simple math? That 3 year plan is a real winner (for them) compared to annual renewal.
I think I’ll revert to the free version or use Microsoft’s free AV solution. Arrrrrr!

"HOUSTON  —   There was the game on the field, and there was the one watched through the political prism of these times. On social media, the Atlanta Falcons were not just the N. F. C. champions, they were   for   ferment, coming from a staunchly Democratic city and facing a Patriots team whose owner, head coach and starting quarterback are all friends with the president, to varying degrees. “Falcons are fun and their biggest stars aren’t pro Trump,” JayZito wrote on Twitter. “I’m a Falcons fan today. ” Not long before the game started, President Trump, in an interview on Fox, which was broadcasting the game, predicted a Patriot win by 8 points in part out of support for his friends. That prediction was the object of ridicule as Atlanta surged ahead, but then it ended up appearing prescient as the Patriots stormed back to win,   in the first Super Bowl overtime. Mr. Trump did not attend the game, opting for a traditional    party near his    vacation home in South Florida. (Social media users dissected a picture of Mr. Trump and his family not looking enthusiastic at a table there and took sometimes harsh note of Mr. Trump’s departure with nearly an hour and a half left in the game.) Vice President Mike Pence attended the game and drew some boos when he was shown on a stadium screen talking with James Baker, who served as secretary of state under former President George Bush. Mr. Bush did the opening coin toss from a wheelchair on the field, accompanied by the former first lady Barbara Bush. A succession of commercials with themes of inclusion, immigration and multiculturalism were seen by many viewers as commentary on Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration and his calls for a wall along the Mexican border. One commercial made by   follows the path of one of the company’s   Adolphus Busch, as he immigrated from Germany to the United States. The ad was criticized by some   commentators who created a hashtag, #BoycottBudweiser. The actor Morgan Freeman appeared in a commercial for Turkish Airlines, speaking about “bridging worlds and finding delight in our differences. ” Before, during and after the game, people talked about an ad for the   company 84 Lumber that featured imagery of a Mexican mother and daughter on a journey north for a better life in the United States. The company deleted some scenes depicting a border wall but included the full ad on its website. The   website Breitbart News, in its live coverage of the game, grew exasperated. “These commercials have been a bonanza of leftist activism: two immigration commercials, a feminist commercial, now an eco wacko commercial? Am I missing anything?” one of the editors wrote. About the only aspect of the game that generated a surprisingly more muted political discussion than expected was the one everybody seemed to think would cause a stir: the halftime show by Lady Gaga, a persistent critic of Mr. Trump. With a dash of patriotic imagery  —   red and blue drones forming the shape of the United States  —   she mostly stuck to her hits, with only a few gestures that some interpreted as subtle digs at the president. During her song “Million Reasons” she hugged a woman of uncertain ethnicity and sang, “Why don’t you stay,” a move that people on Twitter thought was a statement about race and immigration. The N. F. L. tried in its own way to unify the country for a few hours. Fans at the stadium were given small flags to wave during the singing of the national anthem, and when the teams ran onto the field, they were led by soldiers and sailors holding large American flags. The league even ran a   commercial called “Inside These Lines” to show that “the power of football” can “bring people together. ” Still, outside the stadium it was another story. The president’s unabashed support for the Patriots turned into a punch line on social media when the Patriots fell behind by 25 points early in the second half. Some fans accused the president of jinxing the team. In Houston, hundreds of people protested the president and his policies near the stadium, crossing paths with thousands of fans heading to the game. Chants of “Black Lives Matter” were applauded by Falcons fans. Similar protests took place last week near an N. F. L.  park downtown. Atlanta, the capital of a solidly red state, was suddenly adopted as a darling of   football fans. One commenter on Twitter joked, “The Falcons respect an independent judiciary,” a dig at the president’s criticism of the federal judge in Seattle who temporarily halted the refugee ban. Some Patriots fans, uneasy with their team’s link to the president, encouraged fellow fans to donate to organizations like the N. A. A. C. P. and Planned Parenthood each time the Patriots scored. After the game, Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Patriots, reiterated his vow not to attend the customary congratulatory ceremony at the White House, because he opposes Mr. Trump. Still, at the end Mr. Trump exulted, once again stoking support and derision. “What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots,’’ he wrote on Twitter. “Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!”"

Earlier this month, I detailed at some length why claims about the purported economic harms of piracy, offered by supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT-IP Act (PIPA), ought to be treated with much more skepticism than they generally get from journalists and policymakers. My own view is that this ought to be rather secondary to the policy discussion: SOPA and PIPA would be ineffective mechanisms for addressing the problem, and a terrible idea for many other reasons, even if the numbers were exactly right. No matter how bad last season's crops were, witch burnings are a poor policy response. Fortunately, legislators finally seem to be cottoning on to this: SOPA now appears to be on ice for the time being, and PIPA's own sponsors are having second thoughts about mucking with the Internet's Domain Name System.   
  
That said, I remain a bit amazed that it's become an indisputable premise in Washington that there's an enormous piracy problem, that it's having a devastating impact on U.S. content industries, and that _some_ kind of aggressive new legislation is needed _tout suite_ to stanch the bleeding. Despite the fact that the Government Accountability Office recently concluded that it is ""difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy as a whole,"" our legislative class has somehow determined that—among all the dire challenges now facing the United States— _this_ is an urgent priority. Obviously, there's quite a lot of copyrighted material circulating on the Internet without authorization, and other things equal, one would like to see less of it. But does the best available evidence show that this is inflicting such catastrophic economic harm—that it is depressing so much output, and destroying so many jobs—that Congress has no option but to Do Something immediately? Bearing the GAO's warning in mind, the data we _do_ have doesn't remotely seem to justify the DEFCON One rhetoric that now appears to be obligatory on the Hill.   
  
The International Intellectual Property Alliance—a kind of meta-trade association for all the content industries, and a zealous prophet of the piracy apocalypse, released a report back in November meant to establish that copyright industries are so economically valuable that they merit more vigorous government protection. But it actually paints a picture of industries that, far from being ""killed"" by piracy, are _already_ weathering a harsh economic climate better than most, and have far outperformed the overall U.S. economy through the current recession. The ""core copyright industries"" have, unsurprisingly, shed some jobs over the past few years, but again, compared with the rest of the economy, employment seems to have held relatively stable at a time when you might expect cash-strapped consumers to be turning to piracy to save money.   
  
Since the core function of copyright is to incentivize the production of creative works, it's also worth looking for signs of declining output associated with filesharing. Empirically, it's surprisingly hard to find an effect. Rather, a recent survey study by Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business School concluded that ""data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers"" from producing more works, at least in the U.S. market.   
  
So, for instance, Nielsen SoundScan data shows new album releases stood at 35,516 in 2000, peaked at 106,000 in 2008, and (amidst a general recession) fell back to mid-decade levels of about 75,000 for 2010. That's against a general background of falling sales since 2004—mostly explained by factors unrelated to piracy—which finally seems to have reversed in 2011. The actual picture is probably somewhat better than that, because SoundScan data are markedly incomplete when it comes to the releases by indie artists who've benefited most from the rise of digital distribution.   




If we look at movies, the numbers compiled by the industry statistics site Box Office Mojo show an average of 558 releases from American studios over the past decade, which rises to 578 if you focus on just the past five years. The average for the _previous_ decade—before illicit movie downloads were even an option on most people's radar—is 472 releases per year. (As we learn from a recent Congressional Research Service report, it's weirdly hard to detect a strong overall correlation between output and employment in the motion picture industry, which actually fell slightly from 1998 to 2008, even as profits and CEO pay soared. One reason the growing trend in recent decades for ""Hollywood"" features to actually be produced in Canada or Australia.)   
  
That's all very nice, one might object, but wouldn't these heartening numbers be _even higher_ if labels and studios could recapture some of the revenue lost to illicit downloads? Well, they surely _might_ —but it's not nearly as clear as you'd think.   
  
One reason is that they already _are_ recapturing much of that revenue through ""complementary"" purchases. As Oberholzer-Gee observes, recording industry numbers show large increases in concert revenues corresponding to the drop in recorded music sales. That suggests that, as people discover new artists by sampling downloaded albums online, they're shifting consumption _within_ the sector to live performances. In other words, people have a roughly constant ""music budget,"" and what they don't spend on the albums they've downloaded gets spent on seeing that new band they discovered. For the firms that specifically make their money from the sale of recordings, that may seem like cold comfort, but if we're concerned with the _music_ industry as a whole, it's a wash. Something similar might occur with respect to purchases of merchandise based on licensed film properties.   
  
Another factor is that, notwithstanding projections of a ""long tail"" effect resulting from lower search and distribution costs in the digital era, most entertainment industries continue to operate on a ""tournament"" or ""lottery"" model, where a few hits generate jackpot revenues, sufficient to make up for losses on the majority of new products. Unsurprisingly, the most heavily pirated movies each year tend to be the ones that are also highly successful at the box office and in DVD sales, with similar patterns in album downloads. In other words, bleeding revenue to piracy is going to be a problem to the extent that your product is a hit, in a market where the core uncertainty about this crucial fact (at the time when the decision whether to greenlight production is made) looms a lot larger than the marginal loss from illicit downloads if you _are_ successful.   
  
It's a tricky but more or less tractable problem to estimate roughly how many full-time jobs you'll need regionally to support one additional $150 million movie production next year. It's a totally different question how aggregate sectoral employment in a volatile and evolving industry changes based on investor responses to a $150 million across-the-board drop in the size of the total film jackpot, especially given that arcane financial arrangements are one place Hollywood does show a genius for constantly adapting its business model. If you want to know how many people are getting laid off when McDonald's revenues drop, it makes a difference whether it's each of 13,000 franchises earning $100 less per year, or one franchise earning $1.3 million less, even though the total reduction is the same.   
  
Finally, _more demand for content_ being captured by the content industries is not always the same thing as _demand for more content_ , in the sense of ""a greater variety of output."" I noted earlier that the past few years have seen a significant spike in the number of movie titles released annually. But as the _Los Angeles Times_ reported in 2008, studio executives soon began complaining about a ""glut"" of new movies, many of which were targeted at the same demographics, and therefore cannibalizing their own audiences. As one executive suggested, that meant that (at least in a market dominated by a few huge distributors) releasing _fewer_ titles could yield higher profits—and, indeed, the number of titles released in the following two years dropped back to mid-decade levels. The key point here is that shifting some portion of the pirate audience to some form of legal viewing doesn't necessarily change this basic calculus, because there's an upper bound to the number of hours most people are going to spend watching (say) racing movies, whether they're paying for the privilege or not. Rising demand can just as easily, for instance, bid up star salaries for a fixed number of films.   
  
The point here isn't that piracy by American consumers is somehow completely independent from output or employment rates in the content industries—though, again, that's not at all the same thing as the _overall U.S. employment rate_. Obviously, at _some_ level it has to have some effect. But the link is, to use the technical economic term, _weirder_ than in many other sectors of the economy. In many industries, the relationship between consumer spending and job creation is _relatively_ straightforward. If demand for widgets or restaurant meals rises, satisfying that demand requires a roughly linear increase in widget factories and restaurants, in hiring of widget-makers and cooks and waiters, and in purchases of the raw material inputs for those goods. Distribution of copyrighted content—and in particular digital distribution over the Internet—is a bit more complicated, for precisely the same reason piracy is an issue: once the first copy of a work has been created, an unlimited number of additional units (of the digital product) can be produced at effectively zero cost.   
  
Let's imagine, implausibly, that a measure like SOPA _did_ manage to reduce online piracy by U.S. consumers by some meaningful amount. A small potion of that reduction, the minority of downloads representing legal purchases displaced by file sharing, would translate into sales for the content industries. What form would these take? It seems reasonable to suppose that the majority of people who were previously getting their music and movies from The Pirate Bay are not typically lining up to buy shiny plastic discs at Wal-Mart. Rather, they're probably disproportionately displacing _legal digital downloads_ from venues like iTunes and Amazon, or subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, which are pretty clearly where the overall market is quickly going anyway. (Apparently, literal thieves don't even bother stealing physical media anymore.) For movies, there's probably also some displacement of theatrical ticket sales, though as the theatrical experience is in many ways a distinct good, it's hard to say how much substitution it's reasonable to expect.   
  
In the very short term, increased legal purchases of digital content wouldn't seem likely to generate many additional jobs. If spending in the physical retail sector jumps 20 percent, shops need to hire more clerks, and their suppliers more manufacturing workers, to meet the increased demand. If spending in the iTunes store jumps 20 percent, Apple probably needs to pay a few bucks more for bandwidth and electricity, but basically everyone just gets to smile and pocket the extra profit. The jobs effects estimates we're seeing tossed around, however, are coming from a 2007 study that would have had to employ, at the most recent, adjustments made several years before _that_ to the benchmark multipliers the Bureau of Economic Analysis developed in 2002. Even leaving aside its many other problems, then, the job impact estimates in that study would have been largely based on legacy assumptions from a brick-and-mortar economy. (The loss estimates relied on would also, necessarily, fail to account for the recent rise of popular, legal streaming services that have likely lured many consumers back from the pirate market. There is, alas, no very good data here, but I'd wager Hulu and Netflix have done exponentially more to reduce piracy losses than enforcement crackdowns ever will.) In any event, you'd expect the most _immediate_ effect of consumer spending shifts from widgets and restaurants to digital downloads would be, if anything, fewer _net_ jobs. The output and employment effects, rather, would show up in the longer term as lower returns reduce incentives to produce new content—and hire the workers needed to support that production. For some of the reasons discussed above, though, empirically there's just not much evidence for a dramatic effect of this kind.   
  
No doubt piracy is costing the content industries _something_ —or they wouldn't be throwing so much money at Congress in support of this kind of legislation. If we could wave a magic wand and have less piracy, obviously that would be good. But in the real world, where enforcement has direct costs to the taxpayer, regulation has costs on the industries it burdens, and the reduction in piracy they're likely to produce is very small, it seems important to point out that the credible evidence for the _magnitude_ of the harm is fairly thin. As a rough analogy, since antipiracy crusaders are fond of equating filesharing with shoplifting: suppose the CEO of Wal-Mart came to Congress demanding a $50 million program to deploy FBI agents to frisk suspicious-looking teens in towns near Wal-Marts. A lawmaker might, without for one instant doubting that shoplifiting is a bad thing, question whether this is really the optimal use of federal law enforcement resources. The CEO indignantly points out that shoplifting _kills one million adorable towheaded orphans_ each year. The proof is right here in this study by the Wal-Mart Institute for Anti-Shoplifting Studies. The study sources this dramatic claim to a newspaper article, which quotes the CEO of Wal-Mart asserting (on the basis of private data you can't see) that shoplifting kills hundreds of orphans annually. And as a footnote explains, it seemed prudent to round up to a million. I wish this were _just_ a joke, but as readers of my previous post will recognize, that's literally about the level of evidence we're dealing with here.   
  
In short, piracy is certainly one problem in a world filled with problems. But politicians and journalists seem to have been persuaded to take it largely on faith that it's a uniquely dire and pressing problem that demands dramatic remedies with little time for deliberation. On the data available so far, though, reports of the death of the industry seem much exaggerated.

Aaron M. McCright – duped by the 97% consensus number
But, we all know that 97% consensus talking point is simply based on a handful of actual climate  responding to a broad questionnaire combined with some statistical spin to give the desired result. Apparently, that’s good enough for low information folks, even the researcher in this story, MSU’s Aaron M. McCright is taken in by the spin.
From Michigan State University:
US residents who believe in the scientific consensus on global warming are more likely to support government action to curb emissions, regardless of whether they are Republican or Democrat, according to a study led by a Michigan State University sociologist.
However, a political divide remains on the existence of climate change despite the fact that the vast majority of scientists believe it is real, said Aaron M. McCright, associate professor in Lyman Briggs College and the Department of Sociology.

The study, in the journal Climatic Change, is one of the first to examine the influence of political orientation on perceived scientific agreement and support for government action to reduce emissions.
“The more people believe scientists agree about climate change, the more willing they are to support government action, even when their party affiliation is taken into account,” McCright said. “But there is still a political split on levels of perceived scientific agreement, in that fewer Republicans and conservatives than Democrats and liberals believe there is a scientific consensus.”
McCright and colleagues analyzed a Gallup survey of 1,024 adults who were asked about their views on climate change.
The results reaffirm the success of what McCright calls the “denial machine” – an organized movement to undercut the scientific reality of climate change during the past two decades.
McCright said the first step in dealing with climate change is getting both sides of the political spectrum to accept the scientific consensus. At that point, he said, policymakers can go about the task of coming up with an approach to combat it.
He said both government and industry should be involved in that effort.
“Certainly we can’t solve all our problems with global warming through government regulations – in fact, for some problems, government regulations might make it worse,” McCright said. “And so we need a combination of market-based solutions and government regulations.”
McCright’s co-authors are Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University and Chenyang Xiao of American University.

Paradox (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Theories that can be easily tested should have a high degree of consensus among researchers. Those involving chaotic and less testable questions – climate change or economic growth, physiology or financial markets – ought to have a greater level of scientific disagreement. Yet this is hardly the case for climate science. In the Paradox of Consensus, we illustrate that the greater the level of consensus for certain classes of hypotheses (those that are difficult to test) the less truth we should assign to them.
Guest Essay By D. RYAN BRUMBERG and MATTHEW BRUMBERG
The moon is not made of cheese, the earth is not flat, and lightning may strike the same place twice. We believe these claims to be true, yet it is unlikely that most readers have personally confirmed each of them. Because it would be nigh impossible for anyone to verify all they take as true, most individuals arrive at their worldview by following the beliefs of others (often “experts”). While there can be good reason to accept an idea based on its popularity, this consensus heuristic must be used with care. There must be a sufficient number of others who did arrive (and continue to arrive) at the same conclusion through independent verification and testing. When this condition is not met, the results can be catastrophic (recall the Challenger disaster). Instead of independent observers arriving at the same conclusion, we risk an information cascade. This failing goes by many names—argumentum ad populum, groupthink, the “bandwagon effect”—but its function is the same: increasing numbers of people will buy into an idea simply because many others already believe it.  
Consensus, in and of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing. The more easily testable and verifiable a theory, the less debate we would expect. There is little disagreement, for example, about the sum of one plus one or the average distance of the earth from the sun. But as a question becomes more complex and less testable, we would expect an increasing level of disagreement and a lessening of the consensus—think: the existence of god, the best band since the Beatles, or the grand unified theory of physics. On such topics, independent minds can—and should—differ.
We can use a simple formula to express how an idea’s popularity correlates with its verifiability. Let us introduce the K/C ratio—the ratio of “knowability,” a broad term loosely encapsulating how possible it is to reduce uncertainty about an idea’s correctness, to “consensus,” a measure of the idea’s popularity and general acceptance. Topics that are easily knowable (K ~ 1) should have a high degree of consensus (C ~ 1), whereas those that are impossible to verify (K ~ 0) should have a low degree of consensus (C ~ 0). When the ratio deviates too far from the perfect ratio of 1, either from too much consensus or too little, there is a mispricing of knowledge. Indeed, in cases of extreme deviations from the perfect ratio, additional support for a concept with such a lopsided K/C ratio increasingly subtracts from its potential veracity. This occurs because ideas exist not simply at a single temporal point, but rather evolve over the sweep of time. At the upper reaches of consensus, there is less updating of views to account for new information—so much so that supporters of the status quo tend to suppress new facts and hypothesis. Government agencies deny funding to ‘sham’ scientists, tenure boards dissuade young researchers from pursuing ‘the wrong’ track, and the establishment quashes heretical ideas.

Consider the belief that the sun, moon, and stars circle the earth—a reasonable initial proposition. Yet, as additional facts became available (Copernicus, Brahe, Galileo), the dogmatic believers of the consensus condemned these observations as heresy. A world with a less skewed K/C ratio (lower level of consensus given low knowability) would have advanced to the heliocentric model sooner. Given that we know not the evolutionary stage for any current theory, we arrive thus at the unexpected conclusion that when knowability is low, as the level of consensus increases (without a commensurate increase in knowability), there should be a decrease in the probability assigned to the truth of the matter. While not always clear why the K/C ratio can become highly skewed, one interpretation is that more than just the search for knowledge is at play.
To see how this works in practice, we turn to the evergreen topic of climate change. Notwithstanding the underlying ecological threat of climate change itself, the debate about how to confront human-caused global warming has spawned unprecedented financial, political, and social risks of its own. Entire industries face extinction as the world’s governments seek to impose trillions of dollars of taxes on carbon emissions. The New York Times’s Thomas Friedman approvingly writes that Australian politicians—not to mention public figures through the world—now risk “political suicide” if they deny climate change. But if carbon dioxide turns out not to be the boogey-man that climate scientists have made it out to be, tens of trillions will be wasted in unneeded remediation. Much of the world—billions of humans—will endure a severely diminished quality of life with nothing to show for it. The growth trajectory of the world in the twenty-first century may well depend more on the “truth” of climate change ex ante than ex post.
With climate change, as in many areas of scientific complexity, we can (and do) use models to understand the world. But models have their problems. This is particularly true when dealing with complex, non-linear systems with a multitude of recursive feedback loops, in which small variations produce massive shifts in the long-term outcome. Pioneered by the mathematicians Edward Lorenz and Benoit Mandelbrot, chaos theory helped explain the intractability of certain problems. Readers of pop science will be familiar with the term the “butterfly effect,” in which “the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set[s] off a tornado in Texas.” The earth’s climate is one such dynamic, chaotic system and it is within the whirling, turbulent vortex of unpredictability that the modern climate scientists must tread.
And boldly have they stepped into the breach. The scope of agreement achieved by the world’s climate scientists is breathtaking. To first approximation, around 97% agree that human activity, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, causes global warming. So impressed was the Norwegian Nobel Committee by the work of the Inter-governmental Committee on Climate Change and Al Gore “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change” that it awarded them the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. So many great minds cannot possibly be wrong, right?
Yet something nags us about this self-congratulatory consensus. Our intuition is that this narrow distribution of opinions yields a knowability to consensus ratio far removed from the perfect ratio of 1. To reach their conclusions, climate scientists have to (a) uncover the (historical) drivers of climate, (b) project the future path of these inputs and others that may arise, and (c) predict how recursive feedback loops interact over multi-decadal time horizons, all without being able to test their hypotheses against reality. When evaluating the causes of past climate shifts, for example, scientists cannot simply re-run history to test the impact of changing different variables. Similarly, although climate scientists can make testable hypotheses about the future, their short-term predictions have an embarrassing record (think post-Katrina predictions of a massive surge in US hurricanes or the failed attempts to forecast temperature changes for the 2000s), while the debate will be moot by the time we can test their long-term forecasts in the year 2100.
We would, therefore, expect this limit on empirical verifiability to birth widely divergent views on the path, causes, and consequences of earth’s future climate. In other arenas, only after a theory has been empirically verified has the scientific community coalesced around it. Even then, scientists continue to subject such theories to rigorous testing and debate. For example, consider the current state of theoretical physics: quantum physics, loop quantum gravity, string theory, super-symmetry, and M-theory, among others, all vie for acceptance. Albert Einstein’s general relativity itself did not begin to garner widespread support until four years after its publication, when Arthur Eddington verified its predictions during a 1919 solar eclipse. Even so, as illustrated by the rash of headlines in late 2011 announcing the (false) discovery of faster-than-light neutrinos, scientists continue to try to poke holes in Einstein’s theory.
Yet the expectation of a rich debate among scientists about climate change does not reconcile easily with the widely endorsed shibboleth that human activity will warm the globe dramatically and dangerously over the next one hundred years. As climate scientists are themselves fond of repeating, the vast majority have arrived at the exact same conclusions about both past warming and future trends. Any discussion that doubts the fundamental premises of climate change is dismissed by the mainstream media and climate scientists as pseudo-science conducted by quacks or ideologues. Thus, questions about observational biases in the location of temperature stations, changes in the earth’s albedo, the cooling effect of dust particles, shifting ocean cycles, fluctuating solar activity, correlation v. causation of historical warm periods and carbon dioxide, catastrophic model failure caused by chaotic interactions, and innumerable other theories—most of which are presumably wrong—are never properly mooted in the public debate.
In our view, the fact that so many scientists agree so closely about the earth’s warming is, itself, evidence of a lack of evidence for global warming. Does this mean that climate change is not happening? Not necessarily. But it does mean that we should be wary of the meretricious arguments mustered in its defense. When evaluating complex questions—from climate change to economic growth, physiology to financial markets—it is worse than naïve to judge the veracity of an idea merely from the strength of consensus. The condemnation of Galileo Galilei meant one man served a sentence of life imprisonment. His ecumenical accusers at least acknowledged a force greater than science drove their decision. The modern priests of climate change endanger the lives of billions as they wield their fallacy that consensus is truth.

Scott Morrison’s election victory was a quiet mass protest by “the Quiet Australians” against the tiny, noisy clique of left-elites. Bob Brown’s pathetic clown-parade of screeching rainbow macaws was vocally rejected by town after town. The tiny clique of upper-middle-class almond-fussers playing dress-ups might steam the knickers of a few taxpayer-funded journalists, but their idiot pantomime antics just annoy the crap out of people who actually work for a living.



What’s more, they’re putting lives at risk. When some emaciated beta “male feminist” or blue-haired landwhale with a gender studies degree superglues xirself to the road and gridlocks a city, emergency services are blocked as well. The Queensland government is just one that’s taking action against these annoying twats.



The Queensland government is planning to fast-track proposed laws to jail protesters in the wake of disruptive climate demonstrations this week.



Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has condemned the Extinction Rebellion protests, saying activists were putting themselves and others at risk while soaking up valuable police and emergency services resources.



Last night Ms Palaszczuk said she was determined to pass legislation that would see protesters jailed for up to two years if they use “dangerous devices” such as drums with concrete and locks…“I say to protesters […] ‘what if it was your mother or grandmother that was held up from getting to hospital because of your actions, blocking streets?’,” Ms Palaszczuk told The Courier-Mail.



Or worse, stopping **them** getting their Maccas fix?



Naturally, useless taxpayer-funded ambulance-chasers are screeching up a storm in their biodegradable teacups.



The Human Rights Law Centre says the government has a legitimate interest in ensuring peaceful protests but that this law goes too far […]”We are seeing a clear and worrying wave of laws from governments across Australia that restrict people’s ability to stand together and speak out on issues they care deeply about.”



No, we’re seeing a wave of self-righteous, uninformed parasites restricting ordinary people’s ability to go about their business, and wasting everyone’s time.



And all because of the imaginary sky dragon that’s got these shrieking ninnies running around like headless chooks.

"**It's a tough time in the jobs market, as firms struggle to operate or shed staff to cut costs.**
The collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia and Debenhams could ultimately lead to 25,000 job losses in the retail sector.
But job vacancies are being posted at 70% of last year's average, and there are sectors still hiring.
In the week to 20 November, the volume of online job adverts posted was at 71% of the same week last year.
Some sectors have recovered more strongly than others. Education vacancies are still at 80% of last year's, and the government is offering bursaries and scholarships for teacher training in certain subjects.
Healthcare vacancies are at a similar level, with funding has begun for hundreds of nurse apprenticeships in England.
By contrast, the rate of catering and hospitality vacancies is down by three quarters on the same time last year.
However there are still temporary seasonal vacancies at many supermarkets and retailers this year.
Jobseekers should be ''strategic'' and target sectors experiencing job shortages as well as those that are growing, says Gerwyn Davies, analyst at human resources body the CIPD.
The shortage occupation list \- used to offer work visas to people moving to the UK - quickly shows where workers are needed, and includes fields like engineering, web programming and graphic design.
Now could be a good time to join the public sector, he suggests, with initiatives like the national retraining scheme helping people move into areas like social work, teaching and healthcare.
Tech recruiter Amy Golding suggests applying to companies which are fully digital, regardless of the role you want, as the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online working.
These could be online retail companies like Amazon, which is recruiting for 7,000 UK jobs by the end of 2020 \- or tech companies working in education or healthcare.
To maximise your chances, one strategy is to create an appealing online profile so that recruiters and companies will approach you, while you also actively apply for jobs.
Consider your core skills, rather than hunting for a specific job title, suggests Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management **.**
For example, if you work in retail customer service, this could translate to other people-facing roles such as sales.
She suggests searching for these core skills online, to see which jobs come up, while also listing them on your professional profiles.
Recruiters often search for people based on a list of desired skills, so this will make you more visible.
Many companies list jobs on their own website or on recruitment sites.
You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency.
If you want to work for a particular company, check if they hire directly or through a recruiter.
And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there.
Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available.
Some industries and employers have even set up virtual networking events and job fairs.
With thousands of people applying for some roles, your personal network should be your first port of call, Corinne suggests.
Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, and some should know of businesses which are hiring.
Many employers like a personal recommendation and you may hear about roles before they are advertised.
When compiling your CV, emphasise your skills which a prospective employer wants.
List past achievements clearly. For example, you finished a recent project on time and within budget, or brought in new clients.
Asking someone else to read your application helps spot any spelling or grammatical errors that could mean your CV goes straight in the bin.
Show enthusiasm and give reasons why you want to work for this employer in particular.
Tailor your CV and cover letter for each application, which is time-consuming but more likely to result in a job, suggests Amy Golding.
She adds: ''If you don't hear back within three days, call them - because that makes it harder for them to ignore you!''
The national careers service offers many tools. These include a skills assessment, a search tool for courses, and help with CVs. The government's ''find a job'' website also lists vacancies.
Gaining new skills could help you move into a new sector and shows employers you've been productive during lockdown. Many universities and other institutions are currently offering free training courses.
For example, the University of Edinburgh is offering free short courses in fields such as statistics and data, the University of Oxford has a free course on economic development, and the Open University offers many free courses too.
Many other platforms, such as Codeacademy and Coursera, offer online coding tutorial, some of which are free.
The Prince's Trust is offering free personal development sessions to help 18-30 year-olds get into the health and social care sector. The charity offers mentoring, CV help, and can match jobseekers with suitable local employers."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski has a fascinating piece on what likely causes most of the sea ice to break up. The Spiegel introduction:
Sea ice is disappearing in the Arctic, around the Antarctic it is growing – today’s conventional climate models are unable to explain this contradiction. One effect has just been measured by sensors: wave motion is able to crack ice, hundreds of kilometers away.”
The Spiegel report explains how oceanic mechanical waves induced by large storms offshore propagate underneath sea ice and act to break it apart even hundreds of miles far into the ice sheet. Bojanowski cites a north Pacific storm near Alaska which created huge waves in 2005. “Six days later the surges ripped apart the B15A iceberg 13,500 km to the south.”

The new hypothesis is based on a recent study by Alison Kohout of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Nature.
Scientists placed sensors on a section of the Antarctic ice sheet to measure ocean wave induced oscillations. When storms hit offshore, the ice sheet began to resonate and cracks developed due to the cyclic loading. Spiegel writes that cracks even hundreds of kilometers into the ice sheet resulted.
The scientists examined weather data between 1997 and 2009. They clearly observed that sea ice broke up as result of storms hundreds of kilometers away. Sea ice over water that bordered regions of relatively calm waters that saw low storm activity remained relatively intact.

Many global warming scientists insist ice break-up is likely caused mostly by warming. But the results of the study refute the claim and show that climate models have gotten it all wrong again. Bojanoawski writes on storm-induced ocean waves and ice break-up:
In the calculations such destruction is hardly taken into account by the models, which simulate sea ice. Up to now they have failed to depict the observed changes: …”
But the Alfred Wegener Institute is skeptical of the study’s result, claiming that it neglected to take wind into account.
It’s a good point, but here we see that even the warmist Alfred Wegener Institute indirectly admits that sea ice break-up is in large part driven by mechanical ocean wave dynamics and wind forces.
Bojanowski writes that the destructive effects of ocean waves are documented in the Arctic as well, citing how in 2012 “a huge storm ripped apart an area of sea ice three times the size of Germany in just 10 days“. He adds that the wave effect exascerbated the break-up as deeper warm water was agitated and brought up to the surface and melted the sea ice like “an ice cube in a tea cup.”
Whatever the warmists may argue, one thing is sure:  Sea ice break-up is far more complex and there is a growing body of evidence showing that it is due in large part to mechanical ocean dynamics and wind conditions.

Fraud and deceit are a slippery slope
Story submitted by Bruce Webster
An article in the New York Times chronicles the descent of a sociologist into wholesale fraud. It is worth reading the whole article, because I believe it offers insight into some of the pressures, temptations, and self-rationalizations that many scientists struggle with.
Here is one key passage that will likely not surprise anyone here at WUWT (all emphasis in quoted text is mine):
Each case of research fraud that’s uncovered triggers a similar response from scientists. First disbelief, then anger, then a tendency to dismiss the perpetrator as one rotten egg in an otherwise-honest enterprise. But the scientific misconduct that has come to light in recent years suggests at the very least that the number of bad actors in science isn’t as insignificant as many would like to believe. And considered from a more cynical point of view, figures like Hwang and Hauser are not outliers so much as one end on a continuum of dishonest behaviors that extend from the cherry-picking of data to fit a chosen hypothesis — which many researchers admit is commonplace — to outright fabrication.
“Cherry-picking of data” is, of course, not an unknown topic in these parts. But here’s an even more intriguing passage: 
Stapel did not deny that his deceit was driven by ambition. But it was more complicated than that, he told me. He insisted that he loved social psychology but had been frustrated by the messiness of experimental data, which rarely led to clear conclusions. His lifelong obsession with elegance and order, he said, led him to concoct sexy results that journals found attractive. “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty — instead of the truth,” he said. He described his behavior as an addiction that drove him to carry out acts of increasingly daring fraud, like a junkie seeking a bigger and better high.
And again:
What the public didn’t realize, he said, was that academic science, too, was becoming a business. “There are scarce resources, you need grants, you need money, there is competition,” he said. “Normal people go to the edge to get that money. Science is of course about discovery, about digging to discover the truth. But it is also communication, persuasion, marketing. I am a salesman. I am on the road. People are on the road with their talk. With the same talk. It’s like a circus.”
And finally how it all turned out:
…the universities unveiled their final report at a joint news conference: Stapel had committed fraud in at least 55 of his papers, as well as in 10 Ph.D. dissertations written by his students. The students were not culpable, even though their work was now tarnished. The field of psychology was indicted, too, with a finding that Stapel’s fraud went undetected for so long because of “a general culture of careless, selective and uncritical handling of research and data.” If Stapel was solely to blame for making stuff up, the report stated, his peers, journal editors and reviewers of the field’s top journals were to blame for letting him get away with it. The committees identified several practices as “sloppy science” — misuse of statistics, ignoring of data that do not conform to a desired hypothesis and the pursuit of a compelling story no matter how scientifically unsupported it may be.
A lesson for climate science. Be sure to read the whole thing.  ..bruce..

President-elect Donald Trump has claimed victory in his effort to preserve employment for Carrier workers in Indiana. Assisted by $7 million in tax incentives provided by the State of Indiana, Mr. Trump persuaded the company not to move 800 furnace manufacturing jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. This works out to a taxpayer-funded subsidy of $8750 per job. 



Another 1300 Carrier jobs still will move to Mexico between now and 2019. Published reports have indicated that the company anticipated cost savings of some $65 million per year from moving all 2100 positions to Monterrey. So Carrier is taking at least a partial step toward maintaining its global competiveness, while at least partially appeasing the incoming president.   
  
I wrote an op-ed in Forbes on August 22, 2016, in which I argued that Carrier no doubt had quite good business reasons for planning the move to Mexico. Carrier’s February 2016 announcement of the decision said that it was due to “ongoing cost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements.”   
  
Carrier has been manufacturing products in Monterrey for some years. The company certainly has a clear understanding of why moving production of some air conditioning units makes business sense. It would not be wise for them to explain their reasoning in public because such proprietary knowledge would be of great interest to their competitors.   
  
Some commentators have opined that the decision was driven largely by lower labor costs. Carrier’s expenses for employee salary and benefits average about $34 per hour in Indiana, while those costs in Mexico are only around $6 per hour. It’s possible the move was prompted primarily by labor cost savings, although my analysis of data compiled by The Conference Board suggests otherwise. The value generated by an hour worked in the United States has risen by 40 percent over the past 22 years of NAFTA. In Mexico, the gain has been only 10.5 percent. Productivity has grown faster in the United States, so the incentive to shift production to Mexico today ought to be weaker than it was 10 or 20 years ago. (Note: Those figures apply to the productivity of all workers. If it was possible to analyze just the manufacturing sector, perhaps the findings would change.)   




There is little doubt that Carrier could escape some other costs by moving away from the United States. As I wrote in August:   






What other factors could have inspired Carrier’s move? U.S. businesses frequently are critical of what they see as burdensome regulations imposed by government. Those range from policies dealing with energy and the environment, to rules pertaining to labor relations and taxation. One often overlooked issue is the burden placed on manufacturing firms by antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) measures. AD/CVD duties are imposed to provide protection for U.S. companies that face import competition. Many industries that seek AD/CVD protection are in the business of making basic products that are used as inputs by downstream manufacturers. The simple reality of the marketplace is that protected firms tend to receive higher prices. Those higher prices translate directly into higher costs for value-added manufacturers that use the protected product as an input. 



Steel provides a great example. The United States has imposed roughly 150 AD/CVD orders to limit imports of steel from numerous countries. The extra duties help steel mills to compete, but they also reduce the competitiveness of steel-consuming firms that must pay those extra costs. AD/CVD measures cause a few steel producers to be winners, while a whole lot of other firms end up as losers. 



Since steel is required to make air conditioners, there is little doubt that Carrier is one of the losers from AD/CVD policies. Perhaps more important than steel, AD/CVD measures also apply to imports of copper tubing and aluminum extrusions, both of which are used to accomplish the essential heat-exchange function. Carrier can avoid those policy-imposed costs simply by moving to Mexico.





It may be helpful to look at steel trade remedies in a broader perspective. Downstream manufacturers that use steel as an input are a much larger factor in the U.S. economy than are steel producers. Department of Commerce statistics indicate that “primary metal manufacturing,” which includes steel, copper, aluminum, magnesium, etc., added about $60 billion of value to the economy in 2014. Downstream manufacturers that utilize steel as an input generate value added of $990 billion, more than 16 times larger. Employment by primary metal manufacturers was 400,000, while downstream manufacturers employed 6.5 million, also 16 times greater. (Employment by U.S. steel mills is somewhere around 100,000.)   
  
Steel import restrictions have made the United States a high-priced island in an ocean of low-priced steel. U.S. prices are high enough to give imported manufactured goods an advantage when competing in the U.S. market against domestic firms. How many of the 6.5 million workers employed by value-added manufacturers are vulnerable to import competition from foreign companies that have access to world-price steel? It’s not clear. What is clear is that if only 2 percent of those workers (130,000 people) lose their jobs, more people would be unemployed due to steel import duties than are now employed in the entire U.S. steel mill workforce.   
  
Will the new administration be interested in reforming AD/CVD laws so that an action intended to help one industry does not inadvertently damage another? If so, it should pursue legislation that would balance the potential help provided by such measures against the potential harm they might do. Trade remedy measures should be prevented from going into place whenever quantitative analysis shows that they would have an overall negative effect on the U.S. economy. Although this approach makes great sense, it may not be welcomed by members of the incoming administration’s transition team, some of whom have connections to the steel industry.   
  
One unfortunate aspect of the president-elect’s foray into Carrier’s business decisions is that he missed the opportunity to focus the public’s attention on the need to improve the U.S. business climate. Government policies play important roles in determining whether firms can remain competitive. Non-competitive companies aren’t able to thrive, grow, or hire more workers. The incoming administration would do well to focus on reforming poorly conceived U.S. laws and regulations that make it unnecessarily difficult to conduct business in this country.

"■ A vote on Jeff Sessions’s nomination as attorney general is expected on Wednesday. ■ A proposed Senate bill would require congressional approval to lift sanctions on Russia. ■ Vice President Mike Pence will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s clothing and accessories line, once again raising questions about the tangled relationship between the president and his family’s business interests. The president has been criticized for singling out other companies for criticism, like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, prompting gyrations in their stock prices, but those controversies had to do with government contracts, not his family’s own fortunes. Nordstrom, the department store chain, said on Friday that it was dropping the Ivanka Trump line, a decision it said was based on sales performance. A campaign, using the hashtag #GrabYourWallet, which has encouraged shoppers to boycott products with ties to Mr. Trump, his family and his donors, called the Nordstrom announcement a victory. It was not clear what prompted the president to criticize the company five days later. As Mr. Trump has noted several times, federal    laws apply to other officials, but not to the president. Nordstrom’s stock dropped briefly after the president’s Twitter post, then rose again. Mr. Trump’s blast at the company came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit describing her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. A day after her narrow confirmation as education secretary, Betsy DeVos toured the department she now leads and delivered a speech to staff members and reporters. She began with a joke: “This confirmation process and the drama it engendered have been a bit of a bear,” she said, a reference to her   comment during her Senate hearing that schools might need guns to protect students from “grizzlies. ” “We’ve just come through one of the most bruising, divisive elections in modern times, and that’s O. K.,” she said. “All of us here can help bring unity by personally committing to being more open to and patient toward views different from our own. ” In her speech, she did not mention some of the issues that had made her such a contentious nominee, like her support of private school vouchers and charter schools. But while she had seemed unfamiliar in her Senate hearing with basic education terms and policies, such as the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, on Wednesday Ms. DeVos went out of her way to promise to serve “  students and families to whom we owe our full support,” as well as “students who may be struggling” and “hardworking teachers who may feel stifled. ” She continued, “I pledge to listen and learn from you, and from stakeholders around our country. ” Capping a strikingly contentious confirmation process, the Senate is expected to vote as soon as Wednesday evening on the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general. Senators usually show a great deal of deference when one of their own is nominated for a cabinet post. But Democrats have sharply criticized over his background on civil rights and his stances on voter access and immigration. After Mr. Sessions’s nomination cleared a procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, Democrats took to the floor to reiterate their opposition to the senator during the final hourslong debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote those Twitter posts after being halted by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as she tried to read on the floor a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King opposing Mr. Sessions’s nomination for a judgeship. Mr. McConnell, in a rare step, said Ms. Warren had breached Senate rules by impugning the character of Mr. Sessions. The Senate then voted, along party lines, to bar Ms. Warren from speaking again during the debate. In the end, though, Democrats can do little more than raise their voices. None of the 52 Republicans have said they would vote against Mr. Sessions, and he needs only a simple majority to win confirmation. In a bit of procedural strategy, Republican leaders held off on Mr. Sessions’s vote until after confirming Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary. With Mr. Sessions still in the Senate, Republicans had just enough votes to push her to confirmation. A day after a federal appeals court panel voiced skepticism over his targeted travel ban, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday the possibility that he could lose the case. But to lose the normal way, on the merits? The president sees other forces at play. Later in the morning, Mr. Trump resumed that theme at a gathering of sheriffs and police chiefs. “I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased,” he said. “But courts seem to be so political. ” He also called the appeals court hearing “disgraceful. ” With that, Mr. Trump kept up his efforts to call into question the independence of the judiciary  —   a cornerstone of American democracy. A few days ago, he referred to the district court judge in the travel ban case as a “  judge. ” And before that, he doubted that the judge in a Trump University case could be impartial because of his Mexican heritage. The president has been   blaming judges for any terrorist attack that might happen during the travel ban suspension. On Sunday, he attacked the district court judge who blocked his immigration order, James Robart of Seattle. “If something happens,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “blame him and court system. ” On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump was back on Twitter, claiming that foreigners were flowing into the United States from “certain areas. ” A bipartisan group of senators is expected to introduce legislation on Wednesday that would require congressional approval for Mr. Trump to lift sanctions on Russia, according to two Senate aides. The group is expected to include six senators: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida, all Republicans and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, all Democrats. The effort comes amid longstanding worries on Capitol Hill that the Trump administration might be too dovish on Russia, which intelligence officials say intervened in the election in an effort to help Mr. Trump. Last week, the president seemed to defend the reputation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia by asking an interviewer, “You think our country’s so innocent?” The vice president will attend a Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas at the end of the month, according to a notice from the group sent to prospective attendees. Las Vegas is home to one of the group’s biggest donors, the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson. Mr. Pence’s trip will come a few weeks after the Trump administration issued a muted statement about Israeli settlements, calling for immediate curbs on construction but also signaling a shift away from the Obama administration’s rejection of all settlement activity. It will also come after the president’s promise to immediately move the American Embassy to Jerusalem has been delayed. It seems that no mission is too impossible for Jim Mattis to take on. During a recent trip to Asia, Mr. Mattis, the defense secretary, succeeded in shoring up connections with South Korea and Japan despite Mr. Trump’s campaign talk about pulling back from the United States’ security commitments in the region. On Tuesday, Mr. Mattis made an effort to salvage relations with Mexico, at least in the area of military cooperation. According to a statement issued Tuesday night by the Pentagon, Mr. Mattis spoke by phone with two of his Mexican counterparts: Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, the secretary of national defense, and Adm. Vidal Francisco Soberón Sanz, the secretary of the navy. Mr. Mattis talked about the need to strengthen military connections between the two countries, and “lauded Mexico’s growing leadership in the region,” the Pentagon said. The statement did not say when Mr. Mattis might be visiting the country, but it noted that Mexico was planning to host the Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas in 2018. No word if Mr. Trump’s wall will be built by then."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the weather craziness of the week story.
Officials of the German town of Reutlingen have voted to allocate 50,000 euros in a bid to tame the bad weather that typically occurs during thunderstorms. The plan is to hire an airplane to spray silver iodide into storm clouds with the hopes of reducing the size of hail, and so reduce property damage on the ground.
Hat tip meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann at Twitter.
The Reutlinger General-Anzeiger writes:
Exactly one year since the devastating hailstorm over Reutlingen, local politicians indeed want to support the use of a hail plane. On Monday evening the county council voted by a wide majority to allocate 50,000 euros for this, a spokeswoman said.”
They actually believe this is going to work!
In response, high-profile Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann writes at Twitter: “Now it’s out: Germany’s dumbest politicians are located in the Reutlingen legislature.”
Mr. Kachelmann has written before on the topic of using the bright yellow “weather-making” chemical, claiming that the method has a very low success rate and that certain conditions have to be right on the borderline for it to work. Overall Kachelmann characterizes the practice as “nonsense”.

Kachelmann also notes with sarcasm that the process seems to work especially after weathermen have already forecast the desired effect is going to take place anyway. Wow, the hailstones were pretty small this time. The silver iodide spraying worked!
I’ve also inquired with veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European institute of Climate and Energy (EIKE). He also agrees that the spraying is nonsense, writing that “over the decades there have been serious! attempts time and again and entire projects devoted to this. All of them failed and were stopped.”
Citizens demanding politicians do something about the bad weather
Not only might the dumbest politicians be found in Reutlingen, but also the dumbest citizens, too. The Reutlinger General-Anzeige writes:
Lately in Reutlingen the call from citizens and companies for hail defense has gotten increasingly louder. In Stuttgart and in the Black Forest hail planes have been in use for years to prevent damage.”
Apparently the citizens of Reutlingen really do believe their local government has power over weather. Moreover, these citizens appear no longer able to take steps on their own to protect themselves – seemingly unaware that there are other options available to them, like insurance, or carports. Like the German government is expected to save the world’s climate, the citizens of Reutlingen also expect their local politicians to save them from bad weather.
If you happen to have a Brooklyn Bridge to sell, go to Reutlingen!

An often overlooked aspect of the Jones Act is its environmental effects. By raising the cost of waterborne transportation, the law encourages the use of alternative forms of transport such as trucks and rail. These alternative means of moving goods generate more greenhouse gases and emit pollutants that are in many ways more harmful than those emitted by waterborne transport. Moreover, the Jones Act encourages the use of older, less‐​efficient vessels. Thus, the Jones Act contributes to an environment that is more despoiled than would otherwise be the case in the law’s absence.



This paper presents a detailed examination of the potential environmental gains that could be realized from reform or repeal of the law. It estimates that the environmental benefits accruing from the law’s repeal, through expanded use of waterborne transport as well as newer, more efficient vessels, would exceed $8 billion per year. Such gains are rarely estimated, if they are even considered.



To mitigate the adverse effects that transportation has on the environment, policymakers should acknowledge that the Jones Act encourages businesses to use less environmentally friendly forms of transport. Repeal of the Jones Act—or even a more limited set of reforms—would both promote economic growth and a cleaner environment.



Freight transport is an important service traded in largely competitive markets, but it gives rise to a variety of what economists call external costs. These costs are not borne by carriers or their customers, but by others who are not voluntary participants in the transaction. These costs are real: congestion, accidents, and noise all detract from total economic welfare. No carrier thinks about its marginal contribution to congestion, the increased chance of an accident, or the noise that one more truck creates as part of a consideration of whether or not to move another load of freight.



Environmental costs are an important class of external costs: air emissions, water contamination, and degradation of land resources are important examples of external environmental costs. The magnitude of these environmental spillovers is a function of the amount of freight transport and the choice of mode—truck, rail, air, or water—because they each have different environmental effects. Changing marine cabotage policy (“cabotage” refers to transportation between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country) has the potential to change freight transport choices, with implications for transport markets and their external costs. This paper focuses on the net change in environmental costs from potential changes in marine cabotage policy.



Freight transportation is essential for the modern economy. We have grown accustomed to delivered consumer products, and industry has reengineered supply chains to minimize inventory costs and avoid costly delays. Transportation services account for a steady 3 percent of gross domestic product year after year, although waterborne transport—at less than 3 percent of total transportation value-added—is only a sliver of that.



As shown in Figure 1, most freight transportation moves by truck and rail, which account for more than two‐​thirds of the total ton‐​miles of freight movement. The third‐​largest mode is pipeline, which is particularly cost‐​effective for moving the petroleum and natural gas that the United States is producing in increasing quantities. Water transport includes ocean­going and inland waterway traffic (some of which is on the Great Lakes). Despite the physical advantages of buoyancy, which reduces the amount of energy required to move cargo a given distance, water transport accounts for only about 7 percent of the total freight movement trips.1 Moreover, about 40 percent of the U.S. population lives along the coasts or Great Lakes, which underscores how underutilized water transportation may be.



With its heavy reliance on trucks, the United States has a much different freight transport network than other countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co‐​operation and Development (OECD). There are a number of reasons for this. Rail is the dominant freight mode throughout the OECD. After decades of regulation, the U.S. railroad industry has stabilized with fewer, larger railroads and lower rates. Physical endowments matter as much as policy in the nature of transport networks. No matter the enticement, Switzerland is unlikely to have much coastal waterway traffic, but Japan is likely to have a lot. The United States is mostly a continental market with a handful of isolated outposts—including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico—that must rely heavily on marine transport. Short‐​term fluctuations in economic activity and fuel prices can affect demand for alternative transport modes, but long‐​term factors have an important influence. There is substantial path dependence in transport modes because of physical factors and long‐​term infrastructure investments.



Despite its ample water resources, U.S. water transport is restricted by the requirements of Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act requires that domestic waterborne transport of freight be conducted on vessels that are U.S.-built, owned, registered, and crewed. Colin Grabow, Inu Manak, Daniel Ikenson,2 and Rob Quartel,3 among many others, have documented the distortions created by this provision. The century since the Jones Act’s passage has witnessed a dramatic decline in maritime transport. In an apparent effort to promote U.S. shipbuilding and U.S. shipping, the law has unwittingly incentivized alternative modes of transport, which generate environmental externalities that could be reduced under a different policy environment. The relatively few beneficiaries from the Jones Act receive gains at the expense of millions of consumers who absorb higher shipping costs, while the act imposes a great expense to the local and global environment upon which billions of humans depend.



Environmental costs from freight transport are substantial. Plausible changes to the current set of rules governing freight transport could reduce costs from emission in excess of $8 billion per year. While that translates into a welfare gain of about 1 percent of GDP from transportation, it represents more than 50 percent of the total value‐​added by water transportation. Accounting for avoided envi­ronmental costs provides strong additional motivation for Jones Act reform, with the upper bound increasing estimated welfare gains by 2 to 10 times.



The transportation industry is among the top producers of environmental externalities, which are particularly high relative to the industry’s contributions to GDP. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 14 percent of 2010 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were generated by the global transportation sector, with nearly all (95 percent) of the emissions stemming from the use of petroleum as fuel. However, the contribution of transportation to total environmental costs varies substantially across different types of emissions and therefore, via different paths, affects human well‐​being. In 2016, transportation accounted for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. All modes of transport accounted for 58 percent of carbon monoxide emissions in the United States in 2014. Transportation sources from all modes accounted for 60 percent of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 25 percent of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. Each of these types of emissions has different physical effects, including dispersion and longevity that affect the economic value of changes in emission levels.4



While the transport sector is responsible for sizeable proportions of total emissions, it has substantially reduced emissions across a range of criteria air pollutants since federal air regulations were implemented in the early 1970s, as shown in Figure 2. The transport sector has been far more successful than the nontransport (mostly fixed) sector in reducing emissions of criteria air pollutants, as well as other types of emissions. Removing lead from gasoline helped to dramatically reduce airborne lead levels, for example, with an attendant decrease in lead levels measured in human blood.5



Figure 2 also shows how the criteria air pollutants emissions profile of transportation differs from other sources: carbon monoxide (CO) dominates transportation emissions, although NOx and VOCs also make large contributions. Relative to nontransport sources, emissions of particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SOx), and ammonia (NH3) are all both relatively and absolutely small. These differences between transport and other sources have not changed over time. While emissions intensity of transportation has fallen over recent decades, the compositional differences remain. This is important because integrated assessment modeling shows that the damages from emissions are highest for pollutants that are not prevalent from transport sources.6



Furthermore, Nicholas Z. Muller, Robert Mendelsohn, and William Nordhaus show that water transportation has very localized damages.7 Whereas highway and railroad emissions affect every county in the country, the damages from marine emissions are concentrated in coastal areas. And when criteria air pollutant emissions are released far from human populations, as is the case with marine transport to Alaska and Hawaii (which accounts for a significant amount of U.S. marine transport), the environmental costs are not as large. While that does not necessarily eliminate damages generated through other channels, the economic costs of local air pollutants depend on the location of emission. Greenhouse gases, in contrast, are global stock pollutants, which means their economic costs do not depend on the location of their emission.



While transportation has been relatively successful in reducing criteria air pollutant emissions, GHG emissions are a different story. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transportation sector increased by 20 percent between 1990 and 2016. Over that time, transport’s share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased from just under 24 percent to just over 27 percent. The good news is that relative to the overall transportation sector, maritime transport is relatively clean. Reallocating freight across modes has the potential to reduce GHG emissions.



Achieving such a shift would require some policy changes or other changes to encourage use of water transport, which has become less popular in the United States. In 1990, water transport of all types accounted for 6.7 percent of all transportation energy use in the United States. By 2016, water transport only accounted for 4 percent, even as transport energy use increased by 26 percent.8



Different transport modes generate different sets of environmental costs. Some ocean‐​going ships have traditionally burned residual fuel oil that is relatively high in sulfur, leading to much higher SOx emissions from that portion of the transport network, but a new low‐​sulfur standard mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) limiting such emissions to 0.5 percent by weight (from a previous limit of 3.5 percent) took effect on January 1, 2020. Trucks are less energy efficient than ships, so they use more energy per ton‐​mile and generate more emissions, but U.S. trucks mostly burn low‐​sulfur diesel, so they have lower SOx emissions, all else being equal. As both ships and trucks move toward using natural gas as a fuel, the differences in their emissions profiles may disappear in the future. The coastal waters of the continental United States, Hawaii, and parts of Alaska are part of the Emissions Control Area, a designation that requires the use of low‐​sulfur marine fuels—with a standard even lower than the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 low‐​sulfur standard. As a result, expanding coastwise short‐​sea shipping within the Emissions Control Area will likely have less effect on SOx emissions than would a similar expansion using the global commercial fleet.



Table 1 compares the emissions profiles for different modes of freight transport, which reveals the importance of scale to waterborne freight emissions. The table includes a comparison of two different vessels, one large and one small, as measured by capacity. Shipping volume typically is measured in “twenty‐​foot equivalent units” (TEUs), which is the size of a standard shipping container with a maximum net cargo of 23.8 tons. The table highlights three basic findings. First, by requiring less energy to move a given amount of freight, ships can have much lower emissions than alternative transport modes. Second, this advantage depends heavily on the scale of waterborne transport—larger ships are cleaner than other modes, but the advantage declines for smaller ships. Third, waterborne freight has higher criteria air pollutant emissions.



Since the golden spike was driven to mark the completion of the first transcontinental railroad 150 years ago, much of the country has had a choice between transport modes. When the relative ease of a Pullman car beckoned, traveling from New York to San Francisco no longer meant a long and dangerous trip around Cape Horn or across Central America, both of which were journeys mostly by ship. Technological improve­ments have helped all transport modes, but the increased number of options—as well as costly mandates imposed by the Jones Act—bodes ill for the waterborne share of freight. Today, marine transport is primarily used where there are no substitutes, and the U.S. domestic oceangoing fleet has shrunk to a mere 99 ships. Using data from the Commodity Flow Survey, two‐​thirds of U.S. bluewater freight transport trips (excluding inland water­way and the Great Lakes) either originate or terminate in the noncontiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii, yet these trips carry only about 2 percent of the ton‐​mileage of U.S. water freight transport. Waterborne freight is concentrated in a handful of low‐​value, mostly time‐​insensitive, commodities. Nearly three‐​quarters of the waterborne ton‐​mileage of marine transport is in four classes of commodities: metallic ores, refined petroleum products, coal, and agricultural products.



By restricting the choice for domestic water­borne transport to qualified carriers, the Jones Act has raised costs for marine transport. Measuring these costs is a challenging empirical task. The first channel for impact is that the qualifications might directly raise production costs, either by requiring more expensive factors such as labor, or by specifying more costly performance standards, such as safety equipment. These changes must be measured relative to a historical transportation cost basis, so continuing technological improvement could lead to lower real costs and also to contemporaneous alternatives not subject to the same qualifications. Nonexclusive to the first, a second possibility is that substitute transport modes experience falling costs because of technological change or other policy measures. Third, the market structure in the domestic market may afford occupant firms short‐​term pricing power. Unless there are barriers to entry, in the long run firms cannot maintain market power. But the Jones Act does restrict entry to domestic firms and may act as an effective barrier to entry into the market. A fourth explanation is that short‐​term factors might reduce the long‐​term incentive for complementary investments, such as in ports, which then raise costs in the long run. The extent to which these factors amount to substantial and significant cost differences is an empirical question.



Surveys provide estimates of higher operating expenses for Jones Act–eligible vessels than for foreign‐​flagged vessels. The magnitude of the cost differential is contentious, but a variety of sources corroborate the intuition that the Jones Act contributes to higher costs for domestic shipping services. The U.S. Maritime Administration reported in 2011 an average operating cost for U.S.-flagged vessels that was 2.7 times higher than the foreign‐​flagged equivalent, mostly because of higher crew costs,9 while the Government Accountability Office noted in a 2018 report that “the relative cost of operating a U.S.-flag vessel compared to a foreign‐​flag vessel has increased in recent years.”10 Older estimates suggest that the cost differences have grown over time. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) reported higher U.S. operating costs: from 110 percent for Aframax tankers11 to 15 percent for 2,000-TEU containerships, which is consistent with earlier reports that found operating cost differentials of 52 percent for Aframax tankers and 13 percent for a 2,000-TEU containership, according to the USITC.12 The OECD data provide a consistent picture: in 2018, the OECD Service Trade Restrictiveness Index rated the United States as 60 percent more restrictive than the average OECD country, which was about the same as the difference in 2014. Most of the barrier is attributable to Jones Act restric­tions on foreign entry.13



Existing information about cost differentials has been used to parameterize the USITC computable general equilibrium model that provides economic welfare estimates. In 2002, the USITC estimated that full liberalization of the Jones Act would increase U.S. economic welfare by $656 million (1999 U.S. dollars, equivalent to $1 billion in 2019).14 Removing only the domestic shipbuilding require­ment but keeping all other provisions of the Jones Act would deliver an increase of $261 million (1999 dollars, equivalent to $407 million in 2019) in economic welfare. Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Kimberly Ann Elliott found a similar topline figure using a different methodology, estimating that a full liberalization would increase U.S. economic welfare by $556 million (1990 dollars, equivalent to $1.1 billion in 2019).15 This gain is decom­posed into a $1.83 billion (1990 dollars, equivalent to $3.59 billion in 2019) gain for consumers of marine services and a $1.28 billion (1990 dollars, equivalent to $2.51 billion in 2019) loss for producers. Joseph Francois, Hugh M. Arce, Kenneth A. Reinart, and Joseph E. Flynn arrive at a higher estimate of $3 billion (1989 dollars, equivalent to $6.21 billion in 2019) in economic welfare cost, but add to the consensus that the Jones Act protects a relatively small number of jobs and firms at a broadly dispersed cost.16 None of these studies have attempted to enumerate the external costs, and so they potentially represent an underestimate of the burden of this law by measuring only direct cost differences.



The net effect of making waterborne transport relatively more expensive is that less freight moves by ship and boat than one might otherwise expect. In 2016, 4.2 percent of U.S. domestic freight tonnage was moved by water, compared to 65.7 percent by truck.17 Waterborne freight transport focused on low‐​value products, moving only 1.8 percent of total freight value. In 2015, 3.4 percent of domestic freight tonnage was moved by water, compared to 66.1 percent by truck.



Environmental costs are an important class of external costs associated with transport choices. Table 2 shows that in 2016, ships and other vessels accounted for only 0.9 percent of all freight GHG emissions, compared to more than 80 percent for trucks. The relative intensity of moving freight by different modes is shown in the final column of Table 2. Here water transport has a clear advantage: it is one‐​third lower than pipeline, 70 percent lower than rail, more than 80 percent lower than truck, and hundreds of times lower than air.18 So while water transport is not particularly competitive when environmental costs are excluded, taking GHG emissions into account makes water transport relatively more competitive among modes. How large this effect is relative to existing cost differences that drive current freight patterns, and how incorporating other types of environmental externalities affects the net balance, are all relevant to determining the environmental costs of the Jones Act.



Optimal transportation requires different considerations. Minimizing cost is one, but so too is timeliness, particularly in a world of just‐​in‐​time supply chain management. Envi­ronmental costs are another dimension to be considered. Given its importance to the modern economy, it is not surprising that transport choices have attracted considerable study, and the tradeoffs between modes are complex. Consider a hypothetical trip from Boston to Miami. Using the Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transport model (GIFT), the shortest‐​distance trip is one that relies heavily on ship, shaving about 150 miles (10 percent) off the shortest land route.19 That itinerary does not minimize the time spent traveling. While the ship delivers the cargo in a total travel time of 72 hours, the shortest‐​duration trip is about 24 hours with delivery by truck. Neither of these routes considers potential slowdowns, some of which might be predictable, such as traffic congestion or hours of service regulations for truckers, and some of which might not be predictable, such as weather.



Shipping rates take these differences into account. While ships may have lower unit costs than trucks, to the extent that they are slower, part of the cost savings is consumed by slower travel time. Bryan Comer et al. report delivery times at least four times longer by ship as compared to truck.20 Conversely, a shipper might find it worthwhile to pay a premium for a truck to ensure direct delivery of a time‐​sensitive load. Shipping rates vary with the timeliness of delivery, and sometimes shippers are willing to pay more for speed; each day of transit time is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff between 0.6 and 2.1 percent.21 So a trip from Boston to Miami that takes three days instead of two might be expected to cost some 1.2 to 4.2 percent less. Naturally there are some products for which time is more valuable—fresh produce might be one example—and others that are less time‐​sensitive. The value of time is borne out in the lower costs of inventory that firms must hold with just‐​in‐​time delivery. Slower supply chains can be just‐​in‐​time as well, making the variance of delivery time more relevant to inventory costs. The fact that low‐​value products dominate water transport indicates that the time costs may be higher.



Returning to the GIFT model for travel between Boston and Miami, and considering the external costs of transport mode choices, can lead to still more variation. For example, to minimize carbon dioxide emissions on a per‐​TEU basis, ship transport is far preferred, in part because less than one‐​third of the energy inputs are needed to move the cargo by sea as opposed to land. But marine transport is not always the optimal transport mode. Other environmental criteria, including coarse particulate matter, SOx emissions, and NOx emissions, are minimized by truck transport. The net environmental cost savings depend on the value of these marginal changes in the composition of emissions between transportation modes.



The socially optimal transport choice is one that minimizes the total costs, including the monetary cost, the value of time, and external costs. A key question is whether reducing the amount of marine transportation decreases or increases the net environmental costs. Because marine transportation creates external environmental costs, it is true that reducing the amount of waterborne transport helps reduce those particular external costs. However, because freight that might otherwise be moved by boat or ship tends instead to be moved by some other means, the relative environmental cost for waterborne transport depends on the relative environmental costs across all transportation modes.



Mark Delucchi and Don McCubbin helpfully summarize a number of studies examining different types of external costs for both passenger and freight traffic. Compared to other transport modes, water transport lacks a comprehensive suite of studies, but where research has been conducted it has generally concluded that water transport has lower external costs than other transport modes.22 Table 3 summarizes those results, showing a range of economic damage estimates in cents per ton‐​mile that reflect differences across modes, in research methodologies, and different levels of scientific uncertainty about the magnitude of the external costs. For the external costs attributable to health effects from criteria air pollutants, the range of estimates is substantial but largely consistent across modes. Rail emerges as the lowest external cost mode in this regard, followed by water, air, and road. Consistent with Table 1 and Table 2, climate costs are lowest for water transport, thanks to lower fuel requirements due to buoyancy. Rail is second, followed by low‐​end road estimates. The range for road costs extends well behind the higher climate costs from air transport.



Rainer Friedrich and Emile Quinet provide a direct comparison between external cost estimates for water freight transport in the United States and Europe as part of a broader comparison between the transport systems.23 The rank ordering across all modes is roughly the same between the United States and Europe. After converting units at current exchange rates, the comparison for water freight external costs attributable to air pollution indicates that the cost of those emissions is higher in the United States than in Europe (0.23–9.2 versus 0.11–1.4 dollars per ton‐​mile). The authors are careful to point out that the U.S. estimates include health effects but the European estimates do not, and that the European estimates reflect a much narrower range of scientific uncer­tainty thanks to a greater number of studies. A similar result holds for GHG emissions, with the U.S. estimates ranging higher than their European counterparts (0.0–0.67 versus 0.0–0.13 dollars per ton‐​mile). Together these results provide some weak evidence that the emissions profile of the U.S. water freight system generates slightly higher costs than the water freight system in Europe. Convergence between emissions costs from these two transport systems is possible: modernizing the U.S. fleet via repeal of the Jones Act or even its domestic‐​build requirement would be one step in that direction.



Expanding from just GHGs to criteria air pollutants, the environmental costs of freight transport become more nuanced. While water transport has lower external climate costs, it has higher criteria air pollutant emissions than other transport modes, notably rail. Taking these two types of emissions together, it is clear that water transport has lower external costs than air or truck. Rail and water have overlapping ranges of estimates, with rail being slightly lower. Comparing the United States to European countries reveals higher GHG emission costs in the United States. This is offset by slightly higher external costs from criteria air pollutant emissions, although the underlying methodologies are not comparable.



The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports average revenues per ton‐​mile across transportation modes, which are also included in Table 2.24 Under competitive conditions, these average revenues should be a good proxy for average costs. Consistently over time, water transport revenue has been between one‐​eighth or one‐​ninth of the revenue from trucks. In contrast, the cost difference between water and rail is much smaller, with barge rates as close as three‐​quarters of rail rates. The results are intuitive: planes cost more than trucks, which cost more than trains, which cost more than ships.



Internalizing external costs potentially changes the ordering of modes by costs. The high end of the range of external costs reported in Table 3 suggests that the environmental costs of water transport are potentially as high as the private costs. Truck transport is the only other mode that has as large a level of external costs. David Austin conducted a comprehensive study of external costs for truck and rail and found a lower ratio of external costs to market rates for trucks than is indicated by the figures shown in Table 2.25 External costs have the least effect on air transport, in part because the market rates are already so high.



Forcing providers to pay external costs therefore has the largest relative effect on water transport and the smallest relative effect on air transport. However, when accounting for external costs, water transport has the lowest overall costs of any transport mode.



An important policy question is the degree to which today’s usage of different transport modes is attributable to the Jones Act and how much reflects intramodal competition. Estimating the environmental costs of the Jones Act requires three steps. The first is a comparison of the current situation and a counterfactual with a different cabotage regime. This paper uses existing estimates of the policy change. Second, a large literature evaluates the environmental costs of transportation outcomes across a range of measurable outcomes. Third, these two existing estimates are combined to project the effect of a policy change on environmental costs.



To calculate the environmental costs of the Jones Act, consider three counterfactuals. The first case imagines that the U.S. domestic fleet is upgraded to an international standard of emissions intensity, without any change in the volume of freight carried. The scenario reflects the relatively antiquated nature of the U.S. fleet, as compared to similar international fleets. In 2017, nearly one‐​third of all U.S.-flagged vessels were more than 25 years old—excluding the towboats and barges, the proportion was more than 53 percent.26 Because modern vessels are likely to have lower external environmental costs as a function of technological progress, the Jones Act fleet’s modernization alone might offer scope for improvement.



The second case considers the effect of increasing maritime freight transport by 10 percent, displacing truck and rail transport in equal proportions. This counterfactual reallocates freight from truck and rail to maritime shipping. Hufbauer and Elliott provide some of the only quantitative estimates of reducing maritime cabotage barriers: they estimate a 22 percent price reduction as a result of complete repeal and an underlying supply elasticity of one.27 The posited extensive effect is therefore something less than previous estimates of the effect of a full repeal of the act. These scenarios provide short‐​run estimates of cost savings, even though the physical transitions might take some time. The third case includes both the intensive and extensive effects. The scope of a liberalization, let alone its effects, are uncertain.



Table 4 summarizes the effect on environmental costs from freight transport under these three alternative counterfactuals. In the first case, upgrading the Jones Act fleet to lower‐​emissions vessels comparable to those found in Europe—purchases of which would become far cheaper after removal of the Jones Act’s domestic‐​build requirement—would avoid environmental costs mostly attributable to criteria air pollutant emissions. In part because of uncertainty about the magnitude of the environmental cost from these emissions, these avoided costs range from $118 million to $3.96 billion.



The second case offers a chance for more freight to move by ship by displacing truck and rail traffic. Such a displacement would be incentivized by waterborne freight transport cost reductions realized through Jones Act reform or repeal. The relative cleanliness of water transport compared to truck and rail comes into play at this point. This is reflected in the larger share of avoided costs of GHG emissions from switching freight to a more energy‐​efficient transport mode. In this case, the higher profile of water transport for criteria air pollutant emissions suggests that there could be a slight increase in environmental costs, mostly as relatively cleaner train traffic is replaced by the potentially most environmentally costly part of the U.S. fleet. However, the net avoided costs range higher than in the first case as more freight is reallocated to ships. This extensive change in water freight transport represents a real gain for the marine shipping sector.



The third case combines the first two cases, with waterborne transport becoming both more widespread and more environmentally friendly as older vessels are replaced with newer ones. The range of potential avoided costs in this scenario is from $109 million to $8.2 billion. To put the $8.2 billion figure into context, it is more than 50 percent of recent value‐​added from water transportation, or about 1 percent of the total transportation contribution to GDP. Given previous estimates of economic welfare gains from Jones Act reform that top out at $3 billion, the large estimated environmental benefits greatly strengthen the case for revisiting this law.



Changing the composition of the U.S. marine freight fleet to move more cargo raises a variety of other concerns that might be considered. Jones Act reform could deliver benefits indirectly by changing emissions profiles. A variety of other policies designed to provide an incentive to internalize external costs have been employed and discussed, and those policies could have a first‐​order effect on freight transport. The United States has relied on different mechanisms to control criteria air pollutant emissions, including technical standards that help explain the marked improvement in emissions intensity as shown in Figure 1. Because freight transport in general, and water transport in particular, are small relative to total environmental costs from transport, the sector was not focused on in the past. The exception to this is the Emission Control Area, which limits the sulfur content of marine fuels.



The current Jones Act–eligible fleet is disproportionately skewed toward tankers: 57 of 99 oceangoing vessels are tankers and they represent 80 percent of deadweight tonnage. One reason is the reliance on tankers to deliver oil from Alaska. In the short run, without a change in the fleet, the only way to increase the volume of freight transported by the Jones Act fleet is to use the existing stock of tankers. That means moving crude oil and refined products, which brings with it an increased risk of oil spills. While the Jones Act fleet is entirely comprised of double‐​hulled tankers, which have a lower risk of catastrophic spills, there is still a risk and an economic value attached to moving more oil and refined products in tankers.28 In the event of a major spill in U.S. coastal waters, Jones Act waivers are needed to allow international fleets to help respond and remediate.



Oil and refined products’ disproportionate share of waterborne freight is a cautionary indication of the Jones Act’s effect. Because recent expansions in oil production have not been in Alaska where marine transport is required, the tradeoff has focused on pipelines versus rail.29 Increasing utilization of the current fleet requires that increased bluewater freight be liquids. Bulk carriers are very limited, and other types of potentially useful ships, such as LNG [liquefied natural gas] tankers, do not exist under current build requirements.



Another important question is who stands to gain or lose from the environmental cost standpoint if the Jones Act were revised. In the event that a reform of the act resulted in a net shift of freight transport to marine and inland waterways, then local external costs might be felt by different groups of people. Broadly speaking, people near ports would likely be exposed to greater external costs, while those near highways or railroads would experience somewhat lower costs. To the extent that external costs are global rather than local, only the net change matters because local incidence is not an issue.



There are other external costs that might be alleviated by reform of the Jones Act. These include highway congestion, train derailments, and motor vehicle accidents. Further analysis of these external costs could further strengthen the case for Jones Act reform. There are also other potential environmental costs that could be accounted for, both directly and indirectly. Other direct costs are likely to be dominated by the public good nature of the air emissions.



There could also be further indirect effects embedded in supply chains. By limiting domestic shipment of time‐​insensitive bulk commodities such as scrap steel, the Jones Act unwittingly and unintentionally increases global emissions by diverting industry to foreign soil. The U.S. steel industry is among the cleanest in the world. When electric arc producers are unable to economically ship the scrap feedstock to their mills, foreign producers are only too happy to commission foreign‐​flagged vessels to export steel scrap to fuel their industry. The leading class of U.S. steel exports is scrap. Some steel smelted from U.S. scrap is reimported, further under­cutting the American steel industry. Local and global envi­ronments lose out on the trade. If affordable short‐​sea shipping could move scrap steel to steel minimills or even legacy producers, there would be a double dividend for marine carriers and the domestic steel industry.



Because GHG emissions are such an impor­tant factor in determining the environmental costs of waterborne shipping, the carbon price is a key consideration. The cost of carbon applies to all modes of transport, with water transport the least costly mode. Increasing the marginal cost of carbon emissions, either by assessing higher damages or limiting emissions, will increase the calculated environmental costs of the Jones Act. Reducing the social cost of carbon, as some in the United States have recently argued, will decrease the magnitude of environmental costs.



Changing the Jones Act offers the prospect of substantially reducing environmental costs created by freight transport. Using more marine transport would reduce the emissions from freight transport, especially for greenhouse gases. Criteria air pollutant emissions from water transport are slightly higher than for rail, but lower than for trucks. Both intensive and extensive changes to the prevailing regime could yield external environmental cost reductions of as much as $8 billion per year. These gains provide strong additional motivation for Jones Act reform. While previous studies have provided a range of economic welfare gains from easing the law’s restrictions, the environmental gains offer a substantial boost. Using the most conservative estimates of the gains from reform, the environmental benefits increase the net gains by 50 percent. Much larger gains are possible, increasing the benefits of reform by double or more.



Accounting for the external costs of transport services results in lower consumption. Various mechanisms exist to encourage decision­makers to internalize the costs, including taxing the activity in proportion to the marginal external costs. The change in the overall consumption of transport services is a function of the size of external costs and the elasticities of supply and demand for transport services. Allowing for multiple transport modes with different marginal external costs reallocates market share toward the mode with relatively lower marginal external costs. While the total amount of external cost will decrease, the amount attributable to the lower marginal cost mode will increase.



Accounting for the external costs of the Jones Act requires a second consideration: the Jones Act’s effect in the transport market. The top panel of Figure A1 represents the Jones Act as a supply shifter for the waterborne transport sector. Because waterborne transport is small relative to the total transport industry, and the Jones Act does not affect the supply of other modes of transport, the overall shift is smaller. Holding demand constant, the net effect is a reduction in overall transport from Q to Q′, and a corresponding private cost increase. The magnitude of these shifts depends on the price elasticity of demand and the aggre­gate supply elasticity. Under this specification the market share of waterborne transport decreases from QW/Q to Q′W/Q′. This is a short‐​run change. In the long run, the elasticity of supply in the waterborne sector is likely to decrease because of barriers to entry and lower capital investment attributable to smaller quasi‐​rents.



The lower panel of Figure A1 shows the effect of the policy regime on external costs, without explicitly forcing carriers to internalize external costs. The shift from restricted supply S′W to unrestricted SW has three theoretical effects that ultimately lead to empirical questions. First, the increase in the amount of waterborne transport increases the total external costs from waterborne transport by area A. This increase in market share comes at the expense of nonwaterborne transport that has higher marginal external costs. The second theoretical effect is a decrease in external costs from nonwaterborne transport of A + B. The reduction of external costs from nonwaterborne transport (A + B) is partially offset by the increased external costs from waterborne transport A, implying a net reduction of external costs equal to area B. The third effect is an overall increase in transport, which increases external costs by area C. Combining these three effects, the net change in external costs from the policy change shifting SW is a reduction of area B — C.



The empirical magnitude of this change depends on a handful of parameters. The first shift depends on the marginal external costs of waterborne transport and the increase in traffic from the policy change, which depends on the size of the supply shift and the elasticity of supply for the sector. The displacement of higher‐​cost modes of transport depends on the difference in marginal external costs between waterborne and other transport. The third effect, the extensive increase in transport, depends on the elasticities of supply and demand for transport. In summary, supply elasticities for waterborne and total transport, a demand elasticity for transport, and the expected cost decrease of the policy change are the key parameters that are needed.



One final note deserves mention. The lower panel of Figure A1 represents the marginal external costs as constant over the relevant ranges. That need not be the case. It is possible, if not plausible, that marginal external costs could change in a way that alters the net gains of B from displacing other modes with waterborne transport. If





(holding the relationship at Q′W constant), the policy change could increase marginal external costs by area





As an empirical matter, the marginal external costs are unlikely to change much over the relevant ranges from this policy change.

History — of the U.S., Europe, the U.K. and its former dominions — repeatedly shows that environmental protection is a luxury good. When per‐​capita income reaches some threshold, the citizenry tire of opaque air and sleazy waters, various agencies and permanent bureaucracies sprout, and, as long as times are good, regulation is good.



Our friends in the U.K. and Europe are especially green. Just hop off the plane in London and pick up the papers. Global warming is everywhere, and, for decades, the religion’s been that carbon dioxide reductions are fine, virtuous, and they’re going to make everyone rich. I have a social security system I would like to sell them.



This all splatters to a halt when economies go south. And the crash can be especially jarring if greenness is one of the causes. Thanks in no small part to the debacle in Europe, in a very few recent weeks, we have witnessed the great green crack‐​up.



Admittedly, the first glimmers showed up a couple of years ago in Spain, which suffered the malady of economic miasma brought on by environmental populism. The government — which our president cited as his environmental role model in his last presidential bid — sought to buy support with outrageous subsidies, in the form of power purchases, to anyone who put a solar panel on his roof in sunny Seville. The government spent much more than it took in, sold bonds it couldn’t back, and pretty soon your portfolio is going to pay the price.



(I’m not so bullish on the notion that the president is going to be touting Spain and solar power this time around).



The United Kingdom followed suit, but instead required that electric utilities pay the price, which is far more expensive than their coal (or gas) power. As occurred in Spain, people know a good handout when they see one and, just last month, there were over 15,000 new installations. Nevermind that the U.K. is one of the cloudiest nations on earth — we’re talking Prince Charles here.



At the same time, consumers got an extra bill to support wind farms that, because of the inconstancy of the wind, operate at 25% of their capacity (figure from the British Wind Energy Association) or 8% (according to E.on, a large operator of UK wind farms).



Guess what? Electricity prices have gone through the roof. The average U.K. household bill is a tad under $200 per month, and so the thermostat goes down. It’s pretty chilly there for much of the year, and a cold house has consequences. A study just came out today on the health costs of what they call “fuel poverty”, commissioned by the Energy and Climate Change Secretary (don’t we need one of those?), Chris Huhne. Bottom line: the chill from green taxes is now killing more Brits per year than car crashes.



London has suddenly awoken to the costs of indiscriminate greenness and is proposing to reduce the solar subsidies and — this is big — now threatens the multibillion dollar subsidies for its massive (and massively ugly) wind power scam.



That’s just the tip of the iceberg that the green Titanic has run into. Just this week:



This last one has an additional feedback: by dropping the price of permits, there’s little incentive to invest in wind and solar, from whom the permits can be bought.



And so, as history teaches us, when times are good, green is great, and when economies crash, green cracks up.

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

"**Pubs and restaurants in some parts of England are being allowed to re-open, but with tougher rules.**
Different restrictions are in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
There are also special rules over the Christmas period.
Despite the arrangements for meeting others over the festive period, you will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues.
You can meet other people outside your Christmas bubble, but only in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying.
The rules vary across the three tiers from Wednesday. The tiers are reviewed every 14 days.
In tier two areas - where about 60% of England's population lives - hospitality venues can only serve alcohol alongside a ""substantial meal"".
Venues will only offer table service, and diners could also be asked to leave once they have finished eating, No 10 has confirmed.
Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal, while legislation says it should be at least the main course of a breakfast, midday or evening meal, served at a table.
Up to six people from different households can sit together outside in a pub garden.
Businesses in all tiers are legally required to take customers' contact details, so they can be traced if there is an outbreak. Businesses can be fined up to Â£10,000 for failing to do this, for taking reservations of more than six, or not enforcing social distancing.
Staff in hospitality venues must wear masks, as must customers when not seated at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing one, or breaking the ''rule of six'' is Â£200 for a first offence.
Wedding receptions and wakes - where drinks and food are often served - will be permitted in tiers one and two.
People will be able to have 15 guests for weddings, civil partnerships, wedding receptions and wakes, as well as 30 guests for funerals in all tiers. But wedding receptions will not be permitted in tier three.
Northern Ireland is in a two-week circuit-break lockdown, which started on Friday 27 November.
Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops are shut, except for takeaways and deliveries, which must stop by 23:00.
Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes are open, but they will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday.
Under new restrictions, hospitality venues will also have to close their doors to customers by 18:00.
Businesses will, however, still be allowed to provide a takeaway service after 18:00 for food or non-alcoholic drinks.
If they have an off-licence, they can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The rule allowing a maximum of four people from four different households to meet in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. That does not include children under the age of 11.
Entry to premises is controlled and you will probably be required to pre-book with details of all group members.
Customers must wear face coverings, except when seated to eat or drink.
Businesses are legally required to take customers' contact details. They can be fined up to Â£10,000 if they do not do this, or if they take reservations of more than four, or do not enforce social distancing.
Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.
Restaurants, pubs and bars can open in regions that are placed in level zero, level one, level two or level three.
In **level zero** , up to eight people from three households can meet indoors, while in **level one** , a maximum of six people from two households can meet indoors.
In **level two** , pubs, bars and restaurants are permitted to sell alcoholic drinks only if they come with substantial meals.
This is allowed only until 20:00 indoors, and outdoors until 22:30.
In **level three** , alcohol sales are not permitted either indoors or outdoors. Cafes, pubs and restaurants are permitted to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks until 18:00.
And in **level four** , all hospitality venues must close.
Table service and the wearing of face coverings when not seated by all customers is mandatory in all hospitality venues.
UK pub and hospitality bodies have published guidance for bars and restaurants on how to operate contact tracing."
"For anyone wondering how former President Barack Obama is adjusting to life under the Trump administration, know this: He seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, took a vacation to the British Virgin Islands, where they have been hosted by Richard Branson, the chief executive of the Virgin Group. On Tuesday, Mr. Branson published a blog post, along with photos and video, showing Mr. Obama learning to kitesurf. Yes, he seems to be doing just fine. Mr. Branson wrote that Mr. Obama spent two days learning how to stay afloat and navigate kitesurfing. “Being the former president of America, there was lots of security around, but Barack was able to really relax and get into it,” Mr. Branson wrote. While Mr. Obama was enjoying the wind and the waves, his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced details of his   work. Mr. Biden will lead the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a new effort “focused principally on diplomacy, foreign policy and national security,” the university  announced on Tuesday. Mr. Biden said in a statement: “The Penn Biden Center and I will be engaging with Penn’s wonderful students while partnering with its eminent faculty and global centers to convene world leaders, develop and advance smart policy, and impact the national debate about how America can continue to lead in the 21st Century. ” The center will be in Washington, but Mr. Biden will also have an office on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, which is a short Amtrak ride away in Philadelphia. The campus is also a fairly short trip from Delaware, where Mr. Biden served as a senator for 36 years and where he maintains deep roots. He will also be working with the University of Delaware, his alma mater. The university announced on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would be the founding chairman of the Biden Institute, which it described as “a new research and policy center focused on developing public policy solutions on issues ranging from economic reform and environmental sustainability to civil rights, criminal justice, women’s rights and more. ” The former vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, intend to split time between a lakeside home in Greenville, Del. a Wilmington suburb, and a home in Washington. Dr. Biden plans to continue teaching English at a community college in Northern Virginia. The couple previously announced the creation of the Biden Foundation as a platform to advance priorities like military families, preventing violence against women and a “moonshot” to cure cancer."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

 _The Limits of the Market: The Pendulum between Government and Market_  
Paul De Grauwe  
New York: Oxford University Press, 2017, 165 pp.  
  




In the preface to _The Limits of the Market,_ Paul De Grauwe, an economics professor at the London School of Economics, begins with two basic premises: first, that a centrally planned economy does not work; second, that pure market systems do not exist anywhere. According to De Grauwe, “The only relevant question, then, is how precisely that mixture should look”—that is, the correct mix of market freedom and public policy oversight.



He writes of a “Great Economic Pendulum”—that swings between greater and lesser government intervention—“cyclical movements” in economic history. To illustrate this, he describes a general decline in government involvement in the world economy during the first part of the 20th century. Then the Great Depression ushered in greater government involvement that continued through the middle decades of the century. That gave way to renewed market liberalization in the 1980s, which ended with the Great Recession. With this brief overview of modern economic history as his departure point, he begins to explain what he sees as the limits of capitalism.



“The limits of a market system relate to the fact that the connection between individual and collective rationality can be severed,” De Grauwe writes. He identifies two types of situations in which large numbers of people do not believe that their own interests are being met satisfactorily by markets. The first type, which he labels “external limits,” and others commonly call “externalities,” involves individual decisions that have a positive or negative effect on others. The second category, “internal limits,” involves the conflict between individuals’ “System I” decision-making—relying on intuition and emotion—and “System II” decision-making—relying on reason. These two systems are connected and require a satisfying balance between emotional and rational demands in order for the market system to work effectively. Often, however, this balance of individual and collective rationality is not maintained.



DeGrauwe argues that individuals do not take into account the external effects of their individual decisions. He offers three examples of this: climate change and global warming (“carbon dioxide as a harmful gas generating external costs across geographic borders”); financial markets (“a banking crisis where the system reaches its limits before collapsing and requiring a government bail‐​out”); and public goods and the free‐​rider problem (“the market system has no mechanism for creating public goods”).



He discusses how the expansion of the market system brings it to its “internal limits.” He identifies three mechanisms that lead to the discrepancy between individual and collective well‐​being.



The first mechanism has to do with markets and distribution, whereby the price system leads to an inequality of income and wealth, a sense of injustice, and a desire for individual charity on the part of those able to purchase a good (“sharing with those not able to pay for a product”), as well as a possible revolt by those individuals in the lowest income groups (“protests and violent revolutions”).



The second mechanism has to do with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation means “that people are motivated to put their effort into their work or other activities because they are fulfilled by the work or activity itself.” Extrinsic motivation means “that people make an effort for the sake of the financial reward for a particular activity.” Reconciling these two diametrically opposed motivations is inherently challenging, as managers find it easier to focus on extrinsic motivations involving financial bonuses (which are easily eliminated when managers are confronted by company financial duress).



The third mechanism has to do with competition and cooperation in the market environment. Though both can encourage good market behavior, competition and cooperation can conflict with each other on both emotional and rational levels, resulting in an internal tension between individual and collective well‐​being.



De Grauwe next addresses what he refers to as the “utopia of market self‐​regulation.” While so‐​called market fundamentalists argue that problems concerning the environment and public goods are grounded in a lack of property rights and solutions lie in somehow creating those rights, De Grauwe questions how such rights are possible. For instance, how can government establish ownership rights when people all over the world are negatively affected by air pollution? How does one identify billions of harmed people who will seek legal compensation from billions of other people who are responsible for their injuries, and in what court of law (De Grauwe calls this a “complicated information problem”)? But, as he notes, even if one were able to solve this information problem—that is, through the highly unlikely scenario of negotiating voluntary agreements with billions of people—the legislative branch will have to assign property rights in law (or negotiate those voluntary agreements), and the courts and police will have to enforce those rights—thus inevitably involving government institutions.



Given this need for government to ultimately save the market from its own destruction, De Grauwe discusses three domains where government policy and normative theory have a role in managing the market: externalities (by levying taxes on those engaging in undesirable behavior), supplying public goods (and eliminating the free‐​rider problem in market responses), and redistribution (of income and wealth on the highest incomes, thus providing the socially and politically stabilizing effects of greater equality). However, he recognizes that, while the government may know what it must do, that does not always mean that it will implement such policies. Why? Because government is also subject to limitations.



According to De Grauwe, politicians are prevented from following the normative prescriptions of economic theory. The external limits of government, he writes, involve externalities related to the collective interest, say for environmental protection. This is a similar discrepancy that exists with the external limits of markets, but, unlike the market where individuals resist the efforts of governments to harm private interests in favor of the collective, the discrepancy works in the opposite direction: individuals make decisions that harm the collective good. In this case, the challenge for government (especially in democratic societies) is to close the difference between individual and collective rationality, thus gaining broader support from their citizens for the government’s decisions.



As De Grauwe points out, the free market appeals to the individual’s rational, calculating side at the expense of his or her emotional side. Thus, government appeals to the emotional side—or the dissatisfaction gap left by the free market—and is the mechanism through which emotions are expressed. To this end, government focuses its efforts on distribution problems, motivated by a universal sense of fairness. Emotional appeals to “fairness” win out over rational appeals to profit and efficiency.



Government, however, faces two limits. The first—redistribution at the expense of efficiency—holds that neither excessive equality nor excessive inequality is good for efficiency. Most capitalist regimes tend to reflect this principle. The second—a balance between emotion and reason—recognizes that the more governments work on redistribution the more they tax individuals and limit individual freedom. An example of this is embodied in a public‐​pension system, where, if government does not keep moral hazard under control, the citizen’s sense of fairness is overwhelmed by too many “free‐​riders” exploiting the system.



De Grauwe notes that discussions on the role of markets and government have been ongoing for centuries “between people who believed that the market system was the foundation of economic organization (and creates the economic value that makes it possible to maintain the public sector) or that the task was reserved for government (as it establishes and enforces property rights).” That traditional view is espoused by both market fundamentalists and government fundamentalists, and is often portrayed as a pyramid hierarchy, with either the market or government at the top. So who is in charge?



De Grauwe argues that such hierarchical thinking is wrong, as both the private and public sectors are necessary and it is equally important for both sectors to operate effectively. To that end he offers a nonhierarchal, elliptical portrayal of the relationship of market and government. As he explains:



If the government does not succeed in making those who generate external costs from market activities pay for them, then at some point the market system will come to an end. In the same way we can conclude that a government which does not succeed in providing essential public goods such as infrastructure, law and order, public safety, and education will lead the way to the downfall of the market system



The only relevant question worth asking, he writes, is how the division of labor between markets and government can best be organized.



De Grauwe next reviews theories of the linear historical demise of capitalism proposed by Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Schumpter, and Karl Polanyi. In response to their critiques, he explains that the empirical data of the last 200 years have shown a cyclical—not linear—movement. The market system hits its limit, wanes temporarily, and is replaced by a state system that is full of internal contradictions that will lead to its demise, eventually to be replaced by a resurrection of the market system.



De Grauwe also views the creation of the eurozone (and by extension, the euro) as a threat to national governments. He explains how a eurozone government issues debt in a currency over which it has no control. Thus, the national government cannot offer any guarantee to bondholders that the euros will be available to pay them on the maturity date. Thus, without a national guarantee, the implication is that the financial markets can force national governments into insolvency against their will, which will lead to a dangerous supremacy of the markets. De Grauwe believes that the market has forced many eurozone countries (such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain) to adopt excessive austerity budgets that have led to increasing unemployment and the collapse of parts of the public pension system.



To better understand the limits of capitalism, he refers to the results of Thomas Piketty’s _Capital in the Twenty‐​First Century_. Piketty begins his analysis by evaluating the long‐​term development of the quantity of (net) capital in the economies of the western world, focusing his historical analysis on France and Great Britain (although referencing the United States). He finds that, in the very long term, capital income is higher than the growth of the economy, thus the return on capital is greater than the growth of gross domestic product. De Grauwe believes the implications of Piketty’s research are reflected by the increasingly large proportion of top incomes in capitalist societies that go to the _rentiers_ —the investors in capital. To save both democracy and capital, Piketty’s solution is to offset the great inequality in _rentier_ assets by instituting a progressive wealth tax, thereby saving capitalism from the capitalists.



In his concluding chapter, De Grauwe acknowledges there will always be pendulum swings between market and government. In the 21st century, he views the natural environment as an external limit toward which the market system is rapidly headed, and the tendency for greater income inequality as an internal limit of the market system. A reformist scenario, however, has governments raising taxes on high incomes and wealth, thus making inequality less extreme and more acceptable to society in the 21st century. By instituting this policy, governments would allow the market system to softly come up against its internal limits. Likewise, citizenry would apply democratic pressure on governments to combat pollution (such as carbon dioxide) by using taxes and regulations, and to provide subsidies for alternative energy sources. Therefore, this policy response halts environmental degradation and allows the market to more gently approach its external limits.



De Grauwe’s basic framework offers a plausible explaination for how the pendulum swings between a mix of market freedom and government oversight and intervention. Modern economic history, with the cyclic swings in western democracies embracing capitalism bears this out. What that “mix” should be, however, is less convincing. He admits that he has evolved into less of a supporter of market forces, which is reflected in the title of his book. His argument is based on his belief that “neither market nor government is more important,” yet he emphasizes examples of market failure far more than examples of government failure, though the latter includes such drastic examples as failed communist regimes or the potential for eurozone failure to back sovereign‐​issued debt. This book would have been improved if De Grauwe had dealt in finer detail with the true limits of government, for example by including the theory on nonmarket failure in democratic and capitalist societies as developed by Ronald Coase and Charles J. Wolfe, among others.



For example, De Grauwe uses the economic recession of 2008, specifically the financial services sector, as an example of market failure. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a U.S. commission charged with investigating the causes of the financial crisis, reported in 2011 that, while the modern financial system was evolving, government regulation did not keep pace with the rising risks in the U.S. economy. As the report states, “We had a 21st century financial system with 19th century safeguards.” That was not a market failure, but a government one—specifically, an egregious example of how the federal government performed inadequately and did not sufficiently intervene. This form of nonmarket failure is characterized as regulatory arbitrage, where financial institutions take advantage of the differences between economic risk and the existing regulatory position.



On the market side, De Grauwe discusses market failures in self‐​regulation but does little to explore rich examples of successful private ordering. Recent work by economist Edward Stringham ( _Private Governance: Creating Order in Economic and Social Life_ ) offers a rational approach to addressing when government or markets are warranted to solve societal problems. Private governance is practiced by clubs and voluntary associations in the marketplace, through electronic payment processing, for example. Other examples include best industry practices, as well as codified industry standards, which are developed in the United States by associations without direct government involvement. (Such standards are often later incorporated by reference in administrative rules.) While often requiring a certain level of government intervention, for example, to adjudicate and enforce contracts, such private ordering is an example of how markets can operate creatively and effectively with limited government intervention and oversight.



In conclusion, De Grauwe offers the reader a thought‐​provoking book and a basic theoretical and empirical departure point for further work on an important topic relevant to the future of democratic capitalism. Public policy issues of income inequality (especially a stagnant or declining economic middle class), crushing national debt, public pension and health insurance funding shortfalls, and the ever intrusive and coercive regulatory state (and loss of liberty) are coming due. The important question still remains: What is the right mix of market and state?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems that it is beginning to dawn on some of Europe’s mainstream media: The transition to green energies is turning out to be ten or even 100 times more expensive than what they were led to believe just a few years ago.
Increasingly we have been seeing reports featuring renowned climate economists such as Bjørn Lomborg or Richard Tol in the German-language mainstream media.
The message: Hey, this green energy policy really isn’t working well at all.
And again the climate policy critics Tol and Lomborg are being featured by the German-language media as respected dissident voices, this time by the online Austrian nachrichten.at in an article titled: 1 Euro Kosten, 3 Cent Nutzen. In English:
1 euro costs, 3 cents benefit
First the nachrichten.at discusses what could be the most economically sensible way of reducing CO2 emissions. So far the measures that have been implemented have been both effective and ineffective: Effective at costing lots of money, ineffective at actually reducing CO2 emissions.
The nachrichten.at writes that the most effective policy to reduce carbon emissions may be a CO2 tax, but then writes how Australia has just repealed it because of its sheer unpopularity.
The Austrian nachrichten.at then writes about the astronomical costs and the utter ineffectivity of climate policy so far:

Already the EU 2020 strategy costs 185 billion euros annually. By the end of the century the costs will run to 15 trillion euros. With this, according to the UN IPCC, the global temperature increase will be lowered 0.05°C. For every euro that the EU pays into climate protection, it prevents 3 cents worth of damage from climate change. Lomborg writes: ‘That is not rational policy!'”
The nachrichten.at quotes what Lomborg said in 2013:
If the measures against climate change are not economically efficient, then they will not be sustainable because countries struggling to emerge like India and China will not follow along.”
Moreover the article presents harsh criticism from Richard Tol, writing:
Trillions of euros, zero effect
What has been done and planned thus far has been a debacle. […] Although the consequences of climate change cannot be denied, they have, however, been drastically overestimated. Tol accuses the climate scientists of acting ‘bitterly and politically’.”
Things are slowly changing. German language media are increasingly presenting other opinions to get the public to take another look at where the current, skewed energy policy is leading. That’s good news because a debate has long been sorely missing. As the costs skyrocket, the days of isolating divergent opinions may be ending.

President Obama is presiding over what may prove to be the most significant round of trade liberalization in American history, yet he has never once made an affirmative case for that outcome. Despite various reports of intensifying outreach to members of Congress, the president's ""advocacy"" is couched in enough skepticism to create and reinforce fears about trade and globalization.



Politico reports:



On Tuesday, Obama sent a letter directly to Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), arguing that reaching new trade agreements is the only way to stop China from dominating the global markets and letting its lax standards run the world.



""If they succeed, our competitors would be free to ignore basic environmental and labor standards, giving them an unfair advantage against American workers,"" Obama wrote Gallego in a letter obtained by POLITICO. ""We can’t let that happen. We should write the rules, and level the playing field for the middle class.""





Certainly, playing the China card could help win support for Trade Promotion Authority and, eventually, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but it needn't be the first selling point. Pitching trade agreements as though they were innoculations from an otherwise imminent disease betrays a profound lack of understanding of the benefits of trade. With TPP near completion and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks expected to accelerate, the president’s stubborn refusal to make an affirmative case for his trade initiatives to the public and the skeptics in his party is disconcerting. Bill Watson was troubled by the president's feeble advocacy of trade liberalization in his SOTU address.



Does Obama really want a legacy as the president who increased Americans’ economic liberties and opportunities when the best case he can muster for his agenda is that if we don’t adopt it we’ll get crushed? I have questioned whether he supports his own trade agenda considering -- among other things -- his commitment to arresting climate change and growing income inequality, both of which he believes are exacerbated by increased trade.

Never has the president described how the TPP will better integrate U.S. producers, consumers, workers, investors and taxpayers with customers, suppliers, supply-chain collaborators, and investors in Asia and the Americas. Never has he explained that by eliminating tariffs and other monopolistic impediments to trade and investment, the TPP will help increase the scope for economies of scale and specialization, which will help reduce production costs, freeing resources for lower prices, investment, and research and development. Never has he taken the time to point out that competition inspires innovation, which especially benefits companies operating in the United States, which are advantaged with privileged access to research universities and broad and deep capital markets to commercialize innovation. Never has he mentioned that by opening the door to more competition to bid on public procurement projects, the TPP will help ensure higher quality infrastructure, on-time completion, and better use of taxpayer dollars. Never has he touted the advantages to the U.S. economy of tighter integration with the world’s fastest growing region. None of these positive, promising, pioneering aspects of the TPP has been given an ounce of public attention from the president. 

Some Washington insiders will be sure to contact Bill or me to say it doesn’t matter how Obama portrays trade, as long as he gets enough votes. Well, sure, I understand the transactional nature of politics. But if you don’t try to convince anyone of the merits of trade, if you allow to lay unrebutted, to fester and metastasize, the fallacies concocted by the monopolies who benefit from restricting trade, it serves to legitimize those fears and guarantees a continuation of misinformation and discord where there should be much less.

What should’ve been a slam‐​dunk win for those challenging Minnesota’s ban on “political” apparel at the polls was complicated by the plaintiffs’ counsel’s inability to draw clear lines between what the government can and can’t restrict. The voters’ lawyer began his argument by arguing, quite correctly, that Minnesota’s law was overbroad — sweeping in shirts and buttons supporting the Chamber of Commerce, NAACP, and AFL-CIO — and so several justices pushed him on the constitutionality of a more narrow rule, one restricting paraphernalia explictly referencing candidates and parties. Counsel hemmed and hawed but ultimately stated that he would make that “close call” by disallowing such a statute, though it would depend how the legislature worded it.   
  
  
That unsuccessful attempt to play coy opened the door to discussions of how to draw the distinction between electioneering — which the Court 25 years ago correctly held could be banned within a certain distance of the polling booth — and what the law at issue proscribes. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy further expressed concern about the state’s interest in maintaining “decorum” and “solemnity” (which Justice Elena Kagan later made light of by suggesting that it likened a poll to a church). As Justice Kagan put it, “it’s hard to evaluate an overbreadth argument if we don’t know where to draw the line.”   
  
  
This shouldn’t be so hard. Federal and state laws everywhere already prohibit intimidation, deception, disruption, and other attempts to interfere with the right to vote, so the rare t‐​shirt that does one of those things — for example, “Republicans vote tomorrow” or “Mexicans shouldn’t vote” — is already covered. As for the electioneering bit, a voter’s wearing a button is very different from an activist’s waving signs or distributing literature — or even that same voter’s going up to others in line and trying to convince them to vote for a particular candidate.   
  
  
Moreover, Minnesota’s law is so broad and gives so much discretion to poll workers that its enforcement is arbitrary. When the lawyer representing the election officials tried to explain that a political message or insignia could only be restricted if it related to an issue that was part of the campaign — which seemed to be a change from his earlier litigating position — Justice Samuel Alito shut him down with a devastating line of inquiry. Alito asked whether shirts with the following text could be banned: Parkland Strong, NRA, “I Miss Bill [Clinton],” Reagan‐​Bush ’84. Counsel struggled to answer, at which pointed Alito asked whether, in the current political climate, the text of the Second Amendment could be banned. The response was yes!   
  
  
That’s about as much of a mic‐​drop moment as happens at the Supreme Court — and it was followed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s concern that #MeToo apparel could be banned given that sexual harassment is very much an issue in contemporary discourse. “The [poll workers’] conversation about the shirt seems more disruptive” than the shirt itself, commented Justice Kennedy.   
  
  
The challengers will still win their case — only Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor appeared firmly on the state’s side, so I’m still confident the margin will be more than 5–4 — but it’ll be closer, and the opinion likely narrower, than it needed to be.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost of us already suspect that environmentalists are dictatorial wolves dressed in the democracy sheepskin. Despite all the lip service they pay to justice and liberty, they are really all about state power and regulation.
So it is with Germany’s authoritarian statists and greens, who not long ago called for the enactment of a nationwide “Veggie Day” once a week in order to start weaning people off climate-killing diets containing meat. Fortunately the citizens roundly rejected the nonsense, sending the wackos off – to return another day.

German city of Bremen attempts to form a green police to enforce proposed ban of electric heaters.
Well, that “another day” has already arrived. The latest suggested intrusion into and control over our private lives is reported by the Liberal website of Friedrich Naumann Foundation For Liberty.
In the northern port city of Bremen, just a single hour away from the home of NoTricksZone, officials are now busily playing let’s-save-the-planet and zealously committing the city to cutting its carbon footprint by 40% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.

How is this to be done? The Liberal writes (my emphasis):
One of the planned measures: The ‘ban of electric heaters’. What sounds like one of the usual injection of fuel into the green bonfire of bans in fact takes on a whole new quality. The proposed law by Environment Senator Joachim Lohse foresees a system of monitoring that allows for detection of violations and punishment. According to the Weser-Kurier daily, officials would ‘in carrying out the duties of their office, tread upon private property and enter private buildings‘. The provision of the German Constitution for the inviolability of the home would in this respect be curtailed.”
The Liberal adds:
Here Lohse is creating nothing less than an environment police.”
As mentioned, the proposed law for the city of Bremen of course would clash with Article 13 of the German Constitution which guarantees private individuals the “inviolability of the home”. But in the City of Bremen, which is run by a coalition of climate protection-obsessed socialists and greens, little things like Constitutional Rights are not about to stop their hunt for electric radiators as part of their mission to rescue the planet. After all it’s far more vital to improve the city’s carbon footprint and to promote sustainability then it is to uphold the Federal Constitution.
In their distorted minds, not having an electric heater is more important than having fundamental Constitutional rights.

Pope Francis’ new encyclical, _Laudato Si_ , advocates a new “ecological spirituality.” Yet this challenging call is diminished by the document’s tendency to devolve into leftish policy positions. The encyclical underestimates the power of market forces to promote environmental ends.   
  
There are serious environmental problems but _Laudato Si_ presumes rather than proves crisis is the norm. Moreover, nothing in Scripture or nature tells us how much to spend to clean up the air.   
  
Drawing environmental lines requires balancing such interests as ecology, liberty, and prosperity. One cannot merely assume that the correct outcome in every case is more of the first.   
  
Indeed, the Pontiff’s own goals conflict. He speaks movingly of the dignity of work and its importance for the poor. But the more expensive and extensive the government controls, the fewer and less remunerative the jobs.   
  
Perhaps most disappointing is how the Pope seemingly views capitalism, and especially property rights, as enemies of a better, cleaner world. Yet most environmental problems reflect the _absence_ of markets and property rights, the “externalities,” in economist-speak, which impact others.   




The best solution is to either create or mimic markets and property rights. For instance, public control rarely ends well.   
  
Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “tragedy of the commons,” in which land open to everyone typically is misused by everyone. Federal range and forest land is badly managed, not because government officials are malign, but because the incentives they face are perverse.   
  
In contrast, a private owner bears both costs and benefits, and suffers when he misuses a resource. The owner may make a mistake, but his power to do harm is sharply limited.   
  
Pollution taxes and tradeable permits attempt to apply market forces to the great common areas, such as air and water. Yet _Laudato Si_ launches a perplexing attack on the use of emission credits to limit pollution. Properly designed they create an incentive for those who can control emissions at the least cost to control them the most.   
  
Although the Pope acknowledges “that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views,” _Laudato Si_ ignores the most sophisticated critiques of climate alarmists. For instance, many critics dispute the likelihood of catastrophic change and the best means to deal with the likely impact of any temperature increases.   
  
For years models failed to match climatic behavior. Peer-reviewed research increasingly suggests that warming will be modest. Moreover, any prediction today as to conditions decades in the future is a wild guess.   
  
These argue in favor of addressing specific problems rather than imposing arbitrary, draconian, and costly cuts in energy consumption. Economic analysis confirms that adaptation can achieve similar environmental ends at less expense.   
  
_Laudato Si_ criticizes wasteful, unnecessary consumption and worries about “the depletion of natural resources.” The Pope rightly asks, how should we use the resources entrusted to us by God?   
  
However, the encyclical offers no evidence for its sharp attack on consumption in developed countries, which of course produce more than they use. In fact, unowned or underpriced resources are vulnerable to abuse in any society.   
  
Where markets operate, resource depletion is largely a myth because prices signal consumers and producers to adapt. There now is more recoverable oil than ever.   
  
Markets typically are better than governments in protecting “future generations.” An individual landowner who misuses his property loses its value. The typical political time horizon is until the next election.   
  
As I point out for the Acton Institute: “Economic progress eases the impact of environmental problems on the poor. It also provides resources to enhance the environment, efficiencies to produce more using less, and technologies to better preserve ecological values.”   
  
Of course, markets are not perfect or enough. Perhaps the encyclical’s most important message is that “the emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume.” That is something no government program can fill.

"Music was not only Walter Hautzig’s vocation. It also won over the young woman who would become his wife. And it saved his life. Mr. Hautzig, a concert pianist who escaped from   Vienna as a teenager armed with a fellowship from the Jerusalem Conservatory and went on to become a touring musical   ambassador, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Deborah Hautzig, said. Only five years after he blustered his way into an audition with the conservatory’s director in 1938, the    Mr. Hautzig made his American debut at Town Hall in New York with an ambitious program of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. A reviewer for The New York Times said it “augured a brilliant career. ” Years later, Mr. Hautzig recalled, “My father said I should be a doctor or a lawyer, but after Town Hall, he never left the house without the New York Times review in his pocket. ” Mr. Hautzig (pronounced  ) won the 1943 Town Hall Endowment Series Award for best young artist that year. He later became a cultural ambassador for the United States, performing around the world for three decades. In the 1950s he performed frequently in Japan under State Department sponsorship. In 1979, after relations thawed, he was the first American artist officially delegated to perform in mainland China. “Beethoven and Chopin are as good for the Asians as for the Europeans as for the Jews as for the gentiles,” he told The Forward in 2007. He refused, however, to perform before a racially segregated audience in Alabama in the 1940s. “He told the concert manager, ‘You’re as bad as the Nazis! ’” Ms. Hautzig, his daughter, recalled in her eulogy at his funeral on Thursday. “They said, ‘Go back where you came from. ’” While music affected Mr. Hautzig profoundly, the instrument that spared him from Nazi persecution and led to his marriage entered his personal life serendipitously. “His father had had a big success in his business and told my grandmother she had two choices: She could have a fur coat, or she could have a piano,” Ms. Hautzig said in her eulogy. “She chose the piano. ” Her father began playing it when he was 4. Walter Hautzig was born on Sept. 28, 1921, in Vienna to the former Rosa Zwim and David Hautzig, a bookbinder. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music until the German annexation of Austria capped a period of growing   there, during which he was arrested at least once and also forced to scrub streets on his knees. “They made the world believe that they were Hitler’s first victims, but Hitler’s army was received with kisses,” he said of Austrians. When the music academy was shuttered and seized by German soldiers, he practiced the piano on his own at home. “I said to myself, ‘This they can never take away from me,’” he recalled in a documentary filmed by his granddaughter Molly DeVries. Responding to an advertisement in a Jewish newspaper, he arrived at a Vienna hotel at 8 a. m. to audition for Emil Hauser, director of the Jerusalem Conservatory and a founder of the Budapest String Quartet. Mr. Hauser was not just offering fellowships he was also offering exit visas. Mr. Hauser finally surfaced at 2 p. m. and apologized, saying he had had to rush to another appointment. Audaciously, Mr. Hautzig joined him in a taxi, and when they arrived at a private apartment that happened to have a piano, Mr. Hauser pointed to it and said, “Spiel!” (“Play! ”) Mr. Hautzig performed Beethoven’s “Waldstein” Sonata. “When I finished playing,” Mr. Hautzig said, “he exclaimed, ‘No matter what it takes, I will make sure that you come to Jerusalem. ’” A month later he arrived in what was then Palestine, where he studied under Josef Tal and Alfred Schroeder and performed as a soloist with the Jerusalem Academy Orchestra. After a year and a half, he joined his parents and sister, who had fled through Switzerland, in New York. He studied privately with Artur Schnabel and enrolled in the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was later a professor of piano at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, from 1960 to 1988. He continued to perform until a few years ago. Returning from Scandinavia, where he performed to raise money for war victims of the Nazis, he met Esther Rudomin. She was on her way to New York from Siberia, where her family had been exiled. She was 16 and seasick. “I played for her the G minor Ballade of Chopin,” Mr. Hautzig said, “and she said, ‘Anybody who plays like that has to be good. ’” They married in 1950. Esther Hautzig, who became an author of children’s books, died in 2009. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Hautzig is survived by a son, David, and three grandchildren. The Hautzigs lived in an Upper West Side apartment building, and Mrs. Hautzig once cited the unique challenges that urban acoustics posed for a professional musician. “A neighbor called and said, ‘Mrs. Hautzig, your husband’s practicing is driving me crazy,’” she recalled. “I gulped and apologized. The neighbor interrupted my apologies: ‘No, what’s he practicing? I know the piece and can’t remember what it is! ’”"

2019 was the third consecutive local body election in which I have compiled a voting guide. In 2013, [it was a couple of pages knocked together](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1309/S00728/the-affordable-auckland-voting-guide.htm), with a considerable amount of self-interest invested into it. The Affordable City nationwide local body ticket – Affordable Auckland in our case – had three candidates for Council, two for local board and myself standing for Mayor. 



Affordable Auckland Results 2013  




In 2016, I’d withdrawn from the Mayoral race when the centre-right got too crowded, Palino had a very similar platform to mine and I’d now been transferred to open a new supermarket. It’s hard to sit and watch, quietly, from the sidelines. [Hence, a 2016 voting guide.](http://community.scoop.co.nz/2016/09/stephen-berrys-guide-to-voting-auckland-2016/) It took a couple of days to complete but again, not that detailed.



When the 2019 candidates had been confirmed, I figured it wouldn’t be that difficult to do an assessment of every race if I started immediately, but hyper-focus and the desire not to be sued for defamation resulted in each article taking 2 to 5 hours at a time to write. Local boards such as Manurewa with 22 candidates and Devonport-Takapuna with 18 were especially demanding. Underestimating the size or difficulty of a task is a mistake I think I’m doomed never to learn, though the accompanying excessively optimistic outlook is compensation enough.



For a blatantly biased voting guide, I was determined to be as fair and systematic as possible by reading every candidate profile and googling each candidate to ensure I had as much information as possible. This was most difficult with local board contests. I’ve had a long and sufficiently intense interest in politics for most names or affiliations to ring a bell, though some had virtually no google footprint at all. 



Incumbents are among those with virtually no online presence, including incumbents no longer affiliated with the tickets they were elected prior. The absence of evidence for their newfound independence speaks just as loudly as the absence of any other visibility on google. They did as little as their former colleagues claim. Conversely, a much smaller number of incumbents with new affiliations also stood for re-election and their google footprints indicate the fault resulting in parting ways with their colleagues isn’t their own.



Some candidate profiles were either obviously rushed, showed a lack of effort or were grammatically indecipherable. Others said plenty about themselves or careers and little about their priorities, then had the nerve to send me criticisms for portraying them poorly, not doing enough research or failing to understand how that experience would make them excellent representatives.



Candidates write the candidate profiles themselves. If I have failed to understand the value you would add as a representative, using your candidate profile and google searches using the keywords within, the fault is entirely yours. Do better. Others, standing for election for the first time emailed their appreciation of being reviewed, some of which were blunt but came with suggestions for improvement. The clickbait nature of mass mainstream media meant it was almost the only coverage they had and that’s a frustration I completely understand. Considering the number of elections I’ve lost, it is legitimate to question the value of that advice but much of it comes from politicians I look up to and failing teaches at least as many lessons as success.



I’ve lived in a variety of Auckland suburbs in my life; Manurewa, Mt. Roskill, St. Lukes, Ponsonby, Massey, Lynfield, Onehunga, Remuera, Meadowbank, CBD and Forrest Hill. Most of the contests I researched with no preconceptions of whom I would support and in some cases completed the review with a decision very different from expected. I didn’t even open my voting papers until the articles on Orakei and the Mayoralty were written and published. The irony of being unable to make a decision until reading the voting guide I authored isn’t lost.



Numerous contests, especially the local boards, I knew virtually nothing of the participants, their policies or the nuances of the unique issues of their locality until the article was completely researched and published. The public responses that followed were sufficient evidence I’d got it right. Some were so disproportionate and bizarre, they only helped the reputation of the candidate they opposed.



On occasion, I got it wrong, inevitable given the enormity of the task. The spelling of a couple of candidate names had to be fixed. One candidate who I stated had championed an unsuccessful petition for a dog park, produced evidence showing not only was the petition not rejected but the local board in question was very close to implementing its request. Naturally I was only too happy to publish a correction in every facebook community group possible. There was also the case of two female candidates, listed one after the other on the same ballot who had both worked in their local MP’s office and one was missed from the guide. Credit goes to the persistence and politeness of their many supporters for the injustice being corrected.



Sometimes, I’d encounter candidate names that I only recognised as having liked the facebook page recently. Many I’d met and liked personally despite their politics. Those were the most difficult to write. Politics is an enterprise in which uncomplimentary interactions or language are routine and necessary. It varies wildly depending on the individual, but a significant proportion of the insults and criticisms levelled at rivals aren’t enjoyable.



To my knowledge, _Stephen Berry’s Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ is the most comprehensive, complete and detailed guide compiled in New Zealand political history. If not, it certainly is the case for one compiled single-handedly. 



Unfortunately, I fell short of achieving a review of every election contest, though the Mayoralty, all Council Wards, 1 DHB, 16 from 32 local board contests and the Waitakere & Portage Licensing Trusts were completed.



Several other organisations also wrote guides recommending voting choices;



All of these guides shared a fatal flaw. They required candidate participation. Not every candidate likes answering policy questions for a publisher they perceive to be hostile or unimportant. Communities & Residents didn’t participate in any in Auckland. _Stephen Berry’s Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ (aka The BFD’s _An Absolutely Biased Guide to Auckland Local Elections_ ) wasn’t compromised by that handicap because I asked virtually no candidates. The names of those who contacted me will stay with me.



There were 40 individual contests rated, once local boards are split into subdivisions where appropriate.



That’s 282 candidacies, compiled at the end of this article though, with 1 day left for people to physically deliver their vote, I doubt that will make any further impact.

"WASHINGTON  —   Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation’s education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The    vote capped an   vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos  —   a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers  —   from becoming the steward of the nation’s nearly 100, 000 public schools. It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. “If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president’s nominees, what are we even doing here?” Mr. Franken asked. The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students. “I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition. Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination. For many educators, Ms. DeVos’s support for charter schools and vouchers  —   which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and   schools  —   reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president. “She led the most effective public school reform movement over the last few years,” he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos’s nomination last week in a   split, said she had been “at the forefront” of education overhaul for decades. By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr. Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p. m. declared his vote for Ms. DeVos. In a procedural quirk, a confirmation vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote “yes” before leaving the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote. Raised in a wealthy family, Ms. DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has a web of financial investments, has also raised alarm among critics who worried about the many opportunities for conflicts of interest. She was the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel. She filed her ethics paperwork on Jan. 19, two days after her confirmation hearing. Teachers’ unions and even some charter organizations had protested Ms. DeVos’s nomination across the country. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos  —   and a former educator herself  —   urged disheartened advocates on Tuesday morning before the vote not to think of their efforts as a waste. “It’s made an impact here and made a difference,” she said. “And I think it’s woken each of us up in this country to what we value and what we want. ” Shortly after Ms. DeVos’s confirmation, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a union that protested the nomination, said the public would now have to “serve as a check and balance” to her policies and be “fierce fighters on behalf of children. ” “It’s telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,” Ms. Weingarten said. “That’s because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools, a   embrace of private,   alternatives and a lack of basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school. ” David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has studied Ms. DeVos’s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of federal funding. “Her extensive conflicts of interest and record of diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just confirmed to,” he said. Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on embracing charter schools and vouchers. Her ideology was a good fit for Mr. Trump’s education platform during the campaign, which called for a $20 billion voucher initiative aimed at   children. But freeing such an enormous sum would most likely require the reallocation of federal education money, as well as a realignment of congressional priorities. Vouchers were not part of a sweeping education overhaul passed in 2015, and lawmakers from rural areas, where schools tend to be farther apart, are particularly wary of such initiatives. The Trump administration could potentially advance a more limited voucher program and seek tax credits for private school tuition or home schooling costs. Ms. DeVos has also indicated that she would dismantle other pieces of the Obama administration’s legacy, potentially including a rule that denies federal student aid money to   colleges whose graduates struggle to get jobs, as well as an aggressive effort to investigate and adjudicate campus sexual assault claims. Ms. DeVos’s critics said they would continue to fight her as she serves. Some vowed to demonstrate at her appearances at forums and schools and to seek candidates friendly to their view to run for local office. Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association, said her union would tap into the vast database of advocates it had built during Ms. DeVos’s confirmation process to help keep her in check. “As soon as she does something alarming, it will be known, it will be seen,” she said. “She won’t be able to hide. ” Mr. Trump’s choice of Ms. DeVos, known for her   lobbying efforts to expand charter schools in Michigan  —   an experiment that even charter school supporters now criticize  —   to lead the Education Department presented senators with a multitude of potential pitfalls. Her background as a prolific    who has donated about $200 million over the years to Republican causes and candidates  —   including some senators, as has been the case for previous presidential nominees  —   came under scrutiny. Democrats have also expressed concern about her family’s contributions to groups that support   conversion therapy for gay people and her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are a “dead end. ” Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she championed. Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle also expressed concern after Ms. DeVos, during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, confused core responsibilities of the department. In one notable exchange that spread across the internet, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that receive public money should have to follow the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the landmark 1975 civil rights legislation. Under that federal law, states and school districts are required to provide special education services to children with disabilities. Ms. DeVos said the issue was “best left to the states. ” In a bizarre moment that made her the butt of   TV jokes, Ms. DeVos also suggested that states should decide whether to allow guns in schools, citing in part concerns about protection from grizzly bears in Wyoming. “I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies,” she said. Before the vote Tuesday, Mr. Franken said, “It was the most embarrassing confirmation hearing that I have ever seen. ” In a final push that included demonstrations around the country, constituents and advocates swamped Senate offices with calls, so inundating the Capitol switchboard that it disrupted the Senate’s voice mail system."

From the University of British Columbia , a fish story inspired by a model:

Fish getting smaller as the oceans warm: UBC research
Changes in ocean and climate systems could lead to smaller fish, according to a new study led by fisheries scientists at the University of British Columbia.
The study, published today in the journal Nature Climate Change, provides the first-ever global projection of the potential reduction in the maximum size of fish in a warmer and less-oxygenated ocean.

The researchers used computer modeling to study more than 600 species of fish from oceans around the world and found that the maximum body weight they can reach could decline by 14-20 per cent between years 2000 and 2050, with the tropics being one of the most impacted regions.
“We were surprised to see such a large decrease in fish size,” says the study’s lead author William Cheung, an assistant professor at the UBC Fisheries Centre. “Marine fish are generally known to respond to climate change through changing distribution and seasonality. But the unexpectedly big effect that climate change could have on body size suggests that we may be missing a big piece of the puzzle of understanding climate change effects in the ocean.”
This is the first global-scale application of the idea that fish growth is limited by oxygen supply, which was pioneered more than 30 years ago by Daniel Pauly, principal investigator with UBC’s Sea Around Us Project and the study’s co-author.
“It’s a constant challenge for fish to get enough oxygen from water to grow, and the situation gets worse as fish get bigger,” explains Pauly. “A warmer and less-oxygenated ocean, as predicted under climate change, would make it more difficult for bigger fish to get enough oxygen, which means they will stop growing sooner.”
This study highlights the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and develop strategies to monitor and adapt to changes that we are already seeing, or we risk disruption of fisheries, food security and the way ocean ecosystems work.
###
Note the press release headline: Fish getting smaller as the oceans warm: UBC research – they tout that as if it were measured, it isn’t.
Of course actual field experiments with real data trump models every day of the week and twice on Sunday. For example here’s a graph from the paper The effect of temperature and fish size on growth, feed intake, food conversion efficiency and stomach evacuation rate of Atlantic salmon post-smolts by Handeland et al published in the journal Aquaculture in June 2008:

Fig. 1. Mean weight in Atlantic salmon smolts (±SE, n=23) transferred to seawater at 6 (□), 10 (Δ), 14 (⋄) and 18 (○) °C. The first point (week 0) refers to the freshwater group (control). Different letters indicates significant differences (Student–Newman–Keuls, pb0.05) between temperature groups at same time of sampling, n.s., non significant.
The authors conclude:
In conclusion, the present study shows ontogenetic variation in optimum temperature for growth in juvenile Atlantic salmon smolts, with increased temperature optimum for growth and decreased temperature for feed conversion efficiency as the fish grow bigger.
Temperature tolerance increases with size, but Atlantic salmon smolts are eurythermal (Able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures.) in the size range investigated. 
Full paper here (PDF)
Now as Willis would point out, clearly this is tank studies, and not the open ocean, and you can’t duplicate the complexity of the ocean in a tank. But the fish don’t seem to have a temperature issue, in fact they seem to thrive at warmer temperatures. The claim is that as oceans warm, less oxygen will be available, and that will stunt the growth of fish. This claim in the modeling paper comes from the elemental saturation curve for dissolved oxygen (DO) in water, which is much like that of CO2. From a lecture on water chemistry at keystone.edu:

I found this part of the lecture interesting, and was something I didn’t know:
Nota bene:  100% saturation does not mean that no more O2 can be held in solution.  I have measured DO >200%.  Does this mean that bubbles should be forming?  No, not necessarily. Saturation here means that 10.92 mg/l can be held at equilibrium; if 200% is produced by intense photosynthetic activity, the extra amount will be lost (diffused) at the air/water interface.


a nomogram can be used to determine degree of saturation; use a straightedge to connect the water temperature and DO.  Read the % saturation at the intersection of this line with the middle line.


Dissolved Oxygen % Saturation Nomogram
 ·         at 10 meters, with a temperature of 10°C, at surface pressure would hold (at 100% saturation) 10.92 mg, but you may find 15 mg/l.; compared to the surface it would be supersaturated, but at the depth and pressure it’s at, it may be less than saturated.
o       How can water be supersaturated?
§         intense photosynthesis
§         entrainment of air falling over a dam or spillway; high pressure of impact drives gases into solution; may lead to gas bubble disease, a problem in TVA dams
§         affects fish if subjected for a few hours to >115% saturation; bubbles form in tissues; emboli collect in gills causing anoxia and death; also affects cladocerans.  Other biota, e.g., crayfish and stoneflies are hardier.
So, too much oxygen is also a problem. But what really piqued my interest wad the statement of “intense photosynthesis” as a cause. That made me wonder if photosynthetic algae and diatoms would respond to increased temperature, so I went looking and found this paper:  Production and fate of extracellular polymeric substances produced by benthic diatoms and bacteria: A laboratory study by Lundkvist et al.
And the graph showing how photosynthetic oxygen production changes with temperature, again hard data from observation:

Fig. 7. Dose-response curve on light intensity and photosynthesis measured as oxygen production by benthic algae population.
So, it seems to me that the ocean already has this worked out. If O2 can be supersaturated, and “intense photosynthesis” can be a cause, it would seem that warmer water that normally would get oxygen from air-sea interaction and entrainment might be supplemented from increased algal photosynthesis.
Besides, broad differences in oxygen content by latitude are well known:

And fish aren’t static entities…they move. So I suppose I’m not too worried about global warming shrinking fish. Overfishing is likely a far greater problem for reduced fish size, as are oxygen deprived dead zones due to fertilizer runoff as we’ve seen in the Gulf of Mexico:

Dead zones occur throughout the world and are caused primarily from excess fertilizer and animal manure run-off, as well as, emissions from sewage treatment plants, urban and suburban run-off, and air emissions from vehicles. The largest dead zone in the country occurs at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the Gulf of Mexico each spring. In past years, the dead zone (pictured in the satellite image as the red coastal areas around Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida) has encompassed some 5,000 square miles. – ewg.org

"**Nottingham has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, according to the latest data.**
Public Health England figures show that 689.1 per 100,000 people tested positive for the virus in the city over the past week.
Documents leaked earlier today indicate that new social distancing rules for Nottinghamshire are due to be announced on Monday.
Local politicians have criticised the delay in imposing restrictions.
Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said the government's lack of action on new measures in Nottingham ""makes absolutely no sense"" and that ""strict interventions are needed urgently"".
The Labour politician said: ""The delay leaves this weekend open to potential abuse of the existing rules, which could result in yet more Covid cases in our city.""
He called on the government to ""act urgently and decisively or, better still, give us the powers to let us get on with taking action ourselves"".
In the week up to 5 October, Nottingham recorded 2,294 cases, up from 407 the previous week.
Earlier, the county council said the rate of infection for Nottinghamshire was 106 per 100,000, much lower than the rate in Nottingham.
Although the government has yet to introduce formal measures, local authorities have asked people in the county to avoid mixing indoors with other households indoors following the ""dramatic"" rise in cases.
Nottingham's director of public health Alison Challenger said: ""Everyone needs to stick rigidly to their social bubbles and not mix with other households.
""There is no need to wait for additional government restrictions.""
Gedling MP Tom Randall said he would ""wholly support calls"" for people to follow stricter guidelines, while Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood has called the delay in introducing measures ""reckless and indefensible"".
Ms Greenwood added: ""It's outrageous that [MPs] only found out about this decision from the media.""
On Thursday evening, the government released a statement urging residents to follow ""the advice of the local authority"", as well as practising social distancing, wearing face coverings, and getting tested if they exhibited symptoms.
A spokesperson added: ""The local authority has our full backing and support.""
But Nottingham North MP Alex Norris, who was briefed about the government's strategy during a call with health minister Edward Argar, said he was sceptical about the government's strategy.
He said: ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet', which is very hard to understand.
""They won't support us because they won't bring in the restriction we're appealing for them to bring in.
""We're trying to get ahead of those restrictions by suggesting them to people ourselves, but of course we don't have the legal backing to enforce those.""
Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield - which has a lower infection rate of 62.2 - called on the government to reconsider blanket restrictions for the whole of the county.
The Conservative politician added: ""It would be really frustrating to have restrictions imposed when, locally, we might not need them.""
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, leaked documents show Nottinghamshire is expected to go into level two of a new ""three-tier"" system next week.
They indicate people will still be able to go on holiday outside the county, but only with people from their own household or support bubble.
Households would still be able to meet indoors if they are in a support bubble.
Jo Cox-Brown, founder of Night Time Economy, which works with businesses and local authorities to create safer nights out in English cities, said further restrictions could have a devastating effect on jobs.
""[Businesses] are terrified. The night-time economy is worth 14,000 jobs in Nottingham alone,"" she said.
""They were closed for three months, they have been trading for two months but at 50-75% of normal occupancy levels, so financially these venues are on their knees.""
Across England, bars and restaurants could be forced to close as the government prepares to tighten restrictions for the worst-affected areas.
It follows the announcement that similar outlets across central Scotland are to be closed for 16 days.
Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has refused to say whether pubs and restaurants in the north and in Nottingham will be forced to close.
He said: ""We are currently considering what steps we should take, obviously taking the advice of our scientific and medical advisers, and a decision will be made shortly.""
Asked if there will be an announcement linked to the hospitality industry, he said: ""We are considering the evidence. In some parts of the country, the number of cases are rising very fast and we are taking that very seriously.""

"**A padlock on a bed of duck feathers entitled Lockdown has won an annual art competition that parodies the Turner Prize.**
The Turnip Prize is organised by a Somerset pub and is awarded to the person ""using the least amount of effort possible"".
Gardener Herewe Goagain, from Barnstaple, won the prize, ""fulfilling a personal ambition"".
""I'm tickled pink and maybe I should lack effort more often,"" she said.
She added: ""Once the seed was sown, the idea germinated, shoots burst forth into a luxuriate masterpiece"".
This year's Turner Prize was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic and instead replaced with a Â£100,000 fund for struggling artists.
Organiser Trevor Prideaux, from The New Inn in Wedmore, said: ""I am delighted with the lack of effort taken to create this work.
""This year's event attracted a record total of 120 entries.
""It's fantastic that Herewe has won.
""She clearly has what it takes to be recognised in modern art circles and will be remembered in art history for no time at all.""
The prize was first given out in 1999 in response to Tracey Emin's My Bed, which was shortlisted for the Turner Prize that year.
Winners of the competition receive a turnip attached to a wooden base.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs much as an entire array of forces attempted to prevent it, the PRP special edition journal with its 12 peer-reviewed papers that offer an alternative explanation on what contributes to driving climate is coming out – and how!
Ironically, the intense efforts to silence the journal have backfired – the special edition has been receiving widespread exposure rather than being silenced.
Unsurprisingly the dubious attempts to silence the publication have met with loud and harsh objections, see here, here, here, here and here.
The problems began when 19 scientists declared that the special issue shedded “serious doubts” on the conclusions of the IPCC.
That didn’t sit well with publisher Copernicus director Martin Rasmussen, who had come under intense pressure from the climate establishment and took the unbelievable decision to close down the entire journal immediately and “without any discussion with the editors“.
“Inquisition and book burning”

Distinguished Swedish scientist Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner, the former head of the Paleogeophysics and Geodynamics department at Stockholm University, and the PRP special edition journal editor, has now issued a statement here (last page) on the events leading up to politically motivated cancellation of the journal.
By this decision, we were suddenly thrown back in the evolution of humanism and culture to the stage of inquisition and books burning. […]
To debate is a vital part of science. To forbid and even close down a journal because of an inevitable conclusion which “sheds serious doubts on the issue of a continued, even accelerated, warming as claimed by the IPCC” is most unscientific and unethical.
Copernicus has disgraced itself in this desperate act of trying to cover up for IPCC.”
Nils-Axel Mörner was also president of the International Union for Quaternary Research Commission on Neotectonics and has authored close to 600 peer-reviewed papers.
Entire special journal here. 
Now comes the journal’s real test. Let’s wait to see what the “real experts” say about it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrivate commercial meteorologist are always under pressure to produce reasonably accurate forecasts for their clients and to stick to the best available science. If their models and work consistently produce false results, then it is not long before they find themselves looking for a new line of work. There’s no room for politics in their trade.

No trend to anything unusual
One of Germany’s leading private commercial meteorologists, Dominik Jung of wetternet.de, gives an interview at the online Hessische/Niedersächsische Allgemeine Zeitung (HNA). Jung says storms and variable weather are nothing new in Germany, and that there is no trend pointing to any unusual changes.
So far this summer Germany has seen a fair amount of variable weather, with several periods of a few hot days followed by cooler rainy days. HNA asked Jung if this was unusual and if spells of sunny, hot summerlike weather had not been longer in the past. The HNA gives us Jung’s answer: “No. Weeks-long warm periods with long-lasting heat are not typical for our region.”
Summers getting wetter, contradicting climate models
On whether German summers are becoming drier, as many climate scientists once projected: “In the past years six were wetter than the long-term average. The summer of 2013 was a bit too dry.”
Winters are not getting warmer

The HNA also brings up the often mentioned claim that German winters are becoming warmer, and that snow and frost will soon become “a thing of the past”. It writes: Also the suspicion that winters are getting warmer cannot be statistically asserted. Over the past seven years many of the winters were very cold with long periods of snow and ice.”
Increased storm activity in Germany?
The HNA also asked Jung about storm frequency and severity. Here as well the high-profile meteorologist sees no statistical basis. The HNA writes : “According to Jung, there is no detectable increase. The UN IPCC report also comes up with the same result. … statistically there hasn’t been any more such storms than there was 100 years ago.”
On rising insurance claims due to storm damage, Jung says that the rising trend has much more to do with the higher number of people insuring their assets, and is not a measure of storm activity.
Jung also says that spring on average is arriving about one or two weeks earlier than it did 3o years ago. Here Jung does not mention that 30 years ago some importanct ocean cycles were in their cold phases. Climate is changing, but that change is due in most part to natural cycles, which even alarmist scientists have been conceding lately every time they claim “the warming is being masked by natural variations.”
Climate change is natural
When asked if the fluctuiations are a tell-tale sign of climate change, Jung dumps cold water on that claim as well. The HNA reports: “For meteorologist Jung there is currently no acute effects of a climate change. Climate has been changing since the earth was created, and it will continue to do so in the decades and centuries ahead.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans-Joachim Schellnhuber, often regarded in Europe as the Pope John of climate change, has an interview in German flagship political daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
Schellnhuber is often regarded as the father of the 2°C limit the UN and warmists keep talking about. To not exceed the 2°C warming limit, Schellnhuber and the warmists say that drastic cuts in CO2 emissions are needed very urgently.
Barroso “appears exhausted”
In the FAZ, Schellnhuber reiterates many of the points he’s made in the past. But a number of his comments relate to the new non-binding emissions targets now proposed by the European Union. The latest EU proposal is to achieve a 40% CO2 reduction by 2030. Many view this as watered down. Schellnhuber characterizes the new target as “a still acceptable level of ambition, and is in any case not a catastrophe.” He adds:
The new target is the weakest version of a European lead role […]. It is compromise that puts competition at the forefront. It is certainly the result of the European economic crisis and an attempt to some extent to address the trauma while at the same time to not abandon climate protection. The fire that burned in President Barroso is pretty much out.”
Later he adds:
Barroso listens and he understands the things, but he appears exhausted by the European crisis.”
By now we see that even top European policy makers, like Barroso and Merkel, view attempts to reduce carbon as clashing with economic stability. They continue to want to pursue carbon reductions, but realize that going it alone is not going to work economically.
“A renewable efficient system is superior”
But Schellnhuber is not one to give up easily and maintains a face of optimism:

I believe that Europe will decarbonize faster than provided by the roadmap because we can anticipate additional technical and social innovations in the years ahead. We know that a renewable efficient system is superior to fossil-nuclear.”
Prof. Schellnhuber must know a technology that the rest of us aren’t aware of. So far there is not a single green energy out there that has been demonstrated to have the superiority he claims. It’s not for nothing European countries are scaling back green energy subsidies. They’re just not working anywhere near as well as hoped. Right now where I live solar panels are covered with 10 cm of snow and the wind is hardly blowing. Cars are running and homes are heating by using fossil fuels.
“By 2050 we have to be near zero globally.”
From a global perspective, Schellnhuber adds:
By 2020 we must reach the peak in CO2 emissions, then it has to go down and by 2050 we have to be near zero globally.”
It’s one thing to be optimistic, but here Schellnhuber is totally out to lunch if he thinks this is a realistic and achievable target. Does he have any understanding about energy supply and consumption? The whole world is expected to consume as much carbon as the poorest African within a single generation? It’s clearer than ever that Schellnhuber completely miscalculated and that his CO2 – 2°C target calculation is fantasy. Expect leaders to keep listening to Schellnhuber, but not to act.
What is professor Schellnhuber’s next step?
I’m going to speak to Barroso about how he can bring this in harmony with the international target of maximum 2°C.
Whether he listens is another question.

Romm must be fuming. After disappearing his formerly independent “Climate Progress” blog and merging it with the main Think Progress website, where he’s lucky to get a dozen comments a day. His parent organization, Think Progress, utterly fails to mention The Most Important Issue of All Time as a top issue for 2013. Oooh, that’s gotta hurt.


This morning, 31 December 2012, Think Progress provided 12 Progressive Resolutions for 2013. From better drug policy to immigration reform to enacting gun safety laws, many interesting (if not outright good) items in this list. Again, however, the telling thing is the absence of a critical set of issues.
Amid these 12, no (zero, nada, nilch) reference to climate change, the climate cliff, environment, clean energy, green jobs, energy efficiency, fossil fuel impacts on the political system, …
From Get Energy Smart NOW!  Stunning Think Progress Climate Silence
It is just one more indication that even the people pushing the issue don’t really much believe in it anymore, especially when we’ve had over a decade of no warming.

"**A Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNtech has been approved for use in the UK.**
But how does it compare with other vaccines under development?
The vast majority of people are still vulnerable to coronavirus. It's only the current restrictions that are preventing more people from dying.
A vaccine would teach our bodies to fight the infection by stopping us from catching coronavirus, or at least making Covid less deadly.
Having a vaccine, alongside better treatments, is ""the"" exit strategy.
The big breakthrough came when Pfizer/BioNTech published its first results in November.
The vaccine must be stored at a temperature of around -70C. It will be transported in a special box, packed in dry ice and installed with GPS trackers.
One 2 December, the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
The vaccine is a new type called an RNA, and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.
An RNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials for other diseases.
Trials of the Oxford vaccine show it stops 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.
The data also shows a strong immune response in older people.
This may be one of the easiest vaccines to distribute, because it does not need to be stored at very cold temperatures.
It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, that has been modified to not grow in humans.
Moderna uses the same approach as the Pfizer vaccine.
It is easier to store than Pfizer's, because it stays stable at -20C for up to six months.
Other trial results are also expected in the coming weeks.
However, a trial in Brazil for a drug developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac was suspended after a ""severe adverse incident"" - believed to be a volunteer's death.
Understanding which method produces the best results will be vital. Challenge trials, where people are deliberately infected, could help.
This depends on where Covid is spreading when the vaccine becomes available and in which groups each is most effective.
Older care home residents and staff top the UK's preliminary priority list, followed by health workers like hospital staff, and the over-80s.
Age is, by far, Covid's biggest risk factor.
It is thought that 60-70% of the global population must be immune to stop the virus spreading easily (herd immunity) - billions of people, even if the vaccine works perfectly.
People respond differently to immunisation.
History suggests any vaccine could be less successful in old people because an aged immune system does not respond as well, as happens with the annual flu jab. But data so far suggests this may not be a problem with some of Covid vaccines
Multiple doses may overcome any problems, as could giving it alongside a chemical (called an adjuvant) that boosts the immune system.

"**All retail outlets, hairdressers, museums and libraries have reopened in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday in an easing of Covid-19 restrictions.**
Ireland had been in lockdown for nearly six weeks, with rules similar to those in spring, except schools stayed open and construction continued.
It is now moving from the most severe level five restrictions to level three.
People will now also be able to attend religious services and play golf and tennis again.
Gatherings of 15 people can take place outdoors and gyms and swimming pools can reopen, as can hotels and guesthouses, with services limited to residents only.
However, people will not be allowed to leave their county except for essential reasons such as work, education or a medical appointment.
Households have been told not to mix with other households outside their bubble until Christmas week.
People are still advised to work from home where possible, and a face covering should be worn outdoors on busy streets, inside crowded workplaces and in places of worship.
From Friday, restaurants and pubs that have a kitchen and serve food will reopen.
However, pubs that do not serve food will remain closed except for delivery or take-away services.
From 18 December until 6 January, people will be allowed to travel outside of their county and up to three households will be allowed to meet indoors.
Non-essential shops in Northern Ireland are currently closed until 11 December.
Some shoppers queued outside Penney's in Dublin from 04:30 local time on Tuesday ahead of it reopening.
Leonard Watson, who is the owner of a menswear clothing business in Letterkenny, County Donegal, has said it has been a long six weeks but he is delighted to be reopening again.
""It is great to get the doors open again in the run up to Christmas,"" Mr Watson said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the business owner said, if given the option, he would much rather have been closed for the past five weeks if it meant he could be open for the next two weeks in December.
""It is the golden quarter, December is the month for us as independent retailers to make most of our money that covers us through the quiet months of January and February.
""We are still here, people need the high streets and we just hope people will continue to shop local.""
Mr Watson said he accepted that shops being open was conditional on coronavirus case numbers remaining low, but said he was hopeful local retailers would be able to get at least some Christmas trade.
Paddy Malone, from Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, said more than 300 shops in the Dundalk area had availed of financial assistance from the Irish government to help them go online during the lockdown.
""The local office did more in the past four months than they did over the past five years of getting businesses to switch online,"" he said.
Last month, it was reported that TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar had advised against cross-border travel to Northern Ireland at Christmas, but he later said that was not the case.
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Monday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said no-one in the Irish government was suggesting that people could not cross the border.
""What needs to happen north and south is for people to respect the restrictions that are in place,"" Mr Coveney said.
""We are seeing strong advice coming from the executive in the north and the government in the south that there should be no non-essential travel.
""So in other words if people need to see a relative, if people need to travel for work or for study or medical reasons or other essential reasons, of course they are allowed to travel.
""But we're trying to contain a killer disease here and so people need to be responsible in how they travel, how they move around so we can limit the spread of this disease."""

I have long held A Newspaper in such regard that I refuse to pay for its premium content. The few articles worth reading amongst endless pieces of mundane dross means the economics just don’t stack up. Content about Ardern is freely available as she doesn’t rate premium content in this newspaper, which is quite understandable. With President Trump, it also appears that she doesn’t rate premium time, which is also quite understandable. Compared to the treatment Scott Morrison has just received, our little lady rated a twenty-five-minute chit chat.



According to the NZ Herald Trump asked for the meeting because he was particularly interested in meeting Ardern. I wonder where their source for that startling fact came from? The Washington Post maybe, or the New York Times. Evidently Ardern emerged from the meeting with warm smiles and high praise for Trump. Hypocrite. Or maybe she thought she was in Canada talking to Justin Trudeau.



“President Trump views New Zealand very warmly, views the relationship very warmly and holds New Zealand in very high regard,” she told reporters. Yes, New Zealand, not you sweetie.



“He was interested in everything from tourism to what occurred in Christchurch. We even had a conversation about our gun buyback and the process we had gone through there.” Amazingly, Trump asked her about this unprompted. Are we to assume he normally has someone in attendance telling him what questions to ask? I bet she didn’t let on it’s been a flop.



A free trade deal was also discussed which, according to Jacinda, he’s very enthusiastic about. I wonder if it’s even slightly occurred to her that, being the dealer and trader he is, he might just want a teensy weensy bit in return. Or more likely quite a lot in areas she won’t be happy with like agreements in foreign affairs and defence. I watched a video of her talking to the media after the meeting and as usual, she was full of earnest enunciation and fervent facial contortions.



She delivered the keynote address on climate change in which she stressed that no countries, even non-believers, should cop-out. In her subsequent meeting with Trump then, she should have asked him why the US had not signed up for the Paris Accord. In her speech, she reeled off a whole list of things her Government had announced in the area of climate change and all in just two years. The audience would not have been nearly so impressed had they realised that in reality very little has been implemented.



She talked about March 15 but again she failed to ask Trump why he had not signed up for the Christchurch Call. Here we have a Prime Minister who avoids the hard questions. A Prime Minister who can’t deliver on the job she’s been given. Actions speak louder than words, but this will never happen while we are burdened with a flaky Prime Minister whose most obvious traits appear to be obfuscation domestically and an inability to give New Zealand the presence it deserves on the world stage.

"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."

Several researchers have noted that the 11-year solar cycle does not show up in temperature or precipitation data. Most recently, Dr. David Evans has introduced his “notch filter” answer to the problem. I think the answer is much simpler.
The solar influence on earth has several components. The Total Solar Insolation (TSI), varies over the 11-year solar cycle by about 0.1%. Solar UV varies by much more, up to 10%, but those wavelengths carry much less energy than TSI, and affect only the top of the atmosphere. The solar wind has little energy, but influences the cosmic ray influx. Other influx, such as Forbush Events, from Coronal Mass Ejections (CME’s), have short term effects. These last two, the solar wind and Forbush Events, do not follow the solar cycle very closely, so tend not to show up in a time power spectrum of climate, or even of cosmic rays.
So why does the TSI cycle not show up in climate data? Because annual and daily changes completely drown out the signal. First, the earth’s orbit around the sun is not circular, but elliptical. We are closer to the sun during the northern hemisphere winter by 3.4% compared to the distance in the summer. Because the TSI varies by the square of the distance change, the change in TSI is 6.8% from summer to winter. This alone would make the 11-year 1% signal difficult to detect, but there are other, much large variations.

The earth is tilted on it’s axis by 23.5°. This causes a further variation in insolation even at the equator. At the equator, the annual variation is almost 12%, with the maximum occurring at the spring and fall equinoxes, and the minimum occurring on June 21st.
Figure 1: is the insolation seen at three different latitudes. Source here
At 40° latitude, this variation grows to over 100% around the average, and at 80° degrees, to over 200% around the average, including days of 24 hours of sunlight and more days of 24 hours of darkness.
Besides the large annual variations in insolation, there is the diurnal variation, night and day, with another signal that is nearly a square wave. But this isn’t all. The variation in clouds causes albedo changes that are nearly random, and imposed  on the above insolation curves. I say nearly random, because of solar effects on clouds due to changes in cosmic rays. But these effects have only small correlation with solar cycles.
So, a 0.1% TSI change on an 11-year cycle, is buried in the much larger annual orbital and axial tilt cycle, the diurnal cycle, as well as random albedo changes due to clouds. An analogy would be hearing the 50/60 Hertz power supply hum on your HiFi, while playing Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture, complete with cannons, at full volume.

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to testify regarding corporate welfare, entrepreneurs, and economic growth. This testimony will address the problems caused by corporate welfare and discuss why spurring entrepreneurship is a better approach for generating economic growth.



Rising spending and huge deficits are pushing the nation toward an economic crisis. There is general agreement that policymakers need to find wasteful and damaging programs in the federal budget to terminate. One good place to find savings is spending on corporate welfare. 



Some people claim that business subsidies are needed to help fix market failures in the economy. But corporate welfare is just as likely to create failures by misallocating resources and inducing businesses to spend time on lobbying rather than on making better products. Corporate welfare transfers wealth from average families to favored businesses, and it creates corrupting ties between government officials, politicians, and business leaders.



Policymakers are rightly concerned about the competitiveness of American businesses in the global economy. But the way to address that concern is not through subsidies, but through broad‐​based reforms such as permanent reductions to capital gains and corporate income tax rates. 





**The Taxpayer Cost of Corporate Welfare**





A forthcoming Cato Institute study finds that federal business subsidies total almost $100 billion annually.1 That is a fairly broad measure of subsidies to small businesses, large corporations, and industry organizations. The subsidies are handed out from programs in many federal departments including Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.



However, there is no precise measure of “corporate welfare.” As part of the national income accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates that the federal government handed out $57 billion in business subsidies in 2010.2 A 1995 Congressional Budget Office Study put the total at $30 billion in spending subsidies for businesses at that time.3



Ending business subsidies would be one step toward reducing the federal deficit, but there would be other benefits as well. The following sections discuss the unfairness of corporate welfare, how it harms the economy and generates corruption, and why entrepreneur‐​led growth is a better alternative.





**Corporate Welfare Is Unfair**





The Constitution empowers the federal government to take steps to ensure an open national economy. The Commerce Clause gives the government the authority to “regulate Commerce… among the several States,” but the purpose was to remove barriers to trade, not to actively favor some businesses over other businesses and individuals.



People disagree on the meaning of “fairness,” but surely it includes supporting the bedrock American value of equality under the law. The government’s proper role should be that of a neutral referee in the economy facilitating the free exchange of goods and services. Yet corporate welfare advantages certain businesses at the expense of taxpayers, families, and other businesses, as some examples illustrate:



 ** _Farm Subsidies._** Farm subsidies redistribute wealth from taxpayers to often well‐​off farm businesses and landowners. “Farm income stabilization” payments have recently fluctuated between about $13 billion and $33 billion annually. 4 This is a welfare hand‐​out like food stamps, yet it goes to higher‐​income households. In 2010, the average income of farm households was $84,400, or 25 percent above the $67,530 average of all U.S. households.5 Moreover, the great bulk of farm subsidies go to the largest farms.6



 ** _Sugar Subsidies_**. The federal government also enriches certain businesses in an off‐​budget manner, as sugar subsidies illustrate. The government runs a Soviet‐​style system of price supports, quotas, and import barriers for sugar. The effect is to push up the domestic price of sugar to the benefit of U.S. sugar producers while imposing extra costs on consumers.7 Artificially high sugar prices also hurt American businesses that use sugar, and numerous U.S. food companies have moved production to Canada and Mexico where sugar prices are lower.8



 ** _Economic Development._** The government runs many so‐​called economic development programs that distribute corporate welfare. As one small example, the Community Development Block Grant program recently handed out $220,000 to a craft brewery in Michigan.9 Meanwhile the Value Added Marketing program hands out money to selected wineries across the country.10 These hand‐​outs are not fair to taxpayers or the breweries, wineries, and other businesses that don’t receive such special favors.



Polls show that the public understands the unfairness of corporate welfare, and most people want it cut. Most people are against the federal government providing loan guarantees to small businesses; only 29 percent think that the government should help large corporations finance their export sales; and a plurality (46 percent) think farm subsidies should be abolished.11 Polls have also found strong opposition to federal bailouts of financial institutions.12





**Corporate Welfare Distorts the Economy**





Some policymakers think that subsidies are needed to help U.S. businesses compete in the world economy. But the more we subsidize businesses, the more we weaken the market’s profit‐​and‐​loss signals, and the more we undermine America’s traditions of entrepreneurship and gutsy risk‐​taking by the private sector.



People argue that business subsidies are needed to fix market imperfections. But subsidies usually don’t work as intended, and they often distort markets rather than fixing them. Robert Novak once said that “the mind‐​set underlying corporate welfare is that of the central planner,” and yet we know that central planning does not work.13



Consider the energy industry, which Republicans and Democrats have been manipulating with subsidies for decades. An early subsidy effort was the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, which was an experimental nuclear fission power plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in the 1970s. This Republican‐​backed boondoggle cost taxpayers $1.7 billion and produced absolutely nothing in return.14



Then we had the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) approved by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, who called it a “keystone” of U.S. energy policy. The government sank $2 billion of taxpayer money into this scheme that funded coal gasification and other technologies before it was closed down as a failure. The SFC suffered from appalling mismanagement, huge cost overruns on its projects, political cronyism, and pork barrel politics in dishing out funding.15



Both parties have backed dubious “clean coal” projects for decades. The GAO found that many of these projects have “experienced delays, cost overruns, bankruptcies, and performance problems.“16 In a review of federal fossil fuel research, the Congressional Budget Office concluded: “Federal programs have had a long history of funding fossil‐​fuel technologies that, although interesting technically, had little chance of commercial implementation. As a result, much of the federal spending has not been productive.“17



With the poor record of energy subsidies over the decades, it is no surprise that the Obama administration is having trouble with its green energy activities. The administration’s failures keep piling up—Solyndra, Raser Technologies, Ecotality, Nevada Geothermal, Beacon Power, First Solar, Abound Solar, and Beacon Power.18 These subsidy recipients have either gone bankrupt or appear to be headed in that direction.



Why don’t business subsidies work very well? One reason is that political pressures undermine sound economic choices. The _Washington Post_ found that “Obama’s green‐​technology program was infused with politics at every level.“19 The decision to approve the Solyndra loan, for example, appears to have been rushed along by high‐​level politics.



Perhaps more importantly, subsidies change the behavior of businesses. An economist recently quipped to me: “I don’t know whether the government is better at picking winners rather than losers, but I do know that losers are good at picking governments.” When the government starts handing out money, businesses with weak ideas get in line because the businesses with the good ideas can get private funding. Enron, for example, was able to grab huge federal support for its disastrous foreign investment schemes.



At recent House hearings on green energy subsidies, most witnesses lined up in favor of Department of Energy loan programs, except for one witness who heads a solar power firm that does not receive federal subsidies.20 James Nelson of Solar3D said that subsidizing green energy commercialization “is a wasteful mistake because it doesn’t work.“21 Here are some of the problems he pointed to:





The House hearing included testimony from green energy firms that had received subsidies. Their comments revealed how subsidies were eroding their focus on the bottom line. The firms stressed how many jobs they were creating and how their supplier chains covered many states—and thus many congressional districts. One solar firm bragged that it is “creating and maintaining jobs locally and across the nation,” while it is “procur(ing) from a supply chain that stretches across 17 states.“22 Another solar firm bragged that it “spent more than $1 billion with U.S. suppliers in 35 states.“23



Subsidy supporters at the hearing stressed the “nonfinancial objectives” of green subsidies, such as jobs.24 But as Nelson noted, “businesses are not made more successful by more jobs.“25 If businesses want to succeed in tough global competition, they need to minimize their labor and supplier costs, and subsidies erode that lean focus. Nelson concluded that success in the marketplace “requires brains, discipline, and grit. It is rarely aided, and often impeded by government involvement.“26



Another problem with business subsidies is that they can encourage investing in very dubious projects. That is the story of Enron’s international investments, which played an important role in the implosion of the firm. By one estimate, Enron received $2.4 billion in federal aid through the Export‐​Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Company between 1992 and 2000.27 Another study puts total federal government subsidies to Enron for its foreign schemes at $3.7 billion, plus Enron received subsidies from international agencies such as the World Bank.28 All these subsidies made possible Enron’s excessively risky foreign investments, which came crashing down at the same time that the firm’s accounting frauds were being revealed.29



Suppose that the government was capable of channeling subsidies only to well‐​managed companies with sensible ideas. Then the subsidies wouldn’t be needed because they would simply crowd out private investment. That seems to be the case with much of the $7 billion in subsidies for rural broadband in the 2009 stimulus bill, as one detailed study in 2011 found.30



Or consider the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides subsidies to companies to develop green cars. A former executive with Tesla Motors, which received subsidies, concluded that “private fundraising is complicated by investor expectations of government support.“31 Subsidies distort the venture capital market, having “a stifling effect on innovation, as private capital chases fewer deals and companies that do not have government backing have a harder time attracting private capital.“32



A final problem with corporate welfare is that it can create broader distortions in the economy. For more than a century, the federal Bureau of Reclamation has subsidized irrigation in the 17 western states. About four‐​fifths of the water supplied by the bureau goes to farm businesses, and this water is greatly underpriced.33 Because farmers are receiving water at a fraction of the market price, they are over consuming it, which threatens to create water shortages in many areas in the West. Subsidized irrigation also causes environmental damage. 





**Corporate Welfare Generates Corruption**





The creation of corporate welfare programs has spawned an expanding web of lobby groups that demand ever more favors from policymakers. The more that the government intervenes in the economy, the more lobbying activity is generated, and the more new subsidy programs get created. It’s a vicious cycle.



Corporate welfare doesn’t just create direct economic harm, it also erodes support for America’s free enterprise system. Businesses that become hooked on subsidies become tools of the state. They lose their independence, and they may focus more on gaining special benefits from Washington than on making good products. The more special breaks that businesses receive, the less willing they are to speak out against the expansion of big government. 



While some people think that corporations lobby to slash government, they mainly do the opposite. Businesses often lobby in favor of federal intervention if it will benefit them and hurt their competitors. The major airlines, for example, were against airline deregulation in the 1970s because existing rules protected them from competition.34



Business subsidy programs attract corruption like garbage dumps attracts rats, and that has always been the case in Washington. For example, federal subsidies for the first transcontinental railroad, the Union Pacific, led to the Credit Mobilier scandal of the 1870s, which involved payoffs to dozens of members of Congress. In recent decades, scandals stemming from corporate welfare have been a bipartisan problem, as these examples illustrate:



 ** _HUD Subsidies under Reagan._** President Ronald Reagan’s Department of Housing and Urban Development overflowed with corruption in the 1980s under Secretary Sam Pierce.35 Pierce routinely dished out grants, loans, and other sorts of subsidies to friends and business associates. And HUD created programs that involved large subsidies to mortgage lenders, developers, and other businesses, with Republican Party contributors as frequent beneficiaries.



 ** _Commerce Subsidies under Clinton._** President Bill Clinton’s Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, used federal business subsidies as a fund‐​raising tool for the Democratic Party in the 1990s. Corporate executives who played the game were given access to export promotion trips and loans from OPIC.36 In subsequent investigations, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth found that Commerce officials concealed and destroyed documents relating to the scandal, and he compared the officials to “con artists” and “scofflaws.37



 ** _Enron Subsidies under Clinton and Bush._** Enron Corporation is a poster child for the harm of business subsidies, particularly with regard to its disastrous foreign investments. Enron lobbied government officials to expand export subsidy programs, and it received billions of dollars in aid for its foreign projects from the Ex‐​Im Bank, OPIC, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the Commerce Department, and the U.S.-backed World Bank. As noted, Enron received about $3.7 billion in financing through federal government agencies.38 These subsidies induced Enron to make exceptionally risky foreign investments, and the resulting losses were an important factor in the company’s implosion.39



During the Clinton and early Bush administrations, high‐​level officials went to great lengths to aid Enron on an Indian power plant deal.40 The _Washington Post_ noted, “President Bush’s National Security Council led a ‘working group’ with officials from various Cabinet agencies to resolve Enron’s troubles over a power plant venture.“41 We saw similar high‐​level involvement in the failed Solyndra investment by the Obama administration. Top government officials should be spending their time on policies in the general interest of all Americans, not on helping individual companies earn higher profits.



 ** _Green Subsidies under Obama._** The _Washington Post_ found, “Obama’s green‐​technology program was infused with politics at every level.“42 The $535 million loan guarantee for Solyndra, is a prime example. The DOE approved the loan after receiving pressure from White House officials to move ahead so that the vice president could announce it at a groundbreaking for the company’s factory.43 President Obama visited Solyndra and called the firm an “engine of economic growth,” but later it collapsed.44



President Obama’s green energy programs illustrate how corporate welfare creates corrupting relationships between businesses and politicians. The _Washington Post_ found that “$3.9 billion in federal [energy] grants and financing flowed to 21 companies backed by firms with connections to five Obama administration staffers and advisers.“45 It also noted that the “main players in the Solyndra saga were interconnected in many ways, as investors enjoyed access to the White House and the Energy Department.“46 According to the _New York Times_ , Solyndra “spent nearly $1.8 million on Washington lobbyists, employing six firms with ties to members of Congress and officials of the Obama White House.“47



American businesses, of course, have a right to lobby the federal government. But given that reality, Congress throws fuel onto the corruption fire by creating business subsidy programs. When subsidy money flows out the door from Washington to businesses at the same time that money flows back from businesses to Washington for lobbying, it’s no surprise that we get influence‐​peddling. Corporate welfare undermines honest and transparent governance, and Americans are sick and tired of the inevitable scandals. 





**Long‐​Term Growth Depends on Entrepreneurs**





Most of America’s technological and industrial advances have come from innovative private businesses in competitive markets. Indeed, it is probably true that most of our long‐​term economic growth has come not from existing large corporations or governments, but from entrepreneurs creating new businesses and pioneering new industries. Such entrepreneurs have often had to overcome barriers put in place by dominant businesses and governments. 



Economic historians Nathan Rosenberg and L.E. Birdzell found that “new enterprises, specializing in new technologies, were instrumental in the introduction of electricity, the internal‐​combustion engine, automobiles, aircraft, electronics, aluminum, petroleum, plastic materials, and many other advances.“48 We can update that list to include cell phones, personal computers, biotechnology, and all kinds of Internet businesses. 



If policymakers want to get U.S. economic growth back on track, they should put entrepreneurs front‐​and‐​center in their thinking about policy. Here are some of the ways that entrepreneurs generate growth:



 ** _Entrepreneurs are Radical Innovators_.** Their advances are usually unexpected and disruptive to existing businesses.49 Personal computers were pioneered in the 1970s by new companies such as Apple. The opportunity was missed both by leading computer firms and by government planning agencies such as Japan’s MITI.50 Big corporations were focused on mini and mainframe computers, while the U.S. government was subsidizing supercomputers. Governments and big companies often overlook niche products that later become revolutionary. In the 1970s, microcomputers were an obscure hobbyist activity, and software for microcomputers—which Bill Gates helped pioneer—was a niche within a niche. The small‐​scale innovations of entrepreneurs in niches often create huge, unforeseen changes. 



**_Entrepreneurs Generate Competition_.** Another crucial role of entrepreneurs is that they challenge dominant firms and governments. One great story is the rise of MCI Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s. MCI helped destroy the AT&T monopoly, which paved the way for the modern telecommunications revolution. Another innovator was Fred Smith of Federal Express. Today we take overnight letter delivery for granted, but it was Smith who battled federal regulatory roadblocks in the 1970s and provided new competition for the U.S. Postal Service by proving that there was an untapped demand for rapid delivery.



 ** _Entrepreneurs Turn Inventions into Innovations_.** America’s long‐​run growth is often portrayed as a steady process of accumulating new _inventions_. Many people seem to think that the government can simply pump money into research and the economy will grow. But that “science push” theory of growth is incorrect. Economies grow because of _innovations_ , which are inventions that are packaged and tested in the marketplace by entrepreneurs. 



The modern economy is steeped in uncertainty. No one can predict the future, not even the best scientists, engineers, and economists in big companies and the government. Many experts have made hugely off‐​base prognostications about the economy.51 Two decades ago, many pundits and policymakers were convinced that Japan was taking over the global economy. Professor and pundit Robert Reich thought that “chronic entrepreneurialism” was undermining the U.S. economy. And past predictions about the computer industry have been laughable, such as this comment in 1977 by the founder of Digital Equipment Corporation: “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.”   
  
Luckily, expert predictions don’t drive the economy. Rather, successful market economies work by having swarms of entrepreneurs freely testing new ideas. Entrepreneurs are the economy’s guinea pigs. They have the guts to act in the face of uncertainty, and they learn from their mistakes and keep trying until they find ideas that work and generate profits. 



By contrast, government plans to stimulate the economy are often based on ideologies and rigid ideas. Some policymakers believe that particular energy technologies are THE solution to America’s problems, and they support ongoing subsidies year after year regardless of marketplace realities. By contrast, in competitive and unsubsidized markets, mistakes are usually quickly exposed and businesses cut their losses short and change direction.



It appears that the unexpected fall in solar panel prices helped to sink Solyndra. Perhaps businesses that are tethered to governments are slower to make the changes needed to survive. The government tends to work at a turtle’s pace, which doesn’t sync well with the fast‐​paced modern economy. We saw a comparison of the government turtle with the private‐​sector gazelle during the first sequencing of the human genome in the late 1990s. The government’s lavishly funded Human Genome Project was a lengthy multi‐​year research project, but it was upstaged when entrepreneur Craig Venter launched Celera Genomics to complete the job at a fraction of the time and cost.



What are the policy lessons from America’s great entrepreneurial history? One lesson is that because markets have high levels of uncertainty, government agencies and dominant companies cannot be relied upon to secure our economic future. Instead, we should remove hurdles to entrepreneurship every way we can—by tax reforms, by repealing barriers to entry into industries, and by reducing financial industry barriers to private risk financing.



While it has become fashionable to criticize Wall Street, the financial industry has been crucial to funding waves of innovation in the U.S. economy. Risk capital was integral to the railroad and telegraph booms of the 1800s, and the radio, electricity, and automobile booms of the early 20th century. J.P. Morgan Chase has garnered negative headlines in recent weeks, but J.P. Morgan was the company that provided seed capital for Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Illuminating Company, which became General Electric.52



In recent decades, high‐​yield bonds, venture capital, and angel investment have played key roles in growing new industries. Today, U.S. venture capital and angel investors pump more than $50 billion annually into young companies.53 Tax policy influences investment flows, and funding for high‐​growth ventures is affected by the tax treatment of capital gains in particular. One step for policymakers would be to create investment certainty by permanently extending the 15 percent federal capital gains tax rate. Also, the corporate tax rate should be cut to spur greater capital investment—new capital equipment usually embodies technological advances.



Policymakers should put aside the idea that some sort of big intervention can permanently “win the race” for some particular goal, such as energy independence, solar power dominance, or beating China. In the recent House testimony, an energy consultant said, “clean energy has been targeted by our major international competitors (including China and Germany) as a critical, and perhaps the critical, future growth and export industry… whether the U.S. wins or loses in this race matters because the outcome will have a large impact on future U.S. employment and economic strength.“54 At the same hearing, a solar company executive said that America could “win in the long run” with a particular solar technology.55



However, those sorts of prognostications are refuted by U.S. economic history. There is never any final “win” in the marketplace. Look at how leadership in cell phones and smart phones has shifted from firm to firm and country to country, from Nokia, to RIM Blackberry, to Apple and others. Technologies and markets are always changing, so the only way for America to permanently “win” in the struggle for economic growth is to have the best climate for investing, innovating, and building entrepreneurial companies.



We’ve mainly focused on subsidies to new industries such as green energy. But withdrawing corporate welfare from older, established industries could spur innovation as well. Consider farm subsidies. New Zealand ended virtually all its farm subsidies in 1984, which was a bold stroke because that country is much more dependent on farming than is the United States. The changes were initially resisted, but New Zealand farm productivity, profitability, and output have soared since the reforms.56 Faced with new financial realities, New Zealand’s farmers innovated—they cut costs, diversified their land use, sought nonfarm income, and developed new markets. 



Thus rather than looking for new ways to subsidize businesses, policymakers should be looking for places to withdraw subsidies and deregulate in order to spur innovation. For example, just as the break‐​up of the AT&T monopoly in the 1980s helped to generate growth in the telecommunications industry, ending the U.S. Postal Service monopoly today would spur innovation in that industry. Europe is moving in that direction, with Germany and the Netherlands already privatizing their postal systems.57



The transportation sector is another area where innovation could be spurred by the reduction of federal subsidies. For example, Amtrak is doomed to inefficiency as a government‐​run business pumped full of subsidies and shackled with regulations. It should be privatized.58 Other countries are ahead of the United States in privatizing transportation infrastructure, or at least in bringing private investment into infrastructure.59



The United States subsidizes its air traffic control system, but it doesn’t need to. Canada privatized its air traffic control system in 1996, and it operates as a self‐​funded nonprofit corporation. It has been a big success.60 Another ripe area to cut subsidies and bring the private sector in is space flight. The recent success of the SpaceX flight and the 2004 success of SpaceShipOne indicate that the private sector is entirely capable of bold and risky technological ventures. 



To sum up, the way to spur economic growth is not through business subsidies, but through breaking down barriers to entrepreneurs. Let’s give entrepreneurs a crack at postal services, air traffic control, passenger trains, and other monopoly industries. Let’s pursue tax and regulatory reforms to maximize the flow of financing to new and growing businesses. And let’s stop demonizing entrepreneurs who succeed and the financial system that allows them to grow. If we want to exorcize some demons, we should end the corporate welfare system that is corrupting our government and the American economy.



Thank you for holding these important hearings.

Guest post by Dr. Tim Ball
It is important for the person who leaked the emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in November 2009 and 2010 to reveal themselves and release the remaining 200,000 emails. The public are increasingly aware of the inaccurate science and failed projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Those promoting the false science are pushing even harder as they lose ground, but a final disclosure would expose the full extent of the deceptions. This would force leaders to abandon policies already causing serious social and economic harm and develop policies based on proper science.
The IPCC failures are no surprise and inevitable because of the political rather than scientific agenda exposed in the first 6000 emails. Evidence from leaked information from AR5, the next IPCC Report, indicate they have not changed. Equally important, the people involved at the CRU and the IPCC think they’ve escaped responsibility with the release of the Norfolk Police Report. It was the engineered response they wanted and in its own way is deceptive.
On July 18, 2012 the Norfolk Police closed their investigation because of the “Realistic prospect of identifying the offender or offenders and launching criminal proceedings within the time constraints imposed by law”. They also concluded the attack was carried out “remotely via the Internet”, which is not surprising and does not eliminate a whistleblower. 
They further deflected the whistleblower claim saying there is “no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the University of East Anglia was involved in the crime”. It is very unlikely that a whistleblower would work from within the University and run the risk of easy exposure. Most people working at CRU would likely have external access, so they could continue work at home, or when traveling to the numerous worldwide IPCC climate conferences.
Canadian network engineer Lance Levsen after detailed analysis showed, convincingly, the source was someone within the university. He concluded, “For the hacker to have collected all of this information s/he would have required extraordinary capabilities…to crack an Administrative file server to get to the emails and crack numerous workstations, desktops, and servers to get the documents.” Access to the files is a major hurdle, but once inside there is a bigger challenge. Which files do you select? Whoever released the files knew which ones were significant. This required considerable knowledge of climate science as well as the politics and machinations of the people involved.
A comment posted on Anthony Watt’s web site encapsulates the problem. “It would take a hacker massive amounts of work to parse through decades of emails and files.” The commenter suggested a different scenario that involved hacking a single file. Such a file would exist because of “an ongoing process of internally collating this information for an FOI response is entirely consistent with what we find in the file.” The problem with this argument is that the emails appeared in November 2009, at which time both the CRU and the University of East Anglia were rejecting all FOI requests. In January 2005 Phil Jones “states that he will be using IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) to shelter the data from Freedom of Information requests.” In an email on August 20th 2008, Prof. Jones says “The FOI line we’re all using is this. IPCC is exempt from any countries FOI – the skeptics have been told this. Even though we (MOHC, CRU/UEA) possibly hold relevant info the IPCC is not part our remit (mission statement, aims etc) therefore we don’t have an obligation to pass it on.” It is unlikely anyone did much work preparing files to answer FOI requests. Even if they did, files for an FOI request are different from those required to expose corruption and still required selection.
Levsen reached a solid and logical conclusion “the simplest explanation or strategy tends to be the best one”. “The simplest explanation in this case is that someone at UEA found it and released it to the wild and the release of FOIA2009.zip wasn’t because of some hacker, but because of a leak from UEA by a person with scruples.”
How did the CRU people and others exposed in the emails essentially avoid any accountability? Part was likely due to groupthink defined by Irving Janis. “Groups affected by groupthink ignore alternatives and tend to take irrational actions that dehumanize other groups.  A group is especially vulnerable to groupthink when its members are similar in background, when the group is insulated from outside opinions, and when there are no clear rules for decision-making.” In his Report for a combined Congressional investigative committees on the “hockey stick” Professor Wegman identifies the insulation. “It is important to note the isolation of the paleoclimate community.” Phil Jones said the banter was typical, which is a disturbing and instructive comment in itself.
Every time a serious problem occurred for IPCC official climate science or those promoting it, they hired professional spin doctors. Why do ‘official’ climate scientists need spin doctors? Answer, because they practice politics not science. Climategate, like it’s namesake Watergate, became exposed by the cover up, in this case disgraceful, atypical behavior disclosed in the emails.
After the November 2009 leak the University of East Anglia hired Neil Wallis of Outside Organization to handle the fall out. University spokesperson Trevor Davies said it was a “reputation management” problem, which he claimed they don’t handle well. Apparently they didn’t consider telling the truth. The leaked emails triggered a shock wave that required a top political spin-doctor. Wallis, a former editor at the News of The World, was later arrested in connection with the phone hacking scandals that led to the resignation of London Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, as well as Andy Coulson, Prime Minister Cameron’s press secretary.
CRU Director Phil Jones immediately called in the police, which established the event potentially as a criminal act. This raises the question of what he had to hide. If there was nothing in the files of consequence, then loss of the information had no currency. The British House of Commons’ Science and Technology Committee perpetuated the criminal idea by referring to emails as “stolen” in their whitewash investigation of Jones’ behavior. They didn’t even take testimony from scientists qualified to address the problems with the science, yet still concluded the science was solid.
Terminology used is apparently important and possibly done on advice. Involving the police froze further disclosure of information and created the idea it was a crime. Calling it a theft or a hacking reinforced this with an implication for future legal action. Reportedly, hacked material or stolen information is not admissible in court, unlike information disclosed by a whistleblower.
A special police unit achieved the desired result of letting the investigation drag out past the statute of limitations and then concluded there was no evidence of an inside leak. It is critical to remember the implications went beyond the CRU because its members dominated and controlled the principle portions of the IPCC Reports. The person who released the information apparently knew this because it was timed to derail the Conference of The Parties (COP) 15 scheduled for Copenhagen in December 2009.
The first 1000 emails included some selected to expose behavior unacceptable even without knowledge of climatology. Others show how the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) science was conjured. Exposure of CRU members was necessary because they dominated and controlled the vital portions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports. The leaks achieved their objective of derailing the political program of COP 15. The COP was in a bind because their starting point and assumption is the validity of IPCC science.
COP 15 scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen Denmark offered the ideal opportunity for exposing the corrupted science. “The main contentious issues in Copenhagen where whether or not to abandon the Kyoto Protocol, which binds almost 40 industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the dispute, developing nations wanted to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and work out a separate new deal. But most developed nations wanted to merge Kyoto into a single new accord obliging all nations to fight global warming.” It was a critical meeting because failure probably meant the end of Kyoto and any attempt at replacement or modification. The leak was effective because Kyoto expired on December 31, 2012, despite further attempts at resuscitation at COP 16 in Durban.
Who, on the inside, had “scruples” about what was going on. Some of the clues lie in how the person attempted to release the information without personal exposure. The ‘leaker’ was determined to have the material out before the Copenhagen Conference. He sent it out through a Russian IP that reportedly prevented a trace.
George Monbiot of the Guardian actively sold the scientific material produced by the IPCC, which makes his reaction more telling. Reportedly shocked by the emails he said “why was CRU’s response to this issue such a total car crash.” George, the answer is because they were deceiving you, the politicians and the public. Meanwhile, you attacked scientists who knew what was going on and dared to speak out. I can attest that you were told.
The spin-doctors pursued the coverup by putting in place two investigation panels that separated out the science and limited their investigation with terms of reference. I know how this is done because I have refused to participate in such political deceptions. The trick is to pretend to remove the politics by establishing arms-length from governemnt committees to investigate and report. These committees are identified by their Chairs, Muir Russell and Lord Oxburgh. Conflicts and questions immediately arose about the integrity and independence of the committees, which the parties tried to address. The emails and their content were already arousing suspicions.
The University of East Anglia (UEA) and Muir Russell both said the Lord Oxburgh inquiry would examine the science. At a press conference on February 11, 2010 Muir Russell said, “Our job is to investigate scientific rigor, the honesty, the openness and the due process of CRU’s approach as well as the other things in the remit and compliance with rules. It’s not our job to audit CRU’s scientific conclusions. That would require a different set of skills and resources.” The Lord Oxburgh investigation was doomed from the start. “A member of the House of Lords appointed to investigate the veracity of climate science has close links to businesses that stand to make billions of pounds from low-carbon technology.”
The cover-up was easily detectable. Clive Crook, Senior editor of The Atlantic wrote a searing indictment of the whitewash. “I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific consensus. But no, the reports make things worse. At best they are mealy-mouthed apologies; at worst they are patently incompetent and even wilfully wrong. The climate-science establishment, of which these inquiries have chosen to make themselves a part, seems entirely incapable of understanding, let alone repairing, the harm it has done to its own cause.”
Worse, they concluded that what went on was within normal patterns of interchanges and activities between a group of scientists. It’s inconceivable that any reasonable person reading the emails, especially the second 5000, can reach such a conclusion. Meanwhile, we still don’t know who leaked the material. 
It is helpful to study the details and consider the people involved. The final police report concluded it was not a whistleblower, but that challenges the evidence. However, it was a valuable conclusion for the coverup. Phil Jones, former Director of the CRU, knew the potential damage and legal implications of the file contents. Ironically, in order to claim the files stolen and a crime committed Jones admitted the files belonged to CRU. What would have happened if he denied they were files from the CRU?
Internal Candidate
There are several internal candidates, but I think the strongest is Keith Briffa. The person was apparently disaffected by the conflicts within the CRU, but also the implications of false data as the basis for world policy. Emails illustrate Briffa’s conflicts within the group. On October 5th 2009 Wigley wrote to Jones “It is distressing to read that American Stinker item. But Keith does seem to have got himself into a mess. As I pointed out in emails, Yamal is insignificant…….I presume they went thru papers to see if Yamal was cited, a pretty foolproof method if you ask me. Perhaps these things can be explained clearly and concisely — but I am not sure Keith is able to do this as he is too close to the issue and probably quite pissed of (sic). I think Keith needs to be very, very careful in how he handles this. I’d be willing to check over anything he puts together.” It appears Wigley is aware of the danger of Briffa doing something rash, like releasing documents. Jones forwarded the email to Briffa, which would likely only irritate him more.
Briffa’s dislike of Mann had a long history. On 22 September 1999, almost ten years before the leaks, Briffa confronted Mann in a long email that included the comment, “I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years ago.” Treasonous words for Mann’s hockey stick paper that claimed no medieval warm period existed. Mann appeared to back off. He wrote, “Walked into this hornet’s nest this morning! Keith and Phil have both raised some very good points.” In reality, he puts Briffa down again. “SO(sic) I think we’re in the position to say/resolve somewhat more than, frankly, than Keith does, about the temperature history of the past millennium. And the issues I’ve spelled out all have to be dealt with in the chapter.” One cynical comment from Mann says, “And I certainly don’t want to abuse my lead authorship by advocating my own work.” It’s an interesting comment in light of his role in the IPCC 2001 Science Report and Summary for Policy Makers. It is also a concern the Wegman Report identified in Recommendation 1; “Especially when massive amounts of public monies and human lives are at stake, academic work should have a more intense level of scrutiny and review. It is especially the case that authors of policy-related documents like the IPCC report, Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, should not be the same people as those that constructed the academic papers.”
On 17th June 2002 Briffa wrote to Dr Edward Cook about a letter involving Esper and Michael Mann, “I have just read this letter – and I think it is crap. I am sick to death of Mann stating his reconstruction represents the tropical area just because it contains a few (poorly temperature representative) tropical series. He is just as capable of regressing these data against any other “target” series, such as the increasing trend of self-opinionated verbage (sic) he has produced over the last few years, and … (better say no more)”Cook responds; “We both know the probable flaws in Mike’s recon (reconstruction), particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff…. It is puzzling to me that a guy as bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit more objectively.”
Wigley didn’t help. Here is the first part of a belittling email from Wigley to Briffa on 10 January 2006. Thanx for this. Interesting. However, I do not think your response is very good. Further, there are grammatical and text errors, and (shocking!!) you have spelled McKitrick wrong. This is a sure way to piss them off. It appears to typify Wigley’s patronizing way of talking to wayward CRU members, especially those who undermined the elimination of the Medieval Warm Period.
Conflict continued as Briffa expressed his concern. Mann made some overtures, but on April 29th 2007 Briffa responded, “I found myself questioning the whole process and being often frustrated at the formulaic way things had to be done – often wasting time and going down dead ends. I really thank you for taking the time to say these kind words. I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC, which were not always the same. I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties.” What damning commentary about what the CRU and the IPCC were doing?
Briffa may have worked with the Information Officer at the University who was under pressure for Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. In March 2009, we learned Briffa was ill and he and his wife were cancelling meetings with people at the CRU. Did this give him time to think about what was happening? Maybe, but his treatment by Mann and the sinking ship was likely an impetus. Whatever the answer, any reading of the emails show they were anything but normal correspondence between colleagues. It became more than a scientific disagreement.
Because of Jones’ actions the Norfolk police, a regional force, involved the national government through the National Domestic Extremism Unit, which was surely another measure of the seriousness of what was involved in the files. This led to the University of East Anglia turning over all the files related to skeptics and their requests through Freedom of Information (FOI). Apparently, the police and subsequent investigations accepted the CRU claims that requests for information were politically driven and caused hardship that diverted them from their work. When police interrogated skeptics, they asked about political affiliations. Why?
The idea of politics as the only motive developed because the CRU and the IPCC made global warming a purely political issue. Besides, why has motive got anything to do with the requests for scientific data and methods, especially when funded by taxes and used to create potentially devastating policies?

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
People sometimes ask why I don’t publish in the so-called scientific journals. Here’s a little story about that. Back in 2004, Michael Mann wrote a mathematically naive piece about how to smooth the ends of time series. It was called “On smoothing potentially non-stationary climate time series“, and it was published in Geophysical Research Letters in April of 2004. When I read it, I couldn’t believe how bad it was. Here is his figure illustrating the problem:

Figure 1a. [ORIGINAL CAPTION] Figure 1. Annual mean NH series. (blue) shown along with (a) 40 year smooths of series based on alternative boundary constraints (1) – (3). Associated MSE scores favor use of the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint. 
Note the different colored lines showing different estimates of what the final averaged value will be, based on different methods of calculating the ends of the averages. The problem is how to pick the best method.
I was pretty naive back then. I was living in Fiji for one thing, and hadn’t had much contact with scientific journals and their curious ways. So I innocently thought I should write a piece pointing out Mann’s errors, and suggesting a better method. I append the piece I wrote back nearly a decade ago. It was called “A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series.”
My main insight in my paper was that I could actually test the different averaging methods against the dataset by truncating the data at various points. By doing that you can calculate what you would have predicted using a certain method, and compare it to what the true average actually turned out to be.
And that means that you can calculate the error for any given method experimentally. You don’t have to guess at which one is best. You can measure which one is best. That was the insight that I thought made my work worth publishing.
Now, here comes the story.
I wrote this, and I submitted it to Geophysical Research Letters at the end of 2005. After the usual long delays, they said I was being too hard on poor Michael Mann, so they wouldn’t even consider it … and perhaps they were right, although it seemed pretty vanilla to me. In any case, I could see which way the wind was blowing. I was pointing out the feet of clay, not allowed.
I commented about my lack of success on the web. I described my findings over at Climate Audit, saying:
Posted Oct 24, 2006 at 2:09 PM
…
[Mann] recommends using the “minimum roughness” constraint … apparently without noticing that it pins the endpoints.
I wrote a reply to GRL pointing this out, and advocating another method than one of those three, but they declined to publish it. I’m resubmitting it.
w.
So, I pulled out everything but the direct citations to Mann’s paper and resubmitted it basically in the form appended below. But in the event, I got no joy on my second pass at publishing it either. They said no thanks, not interested, so I gave up. I posted it on my server at the time (long dead), put a link up on Climate Audit, and let it go. I was just a guy living in Fiji and working a day job, what did I know?
Then a year later, in 2007 Steve McIntyre posted a piece called “Mannomatic Smoothing and Pinned End-points“. In that post, he also discussed the end point problem.
And now, with all of that as prologue, here’s the best part.
In 2008, after I’d foolishly sent my manuscript entitled “A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series” to people who turned out to be friends of Michael Mann, Dr. Mann published a brand new paper in GRL. And here’s the title of his study …
“Smoothing of climate time series revisited”
I cracked up when I saw the title. Yeah, he better revisit it, I thought at the time, because the result of the first visit was swiss cheese.
And what was Michael Mann’s main insight in his new 2008 paper? What method did he propose?
“In such cases, the true smoothed behavior of the time series at the termination date is known, because that date is far enough into the interior of the full series that its smooth at that point is largely insensitive to the constraint on the upper boundary. The relative skill of the different methods can then be measured by the misfit between the estimated and true smooths of the truncated series.”
In other words, his insight is that if you truncate the data, you can calculate the error for each method experimentally … curious how that happens to be exactly the insight I wasted my time trying to publish.
Ooooh, dear friends, I’d laughed at his title, but when I first read that analysis of “his” back in 2008, I must admit that I waxed nuclear and unleashed the awesome power that comes from splitting the infinitive. The house smelled for days from the sulfur fumes emitted by my unabashed expletives … not a pretty picture at all, I’m ashamed to say.
But before long, sanity prevailed, and I came to realize that I’d have been a fool to expect anything else. I had revealed a huge, gaping hole in Mann’s math to people who were obviously his friends … and while for me it was an interesting scientific exercise, for him it represented much, much more. He could not afford to leave the hole unplugged or have me plug it.
And since I had kindly told him how to plug the hole, he’d have been crazy to try something else. Why? Because my method worked … hard to argue with success.
The outcome also proved to me once again that I could accomplish most anything if I didn’t care who got the credit. 
Because in this case, the sting in the tale is that at the end of the day, my insights on how to deal with the problem did get published in GRL. Not only that, they got published by the guy who would have most opposed their publication under my name. I gotta say, whoever is directing this crazy goat-roping contest we call life has the most outré, wildest sense of humor imaginable …
Anyhow, that’s why I’ve never pushed too hard to try to publish my work in what used to be scientific journals, but now are perhaps better described as the popular science magazines. Last time I tried, I got bit … so now, I mostly just skip getting gnawed on by the middleman and put my ideas up on the web directly.
And if someone wants to borrow or steal or plagiarise my scientific ideas and words and images, I say more power to them, take all you want. I cast my scientific ideas on the electronic winds in the hope that they will take root, and I can only wish that, just like Michael Mann did, people will adopt my ideas as their own. There’s much more chance they’ll survive that way.
Sure, I’d prefer to get credit—I’m as human as anyone, or at least I keep telling myself that. So an acknowledgement is always appreciated.
But if you just want to just take some idea of mine and run, sell it under another brand name, I say go for it, take all you want, because I’ve learned my lesson. The very best way to keep people from stealing my ideas is to give them away … and that’s the end of my story.
As always, my best wishes for each of you … and at this moment my best wish is that you follow your dream, you know the one I mean, the dream you keep putting off again and again. I wish you follow that dream because the night is coming and no one knows what time it really is …

A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series

[1] An experimental method is presented to determine the optimal choice among several alternative smoothing methods and boundary constraints based on their behavior at the end of the data series. This method is applied to the smoothing of the instrumental Northern Hemisphere (NH) annual mean, yielding the best choice of these methods and constraints.
1. Introduction
[2] Michael Mann has given us an analysis of various ways of smoothing the data at the beginning and the end of a time series of data (Mann 2004, Geophysical Research Letters, hereinafter M2004).
These involve minimizing different boundary conditions at those boundaries, and are called the “minimum norm”, “minimum slope”, and “minimum roughness” methods. These methods minimize, in order, the zeroth, first, and second derivatives of the smoothed average. M2004 describes the methods as follows:
“To approximate the ‘minimum norm’ constraint, one pads the series with the long-term mean beyond the boundaries (up to at least one filter width) prior to smoothing.
To approximate the ‘minimum slope’ constraint, one pads the series with the values within one filter width of the boundary reflected about the time boundary. This leads the smooth towards zero slope as it approaches the boundary.
Finally, to approximate the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint, one pads the series with the values within one filter width of the boundary reflected about the time boundary, and reflected vertically (i.e., about the ‘‘y’’ axis) relative to the final value. This tends to impose a point of inflection at the boundary, and leads the smooth towards the boundary with constant slope.” (M2004)
[3] He then goes on to say that the best choice among these methods is the one that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) between the smoothed data and the data itself:
“That constraint providing the minimum MSE is arguably the optimal constraint among the three tested.” (M2004)
2. Method
[4] However, there is a better and more reliable way to choose among these three constraints. This is to minimize the error of the final smoothed data point in relation, not to the data itself, but to the actual final smoothed average (which will only be obtainable in the future). The minimum MSE used in M2004 minimizes the squared error between the estimate and the data points. But this is not what we want. We are interested in the minimum mean squared error between the estimate and the final smoothed curve obtained from the chosen smoothing method. In other words, we want the minimum error between the smoothed average at the end of the data and the smoothed average that will actually be obtained in the future, when we have enough additional data to determine the smoothed average exactly.
[5] This choice can be determined experimentally, by realizing that the potential error increases as we approach the final data point. This is because as we approach the final data point, we have less and less data to work with, and so the potential for error grows. Accordingly, we can look to see what the error is with each method in the final piece of data. This will be the maximum expected error for each method. While we cannot determine this for any data nearer to the boundary than half the width of the smoothing filter, we can do so for all of the rest of the data. It is done by truncating the data at each data point along the way, calculating the estimated value of the final point in this truncated dataset using the minimum norm, slope, and roughness methods, and seeing how far they are from the actual value obtained from the full data set.
[6] In doing this, a curious fact emerges — if we calculate the average using the “minimum roughness” method outlined above, the “minimum roughness” average at the final data point is just the final data point itself. This is true regardless of the averaging method used. If we reflect data around both the time axis and the y-axis at the final value, the data will be symmetrical around the final value in both the “x” and “y” directions. Thus the average will be just the final data point, no matter what smoothing method is used. This can be seen in Fig. 1a of M2004:
ORIGINAL CAPTION: Figure 1. Annual mean NH series. (blue) shown along with (a) 40 year smooths of series based on alternative boundary constraints (1)–(3). Associated MSE scores favor use of the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint. (Mann 2004)
[7] Note that the minimum roughness method (red line) goes through the final data point. But this is clearly not what we want to do. Looking at Fig. 1, imagine a “smoothed average” which, for a data set truncated at any given year, must end up at the final data point. In many cases, this will yield wildly inaccurate results. If this method were applied to the data truncated at the high temperature peak just before 1880, for example, or the low temperature point just before that, the “average” would be heading out of the page. This is not at all what we are looking for, so the choice that minimizes the MSE between the data and the average (the “minimum roughness” choice) should not be used.
[8] Since the minimum roughness method leads to obvious errors, this leaves us a choice between the minimum norm and minimum slope methods. Fig. 2 shows the same data set with the point-by-point errors from the three methods (minimum norm, minimum slope, and minimum roughness) calculated for all possible points. (The error for the minimum roughness method, as mentioned, is identical to the data set itself.)
[9] To determine these errors, I truncated the data set at each year, starting with the year that is half the filter width after the start of the start of the dataset. Then I calculated the value for the final year of the truncated data set using each of the different methods, and compared it to the actual average for that year obtained from the full data set. I am using a 41-year Gaussian average as my averaging method, but the underlying procedure and its results are applicable to any other smoothing method. I have used the same dataset as Mann, the Northern Hemisphere mean annual surface temperature time series of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia   [Jones et al., 1999], available at http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ftpdata/tavenh2v.dat.
Figure 2. Errors in the final data point resulting from different methods of treating the end conditions. The “minimum roughness” method error for the dataset truncated at any given year is the same as the data point for that year.
3. Applications
[10] The size of the errors of the three methods relative to the smoothed line can be seen in the graph, and the minimum slope method is clearly superior for this data set. This is verified by taking the standard deviation of each method’s point-by-point distance from the actual average. Minimum roughness has the greatest deviation from the average, a standard deviation of 0.110 degrees. The minimum norm method has a standard deviation of 0.065 degrees from the actual average, while the minimum slope’s standard deviation is the smallest at 0.048.
[11] Knowing how far the last point in the average of the truncated data wanders from the actual average allows us to put an error bar on the final point of our average. Here are the three methods, each with their associated error bar (all error bars in this paper show 3 standard deviations, and are slightly offset horizontally from the final data point for clarity).
Figure 3. Potential errors at the end of the dataset resulting from different methods of treating the end conditions. Error bars represent 3 standard deviations. The minimum slope constraint yields the smallest error for this dataset.
[12] Note that these error bars are not centered vertically on the final data point of each of the series. This is because, in addition to knowing the standard deviation of the error of each end condition, we also know the average of each error. Looking at Fig. 2, for example, we can see that the minimum norm end condition on average runs lower than the true Gaussian average. Knowing this, we can improve our estimate of the error of the final point. In this dataset, the centre of the confidence limits for the minimum norm will be higher than the final point by the amount of the average error.
3.1 Loess and Lowess Smoothing
[13] This dataset is regular, with a data point for each year in the series. When data is not regular but has gaps, loess or lowess smoothing is often used. These are similar to Gaussian smoothing, but use a window that encompasses a certain number of data points, rather than a certain number of years.
[14] When the data is evenly spaced, both lowess and loess smoothing yield very similar results to Gaussian smoothing. However, the treatment of the final data points is different from the method used in Gaussian smoothing. With loess and lowess smoothing, rather than using less and less data as in Gaussian smoothing, the filter window stays the same width (in this case 41 years). However, the shape of the curve of the weights changes as the data nears the end.
[15] The errors of the loess and lowess averaging can be calculated in the same way as before, by truncating the dataset at each year of the data and plotting the value of the final data point. Fig. 4 shows the errors of the two methods.
Figure 4. Lowess and loess smoothing along with their associated end condition errors.
[16] The end condition errors for lowess and loess are quite different, but the average size of the errors is quite similar. Lowess has a standard deviation of .062 from the lowess smoothed data, and loess has a standard deviation of .061 from the loess smoothed data. Fig 5 shows the Gaussian minimum slope (the least error of the three M2004 end conditions), and the lowess and loess smoothings, with their associated error bars.
Figure 5. Gaussian, lowess and loess smoothing along with their associated error bars. Both lowess and loess have larger errors than the Gaussian minimum slope error.
  [17] Of the methods tested so far, the error results are as follows:
METHOD                      Standard Deviation of Error

Gaussian Minimum Roughness            0.111

Gaussian Minimum Norm                 0.065

Lowess                                0.062

Loess                                 0.061Gaussian Minimum Slope                0.048
[18] Experimentally, therefore, we have determined that of these methods, for this data set, the Gaussian minimum slope method gives us the best estimate of the smoothed curve which we will find once we have enough additional years of data to determine the actual shape of the curve for the final years of data.
3.2 Improved and Alternate Methods
[19] At least one better method of dealing with the end conditions exists. I call it the “minimum assumptions” method, as it makes no assumptions about the future state of the data. It simply increases the result of the Gaussian smoothing by an amount equal to the weight of the missing data. Gaussian smoothing works by multiplying each data point within the filter width by a Gaussian weight. This weight is greatest for the central point of the filter, and decreases in a Gaussian “bell-shaped” curve for points further and further away from the central point. The weights are chosen so that the total of the weights summed across the width of the filter adds up to 1.
[20] Let us suppose that as the center of the filter approaches the end of the dataset, the final two weights do not have data associated with them because they are beyond the end of the dataset. The Gaussian average is calculated in the usual manner, by multiplying each data point with its associated weight and summing the weighted data. The final two points, of course, do not contribute to the total, as they have no data associated with them.
[21] However, we know the total of the weights for the other data points. Normally, all of the weights would add up to 1, but as we approach the end of the data there are missing data points within the filter width. Their total of the existing data points might only be say 0.95, instead of 1. Knowing that we only have 95% of the correct weight, we can approximate the correct total by dividing the sum of the existing weighted data points by 0.95. The net effect of this is a shifted weighting which, as the final data point is approached, shifts the center of the weighting function further and further forwards toward the final data point.
[22] The standard deviation of the error of the minimum slope method, calculated earlier, was 0.048. The standard deviation of the error of the minimum assumptions method is 0.046. This makes it, for this data set, the most accurate of the methods tested. Fig. 6 shows of the difference between these two methods at the end of the data set.

Figure 6. Gaussian minimum slope and minimum assumptions error bars. The minimum assumptions method provides the better estimate of the future smoothed curve.
[23] We can also improve upon an existing method. The obvious candidate for improvement is the minimum norm method. It has been calculated by padding the data with the average of the full dataset, from the start to the end of the data. However, we can choose an alternate interval on which to take our average. We can calculate (over most of the dataset) the error resulting from any given choice of interval. This allows us to choose the particular interval that will minimize the error. For the dataset in question, this turns out to be padding the end of the dataset with the average of the previous 5 years of data. Fig 7 shows the individual errors from this method, compared with the minimum assumptions method. Since the results from the two very different methods are quite similar, this increases confidence in the conclusion that these are the best of the alternatives.
Figure 7. Smoothed data (red), minimum assumptions errors (green), tuned minimum norm (previous 5 year average) errors (blue)
[24] The standard deviation of the error from the minimum norm with a 5-year average is slightly smaller than from the minimum assumptions method, 0.045 versus 0.046.
4. Discussion
[25] I have presented a method for experimentally determining which of a number of methods yields the closest approximation to a given smoothing of a dataset at the ends of the dataset. The method can be used with most smoothing filters (Gaussian, loess, low-pass, Butterworth, or other filter). The method also experimentally determines the average error and the standard deviation of the error of the last point of the dataset. Although the Tuned Minimum Norm method yields the best results for this dataset, this does not mean that it will give the best results for other datasets. It also does not mean that the Tuned Minimum Norm method is the best smoothing method possible; there may be other smoothing methods out there, known or unknown, which will give a better result on a given dataset.
[26] The method for experimentally determining the smoothing method with the smallest end point error is as follows:
1)  For each data point for which all of the data is available to determine the exact smoothed average, determine the smoothed result which would be obtained by each candidate method if that data point were the final point of the data. (While this can be done by truncating the data at each point, padding the data if required, and calculating the result, it is much quicker to use a modified smoothing function which simply treats each data point as if it were the last point of the dataset and applies the required padding.)
2)  For each of these data points, subtract the actual smoothed result of the given filter at that point from the smoothed result of treating that point as if it were the final point. This gives the error of the smoothing method for the series if it were truncated at that data point.
3)  Take the average and the standard deviation of all of the errors obtained by this analysis.
4)  Use the standard deviation of these errors to determine the best smoothing method.
5)  Use the average and the standard deviation of these errors to establish confidence limits at the final point of the smoothed data.
5. Conclusions
1)  The Minimum Roughness method will always yield the largest standard deviation of the end point error in relation to the smoothed data, and is thus the worst method to choose.
2)  For any given data set, the best method can be chosen by selecting the method with the smallest standard deviation of error as measured on the dataset itself.
3)  The use of an error bar at the end of the smoothed average allows us to gauge the reliability of the smoothed average as it reaches the end of the data set.

One example is from the German online FOCUS magazine. It presents 2 blurbs at its news ticker. it writes:
20.44: The so-called Super Bowl will take place this coming Sunday in the US state of New Jersey. A report in the newspaper ‘New York Times’ wrote that it could be the coldest Super Bowl of all time – because for the first time it will take place at an especially northern region of the country.
20.30: The USA is also struggling with a new cold wave. At the east coast and in the midwest many schools and highways have been closed. As the National Weather Service predicted, the Arctic weather front could reach all the way into the normally warm southern states, bringing near freezing temperatures. In Chicago temperatures could drop to minus 20° Celsius.”
But that’s about it when it comes to news from Germany on the US cold wave. Unfortunately for European climate activists, the Super Bowl will certainly bring vivid photos of the bitter cold that’s gripping the US to millions of viewers in Europe, thus potentially making it the Inconvenient Super Bowl.
63 people die of “unusual cold” in Thailand – coldest in 30 years!
Meanwhile not only is cold gripping North America and Eastern Europe, but it has also plunged all the way down into Thailand. The German-language Farang.com reports of a brutal winter taking place in the normally tropical Asian region this year. It writes:

In Bangkok the temperature dropped to 15.6°C. Authorities reported on Thursday a new cold record and are speaking of an unusually cold winter in Thailand. It hasn’t been this cold in Bangkok since 1983, said Songkram Aksorn of the weather authority.”
The Farang.com also writes of 63 deaths due to cold over the last three months.
This cold spell is the longest in a decade, said Khun Songkram. Also the rice harvest has been impacted sei, exporters said.”

"HOUSTON  —   The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas, not from bars or living rooms across New England, until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission. “Brady, Brady,” the fans screamed, and it is in moments like this  —   the first overtime in Super Bowl history  —   that Tom Brady appears most comfortable, as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs. In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories, Brady guided   drives for the Patriots. However sublime, those efforts against the Rams, the Panthers, the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night. That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl. When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away, completing a   victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriots’ fifth title, his teammates stormed onto the field, flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved. Across the field, the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber, too exhausted and dumbstruck to move. The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter  —   and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation  —   and they won. They won because of Dont’a Hightower’s critical   and Julian Edelman’s Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro, Bill Belichick, but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the league’s other 31 teams for 16 years running: the Patriots have Brady, and no one else does, not even the Falcons, who boasted the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player in Matt Ryan. Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their   possession at the end of regulation, the Patriots, after mustering only a field goal on their first seven drives, scored on their final five possessions. “At halftime, I would say we weren’t down at all,” Brady said. “We were disappointed in the way we played, and we knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. ” Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earned him Super Bowl M. V. P. honors for the fourth time in his career. In none of the other three instances did he handle a season as challenging as this, from the illness plaguing his mother, Galynn, to the   suspension served for his role in that protracted saga known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. “A lot has transpired in the last two years, and I don’t think that needs any explanation,” Kraft said. Because of that, he said, this title is “unequivocally the sweetest. ” His reputation sullied, Brady embarked on a nationwide tour of vindication that reached its climax in the venue where he won his second Super Bowl, back in February 2004, long before the Patriots achieved modern dynasty status in an era designed to encourage parity. Brady was 26 then, and it is possible that he is now superior in all facets, six months shy of his 40th birthday, at an age when most of his peers have either retired or entered a noticeable decline. By going   during his suspension, the Patriots created the farcical perception that they no longer needed him  —   that quarterbacks in New England’s ruthless machinery are interchangeable, even Brady. He turbocharged the Patriots’ offense with 33 touchdowns to four interceptions heading into Sunday, when he toiled, misfiring wide and long, until late in the third quarter. Powered by three touchdowns in a 9:54 span of the second quarter, Atlanta led by   with 10 minutes left before the Patriots unleashed 10 minutes of mayhem. Hightower’s   catalyzed the comeback, with Brady capitalizing on excellent field position to find Danny Amendola from 6 yards out. Less than 6 minutes remained, and though the Falcons advanced deep into New England territory, a holding penalty knocked them out of   range, forcing them to punt. This might be the appropriate point to note the travails of the Falcons franchise. Their woeful inaugural season of 1966, completed weeks before the first Super Bowl, presaged Atlanta’s struggles for the next  . It took more than a decade for the Falcons to reach the playoffs, more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons. The Falcons traded Brett Favre and had a coach, Bobby Petrino, notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers. The only other time Atlanta reached the Super Bowl, in January 1999, one of its best defensive players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before. They have lost far more than they won, endured more agony than ecstasy and been lampooned for everything from their attendance to their uniforms, and for all those reasons  —   and more  —   a city that had not claimed a champion since the Braves won the World Series in 1995 was ready to celebrate with abandon once more. But first, Brady. He still had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falcons’ coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichick’s experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to New England still smolders for Quinn, who from that game remembers not the     interception by Malcolm Butler, but how the Seahawks went ahead to stay with about two minutes left. Quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical  —   words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn  —   as Seattle’s, but for the first three quarters on Sunday, the Falcons harassed Brady, swarmed the ball and created turnovers, converting both of New England’s mistakes before halftime into 14 points. Most obvious was the Falcons’ speed advantage, and how, as Quinn’s Seahawks did against Denver in the 2014 game, they parlayed it into momentum. Robert Alford’s   interception return for a touchdown, the   return in a Super Bowl, had the same effect on the Patriots as Malcolm Smith’s for Seattle three years ago. And that, to an extent, was part of the plan Quinn toted along with him to Atlanta, whose ascension under him began with an evolved way of thinking forged by his time in Seattle: He wanted his players to work as hard as they ever have  —   but have a great time doing it. The Super Bowl was enjoyable, until it wasn’t. “That’s a hard one in the locker room,” Quinn said. “No place to put that one mentally for us. ” One of the Patriots’ underappreciated assets during their dominant stretch has been their resilience, which seems odd given how rarely they tend to lose, or even trail. They fell behind Sunday for the first time since Week 12 against the Jets. But the ethos cultivated by Belichick demands an uncommon fortitude. Those who cannot handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students. Belichick built this reputation by twice smothering prolific offenses in Super Bowls  —   the 1990 Bills, when he coordinated the Giants’ unit, and the 2001 Rams, in the championship that launched New England’s dynasty. As potent as that Rams team was, it actually averaged fewer points and fewer yards per play during the season, and committed 33 more turnovers, than these Falcons. Scoring 80 points across two playoff victories emboldened Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman to call the Falcons’ offense “unstoppable. ” Except that the Patriots did, in fact, stop Atlanta on all four   possessions, empowering Brady with two timeouts and 3:30 left, chasing an   deficit. They marched 91 yards on a drive extended by a reception by Edelman as absurd as the comeback itself, one that evoked so many catches of past New England Super Bowls. Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible  —   David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself  —   it was the Patriots who amazed. While falling, Edelman caught a tipped pass, then dropped it, then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground. “It was one of the greatest catches I’ve ever seen,” Brady said. “I don’t know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I don’t think anybody  —   I don’t think he does. ” It only mattered that he did, and after White scored with 57 seconds left and Danny Amendola converted the tying   conversion, the Patriots called heads, won the coin toss and never let Atlanta touch the ball again. Only with a cleareyed view of these last five months, after the completion of another N. F. L. season, can it now be said: The anxiety, anger and exasperation that pervaded New England for months, after the scandal that cost the Patriots their sainted quarterback for a spell and dented their reputation  —   none of it mattered. The Patriots reached the final game, just as they thought they would. And they won, just as they thought they would all along, even if they never could have conjured how they did it. Brady and the Patriots were down for much of Sunday night, but they reappeared in the fourth quarter. And now, after Sunday, after winning yet another Super Bowl, he struck a familiar pose: holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti fell."

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making a working or “no frills” trip to Washington. It’s a chance for him to meet President Donald Trump as they discuss what the White House calls “common priorities.” And the premier has business to conduct, including expressing his concern over proposals to restrict use of H-1B visas, which have brought many Indian professionals to America.



Some observers have highlighted similarities between the two leaders, including their nationalist/​populist message. Both emphasize business and jobs but neither believes in free markets. Both benefited from a surge in support from religious voters, though the faiths differ. Finally, critics tagged both as potential strongmen. However, PM Modi appears measurably stronger politically.



Indeed, the latter is the far more practiced politician. He led the state government of Gujarat and Bharatiya Janata Party before taking over as premier after the BJP’s overwhelming victory in 2014. The party did well last March in state elections, though it won outright only in the super‐​state of Uttar Pradesh. Still, the BJP far out‐​classed the once ruling Congress Party with a campaign that transcended caste politics, embraced Hindu nationalism, and relied on grassroots activism. PM Modi appears well‐​positioned for a repeat national victory when elections are held in two years.



Under him India has become more active internationally. New Delhi gloried in its role as a member of the “nonaligned bloc” during the Cold War. Now the bipolar world is gone and India is wealthier and ready for global leadership. President George W. Bush initiated a significant improvement in U.S.-India relations, hoping to develop New Delhi as a counterweight to China’s growing influence.



Although India has no desire to be the catspaw of Washington or anyone else, it is a natural rival to the People’s Republic of China. Their relationship remains marred by a territorial dispute that sparked a short war a half century ago. Even before the U.S.-New Delhi rapprochement, India was active economically in Burma when Western sanctions had given the PRC a near monopoly and the Indian navy was patrolling waters in Southeast Asia where local forces were dwarfed by China’s forces.



The Obama administration continued to promote good relations, as should the Trump administration, despite some concerns in New Delhi created by the president’s criticisms of the Paris climate change treaty and H-1B visas. Hopefully tonight’s White House dinner will smooth any ruffled feathers. President Trump’s apparent choice for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, currently serving on the National Economic Council, also should be a positive influence given his extensive experience with India. There are several areas for fruitful cooperation, including economic. U.S. officials have suggested the possibility of negotiating a free trade agreement. No formal alliance is needed; a friendly, prosperous, and democratic India naturally serves the balance of power.



It perhaps has become an international cliché, but India should follow China down the path of sustained high economic growth. With a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 2015 India has been growing faster than the PRC. Last year the International Monetary Fund forecast continued expansion above seven percent annually in coming years. Many of India’s fundamentals look solid. Inflation remains modest. India’s population is likely to surpass China’s and the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that India’s “consuming class” will triple in size over the coming decade. Entry of more women into the workforce affords India another important growth opportunity. Moreover, India’s “country risk” is below that of China, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Indeed, New Delhi enjoys a clear though hard to quantify advantage from democracy: Indian politics is messy, but offers a critical pressure valve lacking in the Chinese political system.



Yet there are worrisome signs that India may fall short of its potential. Some growth fundamentals remain weak. For instance, government spending rather than private investment has been driving the economy. The drop in oil prices also spurred recent growth; no similar stimulus is likely in the near future. Per capita GDP increases have not kept up. Job creation also has disappointed. HDFC Bank warned of a “growing disconnect between economic growth, education, skills and jobs.”



A number of companies fear the future. Business confidence, along with sales growth and capacity utilization, are down. In March the _Economist_ reported that “firms are busy cutting back investment as if mired in recession. Bank lending to industry, growth in which once reached 30 percent a year, is shrinking for the first time in over two decades.”





India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making a working or ‘no frills’ trip to Washington.



Even the information technology sector is suffering. The Modi government had hoped to expand India’s success in information technology, proposing to wire every village as part of the “Digital India” plan. But layoffs have hit the IT sector, which currently accounts for nearly ten percent of India’s GDP. Kris Lakshmikanth, who runs Head Hunters India, said that “For the first time, companies are touching middle management.” The industry, which provides two‐​thirds of world IT out‐​sourcing, also faces foreign pressure. A related threat from President Trump is limiting use of H-1B visas, available for more highly skilled workers.



The national government has a debt to GDP ratio of 67 percent, among the highest in Asia; the 2018 deficit will be about 3.2 percent. State debt also has been increasing sharply, up from two percent of GDP in 2012 to about three percent now. Annual state deficits run about 2.5 percent of GDP. The combined national‐​state deficit is burdensome 5.7 percent of GDP.



Earlier this year states began writing off agricultural debts. In Uttar Pradesh the victorious BJP promised to waive $5.6 billion in small farmers’ loans. Farmers across the nation then demanded the same treatment. The likely result is a $40 billion write‐​off, about two percent of GDP. (The then‐​ruling Congress party took a similar step in 2008, at a cost of 1.8 percent of GDP.)



Still, the most serious barrier to an Indian economic take‐​off is India’s government, both national and state. Around the world—India’s diaspora numbers some 30 million—ethnic Indians are traders. But not in India. New Delhi and numerous state capitals simply smothered the natural entrepreneurship of the Indian people.



Collectivist, dirigiste economics reigned. The state dominated the economy’s commanding heights, imposed confiscatory tax rates, created a “License Raj” to micro‐​manage private industry, and enforced its dictates through a bureaucracy rated the worst in Asia. Even as the famed “Tigers” of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and eventually China raced ahead, India languished. As late as 1983 the poverty rate was an astounding 60 percent.



Meaningful reform finally came in 1991. Although the changes were sharply limited compared to what needed to be done, they were a dramatic advance over the past. Average incomes doubled within a decade and tens of millions of Indians escaped poverty. But people hoped for so much more while New Delhi again fell behind. For instance, in the 2014 _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating, India had dropped to 112 from 102 the year before. Explained Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar in a Cato Institute study, “Although many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created.”



Expectations were great when PM Modi took over, given his pro‐​business rhetoric and positive record in Gujarat. And his government has some solid achievements, despite lacking control of the upper house, which allowed the opposition to block some measures. Modi’s administration streamlined the goods and services tax (GST), implemented a new bankruptcy code, eased restrictions on foreign investment, limited spending, eliminated capital and certification requirements barriers for business, accelerated environmental approvals, and improved public administration and infrastructure. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of the Confederation of Indian Industry, praised the “impressive agenda of innovative economic reforms and social programs that have positively impacted growth.”



However, some of the premier’s supporters have been disappointed, given the magnitude of the changes yet needed. For example, Shankar Acharya, a columnist for New Delhi’s _Business Standard_ , worried: “Economic reforms have clearly lost momentum and there is a sense of drift in economic policy.” The _Times of India_ editorialized that “the government hasn’t pressed the pedal hard on reforms” and “implementation of projects” has been slow. The _Economist_ saw a cavalcade of mini‐​initiatives rather than a serious reform program.



Despite BJP rule, the 2017 _Index of Economic Freedom_ rated India at only 143 of 180 countries. In contrast, China stood at 111. Moreover, New Delhi’s rating _fell_ from the year before. India performed particularly poorly on business freedom, financial freedom, government integrity, investment freedom, judicial effectiveness, and labor freedom.



PM Modi’s ability to effect change will improve as the BJP makes additional gains in parliament’s upper chamber. However, the premier is more like Donald Trump than Ronald Reagan, to whom he was originally compared, in that he believes in managed rather than free markets. In fact, the BJP has, in the words of the Carnegie Endowment’s Milan Vaishnav, a “nationalist, protectionist wing” with which President Trump would be comfortable. Moreover, despite PM Modi’s dominating role, he “seems stuck in the mindset of a provincial executive: he is more interested in projects than in policies; he is a modernizer, not a reformer,” observed Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations. The _Economist_ similarly termed the premier “a fine administrator but not much of a reformer.”



The government often has manipulated rather than freed the market. For instance, New Delhi imposed agricultural prices controls and criticized “hoarding,” Officials also have discussed recreating state monopolies in “strategic” economic sectors, Particularly harmful was last November’s currency “reform,” by which 86 percent of the nation’s currency was demonetized without an adequate number of new bills available. The result was chaos for all and ruin for some, particularly small, cash‐​based businesses. Currency shortages in ATMs persisted until last month. Saurabh Mukherjea of Ambit Capital described demonetization “as the economic equivalent of a heart attack.”



PM Modi moderated the political blowback by playing the populist card, arguing that the program was necessary to tame the rich and stop corruption. But whatever the economic justification for moving the economy away from a disproportionate reliance on cash, the government appeared motivated more by the desire to bring the nation’s finances under its control. The botched swap probably accounted at least partly for the lower annualized growth of 6.1 percent during the first quarter of this year, below the rate when PM Modi took office. And the impact could last for some time.



The premier should shift course and use his authority, strengthened by the March elections, to accelerate reforms. Much could be done to liberalize markets, encourage entrepreneurship, ease business creation, and spur employment. For instance, Cornell’s Eswar Prasad of Cornell advocated “reducing labor regulations, unshackling businesses from red tape and bureaucracy, reducing government control of banks and clearing up their bad loans, developing capital markets, revamping the government’s tax and expenditure systems and improving infrastructure.”



Of particular concern, the rules governing business hiring and firing greatly increase costs, discouraging job creation. Employment actually has fallen in these areas, while growth has been limited primarily to uncovered industries. Regulated companies tend to stay small and rely on temporary labor. India hosts only 270 firms with sales above $125 million, compared to 7,680 in China. Nine out of ten jobs come from the informal sector. This system has greatly hindered development of a competitive manufacturing industry, like that in China. India’s abundant human resources are being squandered.



Government enterprises are used to provide jobs. Even in a good economy losses are routine. Firms that make money usually rely on government monopolies or other special privileges. Air India loses more money the more it flies. Overall, parastatals lose billions of dollars a year. They survive only at extraordinary public cost: “soft loans, subsidies, and bail‐​outs keep them afloat,” observed the _Economist_.



State banks are loaded with bad debts which McKinsey & Co. figures exceed the banks’ total value. Government “services” are a scandal. Said Aiyar, “With almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health.” Many teachers in public schools don’t even bother to come to class. Lawsuits can take decades to resolve: the legal system has a backlog of 31.5 million cases.



PM Modi also should avoid the temptation to inflame Hindu nationalism to win votes. Religious intolerance and persecution have worsened since his 2014 victory. Vigilantism has been rising, especially against Muslims accused of trafficking in beef. Yet after the BJP’s victory in Uttar Pradesh he appointed as chief minister a Hindu priest once jailed for his violent rhetorical attacks on Muslims. Even if such tactics yield short‐​term political benefits, they risk not only social conflict but economic harm, discouraging foreign investment and trade which would benefit all Indians.



Just as the world spent decades waiting for China to escape Mao Zedong’s communist madness, so, too, has the world spent decades waiting for India to leave behind Jawaharlal Nehru’s socialist nostrums. PM Modi offers competent management and has moved his country closer to economic freedom. But getting the rest of the way requires freeing India’s people from the shackles created by government social and economic engineers. Ethnic Indians have proved their economic prowess around the globe. Now they need the chance to do so at home.



It is good for the prime minister to visit America early during the two leaders’ joint tenure. Although no one knows how two such egos that have climbed the political mountains in their respective nations will get along, Narendra Modi is a worthy partner for Donald Trump. Both have succeeded in tough political systems and overcome harsh opposition. And both have a unique opportunity to transform their respective nations, and ultimately the world. Working together they are more likely to succeed in doing so, and for the better.

 **Press Statement:** Robin Grieve   
Chairman of Pastural farming Climate Research  
www.farmcarbon.co.nz



 ****“NZ must lead the way in pushing for change in the way methane emissions are regarded in the Paris climate accord at the UN Climate Action Summit this week.”Robin Grieve Chairman of Pastural farming Climate Research said today



“Globally there is a push for the politicians to listen to the science, and the science of methane has been ignored by politicians who decades ago adopted a carbon accounting system using the carbon dioxide equivalent model which scientists say failed to take in to account the cyclical nature of the methane emissions.



“NZ is one country with an emissions profile that has significant methane emissions compared to our CO2 emissions and which has the standing to influence change in international agreements to reflect the fact that not all carbon emissions are the same and it is not the equivalence unit it was intended to be and is portrayed to be in the Paris agreement. Carbon emissions are not a useful measure of anything for this reason.



“PM Ardern is likely to be wanting to show we are leading the way by pointing to her proposed carbon zero bill where some carbon emissions will reduce to zero but carbon emissions sourced from methane will only be required to reduce.



“Reducing emissions of methane however is not only unnecessary, it is undesirable because **it will only come at the expense of food production** , and given the growing population’s need for food there is no morality in that.



“Simply by pursuing policies that abdicate any responsibility to meet the world’s growing food demand, show we have learnt nothing from the inhumanity of the push for biofuel by politicians just a few years ago. Ardern’s methane reduction policies will also increase global emissions because the demand for food will have to be met by less efficient international producers.



“Farmers in NZ have to date been able to increase food output while maintaining methane emissions at a stable rate. That is the best outcome and has been **achieved with no regulatory impost.**



“It is also all that is needed, with the Ministry for Environment confirming, in its zero carbon consultation discussion document, that stabilizing methane emissions is all that is required to ensure they do not contribute to any further increase in global temperatures.



“NZ through its delegation must push for science to be respected and the methane mistake of the 1990’s, where politicians adopted the farcical carbon equivalence system, be fixed. This can be done with the Paris agreement recognizing that not all carbon emissions require the same reductions as others and more importantly that countries’ reduction targets must not be achieved by reducing the wrong carbon emissions and also **not by simply passing the buck to other countries, as NZ intends to do.**



“Jacinda Ardern called climate change her generation’s nuclear free moment and her policy response so far is similar in that it relies on other countries to take responsibility. In our nuclear free moment it was for the problem of maintaining peace, this time it is for the problem of feeding the world.



“NZ farmers’ record of increasing production whilst stabilizing methane emissions puts NZ in a great place to show the world what can be done, and our Prime Minister should send the message to the world that it is in the best interests of humanity and the planet that the Paris agreement changes its approach to methane and encourages national reduction targets that encourage what NZ farmers are already doing in NZ.”

"MONROVIA, Liberia  —   Emmanuel Dongo, who spends his days begging on Monrovia’s streets, plunged with his crutches onto the concrete stage and into the glare of neon. He thrust his muscular shoulders forward, limp legs hanging behind him, and transformed himself into Lyrical D, rising rap artist. “Handicap man trying to survive, then you sitting there just to criticize, when that you, what thing you will really do?” he asked, snapping out the lyrics to a rapt crowd at Code 146, where Liberia’s aspiring rap stars come to make their names. “Will you close your mouth and turn your back on you? I feel too bad when I sitting in this wheelchair, just want to be walking like you, man. See me passing and you mocking at me telling me I not even look like human being. ” Putting down his crutches, Mr. Dongo leaned back into his wheelchair and propelled himself across the stage, dancing frenetically and spitting out angry rhymes about his experiences of discrimination in a society that largely views disability through the lens of superstition. Even though disabled victims of war are a common sight on Liberia’s city streets, handicapped people are often seen as cursed, their amputations or paralyzed limbs viewed as the result of witchcraft by the cruel and envious, or else as punishment for some wrongdoing. Music seems an unlikely career choice for a Liberian with Mr. Dongo’s many difficulties. But the proliferation of makeshift studios,   engineers and a distinct Liberian sound has given rise to a thriving music scene here, opening up space for emerging artists like Mr. Dongo. Aspiring artists can record songs for as little as $20 if the engineer likes them, or even free if they are a big enough name. That night at Code 146, the D. J. played the beat to Lyrical D’s latest club track. Onstage, Mr. Dongo swung back into his wheelchair and began to twist, turn and thump the chair’s front tire up and down. “Make some noise, party people, make some noise!” he shouted. The listeners in the audience responded, shaking their bodies and raising their arms in the air. Code 146 is owned and run by Jonathan Koffa, Monrovia’s most famous rapper. Known as  Takun J, Mr. Koffa is widely considered a pioneer of HipCo, Liberia’s articulation of rap that uses the nation’s unique patois as its base. His downtown club is hidden at the end of a dark alley. Its walls are lime green and covered with paintings of the city’s musical icons. Performances rarely start before 11 p. m. with music pumping through crackling speakers till the early hours. On the evening Mr. Dongo performed, his producer, Alhaji Yaits, 22, who goes by the name Young Master, sat nodding to the beat he had helped produce a week earlier. Mr. Yaits discovered Mr. Dongo, 27, on the streets of Monrovia three years ago and, in between other paying projects, has been helping him produce an album free of charge. Mr. Dongo’s wheelchair is regularly parked at the bottom of the steps leading to Mr. Yaits’s studio. Inside, the walls are decorated in   colors with the names of artists Mr. Yaits has worked with and a large picture of him presiding over a mixing board. Mr. Yaits, like Mr. Dongo, was inspired by Takun J and HipCo music, a sound born in Monrovia in the aftermath of Liberia’s civil war, which ended in 2003. HipCo is raw, gritty and deeply   in spirit. It throws punches at politicians and the Liberian elite, whom HipCo rappers accuse of plundering the country’s wealth and ignoring the poor. Dozens of artists like Mr. Dongo jockey for a chance to perform at Code 146’s weekly   sessions. In the early days of his career, Mr. Dongo was ridiculed when he performed at the street jams that regularly spring up across the city, but at Code 146 he was welcomed with open arms. Born in a rural area outside the capital, Mr. Dongo came into the world on the eve of a conflict that killed more than 250, 000 and displaced millions. His mother was never able to reach a clinic to have him vaccinated for polio, leaving Mr. Dongo with two withered legs. His uncle, a health worker, eventually brought Mr. Dongo to Monrovia but lost his job and was not able to support him. Instead, he sent Mr. Dongo to a grim   home for disabled people. Mr. Dongo lived there for over a decade before moving out on his own to pursue his dream of becoming a rap star. By day, Mr. Dongo sits on busy traffic islands and begs outside the shiny supermarkets that serve Liberia’s expatriates and elite, who drive around in ample S. U. V.s and live in plush   compounds protected by barbed wire. He uses most of the money to support his    son, who lives with Mr. Dongo’s mother. The rest of the money goes toward the fledgling music career he hopes will lift him out of poverty in a nation where opportunities for handicapped people simply do not exist. Just getting around Monrovia is tough for the disabled. Footpaths are rare, and when they exist, they are often a series of disjointed concrete panels that jut out like jagged teeth. Metal manholes are often stolen for scrap metal, leaving open holes in the middle of roads. Many of Monrovia’s main thoroughfares have been paved in recent years, though, and Mr. Dongo and other disabled people can often be seen gliding in their wheelchairs through city traffic, dodging cars in a country where road rules are rarely respected. Like many Monrovians, Mr. Dongo lives in a slum, called Clara Town, where he has to muscle his way through the narrow dusty pathways that run between the community’s zinc shacks. While largely independent, he often pays neighbors to fetch him water from the pump to bathe, to   his clothes and sometimes to cook. Mr. Dongo fantasizes about a future in which he no longer begs in order to survive or navigates potholed roads and back streets instead, he’s ferried around in a black S. U. V. accompanied by a bodyguard who pushes him past screaming fans to the stage. On the streets he feels embarrassed when those who know him as an artist see him begging. “I know that sitting on the street begging I belittle myself,” Mr. Dongo said. “But when I perform onstage, I feel good because I know that my dream is working and people go wild for me. ” As Lyrical D finished his short set at Code 146, Mr. Koffa stood behind the bar, a quietly commanding presence. His bare, muscular arms were tattooed with maps of Liberia and tributes to HipCo. At the end of the performance, Mr. Koffa told Lyrical D that he liked his new track and shook his hand. Several days later, Mr. Dongo was out on the street filming a video for his song “Show Love. ” A director told Mr. Dongo where to position himself as workers shooed people away from the shot. A friend played the song through a mobile phone plugged into a boom box, and Mr. Dongo began to sing. He was accompanied by two friends dressed in matching    striped   and jeans: his backup dancers, twirling in wheelchairs. Mr. Dongo furrowed his brow and performed small stunts with his chair. “I can remember when I used to go on show, people used to laugh,” he sang. “But I keep pushing, no fun, keep pushing, no fun, keep pushing, I not give up. ”"
"**Chloe Haskett wakes up every morning wondering whether she'll still have a job to go to.**
She's one of almost a million young people working in the retail sector whose future has been thrown into doubt by the coronavirus crisis.
Early December is normally a boom time for retailers when the festive shopping season is in full swing. But lockdowns across the UK have forced many shops to close or limit the number of customers they allow through their doors for much of the year, pushing more to shop online.
And that has had a devastating impact on the fortunes of some of the UK's biggest High Street names, as well as the staff.
On Tuesday, Chloe woke up to find that she was one of more than 25,000 retail workers whose job was put at risk this week after Debenhams revealed it was set to close and Arcadia, the owner of Topshop, was put into administration.
Both firms have been hit by a dramatic fall in visits to UK shops, which are expected to be down 62% in the final weeks of the year, according to retail analyst company Springboard.
But the pandemic has merely accelerated a trend that was already visible on Britain's High Streets, as shoppers swap bricks-and-mortar shops for online deliveries.
""This is my fifth Christmas in Debenhams, and over the years, every year, you just notice it getting quieter,"" says Chloe, who works in the Portsmouth branch.
""Commercial Road, our High Street, is just dead,"" says the 22-year-old, who works in a watch and jewellery repair concession in the Debenhams store. ""Everything's closing, nothing's really reopening.""
She's hoping for a Christmas rush when lockdown restrictions are relaxed in England. However, she worries that the news of Debenhams' demise could put people off bringing their valuables in for repair.
Chloe blames the High Street job losses on the rise of Amazon, but also bricks-and-mortar retailers themselves for promoting online-only offers that put people off visiting stores.
She also worries about what will happen if the closure of Debenhams puts her out of a job.
Chloe, who has only ever worked in retail, says that trying to find another job after the coronavirus crisis has ravaged the sector is ""an almost impossible battle"".
""I'd literally probably try anything at this point,"" she says. ""I used to be a bit picky before, but now I really can't be, it's going to be whatever pays money at the end of the day.""
Chris Brook-Carter, chief executive of RetailTrust, an organisation for shop workers, said: ""We're closing in on 150,000 jobs lost in retail, across the course of this pandemic.""
Four million people work in retail and the supporting sector, making it the biggest employer in the UK, according to Mr Brook-Carter.
""Sadly there will be fewer jobs in retail going forward than have existed in the past,"" he said.
The Centre for Retail Research estimates that job losses in the sector will hit 235,000 this year, with 20,620 stores expected to close their doors.
One of those to have already lost their job was Grant Docherty, 23, who worked at a Burton concession at the Debenhams store in Carlisle.
He was made redundant in October after being furloughed during the lockdown. But as he only joined the firm in February, he was ineligible for the wage top-up under the government's job retention scheme, which left him out of pocket.
""Stores were seeing a massive lack of customers, sales were down, and stock was still in the wrong season as deliveries took a long time to get back into the swing of things,"" he says.
He said the subsequent job hunt was very difficult. In the end, he was forced to relocate to Glasgow for a new job as a call handler for the NHS, which interviewed 500 people for the role.
That prospect of finding new work, possibly beyond retail, is now looming large for another 12,000 Debenhams employees.
Sarah (not her real name) works part-time in the chain's Worthing store. She knew it was likely to be bad news when she received a message on the staff WhatsApp group asking her and her colleagues to dial into an all-staff conference call.
Sarah says the staff were told in ""blunt"" terms that they would ""more than likely"" be made redundant.
Another person on the line, who also did not want to use her name, said: ""The call was really sad.""
""We don't know when we will close but I am going into work today to prepare for reopening tomorrow and it is with a heavy heart,"" she said.
""We unfortunately aren't the first casualty of the pandemic and sadly I don't think we will be the last.""
With Christmas just around the corner, many people like Sarah, Grant and Chloe face an uncertain wait as other big chains, such as Peacocks and Jaeger, announce cutbacks and job losses.
And with a third of retail workers thought to be 25 and under, that could leave thousands more young people looking for work."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCO2 Handel here, a leading German web portal promoting climate alarmism, renewable energy and climate protection, today has announced it is “forced to discontinue operating effective the end of this month“, citing they were unable to secure financing.
The CO2-Handel site is operated by “KlimAktiv® Consulting GmbH“, an “independent consulting company in the field of energy and emissions management“.

According to its website, KlimAktiv is “supported by the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Protection, Construction And Reactor Safety (BMUB) and is an UNFCCC approved NGO and observer of the World climate negotiations.” A number of the KlimaAktiv partners are listed here.
Not surprisingly the CO2 Handel site almost always presented reports promoting alarmism, the virtues of renewable energy, and the evils of fossil fuels.
Norbert Schmid und Stephan Schunkert of CO2 Handel write that the web portal began in 2005 as an “indefatigable fellow campaigner for climate protection” and that they “confidently look ahead, however, to the coming year and a global climate treaty in Paris“.
But the optimism seems to end there. Schmid und Schunkert write that in the early days they had been confident that CO2 emissions trading would play “an important role in national and international climate protection”, but reluctantly admit today: “These developments are taking place very slowly, if at all. Emissions trading in Europe is ailing.”
The end of CO2-Handel may be a sign that hard times are in the pipeline for the financing of global warming activism in Germany.

As Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s struggle to oust union strongman John Setka from the party stumbles along, another rift is opening in the Labor movement. Labor is still unable to make up its mind whether it wants to return to its blue-collar roots, or just keep on its disastrous path of becoming the party of inner-city watermelon elites.



Nuclear energy policy is shaping up as yet another fault-line for a Labor party which can’t decide if it’s beer’n’parmy Arthur, or quinoa’n’almond milk Martha.



The Australian Workers’ Union will call on Australia to drop restrictions on nuclear power in a significant break from the Labor Party and other unions.



Labor has tried to straddle the barbed-wire between workers and watermelons on nuclear energy since the Hawke government compromised with the Three-Mine policy in the 1980s. Hawke wanted to avoid antagonising the urban left for whom anti-nuclear activism was a totemic fetish, while still not risking votes in mining states. The workers are arking up.



AWU national secretary Daniel Walton on Friday will tell a parliamentary roundtable — chaired by former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce — that Australia’s approach to nuclear energy is “stuck in a time warp”.



Mr Walton told The Australian on Thursday “partisan pigheadedness” on nuclear energy was holding back Australia’s ability to keep up with international competitors.



“Thirty-one advanced economies — the likes of the US, UK, Switzerland, France, Sweden, South Korea, and Finland — all rely on nuclear power in their energy mix. Yet here we’re stuck in a time warp,” Mr Walton said.



“Continuing to adopt a position of ideological extremism on nuclear technology is an economic own-goal we can’t afford to keep kicking … Australia’s energy sector is a shameful mess. In terms of global competitiveness Australia’s energy infrastructure has fallen off a cliff — from 29th in the world in 2009 to 55th today.



This is almost entirely the fault of the green-left and their obsession with climate change. Reliable power supplies, like coal plants, have been forced to close, while starry-eyed Labor state governments are switching to unreliable, ruinously expensive “renewables”.



“Most of our energy crisis is due to partisan pigheadedness — on both sides. So those of us on the progressive side of politics can’t continue to reflexively reject zero-emission compromise options.



“We should drop the federal ban on nuclear power generation as well as the state-based bans on new uranium mines. If industry sees value in the Australian market it should be free to invest without being blocked by outdated fears. Our energy debate should be about pragmatics, not 20th-century ideology.”



His new pro-nuclear move revives calls from his predecessor as AWU secretary, Paul Howes, in 2009 for a review into Australia’s stance on nuclear. Mr Howes’s push at the time was rejected by then prime minister Kevin Rudd.



If Labor should learn anything from its May election loss, it’s that nonsense such as anti-nuclear might please urban elites, but the vast swathes of electorates in blue-collar, mining areas have had enough. Meanwhile, the Coalition government is listening to the growing calls for nuclear power.



“If you want zero emissions and a renewable energy future, nuclear has to be part of the mix,” Mr Joyce said, while commending the AWU for its nuclear stance.

Victorian premier, socialist left faction leader Daniel Andrews, seems determined to turn that state into Australia’s very own little Venezuela. Whether it’s promulgating the creepy Marxist nonsense of “Safe Schools” (the template for New Zealand’s “Mates and Dates”), greedily trousering billions from the Chinese communist regime, or fiddling in denial while African gangs run rampant in Melbourne suburbs, if there’s a useless watermelon cause going, all Red Dan wants to know is, “Where do we sign?”



Between its rampaging gangs and tottering infrastructure, Victoria is just a blackout away from turning into a _Mad Max_ dystopia. Fittingly enough, the original classic _Mad Max_ was filmed all around my home town, in Victoria.



The Victorian government has ruled out new dams, saying climate change means not enough water would flow into them to make them worthwhile.



 **“Even the rain that falls isn’t actually going to fill our dams and our river systems”** – former Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery in 2004.



 **“South East Queensland Water revealed the [Wivenhoe] dam was holding what was classed as ‘190 per cent’”** – _The Australian_ , 2011.



 **“Warragamba Dam full, set to overflow”** – News.com.au, 2016.



Water Minister Lisa Neville says water in the state’s rivers will halve by 2065, citing this forecast in her refusal to build even one dam, even though over that period the state’s population is expected to double.



Poor old Tim based his claim about dams, and similar claims that Perth would be “the 21st century’s first ghost metropolis”, on the same forecasts.



Lisa Neville, it should also be known, has also been Victoria’s Police Minister during the worst of its African gang crisis – a crisis the government has steadfastly denied even exists. She’s consistent in applying her competence and experience, I’ll give her that.



Rather, she said, Victoria would rely on its high electricity-consuming desalination plant, from which it has ordered $81m of water this year, costing average households what she said was “only” $10 […]



The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ central estimate for Victoria’s population in 2066 is 12 million.



In 2006, the then Labor state government rejected a dam for the Maribyrnong River, proposed by the Liberal Party and estimated to cost $80m. Ms Neville’s spokeswoman said it would have yielded about 25 gigalitres, whereas the desalinat­ion plant could provide up to 150GL independent of rainfall.



The Australian has calculated that, on this basis, the cost of the Maribyrnong Dam would have been $3.2m/GL of water yielded, whereas the cost of the desalination plant is $23m/GL.



Victoria’s desalination plant was rushed into construction during the last drought, costing $3.5 billion. By the time it was actually built, Victoria’s dams were back at over 80% capacity. Even sitting idle, the plant still costs Victorians nearly $2 million a day. Even when finally pressed into service in 2017, the plant failed to deliver its promised quota.



Still, the Water Minister places a standing order for water (whether it’s needed or not) on every April 1.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse took a look at the July 2014 Arctic sea ice data. They found astonishing results. What follows is the Arctic sea ice part of the story I reported on here.
=====================================
The Sun In July 2014 And Arctic Sea Ice In Mid Summer
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Every summer over the past years Arctic sea ice has been the subject of much public interest. Especially after 2006 there have been years (recall 2007 and 2012) when a large part of the Arctic ice cap melted away and all the talk was about the “Arctic death spiral“.
Since 1979 we have been collecting really good, validated and homogenized data from satellite observations that look at two important magnitudes: 1) the sea ice cover area in square kilometers, and 2) the so-called ice extent in square kilometers², i.e. that is at least 15% ice covered. The linear trend of this is indeed downward since observations began:

Figure 4: July sea ice extent since 1979. 
The excitement at the start of the melt season in May/June is always big. How many millions of square kilometers will still be left in September? Estimating this value is no easy task because upward deviations from the trend line have occurred time and again (like in the 1990s and early 2000s), and downward deviations (2007, 2011, 2012).
But last year and the year before the Arctic sea ice ended up close to the trend line. Every year the Sea Ice Prediction Network conducts a survey of educated guesses of sea ice extent expected by mid-September. This is what it looks like this year:

Figure 5: Forecast for September 2014 sea ice extent, from various sources and methods. Source: arcus.com.
For comparison, last year’s (2013) figure of 5.4 million km² is added in the chart. The mean value of this year’s estimates made in June is 4.8 million km², i.e. far above 2012’s record low value of 3.6 million km².
Also a co-author of this article participated; his forecast made in early July was 5.0 million km². He used the heat content of the Arctic basin and the existing ice volume at the end of the winter. There are many decisive factors that are impossible to know so early on, e.g. the weather (foremost the currents from warmer land and wind), and other natural factors.

We already know that every prediction is difficult, especially those dealing with the future. Having observed the development so far until the end of July, it is highly probable that we will see a repeat of 2013, which would mean that the mean of all those submitting a forecast will be approx. 0.6 million km² too low.
Only 5100 km³ melted in July 2014
The sea ice could turn out to be more robust than previously assumed. That has to do with a magnitude that is not visible in satellite images: the thickness of the ice – or its volume. Here we are left to rely on models. One that is often used is PIOMAS. It provides daily data on ice volume and the latest July value yields the following chart over the years:

Figure 6: Ice volume (1979 = 100%) as to PIOMAS for July 31 of each year, eight-year smoothed non-linear trend. 
July is a very important month during the melt season: In the Arctic the sun shines 24 hours per day, irradiance there exceeds that of the tropics as a result. The sun is also high above the horizon and so only about 15% of the sun’s radiation in the water is reflected. The open water absorbs large quantities of energy, which can melt the ice from the side and from underneath. And this year something completely unusual happened: while since 1979 approx. 6500 km³ melted in July, this year only 5100 km³ melted.

Figure 7: July ice volume loss plot since 1979. Shown are also the limits depicting 2 standard deviations (bold black lines). Source: psc.apl.washington.edu/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/.
The very low melt in 2014 is a 3-sigma event!
A negative record – since 1979 – that is unparalleled. The relatively steady decline shown in Figures 4 and 6 is deceptive – the ice of the current year is decisively determined by the previous year. To a great extent the series is auto-correlated. One sees the true development much better with the Figure 7 loss diagram.
Baffled experts
Something seems to have happened during the peak of summer to lead to a stopping of the downward trend. It was internal natural variability within our climate – it certainly was not the weather. All experts are currently baffled. This year the weather resembles more that of the year 2012, and back then there was a low point in ice volume development.
Over the last years natural variability has been increasingly used in climate science to explain away over-hasty predictions of greenhouse effects. Also the observations of the Arctic ice are adding to the scramble for explanations. If you are interested how the Arctic sea ice will finish in September – then stay tuned!

"**A council has been criticised for charging small businesses Â£20 each to join its virtual Christmas fair.**
One local trader described it as a ""cynical"" attempt by Wokingham Borough Council to profit from small companies trying to survive the current climate.
Julie LeFevre said: ""It doesn't seem a lot but they are profiting from small traders who are struggling.""
Councillor Stuart Munro defended the fees which go towards administrative support for those who sign up.
This includes help creating social media posts and promotion on the council's social media accounts, he said.
Conservative Mr Munro added: ""The virtual fair was intended to spread a little bit of festive cheer after the planned in-person market and ice rink had to be cancelled [due to coronavirus restrictions].""
But Ms LeFevre, who makes and sells needle-sculpted figures, said she believed the council ""has a responsibility"" to help all local businesses and people who pay council tax.
""This just doesn't seem right,"" she said, adding: ""I cannot see a difference between the council's online market and other virtual fairs that are not charging people to take part. It's just another way for the council to make money.""
Opposition Lib Dem councillor Imogen Shepherd-DuBey said she thinks the fees are too high.
She added: ""You've got businesses that are trying to survive and the council is clearly making a profit out of this.
""We should really be doing more to support these people and I'm not convinced the charges are appropriate.""
Mr Munro, business lead for the local authority, said about 40 small businesses have signed up for the virtual market so far.
He added that the council has given Â£19m worth of business rate relief and Â£20m in business grants to local companies during the pandemic."

Dr. Michael Connolly and his son Dr. Ronan Connolly have done an in-depth assessment of weather balloon temperature records. In this video, Dr. Michael Connolly explains that there is a significant difference in temperature between urban temperature monitoring stations and those in rural settings. This is well-known as the “Urban Heat Island” effect, where the heat generated by human activity, as well as the absorption of heat from the sun on black pavement and concrete, is retained in a kind of heat ‘bubble’ around a city, while in the country, daytime heating is dissipated by evaporation and wind. To find out to what extent the claim of ‘global warming’ is affected by this phenomenon (which might be an artificial claim), the Connolly’s sought an independent data source that would not be affected by urban/human activity – they chose weather balloons. Dr. Michael Connolly discusses their findings. Their full presentation can be seen here on our blog: Balloons in the Air: Understanding weather and climate.

"Russia will almost certainly be barred from this summer’s track and field world championships, global officials for the sport said Monday, citing the nation’s response to its doping scandal, which they called inadequate. The officials met in Monaco on Monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on Russian athletes, outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until November. Until then, individual Russian athletes with robust histories of drug testing may petition to compete as neutral athletes, unassociated with any country, in the world championships, which will take place in August in London, as well as other global events. Officials agreed to exempt Russia’s youngest athletes from the blanket ban, allowing for those under 15 to compete as neutral individuals without filing a special application. Citing a number of issues  —   including ”unhelpful comments” by Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko limited and problematic drug testing within the country and evidence that an implicated coach had continued to train athletes in spite of having been suspended  —   Rune Andersen, the chairman of a global task force overseeing Russia’s reform, said the nation had not yet met the conditions for reinstatement. Among those conditions is that Russia’s national antidoping agency be fully recertified by the World   Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports. That agency has suggested it may grant Russia partial certification in May, track officials said Monday, and full certification in November. Only after that point, Mr. Andersen said, would track and field authorities consider restoring Russia to good standing. “The criteria were very clear,” said Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field’s global governing body. “They were unambiguous. They were not suffused in politics. ” Mr. Coe and Mr. Andersen said there had been some progress in Russia in recent months, including the election of a new president of Russian track and field, Dmitry Shlyakhtin. They said they had been reassured that Russia would cooperate with France’s continuing criminal investigation, which focuses on bribery and corruption in global track and field, and that the Russian government would provide financial support to national antidoping operations without interfering in them. Mr. Mutko, Russia’s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, has acknowledged broad problems with doping but denied a   system of cheating. Since his promotion by President Vladimir V. Putin last fall, Mr. Mutko has grown increasingly defiant in responding to the mountain of evidence that Russia has systematically doped with government assistance, most notably at the 2014 Sochi Olympics  —   where Russia’s longtime national antidoping lab chief, Grigory Rodchenkov, said he substituted   urine with clean urine. In December, after WADA laid bare the results of a   investigation, Mr. Mutko went so far as to say that female Russian hockey players who competed at the Sochi Games had been found to have male D. N. A. in their urine samples because they had had sex. Scientific experts dismissed that explanation as impossible, calling it clear evidence of sample tampering. Another condition of Russia’s reinstatement highlighted on Monday in Monaco was that the nation’s leadership accept, or credibly rebut, the extensive evidence of   cheating, including the involvement of the sports ministry and Russia’s federal security service, or F. S. B. “The question of apologies is one that we have raised every time we have been to Moscow,” Mr. Andersen said Monday. “In general, I wouldn’t pinpoint any specific person that needs to say apologies,” he said. “But we expect that the Russian community is acknowledging that they have a problem, because only when you acknowledge you have a problem can you do something about it. ” In December, several Russian sports officials told The New York Times they were no longer disputing the cheating schemes that had been uncovered, though they insisted top government officials had no part in them. “Of course it was an institutional conspiracy, but not ” said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia’s national antidoping agency. While Russia remains barred, 35 Russian athletes have so far petitioned to participate in global competitions in 2017, track officials said Monday. They include Yuliya Stepanova, a   runner and   who helped ignite the Russian doping scandal and who is living in hiding in the United States. Ms. Stepanova ran as a neutral athlete in a global indoor competition in Boston late last month. “There have been some subtle shifts, and I think there is a recognition that this clearly has been a very disfiguring episode in Russian sport,” Mr. Coe said. “I’m encouraged, but I’m not cavalier about the amount of work that there still remains to be done. ” Also on Monday, Mr. Coe announced a freeze on nationality transfers, seeking to protect athletes  —   especially those from Africa, he said  —   from changes in allegiance before a new set of rules was in place. “What we have is a wholesale market for African talent open to the highest bidder,” Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, a track and field official representing Africa, said Monday. “Our present rules are being manipulated to the detriment of athletics’ credibility. ”"
"**People living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas if the visitors test negative for Covid-19, the government has said.**
More than a million coronavirus tests will be sent to care homes over the next month to allow safe indoor visits.
Visits will be allowed across all tiers of coronavirus restrictions.
The health secretary said the move was possible due to ""unprecedented strides"" in testing technology and capacity.
Matt Hancock said: ""The separation has been painful, but has protected residents and staff from this deadly virus.
""I'm so pleased we are now able to help reunite families and more safely allow people to have meaningful contact with their loved ones by Christmas.""
Strict restrictions have been placed on visits to care homes during the last eight months because of the pandemic.
In new guidance, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says the ""default position"" is now that visits should be enabled to go ahead in all tiers - unless there is an outbreak in the care home.
It adds that hand holding and hugging may be possible if other infection control measures are followed.
It stresses the importance of visitors minimising contact as much as possible and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to help protect their loved ones.
Care homes will manage the number of visits that take place, which must be arranged in advance, with visitors urged to be mindful of the additional workload for the care home.
Each care home is responsible for setting the visiting policy in that home, it says.
This will be welcome news for families in England who have waited a long time to be given the chance to visit loved ones and friends inside care homes, rather than trying to communicate through windows or on video calls.
But therein lies the problem.
The danger is that expectations will be raised of visits before Christmas which cannot all be fulfilled.
The biggest care home operators have been sent rapid testing kits but the smaller providers have not yet heard details about how they can obtain them.
One told me that, while welcoming the initiative, he was concerned at the level of administration which would be required to book in visits and organise the testing and this might mean taking on more staff.
Some doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the rapid testing technology with a relatively high number of false negatives if administered by less-trained staff.
The scheme will not be fully rolled out by Christmas but officials hope it will be more accessible to the wider public early in the new year.
More than a million quick-turnaround or ""lateral flow"" tests, which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab, are being sent out to England's 385 biggest care homes as part of the first phase of the rollout.
The guidance says the number of test kits will allow up to two visitors per resident, based on them visiting twice a week, by Christmas.
As well as the tests, an extra 46 million items of PPE will be sent to Care Quality Commission (CQC)-registered care home providers.
The Alzheimer's Society urged the government to ensure care homes do not struggle with extra administrative costs so that visits can continue.
The National Care Forum, a member association for not-for-profit social care providers, applauded the announcement, calling it a ""game-changing moment for visits"".
But executive director Vic Rayner said recognition of what the sector needs to put the policy into practice ""remains an inherent weakness"".
She added: ""It is essential that the government addresses this immediately, or else risks setting in train huge expectations around visiting, with no meaningful ability for care homes to deliver at the scale and pace required to make visiting a reality for all by Christmas.""
And Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said it was good news that the government has ""significantly shifted"" its position on care home visiting.
But she cautioned: ""The government has promised that everyone will be able to visit their loved one by Christmas and, while this is a laudable aim, it is also very ambitious, so we remain worried that practical difficulties of various kinds could get in the way for some.""
Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England - the largest representative body for independent care providers - said: ""In order for these promising plans to land successfully, the sector must now be adequately supported by the government.
""We appreciate the continued risks associated with visits, but this represents a positive step forwards.""
Separately, the government has published new guidance that may allow for some residents under the age of 65 to spend time with their families at Christmas outside of care homes \- if their provider agrees and carries out risk assessments."

From the American Chemical Society, something interesting.
A new anti-frost and anti-fog coating for glass
In an advance toward glass that remains clear under the harshest of conditions, scientists are reporting development of a new water-repellant coating that resists both fogging and frosting. Their research on the coating, which could have uses ranging from automobile windshields to camera lenses, appears in the journal ACS Nano.
Michael F. Rubner, Robert E. Cohen and colleagues point out that anti-fogging coatings that absorb water have been the focus of attention lately because of their ability to reduce light scattering and the resultant distortion caused by condensation. However, under extreme fogging conditions, these surfaces may frost and become foggy. They set out to make a better coating to withstand the aggressive conditions.

Their report describes development and testing of a new coating that rapidly absorbs water molecules that cannot freeze in the coating. At the same time, the coating has a water-repelling or hydrophobic effect to larger water droplets. The hydrophobic character means that water droplets do not spread extensively on the coating but essentially remain as flattened droplets.

The paper (which I had to dig up since it wasn’t included in the press release, sigh….) is here:
Zwitter-Wettability and Antifogging Coatings with Frost-Resisting Capabilities
Abstract:
Antifogging coatings with hydrophilic or even superhydrophilic wetting behavior have received significant attention due to their ability to reduce light scattering by film-like condensation. However, under aggressive fogging conditions, these surfaces may exhibit frost formation or excess and nonuniform water condensation, which results in poor optical performance of the coating. In this paper, we show that a zwitter-wettable surface, a surface that has the ability to rapidly absorb molecular water from the environment while simultaneously appearing hydrophobic when probed with water droplets, can be prepared by using hydrogen-bonding-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). An additional step of functionalizing the nano-blended PVA/PAA multilayer with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) (PEG) segments produced a significantly enhanced antifog and frost-resistant behavior. The addition of the PEG segments was needed to further increase the nonfreezing water capacity of the multilayer film. The desirable high-optical quality of these thin films arises from the nanoscale control of the macromolecular complexation process that is afforded by the LbL processing scheme. An experimental protocol that not only allows for the exploration of a variety of aggressive antifogging challenges but also enables quantitative analysis of the antifogging performance via real-time monitoring of transmission levels as well as image distortion is also described.

"In an article that appeared online in The Mail on Sunday, a British tabloid, the journalist David Rose described “astonishing evidence” that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States had “rushed to publish a landmark paper that exaggerated global warming and was timed to influence the historic Paris agreement on climate change. ” “Exposed: How world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data,” the article’s headline read. Mr. Rose, who has made   claims in the past that did not hold up to scrutiny, said a “  ” John J. Bates, a recently retired scientist at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, had told him that the agency “breached its own rules on scientific integrity” in publishing the study in June 2015. According to Mr. Rose, the study, which refuted earlier work that suggested global warming had slowed in the first decade of this century, “was aimed at making the maximum possible impact on world leaders” at the talks in Paris in December 2015 that led to the agreement by more than 190 nations to set limits on carbon emissions. After Mr. Rose’s article was published, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and its chairman, Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, wrote about it on Twitter. Beginning in 2013, scientists published papers showing that, according to land and sea surface temperature data, the rate of global warming had slowed since the late 1990s. This pause or hiatus, as it was often called, puzzled scientists because it came despite a continuing increase in emissions of carbon dioxide and other   gases. The findings also became a cause célèbre among climate change denialists, who cited the papers as evidence that concerns about global warming were at the least overblown. The 2015 paper, by Thomas R. Karl, who was then director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and others, used improved data sets to show that the slowdown probably did not occur at all. Because temperature data was collected in different ways over the years  —   and some methods were more reliable than others  —   it is normal for the data to be refined and adjusted. Mr. Karl’s paper reflected the latest refinements, especially for ocean data. In the Mail on Sunday article, Dr. Bates, who at one point was in charge of archiving climate data at the centers, accused Mr. Karl of having used “unverified” data. In a long blog post published Saturday, Dr. Bates went into extensive detail  —   the kind that only true data geeks could love  —   about how data sets are or are not archived and verified at NOAA. But Dr. Bates also accused Mr. Karl of misusing the process. “We find Tom Karl’s thumb on the scale pushing for, and often insisting on, decisions that maximize warming and minimize documentation,” he wrote. Republicans on the House committee and Mr. Smith, in particular, have long attacked Mr. Karl’s paper and have focused on it as part of a lingering investigation of what Mr. Smith has described as the Obama administration’s “suspect climate agenda. ” The committee has demanded that NOAA researchers turn over emails related to the work the scientists have refused to do so. Climate scientists, some of whom had worked on the data sets, voiced support for the work of Mr. Karl and the other researchers. In a post on the blog of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University, Peter Thorne, who worked on the data but left NOAA before work began on the paper itself, disputed much of what Dr. Bates said. Dr. Bates, Dr. Thorne wrote, was not involved in the data work and had misrepresented “the processes that actually occurred. ” Dr. Thorne also disputed the idea that Mr. Karl had his “thumb on the scale. ” Mr. Karl only used the data  —   he was not personally involved in the refinements, Dr. Thorne wrote. “At no point was any pressure brought to bear to make any scientific or technical choices. ” In a post at Carbon Brief, a British website that covers climate science and policy, Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, disputed the contention that the data sets used in Mr. Karl’s paper were unverified or that the data had been manipulated. Dr. Hausfather was one of the authors of a review of the NOAA ocean data, which showed the most change. The paper, published in January, compared the old and new NOAA data with independent data from satellites, buoys and other sources and found that the new data matched the independent data more closely. The result, he wrote, “strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. ” In an interview on Monday with EE News, Dr. Bates appeared to distance himself from some of what he wrote in the blog post, and from the way his criticisms were portrayed in the Mail on Sunday article. “The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data,” he said, “but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was. ” Climate Home, a nonprofit site based in London that offers news and analysis, also weighed in on one of the central contentions of Mr. Rose’s article, that the publication of the NOAA paper had ”duped” policy makers into adopting the Paris accord. The site contacted representatives to the talks from 10 countries none said that the paper had any influence."
"People have fallen in love with their Instant Pots. They may like their blenders, cherish their slow cookers and need their food processors. But the Instant Pot  —   a device that combines an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker in one handy unit  —   sends even   cooks into fits of passion. You find the “L” word over and over in the 15, 000 or so product reviews on Amazon. And if you click over to Instant Pot’s Facebook community page, you’ll find more than 360, 000 members sharing their undying affection alongside their recipes for chili. (A typical post: “I’m having an affair. My husband said he wished he would have never given me the Instant Pot for Christmas. ”) If you’re a cook and got through last year without bumping into people who couldn’t stop talking about their Instant Pots  —   or any of the other multifunctional electric pressure cookers on the market (Breville and Cuisinart both make versions)  —   then you won’t have to wait much longer. Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C. E. O. of Instant Pot Company. When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300, 000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.) The majority of Instant Pots are sold on Amazon. More than 215, 000 units were sold on Amazon Prime Day 2016, in July, when Prime members get discounts on select items, outperforming any other product on the site. Two different models of the Instant Pot currently sit in the top 10 list of Amazon best sellers in the Kitchen and Dining category. So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following? I bought one to find out. A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding   soup to use it with any regularity. What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of   safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit’s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It’s as   as a slow cooker  —   except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster. The promise of a fast, fresh homemade meal is a pressure cooker’s greatest appeal, said Lorna Sass, author of four pioneering cookbooks on pressure cooking, including “Pressure Perfect. ” “It doesn’t matter if you’re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,” Ms. Sass said. After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn’t quite as uniformly juicy. It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer. I continued to play, spending six weeks experimenting with the Instant Pot and a second electric pressure cooker, the Breville Fast Slow Pro. These are the two models recommended by my colleagues at The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times Company that put six electric pressure cookers through their paces. In terms of performance, I found the two to be more or less the same. Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes. Perhaps most convenient, the   beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old). But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with   skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts? I didn’t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don’t benefit from the intense pressure of   steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing. They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn’t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove. Another pressure cooker downside: They just don’t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the sauté function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the   roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I’ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin. The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there. For example, I’ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans. Same goes for my favorite red lentil soup. Although I didn’t save any time when I tested it, I adored the convenience of not having to watch a pot on the stove. I could turn the pressure cooker on, then go for a run. When I got home, my soup was ready  —   a good thing since I was starving. And it’s amazing for chickpeas, which take an hour all told instead of the usual three to four hours for unsoaked beans. “People want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they’re better for some things than others,” Ms. Sass said. “Stick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto. ” I’d have to agree Ms. Sass’s recipe for porcini mushroom risotto with peas is excellent, adaptable and about as easy as dinner gets (once you source the dried porcinis and arborio rice, that is). I also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs). But perhaps the biggest pressure cooker joy I found was for something as simple as   eggs. They didn’t cook faster, but even fresh eggs from the farmers’ market peeled effortlessly, without ending up pockmarked and riddled with craters the way they do when I boil them in a pot. This is because the pressure helps inflate the air pocket between the cooked white and the shell, which makes separating the two go more smoothly. I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate,   slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I   more, and   less the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I’d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream. So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker? It takes up a lot of space, it’s not at all intuitive, and I hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks. But even so, I don’t plan on giving mine up anytime soon. My friend Robin, who bought an Instant Pot six month ago, summed it up well. “I’m out of the honeymoon phase,” she said. “Now we’re settling into a relationship. And I’ve accepted its limitations, like the fact that there’s no reason to ever make oatmeal or rice in it. But between the lamb stew and the butternut squash soup, I know we will be together forever. ” Recipes: Pressure Cooker Chocolate Pudding | Pressure Cooker Spicy Pork Shoulder | Pressure Cooker Beef Short Ribs With Red Wine and Chile | Pressure Cooker Pork Salad With Pomelo and Garlic Chips | More Pressure Cooker Recipes"
"**More than 200 swimming pools in England will remain closed despite being able to reopen as lockdown restrictions are eased, a Swim England report has said.**
The swimming body said the decision presented a ""catastrophe for the health and wellbeing of the nation"".
The 221 pools were council-run, with the North West being particularly hard hit, affecting about half a million swimmers, Swim England said.
Councils pointed to financial difficulties in their decision making.
With lockdown in England having come to an end, gyms and swimming pools across the country are allowed to reopen from Wednesday, regardless of what tier their area is in.
""While it's extremely positive that millions of swimmers up and down the country can return to the activity they love, it's unacceptable to even think that so many people or clubs will not have a much-loved swimming pool to visit,"" Swim England's chief executive Jane Nickerson said.
She said more investment was needed to keep swimming pools and leisure centres open, adding despite a government grant for the industry ""financial pressures have not gone away"".
Four times world champion triathlete Barbara Holmes, from Lancashire, said: ""People need their pools, especially the children.""
Ms Holmes, who is the over-60s world champion, has been backing campaigners trying to reopen Fleetwood swimming pool.
""The community needs to be heard,"" she said.
Trafford Leisure said all of its centres would remain closed until the new year, saying they would be ""largely empty and costly to run"".
To save money, its chief operating officer said it had had to furlough staff as well as leaving its pool and building unheated.
In Stoke-on-Trent, the council said it recognised the ""essential"" physical and mental health benefits of leisure facilities but had made the decision to stagger their reopening and only two of the city's gyms would not remain closed.
Council leader Abi Brown said 75% of its leisure centre staff had been ""redeployed to critical services including welfare calls and contact tracing"" in an effort to bring down coronavirus cases and some centres had been adapted for community testing.
""If the current situation improves, we expect to restart more of our sport and leisure services from the new year,"" she said.
While some pools have been ""mothballed"", Ms Nickerson said some would ""sadly never reopen"".
Swindon's Oasis Leisure Centre is one victim, which will not reopen after its landlord Seven Capital found its operation was ""not viable"".
A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said it had announced Â£100m of funding to support local authority leisure centres, as well as Â£7.2bn to councils to help with the impacts of coronavirus."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German DW public radio brings us a report on the latest developments concerning the Prokon Holding GmbH & Co. Verwaltungs-KG wind-park investment debacle.
Image: Prokon
The Itzehoe, Germany based Prokon was founded in 1995 and specialized in the planning, financing and construction of onshore wind-parks in Germany, Poland and Finland. Prokon’s business model had come under scrutiny several times in the past, with some even warning that it resembled a Ponzi scheme. Instead of securing financing from banks and lending institutions, the company attracted capital from private persons, enticing them with promises of high rates of return and a contribution to protecting the climate. Early on many politicians praised the model.
Since it was founded in 1995, the company raised 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) by “advertising directly to the public, touting profit participation rights and promises of superb annual returns” to potential private investors. In total 75,000 investors took up the offer. But as time went on critics began to accuse the company of using fresh money coming from new investors to pay the returns for the older investors. They warned that it was only a question of time before the scheme would collapse.
The critics were right: On January 22, 2014, the company declared insolvency. Prokon’s pony-tailed managing director Carsten Rodbertus, however, insisted that the company was still “essentially healthy”, and then blamed the investors for the debacle because they demanded the high returns that had been promised, or a refund of their principle, Spiegel wrote.
Spiegel also wrote that the woes were not only unique to Prokon, but to many windpark developers all over Germany. “In courts around the country, complaints are mounting from wind park investors who haven’t received a dividend disbursement in years or whose parks went belly up. Consumer protection activists are complaining that many projects are poorly structured and lack transparency.”
Meanwhile yesterday a number of investors gathered to vote on how the insolvent Prokon company would proceed in order to settle the 391 million euros ($542 million) in outstanding investor claims. They voted to sell off some of Prokon’s assets in a desperate attempt to “recoup at least some of their original investment.”
The Prokon debacle has even led the German government to introduce new rules to regulate how financial products may be advertised to retail investors. However, for the 75,000 Prokon investors, the new rules will come too late.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"Sana Mustafa considers herself “the privileged one” in the family. A    Syrian refugee who made it to the United States, she has a college degree and an apartment in a quiet,   village in the Hudson Valley. She speaks out, freely and without fear, about the rights of refugees like herself. “But I feel so much guilt,” she said. “My life is moving forward. Their life has been put on hold. ” She means her mother and younger sister, Ghena. They live as refugees in a border town in Turkey, fearful of saying too much. Ms. Mustafa’s father was picked up by the Syrian authorities nearly four years ago and hasn’t been heard from since. Her older sister, Wafa, fled to Germany. President Trump’s executive order freezing refugee resettlement also froze her family’s hopes of living together in the United States. The ensuing legal challenges to the order bring little clarity. About 2, 000 refugees are expected to come into the country over a   period that was to start on Monday. But there are thousands more waiting in line overseas to join family members who are already here, like Ms. Mustafa. These families remain suspended in a state of uncertainty  —   and those who were able to get out say they feel a gnawing sense of guilt. In Knoxville, Tenn. an Iraqi woman who arrived five months ago has no explanation to offer her    twin daughters, who are stranded back home. They cry every time she calls. In Clarkston, Ga. a Somali mother fears for her daughter, 20, who was supposed to come on Feb. 6, but remains in a refugee camp in Kenya. The family had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed their home and raped and killed another daughter. That memory only makes things worse. “I am unable to sleep or eat,” the mother, Habibo Abdikadir Mohamed, 38, said through an interpreter this past week. “I’m not sure she will be safe. I’ve already lost one daughter. I’m worried I will lose another. ” Exactly how many families are divided like these is not known. A United States government lawyer said Friday that 100, 000 visas had been revoked, while the State Department said the number was closer to 60, 000. The rules are changing so fast, it’s impossible to predict the fate of relatives left behind. On Jan. 27, Mr. Trump signed the order suspending the resettlement of refugees from any country for four months, adding that Syrians seeking asylum would be barred indefinitely. Syrians and nationals from six other   countries, including Iraq and Somalia, would be unable to visit even if they had valid visas. Then, federal judges quashed the ban, at least temporarily. The State Department said it would allow refugees who had already been approved to fly to the United States, until Feb. 17. There were nearly 20, 000 people in that category  —   vetted and screened by multiple government agencies  —   according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency that arranged travel for the refugees. It was scrambling to get about 10 percent of them on planes to the United States in the next 10 days. That didn’t bring much comfort to Meathaq Alaunaibi of Iraq. Her husband worked for 10 years as a translator for the United States Agency for International Development in Baghdad. Their home was shelled in 2006, an attack that she believes was done by militants because of his work with American officials. Her husband’s hand was burned by a car bomb in 2014. Still, it took four years for their visa application to be approved, and last summer, the couple, their    daughter and their    son landed in Knoxville. But there was a new wrinkle. Because the process took so long, their twin daughters, Aisha and Fatima, had just turned 18. They were told that they would have to be screened anew. One is in medical school in Baghdad the other is in dentistry school in Kirkuk. Ms. Alaunaibi calls them every day, even if only to tell them to wait. “They just cry. ‘Why this happened to us? We love the U. S. A. We want to live in the U. S. A. ,’” Ms. Alaunaibi, 45, said of their response. “You know, they are young, they are ambitious, they are smart and responsible. So this is a shock to them. ” Ms. Mohamed, the Somali mother in Clarkston, was waiting anxiously to hear whether her eldest daughter would be among those who could come. Ms. Mohamed’s family arrived in Georgia on Jan. 18, after 10 years in a refugee camp in Kenya. She had fled Somalia after gunmen stormed her home and raped one of her daughters in front of her. Ms. Mohamed’s sister and    were killed, too, so she took in her sister’s two children, in addition to her own seven. The last of the family, Batulo Abdalla Ramadhan, 20, was scheduled to leave Kenya on Monday. But then came the ban last month. Her travel was canceled, she called to tell her parents. They could hear the grief in her voice. “She’s always asking us, ‘What do I do? ’” said Ms. Mohamed’s husband, Abdalla Ramadhan Munye. “She feels hurt that we left her behind. Only thing we can do is to listen to her and feel her pain. ” Mr. Munye said he wanted to deliver a message to the first lady, Melania Trump. “As a mother,” he said, “she knows how difficult it would be to be separated from a child. ” Sana Mustafa from Syria said her parents had encouraged her and her sister to get out of the country as soon as they could after the Syrian civil war began. Ms. Mustafa received a   fellowship funded by the State Department to visit Washington in the summer of 2013. “I applied, out of the blue, online, in the middle of the war,” she said. “My dad said, ‘Go. ’” That was one of her last conversations with him. A businessman known for his opposition to President Bashar  ’s government, her father was picked up in July 2013, while Ms. Mustafa was in Washington. Her plans changed immediately. There was no chance of going back to Syria. She slept on the sofas of strangers who took her in. She applied for political asylum in the United States, and quickly got it. To make ends meet, she worked as a hostess at a restaurant, then as a   babysitter. Through friends of friends, she landed a full scholarship at Bard College in upstate New York. She graduated last year. Her mother, Lamia Zreik, has not been as lucky. She fled with her other two daughters, Wafa and Ghena, after her husband was detained in 2013. They went to Gaziantep, Turkey  —   the border town now home to hundreds of thousands of Syrians  —   and in 2014, hoping to join Sana, applied for resettlement to the United States. They were interviewed four times  —   by United Nations officials, then by American officials. One year passed, then two. When Wafa, who had been supporting the family, got a chance to go to Germany, Ms. Zreik told her that she couldn’t possibly pass it up. “We had two options  —   either she stays or I work,” Ms. Zreik said by telephone from Gaziantep, where she works with Syrian children orphaned by the war. “And the first wasn’t really an option. ” In early January, the first bad news came: an email informing Ms. Zreik that she and her daughter would have to undergo more security screenings. Ms. Mustafa was visiting Gaziantep at the time. “Three years wasn’t enough for screening?” she said. “I was very devastated. I was actually very angry. ” For a while, neither of them told Ghena, 16, the bad news. Then came the executive order. Ms. Mustafa said Ghena had taken it the hardest. “She was very sad,” she said. “She said: ‘We’re not going anywhere. No one is taking us. ’” The family has applied for resettlement to France and Canada. Wafa, 26 and studying in Berlin, said she could not sponsor them to Germany until she could prove she could support them financially. Wafa’s own good fortune weighs on her. “I’m thinking about this every day,” she said. “I have to find a way to help my mom and my sister. ” For now, there’s no place they can be together. “I can’t express my deep anger,” Ms. Zreik said. “We are a small family. Without my husband, and each girl in a different country, we can’t see each other. ”"

Once again, the taxpayer-funded ABC has proved both that it is irredeemably biased, and that so-called “fact-checkers” are in reality invariably left-wing propaganda.



The ABC and its “fact-checking” unit have teamed up to “fact-check” Scott Morrison’s speech to the UN. Morrison hit back at the UN for banning Australia (along with other nations) from its latest climate gabfest – while handing a platform to mega-polluters like China and India, to demand more and more of our money.



To their obvious chagrin, Morrison was right on every major point. Except the ABC can’t bring themselves to plainly admit as much, so they resort to their usual gambit: fudge and mislead.



Prime Minister Scott Morrison has taken to the international stage to hammer the message that Australia is “taking real action on climate change and we are getting results […]the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution”.



Which is the worst possible heresy, to the far-green-left, anti-Australian ABC.



Here is our take on some of the key claims made by Mr Morrison in his speech.



 **“Australia is taking real action on climate change and we are getting results.”**



[…]As Fact Check has previously noted, the Coalition’s “Direct Action” emissions reduction fund has played a positive, albeit modest, part in keeping a lid on emissions.



So Morrison is correct.



 **Scott Morrison 1, ABC 0.**



 **“By 2020, Australia will have overachieved on our Kyoto commitments, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 367 million tonnes more than required to meet our 2020 Kyoto target.”**



The [Department of the Environment and Energy] has estimated Australia will have reduced its emissions by some 376 million tonnes more than required over the eight years to 2020, thereby meeting its Kyoto obligations. This is consistent with Mr Morrison’s claim.



But Australia’s success has had little to do with Coalition policies.



 **Morrison never said that it did.** He simply, correctly, stated that Australia is exceeding its Kyoto target.



This is the most common gambit “fact-checkers” use to deceive: taking something their target **didn’t** say, and “fact-checking” that, instead of what they **actually** said.



 **Scott Morrison 2, ABC 0.**



 **“Our latest estimates show both emissions per person and the emissions intensity of the economy are at their lowest levels in 29 years.”**



This is correct. Because Australia’s population has been increasing, emissions per capita have been falling, and are currently at the lowest levels since 1990.



Again, all Morrison said that Australia’s per capita emissions have fallen – which is correct.



In fact, look how the ABC tries to have an each-way bet, while deliberately deceiving its readers.



As experts have previously told Fact Check, what counts as far as the Earth’s atmosphere — and international agreements — are concerned is the total level of emissions […] Moreover, while Australia’s emissions per capita have fallen, they remain among the highest in the world.



So, which matter? Per capita, or total? If it’s total emissions, then why do the ABC and their watermelon chums continually hype Australia’s per capita emissions? Because Australia’s total emissions are **minuscule**. Australia accounts for just over 1% of the world’s emissions. China emits more carbon dioxide in 20 days than Australia does in a year.



 **Scott Morrison 3, ABC 0.**



 **“Australia’s electricity sector is producing less emissions. In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia’s electricity sector were 15.7 per cent lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.”**



This is correct, but it has little to do with the policies of the Morrison Government.



Once again, that is not something that Morrison actually said. Stick to what he said, ABC watermelons, and stop trying to distract attention by attacking things he **didn’t** say.



 **Indeed, the ABC grudgingly concedes that Morrison didn’t actually go far enough in highlighting Australia’s progress:**



Using the raw data […]this was, as Mr Morrison points out, 15.7 per cent lower than the 211.3 million tonnes produced over the year to June 2009.



(If the seasonally adjusted, “weather normalised” data is used, the decline is even bigger).



 **So, it’s game, set and match, with Scott Morrison 4, ABC 0.**



It just kills these taxpayer-funded watermelons to admit that a conservative prime minister is right and that [Australia is doing more for the environment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/) than any number of sour-faced Swedish brats.

Are we running out of resources? That’s been a hotly debated question since the publication of Paul Ehrlich’s _The Population Bomb_ in 1968. The Stanford University biologist warned that population growth would result in the exhaustion of resources and a global catastrophe. University of Maryland economist Julian Simon, in contrast, argued that humans would innovate their way out of resource shortages. He believed that people were the “ultimate resource” that would make other resources more plentiful.



In this paper, we revisit the main points of contention in the debate regarding availability of resources and their relationship with population growth. Using the latest price data for 50 foundational commodities covering energy, food, materials, and metals, we propose a new way of measuring resource availability based on four concepts.



First, the time‐​price of commodities allows us to measure the cost of resources in terms of human labor. We find that, in terms of global average hourly income, commodity prices fell by 64.7 percent between 1980 and 2017. Second, the price elasticity of population (PEP) allows us to measure sensitivity of resource availability to population growth. We find that the time‐​price of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in the world’s population over the same time period. Third, we develop the Simon Abundance Framework, which uses the PEP values to distinguish between different degrees of resource abundance, from decreasing abundance at one end to superabundance at the other end. Considering that the time‐​price of commodities decreased at a faster proportional rate than population increased, we find that humanity is experiencing superabundance. Fourth, we create the Simon Abundance Index, which uses the timeprice of commodities and change in global population to estimate overall resource abundance. We find that the planet’s resources became 379.6 percent more abundant between 1980 and 2017.



On the basis of our analysis of the relationship between resource availability and population growth, we forecast that the time‐​price of commodities could fall by a further 29 percent over the next 37 years. Much will depend on policies and institutions that nations pursue. For the time‐​price of commodities to decline and resource abundance to increase, it is necessary for market incentives and the price mechanism to endure. When prices of commodities temporarily increase, people have an incentive to use resources more efficiently, increase their supply, and develop cheaper substitutes.



Humanity, the latest estimates suggest, is roughly 300,000 years old.1 For the first 99.9 percent of our time on Earth, _Homo sapiens_ lived a short and difficult life that ended, all too often, in violent death. We roamed the world afraid, cold, hungry, and sick. Remedies to ease our suffering were few. In the past 250 years or so, however, human fortunes dramatically improved. An accumulation of incremental technological, scientific, and ideological advances led to the Industrial Revolution, which ushered in an age of abundance.2



To get a sense of how far we have come, consider global life expectancy, which is a good proxy measure for health and nutrition. In 1820, people could expect to live a paltry 29 years. People today can expect to live 72 years—2.5 times longer than they used to.3 Between 1820 and 2010, average global real income per capita rose from $605 to $7,890.4 That’s an implied 12‐​fold increase in the standard of living. The world has also become less violent.5 In the early 1800s, the combined military and civilian death rate from conflicts was about 65 per 100,000 people. By 2000 that rate fell to about 2 per 100,000.6 Those improvements contributed to increasing the human population from 990 million in 1800 to 7.63 billion in 2018.7



Population growth and abundance seem to be connected. The Scottish philosopher Adam Smith noted that division of labor, or separation of the work process into distinct tasks, leads to faster growth. As workers “specialize,” they become more efficient at what they do. Productivity and wealth increase.8 Specialization, however, requires more workers. The population explosion and the globalization of production supplied plenty of those.9 The late University of Maryland economist Julian Simon noted that in addition to more labor, a growing population produces more ideas.10 More ideas lead to more innovations, and more innovations improve productivity.11 Finally, higher productivity translates to better standards of living.



Abundance requires the use of resources. Is that use of resources worth it? It would seem so. Most people prefer wealth to poverty and incur costs in the pursuit of a better life. Can the current state of abundance be sustained and even be improved on? We think it can. In this paper we show that population growth has not led to a shortage of resources. As Simon predicted, humanity has made resources more plentiful through greater efficiency of use, increased supply, and the development of substitutes.



Fifty years ago, Stanford University biology professor Paul R. Ehrlich published a highly influential book, _The Population Bomb_. The book went through a number of editions, sold millions of copies, and was translated into many languages. The early editions included the now‐​infamous statement:



The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.12



Ehrlich believed that population growth and the concomitant rise in consumption would lead to an environmental collapse, exhaustion of natural resources, food shortages, and mass starvation. He claimed that population control—including coerced sterilization and financial penalties for excessive fecundity—and consumption limits in rich countries would be needed to prevent catastrophe.



Simon rejected Ehrlich’s thesis. In his 1981 book _The Ultimate Resource_ , Simon argued that humans were intelligent beings, capable of innovating their way out of shortages through greater efficiency, increased supply, and the development of substitutes. He wrote:



There is no physical or economic reason why human resourcefulness and enterprise cannot forever continue to respond to impending shortages and existing problems with new expedients that, after an adjustment period, leave us better off than before the problem arose.… Adding more people will cause [short‐​run] problems, but at the same time there will be more people to solve these problems and leave us with the bonus of lower costs and less scarcity in the long run.… The ultimate resource is people—skilled, spirited, and hopeful people who will exert their wills and imaginations for their own benefit, and so, inevitably, for the benefit of us all.13



These were, to put it mildly, two very different visions of humanity’s future. Ehrlich’s gloomy view of humanity’s prospects, it should be noted here, was shared by other influential biologists. They included Garrett Hardin of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who developed the “tragedy of the commons” theory, and Jared Diamond of the University of California, Los Angeles, who penned such bestsellers as _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ and _Collapse_.14



Their analyses of human societies, noted Lester R. Brown of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C., were influenced by the notion of “the carrying capacity of natural systems.”15 In the animal world, a sudden increase in the availability of resources, such as grass after unusually plentiful rain, leads to an animal population explosion. The population explosion then leads to the exhaustion of resources. Finally, the exhaustion of resources leads to population collapse. Economists, as Brown explained, tend to be much more sanguine about humanity’s future prospects.16 Unlike other animals, humans have developed sophisticated forms of cooperation that increase their wealth and chances of survival. Consider, for example, trade and exchange. As the British writer Matt Ridley observed:



There is strikingly little use of barter in any other animal species. There is sharing within families, and there is food‐​for‐​sex exchange in many animals including insects and apes, but there are no cases in which one animal gives an unrelated animal one thing in exchange for a different thing.17



Trade is particularly important during famines, such as those feared by Ehrlich and other biologists. A country stricken by drought, for example, can purchase food from abroad. This is not an option available to other animals.



After intellectually sparring with one another in print for most of the 1970s, Simon finally challenged Ehrlich to a wager on resource depletion. Ehrlich would choose a “basket” of raw materials that he expected would become less abundant in the coming years and choose a time period of more than a year, during which those raw materials would become more expensive. At the end of that period, the inflation‐​adjusted price of those materials would be calculated. If the “real” price of the basket was higher at the end of the period than at the beginning, that would indicate the materials had become more precious and Ehrlich would win the wager; if the price was lower, Simon would win. The stakes would be the ultimate price difference of the basket at the beginning and end of the time period.



Ehrlich chose copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. The bet was agreed to on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990, being the payoff date. In spite of a population increase of 873 million over those 10 years, Ehrlich lost the wager. All five commodities that he had selected declined in price by an average of 57.6 percent. Ehrlich mailed Simon a check for $576.07.18



Since the conclusion of the bet, Ehrlich’s supporters have argued that Simon got lucky: had the bet taken place over a different decade, the outcome might have been different.19 The debate continues to this day.20 In 2016, Southern Methodist University economists Michael Cox and Richard Alm revisited the Simon–Ehrlich wager and found that Ehrlich’s metals were 22.4 percent cheaper in 2015 than they had been in 1980.21



In an essay titled, “Onward and Upward! Bet on Capitalism—It Works,” Cox and Alm proposed a new methodology to evaluate Simon’s thesis. “The real price of everything,” as Adam Smith pointed out, “is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.… What is bought with money … is purchased by labour.”22 The cost of human labor, Cox and Alm note, tends to increase faster than inflation. From the perspective of average hourly wages in the United States, therefore, the real price of Ehrlich’s minerals fell by 41.8 percent between 1980 and 2015. According to Cox and Alm, in “work‐​hour terms, Simon wins The Bet [with Ehrlich] in every year from 1980 to 2015.”23



The outcome of the Simon–Ehrlich bet and subsequent developments—instead of a global catastrophe, the world has become unambiguously more prosperous—did not diminish the world’s appetite for apocalyptic predictions. That should not come as a surprise. As Harvard University psychology professor Steven Pinker points out, humanity suffers from a negativity bias, or “vigilance for bad things around us.”24



This bias may well be an innate trait, which came about as a result of natural selection. The Environment of Evolutionary Adeptness—a name that psychologists gave to a period of tens of thousands of years during which human brains developed—was much less hospitable to human beings than is the case today. “Our modern skulls house a stone age mind,” as University of California, Santa Barbara, anthropology professor John Tooby and psychology professor Leda Cosmides put it.25 Consequently, there will always be a market for purveyors of bad news, be they doomsayers who claim that overpopulation will cause mass starvation or scaremongers who claim that we are running out of natural resources.26



Thus, Ehrlich’s message continues to resonate. In 2013, he and his wife, Anne, revisited _The Population Bomb_ in an article titled “Can a Collapse of Global Civilization Be Avoided?” The pair warned that human civilization



is threatened with collapse by an array of environmental problems.… The human predicament is driven by overpopulation, overconsumption of natural resources … and socio‐​economic‐​political arrangements to service _Homo sapiens’_ aggregate consumption.27



In 2017, Ehrlich was invited to address a Vatican workshop on “Biological Extinction.” “You can’t go on growing forever on a finite planet. The biggest problem we face is the continued expansion of the human enterprise,” he said. “Perpetual growth is the creed of a cancer cell.… It’s the aggregate consumption that ruins the environment,” Ehrlich continued.28



Ehrlich was not the first thinker to worry about population growth. Confucius and his Chinese disciples wondered about the size of “optimum population,” thought that government should move people from “overpopulated to under‐​populated areas,” and identified food shortages as a source of population decline.29 The Greek philosopher Aristotle held that an “excessive number of inhabitants would breed poverty and social ills.” To “prevent an excessive population he mentioned child exposure and abortion.”30



Modern discourse concerning the interaction between population growth and resource depletion dates to the British cleric Thomas Malthus, whose immensely influential 1798 _Essay on the Principle of Population_ argued that unchecked population growth would result in widespread famine.31



Nor was Ehrlich alone in generating widespread panic over population growth. Consider, for example, the Club of Rome. Established in the same year that _The Population Bomb_ came out, the club “is an organisation of individuals who share a common concern for the future of humanity and strive to make a difference.… [Its] mission is to promote understanding of the global challenges facing humanity and to propose solutions through scientific analysis, communication and advocacy.”32



The club’s first major publication was its 1972 report _The Limits to Growth_. The report looked at the interplay between industrial development, population growth, malnutrition, the availability of nonrenewable resources, and the quality of the environment. It concluded,



If present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years.… The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity.… Given present resource consumption rates and the projected increase in these rates, the great majority of currently nonrenewable resources will be extremely expensive 100 years from now.33



The Club of Rome has revisited _The Limits to Growth_ on numerous occasions. In 2017, to give just one example, it published a new report titled, _Come On! Capitalism, Short‐​Termism, Population and the Destruction of the Planet_ , which insisted that “the Club of Rome’s warnings published in the book _Limits to Growth_ are still valid” and warned that the “current worldwide trends are not sustainable.”34



It was in this gloomy intellectual environment that Earth Day was born. As the _New York Times_ recalled on April 22, 2014:



When environmentalists proclaimed the first Earth Day, on this date in 1970, the air was filled with doomsday predictions. At the initial rallies to mark the day, people warned of overpopulation, a denuded planet, hundreds of millions of people starving to death, a new Ice Age or the greenhouse effect. Many—though not all, obviously—of those forecasts were off.35



The initial event was the brainchild of American peace activist John McConnell, who “proposed a global holiday to celebrate Earth’s life and beauty” at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization conference in San Francisco in October 1969.36 Like McConnell, we fully support sensible measures to protect the environment and join in celebration of the beauty of our planet. What we object to is the notion that human flourishing and well‐​being of the planet are incompatible.



In this paper, we look at the prices of commodities from a global perspective. Building on Cox and Alm’s methodology, we introduce a concept of “time‐​price,” which is the amount of time that an average human has to work in order to earn enough money to buy a commodity. The time‐​price then allows us to take a new look at Simon’s thesis, which states that population growth will result in “less scarcity in the long run.”37



The Earth is a closed system. One day, we might be able to replenish our resources from outer space by, for example, dragging a mineral‐​rich asteroid down to Earth. In the meantime, we have to make do with the resources we have. But what exactly do we have? We cannot be sure, for the full extent of our resources is not known. Consider the last crisis over the availability of natural resources and note the ingenious ways in which humanity tackled that particular problem.



In September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler and a Japanese coast guard vessel collided in waters disputed by the two countries. The Japanese detained the captain of the Chinese vessel, and China responded by halting all shipments of rare earth minerals to Japan. The latter used the imported metals in a number of high‐​tech industries, including production of magnets and Toyota Priuses. At the time of the embargo, China accounted for 97 percent of the production of these rare earths and a large part of the processing business. Predictably, global panic ensued.



In the United States, where these rare elements are used in defense systems, wind turbines, and electric cars, the great and the good rang the alarm bells. Writing in the _New York Times_ , the Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Krugman opined:



You really have to wonder why nobody raised an alarm while this was happening, if only on national security grounds. But policymakers simply stood by as the U.S. rare earth industry shut down.… The result was a monopoly position exceeding the wildest dreams of Middle Eastern oil‐​fueled tyrants. Couple the rare earth story with China’s behavior on other fronts—the state subsidies that help firms gain key contracts, the pressure on foreign companies to move production to China and, above all, that exchange‐​rate policy—and what you have is a portrait of a rogue economic superpower, unwilling to play by the rules. And the question is what the rest of us are going to do about it.38



In a 2014 Council on Foreign Relations report, Eugene Gholz, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, revisited the crisis and found that the Chinese embargo proved to be a bit of a dud. Some Chinese exporters got around the embargo by using legal loopholes, such as selling rare earths after combining them with other alloys. Others simply smuggled the elements out of China. Some companies found ways to make their products using smaller amounts of the elements, while others “remembered that they did not need the high performance of specialized rare earth[s].… [T]hey were merely using them because, at least until the 2010 episode, they were relatively inexpensive and convenient.”39



Another effect of the embargo was that companies around the world started raising money for new mining projects, ramped up existing plant capacities, and accelerated plans to recycle rare earths. The market response, then, diffused the immediate crisis. Prices of rare earths, which spiked in 2011, came down again.40 In the long run, the future looks brighter still.



In 2018, a team of 21 Japanese scientists discovered a 16‐​million‐​ton patch of mineral‐​rich deep‐​sea mud near Minami‐​Tori Island, which lies 790 miles off the coast of Japan. The patch appears to contain a wealth of rare earth elements, including 780 years’ worth of yttrium, 620 years’ worth of europium, 420 years’ worth of terbium, and 730 years’ worth of dysprosium. This find, the scientists concluded, “has the potential to supply these materials on a semi‐​infinite basis to the world.”41 It turns out that rare earths may not be so “rare” after all.42



Moreover, our resources are not fixed. Freshwater reserves, for example, have been declining for decades, leading many a writer to warn about future water shortages.43 But 71 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, mostly salty sea water. What’s needed in the areas most affected by drought, such as North Africa and the Middle East, is an affordable process of desalination that separates salt particles from water molecules. Israel has pioneered a desalination method that makes freshwater consumed by Israeli households 48 percent cheaper than that consumed by the people of Los Angeles. As Rowan Jacobsen wrote in _Scientific American_ :



Desal [desalinization] works by pushing saltwater into membranes containing microscopic pores. The water gets through, while the larger salt molecules are left behind. But microorganisms in seawater quickly colonize the membranes and block the pores, and controlling them requires periodic costly and chemical‐​intensive cleaning. But [Israeli scientist] Bar‐​Zeev and colleagues developed a chemical‐​free system using porous lava stone to capture the microorganisms before they reach the membranes. It’s just one of many breakthroughs in membrane technology that have made desalination much more efficient. Israel now gets 55 percent of its domestic water from desalination, and that has helped to turn one of the world’s driest countries into the unlikeliest of water giants.44



Similar stories can be told of all kinds of human endeavors. That’s because what matters is not the total number of atoms on Earth, but the infinite number of ways in which those atoms can be combined and recombined. As the Nobel Prize–winning New York University economics professor Paul Romer writes,



Every generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and undesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were discovered. And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding new recipes and ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to be discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding. Possibilities do not add up. They multiply.… To get some sense of how much scope there is for more such discoveries, we can calculate as follows. The periodic table contains about a hundred different types of atoms. If a recipe is simply an indication of whether an element is included or not, there will be 100 × 99 recipes like the one for bronze or steel that involve only two elements. For recipes that can have four elements, there are 100 × 99 × 98 × 97 recipes, which is more [than] 94 million. With up to 5 elements, more than 9 billion. Mathematicians call this increase in the number of combinations “combinatorial explosion.” Once you get to 10 elements, there are more recipes than seconds since the big bang created the universe. As you keep going, it becomes obvious that there have been too few people on earth and too little time since we showed up, for us to have tried more than a minuscule fraction of the all the possibilities.45



Figuring out the availability of resources, therefore, is not about measuring the quantity of resources, as engineers do. It is about looking at the prices of resources, as economists do. In a competitive economy, humanity’s knowledge about the value of something tends to be reflected in its price. As new knowledge emerges, prices change accordingly.



Markets, then, generate nominal or current prices of commodities, and those prices are the best proxies we have for understanding resource availability at any given time. There are a number of organizations that collect commodity prices. In this paper, we rely on data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, D.C. The two institutions track nominal prices of an array of commodities, with some data going as far back as 1960.46



After some consolidation of the available data, a process that we describe at length in Appendix 1, we ended up with a basket of 50 commodities. All the items in the basket are weighted equally (i.e., 2 percent each) and can be divided into five categories. Food and beverages account for 48 percent of the overall composition of the basket, metals account for 20 percent, energy for 12 percent, raw materials for 14 percent, and precious metals for 6 percent (see Figure 1).



 **Figure 1: Commodity weighting and distribution**  




 **Source:** Authors' calculations, based on World Bank and IMF databases.



We started our analysis in 1980 because data for many of the commodities tracked by the World Bank and the IMF do not go back further than that. Coincidentally, 1980 also coincides with the launch date of the Simon–Ehrlich wager.



What did we find? Between 1980 and 2017, the nominal prices of 9 commodities fell, while the nominal prices of 41 commodities increased. The average nominal price of our basket of commodities rose by 62.7 percent (see Appendix 2).



To understand long-term trends in the availability of resources, which is what both Simon and Ehrlich were interested in, one must start by adjusting the nominal prices of commodities for inflation. The value of fiat money tends to decline every year, so it is possible for a commodity to “seem” to become more expensive even though its “real” price has declined or remained the same. To adjust our basket of commodities for inflation, we used the “Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator,” which is published by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis.47



Between 1980 and 2017, the price level rose by 156 percent. Adjusted for inflation, 43 commodities declined in real price, two remained equally valuable, and five increased in real price. On average, the real price of our basket of commodities fell by 36.3 percent between 1980 and 2017 (see Appendix 2).



Income is a key variable in measurement of the availability of resources. When real commodity prices rise faster than real or inflation-adjusted income, the commodities become more expensive relative to income. All else being equal, when a commodity, such as gas, becomes dearer, people have less money left for other purchases, such as clothing. As a consequence, people are left worse off.



Conversely, when real commodity prices rise at a slower rate than real income, the commodities become cheaper relative to income. All else being equal, when a commodity, such as gas, becomes cheaper, people have more money left for other purchases, such as clothing. As a consequence, people are left better off. If real commodity prices fall while real incomes increase, people benefit to an even greater degree.



Thankfully, incomes tend to rise at a faster rate than inflation because humanity tends to become more productive over time. That’s true of our species as a whole (i.e., we are more productive than our Stone Age ancestors) and it’s true for individuals in their prime working age (i.e., up to a certain point, people tend to become more productive with age).



The rise in incomes, however, does not tell us everything we need to know about availability of resources because the average number of hours worked per worker changes over time. If, for example, people’s annual incomes remain the same but they work fewer hours, their hourly incomes actually increase. If people’s annual incomes increase even though they work fewer hours, their hourly incomes are greater still. Looking at annual income divided by annual hours worked, therefore, gives us a more precise hourly income rate.



The World Bank collects gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in current U.S. dollars.48 As was the case when we calculated the real price of commodities, we deflated world average GDP per capita in current U.S. dollars with the GDP deflator. We found that between 1980 and 2017, real average annual per capita income in the world rose from $6,431 to $10,495 (in 2017 U.S. dollars).49 That’s a 63.2 percent increase.



Over the same time period, the population-adjusted average annual hours worked per worker declined from 2,168 hours to 1,964 hours.50 That’s a 9.4 percent reduction.51 In other words, the real average hourly income in the world grew from $2.97 in 1980 to $5.34 in 2017.52 That’s an 80.1 percent increase. It is this average hourly rate that underpins the “time-price of resources” (see below).



Dividing the change in the real price of a commodity by the change in the real hourly rate of income per capita allows us to arrive at the time-price of a commodity, which is time that an average human has to work in order to earn enough money to buy a commodity. According to our methodology, if the real price of a commodity increases by 10 percent but the real hourly income rate increases by 20 percent, the time-price of a commodity falls by 8.3 percent.53



What did we find? As previously shown, the real price of our basket of commodities decreased by an average of 36.3 percent between 1980 and 2017. During the same time period, the global real hourly income rate per capita grew by 80.1 percent. The time-price of our basket of commodities has, therefore, fallen by 64.7 percent (see Figure 2).54



 **Figure 2: Percentage change in nominal, real, and time-price of a basket of commodities, 1980–2017**  




 **Sources:** “Commodity Price Data,” World Bank, http://www.worldbank.org/en/research/commodity-markets; International Monetary Fund, http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/commod/External_Data.xls; “Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator,” FRED Economic Data, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPDEF#0; “GDP per capita (current US$),” World Bank, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD; “Total Economy Database,” The Conference Board, https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/.



A 64.7 percent drop in the time-price of commodities between 1980 and 2017 translates to an annual compounded rate of decline of 2.77 percent. That means that, should the current trend continue, commodities will become 50 percent cheaper every 26 years.



When it comes to the availability of resources, percentage changes are interesting, but multipliers can be even more illuminating. Saying that something has dropped in time-price by 50 percent is the same as saying that a person can now purchase two items for the same amount of time that it used to take to earn the money to purchase just one item. We call that the “time-price multiplier.”55



Before proceeding, note that declining prices result in exponential, not linear, gains. Thus, a 75 percent decline in price allows a person to purchase four items; a 90 percent decline results in 10 items; a 95 percent decline in 20 items; and a 96 percent decline in 25 items. A 1 percentage point change from 95 percent to 96 percent, in other words, enhances the gain by 25 percent.



Now, back to our time-price multiplier. The time it took to earn enough money to buy one unit in our basket of commodities in 1980 bought 2.83 units in 2017.56 Put differently, commodities that took 60 minutes of work to buy in 1980 took only 21 minutes of work to buy in 2017. Thus, whether one looks at percentages or multipliers, it is clear that Simon’s thesis holds. Commodities really did become less costly over time.



In Simon’s telling, commodities grow more plentiful not in spite of population growth, but because of it. With every hungry mouth comes a brain capable of reason and innovation. Was he correct? The _price elasticity of population_ (PEP) can help us answer that question.



In economics, elasticity is a measure of a variable’s sensitivity to a change in another variable. Consider, for example, the relationship between price and demand. If the price of a product increases by 50 percent and the purchases of that product fall by 25 percent, then we can say that for every percentage point increase in the price of a product, the demand for that product decreased by half a percentage point.57



Why is this concept important? If the PEP value ends up being positive, we will be able to infer that time-price of commodities increased in response to population growth. If the PEP value ends up being negative, we will be able to infer that time-price of commodities declined in response to population growth.58



Between 1980 and 2017, the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 64.7 percent. Over the same time period, the world’s population increased from 4.46 billion to 7.55 billion.59 That’s a 69.3 percent increase. The PEP indicates that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in population.60



As noted, people often assume that population growth leads to resource depletion. We found the opposite. Over the past 37 years, every additional human being born on our planet appears to have made resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.61



So far, we have avoided using the term “scarcity” except when quoting from Simon’s works. Simon, however, was responding to Ehrlich, who predicted scarcity of natural resources. In 1974, for example, Ehrlich wrote “that before 1985 mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity in which many things besides energy will be in short supply.”62 In Ehrlich’s telling, scarcity equals depletion of resources. As he noted in 1997:



Since natural resources are finite, increasing consumption obviously must “inevitably lead to depletion and scarcity.” Currently there are very large supplies of many mineral resources, including iron and coal. But when they become “depleted” or “scarce” will depend not simply on how much is in the ground but also on the rate at which they can be produced and the amount societies can afford to pay, in standard economic or environmental terms, for their extraction and use. For most resources, economic and environmental constraints will limit consumption while substantial quantities remain.… For others, however, global “depletion”—that is, decline to a point where worldwide demand can no longer be met economically—is already on the horizon. Petroleum is a textbook example of such a resource.63



In economics, in contrast, scarcity “is a relative rather than an absolute concept—water is scarcer in the desert and less scarce in the rainforest.”64 Economists, Simon included, see resource scarcity as a temporary challenge that can be solved through greater efficiency, increased supply, development of substitutes, and so on.



The relationship between prices and innovation is dynamic. Relative scarcity leads to higher prices, higher prices create incentives for innovations, and innovations lead to abundance. Scarcity gets converted to abundance through the price system. The price system functions as long as the economy is based on property rights, rule of law, and free exchange.



In relatively free economies, resources do not get depleted in the way that Ehrlich feared they would. In fact, resources tend to become more abundant. That is why, in recent years, scholars have started to write about the age of abundance, a state of affairs in which “technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every man, woman, and child on the planet.”65



In this section, we use PEP values to propose four zones of resource abundance. These zones are demarcated by lines, which reflect the magnitude of the change in the time-price of commodities relative to population growth or PEP.66 We call this progression from scarcity to greater abundance the Simon Abundance Framework (see Table 1).



 **Table 1: The Simon Abundance Framework**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.  
 **Note:** The Simon Abundance Framework assumes that population change is always positive.



The Nirvana Line separates accelerating abundance (i.e., time-price decreases as population increases) from superabundance (i.e., time-price decreases at a faster proportional rate than population increases). The Nirvana Line Equation (NLE) specifies the exact amount past which time-price must decline for abundance to increase at a faster rate than population growth.



Note that the relationship between time-price decline and population growth is nonlinear (see Figure 3). For example, if population increases by 50 percent, time-price must decline by 33 percent for abundance to continue to increase at a faster rate than population growth.67



 **Figure 3: Nirvana line**  




 **Source:** Authors’ calculations.  
 **Note:** PEP = price elasticity of population.



As noted, population increased by 69.3 percent between 1980 and 2017. To qualify for superabundance, therefore, the time-price of our basket of commodities has to fall by at least 40 percent.68



Considering that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 64.7 percent, we can conclude that the world is experiencing superabundance. Should the time-price of our basket of commodities fall at a somewhat slower rate than the NLE determines in the future, the economy will revert to accelerating abundance.69



The Simon Abundance Index (SAI) measures the change in abundance of resources over a period of time. The SAI represents the ratio of the change in population over the change in the time-price, times 100. It has a base year of 1980 and a base value of 100. Between 1980 and 2017, resource availability increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.32 percent. That means that the Earth was 379.6 percent more abundant in 2017 than it was in 1980.70 In 2018, the value of the SAI stands at 479.6. Put differently, the Earth was 4.796 times as plentiful last year as it was when Ehrlich and Simon commenced their famous wager (see Figure 4).71



 **Figure 4: Simon Abundance Index 1980–2017**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.



Simon foresaw greater resource abundance and predicted that cheaper commodities would translate into higher living standards.72 Indeed, incomes grew and commodities became cheaper between 1980 and 2017. But Simon also assumed that many people would remain oblivious to the positive changes around them. As he noted in an interview a year before he died, “This is my long-run forecast in brief: The material conditions of life will continue to get better for most people, in most countries, most of the time, indefinitely. . . . I also speculate, however, that many people will continue to _think and say_ that the conditions of life are getting _worse_.”73



Again, Simon was correct. Earlier this year, for example, a survey found that “American high school students are very worried about overpopulation.” The students answered a number of questions, including “How worried are you that an ever-increasing population will continue to use up the Earth’s limited reserves of freshwater, fertile soil, forests and fisheries?” In response to that question, 29 percent of students replied that they were very worried, and 38 percent replied that they were somewhat worried. Only 20 percent were not too worried, while 13 percent expressed no opinion.74 Such views are common.



Consequently, we propose Simon’s Rule, which states that “As population increases, the time-price of most commodities will get cheaper for most people, most of the time. Unfortunately, most people will assume the opposite.”



Our analysis covered 37 years, from 1980 to 2017. Population increased by 69.3 percent from 4.46 billion to 7.55 billion and the time-price of our basket of commodities decreased by 64.7 percent, suggesting that our planet has become 379.6 percent more abundant. According to the United Nations’ medium fertility variant estimates, the world’s population will increase by a further 32 percent over the next 37 years, rising from 7.55 billion in 2017 to 9.97 billion in 2054.75 What should we expect to happen to commodity prices?



We have calculated the PEP values for each year between 1980 and 2017. Our analysis indicates a mean PEP value of -1.530, with a minimum of -16.76 and a maximum of 11.00.76 The range between the two PEP values was 27.76.77 According to our analysis, over the past 37 years humanity experienced decreasing abundance 32 percent of the time and superabundance 54 percent of the time (see Table 2).



 **Table 2: Frequency of PEP values based on the Simon Abundance Framework zones, 1980–2017**  




 **Source:** Authors’ analysis.  
 **Note:** PEP = price elasticity of population.



We expect the annual PEP to be around−0.90 going forward.78 If population increases by 32 percent and the PEP coefficient remains around−0.90, then the time-price of our basket of commodities should decline by around 29 percent. Moreover, our planet will be 83 percent more abundant in 2054 than it was in 2017.



The NLE for a population increase of 32 percent indicates that the time-price of our basket of commodities will have to fall by at least 24 percent. Only then will abundance continue to increase at a faster rate than population growth. Considering that we estimate a further 29 percent decrease in the time-price of our basket of commodities, the world should continue to experience superabundance.



However, we do recognize the large variation in the PEP values. Thus, we expect to see a decreasing abundance indicator around 32.4 percent of the time. Simon, it should be remembered, predicted periods of higher commodity prices. But he expected that higher commodity prices would create incentives for innovation that would, ultimately, lead to greater resource abundance.



In this paper, we have revisited and updated the decades-long debate between Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon. The main point of contention between the biologist and the economist was the effect of population growth on the availability of natural resources. Ehrlich argued that humanity would deplete Earth’s resources, while Simon argued that humanity would make them more plentiful. The famous bet between the two resulted in Simon’s victory, although some researchers subsequently found that the win was partly the result of good luck. The Simon-Ehrlich wager lasted from 1980 to 1990. Our paper, which looked at data between 1980 and 2017, found that the real price of our basket of commodities decreased by 36.3 percent, while the time-price declined by 64.7 percent.



To arrive at the last number, we have developed a new price measure that we call time-price. Unlike resources, which can be made more abundant through greater efficiency, increased supply, and development of substitutes, time is finite. The more time we spend at work, the less time we have for other pursuits such as leisure. Time-price denotes the amount of time that people must spend working to earn enough money to buy something.



Considering that the real average hourly income per capita rose by 80.1 percent, the time it took to earn enough money to buy one unit in our basket of commodities in 1980 bought 2.83 units in 2017. Moreover, the 2.77 percent annual compounded rate of decline in the time-price of commodities suggests that commodities become 50 percent cheaper every 26 years. Finally, our data show that, using the time-price decline measure, Simon would have won his wager with Ehrlich each year between 1980 and 2017.



Furthermore, we have developed the concept of price elasticity of population, which allows us to estimate the effect of population growth on availability of resources. On the basis of a population increase of 69.3 percent and a time-price decline of 64.7 percent, we found that the time-price of our basket of commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every 1 percent increase in population. That means that every additional human being born on our planet seems to be making resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us.



The PEP also allowed us to develop the Simon Abundance Framework, which describes progression from decreasing abundance at the one end to superabundance at the other end. The Nirvana Line Equation allowed us to conclude that humanity is experiencing superabundance with the time-price of commodities decreasing at a faster proportional rate than the population is increasing.



Finally, we have developed the Simon Abundance Index, which measures the overall change in the abundance of resources over a period of time. The 2017 SAI of 479.6 suggests that our planet was 379.6 percent more abundant in resources in 2017 than it was in 1980. Put differently, resources were 4.796 times as plentiful in 2017 as they were in 1980.



While few people would go as far as to compare population growth and the concomitant increase in consumption to “the creed of a cancer cell,” as Ehrlich did, many people continue to feel uneasy about overpopulation and overconsumption. These concerns have deep historical roots and may have been justified at a time when human and animal worlds were more similar than they are today. Back then, a sudden increase in population really could lead to overconsumption of resources, starvation, and death.79



Today’s world, however, is very different from that analyzed by Aristotle or Malthus. As American writer Jonah Goldberg put it in a recent book chronicling human progress, “Almost everything about modernity, progress, and enlightened society emerged in the last 300 years. If the last 200,000 years of humanity were one year, nearly all material progress came in the last 14 hours.”80



It is, in fact, much more difficult to compile a list of measures by which the world is worse off today than it was before science, reason, and humanism made us all healthier, better fed, safer, richer, and even happier.81 We are also much better educated, though old habits, such as our propensity toward pessimism, refuse to go away. Hence Simon’s Rule, which states that “As population increases, the time-price of most commodities will get cheaper for most people, most of the time. Unfortunately, most people will assume the opposite.”



Simon’s revolutionary insights with regard to the mutually beneficial interaction between population growth and availability of natural resources are counterintuitive, but they are real. The world is a closed system in the way that a piano is a closed system. The instrument has only 88 notes, but those notes can be played in a nearly infinite variety of ways. The same applies to our planet. The Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite. What matters, then, is not the physical limits of our planet, but human freedom to experiment and reimagine the use of resources that we have.



To see what has been happening to world commodity prices, we looked at the World Bank’s commodity price data and the IMF primary commodity prices going back to 1980. Most commodities were tracked by both organizations, but a few commodities were tracked by only one or the other organization. The World Bank has been tracking data for a longer period of time and so, when both organizations tracked the same commodity, we relied on the World Bank data as our primary source. Overall, we ended up with 50 items. Forty-three came from the World Bank, and seven came from the IMF.



Our basket of commodities includes gold and silver. That’s not something that Simon would have been comfortable with. Simon was concerned with commodities that are used or consumed and for which relative scarcity is a concern. His analysis did not apply to commodities that moonlight as stores of value. One of us addressed that problem in a previous publication:



In addition to their commercial uses, such as serving as conductors of electricity in switches and cell phones, gold and silver are also stores of value or assets that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time. Historically, people of all income groups used gold and silver to hide their wealth from rapacious government officials and in the time of war. More recently, both metals rose in price during the inflationary 1970s, when many of the world’s most important currencies, including the U.S. dollar, were rapidly losing their value because of monetary mismanagement. They spiked again after the outbreak of the Great Recession and the subsequent uncertainty about the soundness of the financial system.83



In the end, we have decided to keep gold and silver in our basket of commodities for the following reasons. First, prices of many commodities, not just gold and silver, do not perfectly reflect global supply and demand. “For many decades, the oil market was partly shielded from competitive forces by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a cartel of oil-producing countries. The OPEC nations frequently colluded to restrict production of oil in order to keep its price artificially high. The extent to which OPEC was able to achieve its goal in the past is subject to much debate, but many experts have come to believe that OPEC’s ability to affect the future price of oil is in decline.”84 Prices of other commodities, including sugar and corn, may be artificially inflated by tariffs and subsidies.



Second, our aim is to be completely transparent with regard to our methodology and to avoid the charge of cherry-picking. Since gold and silver constitute parts of the World Bank’s database of commodities, we decided to include them. That said, we hope that this section will remind the readers that the prices of gold and silver are subjected to influences that most other commodities are not subject to. Finally, gold and silver together represent a mere 4 percent of the weight in our basket of commodities. Researchers are free to build their own indexes and reduce the weight of gold and silver to zero if they like.

4 These figures are in 1990 U.S. dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). Note that in our analysis we do not use figures adjusted for PPP. That’s because we look at global prices of commodities, which theoretically reflect the influences of all local conditions. A Big Mac costs much less in Ukraine, where labor and other inputs are cheaper, than in Switzerland, where labor and other inputs are more expensive. But the price of imported zinc will be very similar in both countries. For income data, see Jutta Bolt, Marcel Timmer, and Jan Luiten van Zanden, “GDP per Capita since 1820,” in _How Was Life?

5 We do not have a global homicide rate going back to the 1800s, but consider the following examples. In 1800, homicide rates in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany were 8.0, 4.7, and 2.4 per 100,000, respectively. By the early 2000s, those rates fell to 2.30, 0.60 and 0.58, respectively.

9 The Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton argues that population growth preceded the Great Enrichment of the last two centuries because of “the control of disease through public health measures. At first this took the form of improvements in sanitation and in water supplies. Eventually the science caught up with practice and the germ theory of disease was understood and gradually implemented, through more focused, scientifically based measures. These included routine vaccination against a range of diseases and the adoption of good practices of personal and public health based on the germ theory.” See Angus Deaton, _The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality_ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), p. 93.

17 Ridley continues, “I am not talking about swapping favors—any old primate can do that. There is plenty of ‘reciprocity’ in monkeys and apes: you scratch my back and I scratch yours. . . . Such reciprocity is an important human social glue, a source of cooperation and a habit inherited from the animal past that undoubtedly prepared human beings for exchange. But it is not the same thing as exchange. Reciprocity means giving each other the same thing (usually) at different times. Exchange—call it barter or trade if you like—means giving each other different things (usually) at the same time: simultaneously swapping two different objects.” Matt Ridley, _The Rational Optimist_ (New York: HarperCollins, 2010), pp. 56–57.

48 The World Bank’s “GDP per Capita in Current U.S. Dollars” data span the period between 1960 and 2016. We have imputed the 2017 value by computing the average rate of income appreciation between 1960 and 2016, which came to 3 percent. We added 3 percent to the 2016 figure of $10,192.

50 “Total Economy Database: Annual Hours Worked per Worker,” The Conference Board, https://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/.



51 The “Annual Hours Worked per Worker” dataset from The Conference Board covers 70 percent of the world’s population. We consider that to be a sufficient share of the world’s population to imply a global population–adjusted average annual hours worked per worker decline of 9.4 percent.



52 The relevant calculation for 1980 is GDP per capita of $6,431 ÷ 2,168 hours worked = $2.97 income per hour. The relevant calculation for 2017 is GDP per capita of $10,495 ÷ 1,964 hours worked = $5.34 income per hour. (All figures are in 2017 dollars.)



53 The relevant equation here is  
TP = [(1+ percentage change in price) ÷ (1 + the percentage change in income)] − 1  
TP = [1.10 ÷ 1.20] − 1  
TP = 0.917 – 1  
TP = −0.083 or −8.3 percent



54 The relevant equation here is  
TP = [(1+ percentage change in price) ÷ (1 + the percentage change in income)] − 1  
TP = [(1 − 0.363) ÷ (1 + 0.801)] − 1  
TP = [0.637 ÷ 1.801] − 1  
TP = 0.353 − 1   
TP = −0.647 or −64.7 percent



55 The relevant equation here is  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in time-price)  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + (−0.50))  
TPM = 1 ÷ 0.5  
TPM = 2



56 The relevant equation here is  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + change in time-price)  
TPM = 1 ÷ (1 + (−0.647))  
TPM = 1 ÷ 0.353  
TPM = 2.83



57 Price elasticity of a product (P) = percentage change in the quantity of P purchased ÷ percentage change in price of P sold; price elasticity of P = (−25 percent ÷ 50 percent); price elasticity of P = −0.5.



58 The relevant equation here is: PEP = percentage change in time-price ÷ percentage change in population.



59 “World Population Prospects, 2017,” United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/.



60 The relevant equation here is  
PEP = percentage change in time-price ÷ percentage change in population  
PEP = -64.7 ÷ 69.3   
PEP = -0.934



61 Note that price elasticity of population is unlikely to be constant. The nearly direct link between population and time-price generated between 1980 and 2017 might not hold over the course of the next 37 years. For more discussion on this subject, see the “Forecasts” section of this paper.

66 Note that the PEP denominator will always be positive. That’s because we expect population to keep growing for the foreseeable future. The PEP does not deal with scenarios in which population remains constant or is declining. That’s consonant with the Simon–Ehrlich debate, since both scholars were concerned with the effect of population _growth_ on the availability of resources.



67 The relevant equation here is  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in population)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + 0.50)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ 1.5] − 1  
NLE = 0.66 − 1  
NLE = −0.33 or −33 percent



68 The relevant equation here is  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + percentage change in population)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ (1 + 0.693)] − 1  
NLE = [1 ÷ 1.693] − 1  
NLE = 0.59 − 1  
NLE = −0.41 or −41 percent



69 To better understand this section, consider watching this video prepared by Gale Pooley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPWU4YF6RvI&feature=youtu.be.



70 The relevant equation is  
SAI = [(1 + percentage change in population) ÷ (1 + percentage change in time-price)] × 100  
SAI = [(1 + 0.693) ÷ (1 − 0.647)] × 100  
SAI = [1.693 ÷ 0.353] × 100  
SAI = 4.796 × 100  
SAI = 479.6



71 Much of the contemporary discussion in academia and the popular press centers on the subject of income inequality. In this paper, we did not adjust our figures to indicate different resource availability for people of different income levels. That said, it is worth remembering that the Simon Index is composed of basic commodities, not yachts or Lamborghinis. The poor benefit most when basic commodities, including food, fall in price. Hundreds of millions of people, especially those in the developing world whose incomes remain relatively low, are escaping from absolute poverty because time-prices of commodities are getting cheaper. Other researchers might wish to examine spending patterns to determine the welfare implications of the falling time-price of commodities for different income groups.

76 The standard deviation was 5.71 and the standard error was 0.939. Assuming a normal distribution, the chance that the PEP average will exceed 1 (i.e., scarcity) is 2.69 standard deviations away from the mean. The probably of that occurring is 0.00355 percent.



77 Note that the PEP value for 1980–2017, which comes to -0.934, differs somewhat from the yearly average of -1.53. As such, our forecast of -0.90 errs on the side of caution.



78 A potential concern with our forecast is that innovation could, as Paul Romer put it, “peter out.” As humanity develops more ideas, finding enough good new ones to maintain the current level of productivity growth may require increasingly costly investments in human capital. Researchers may have to command a greater body of literature and solve increasingly difficult problems. Under this scenario, the cost of accumulating enough human capital to balance population growth with higher productivity may eventually become prohibitive, the PEP could move toward a positive value, and population growth could indeed presage decreasing abundance. Note that Romer does not endorse the “petering out” argument but merely gives that concept a useful name. Like Romer, we believe that, when it comes to innovation, there are reasons for optimism. As Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler put it in their 2012 book _Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think_ , “the advancement of new, transformational technologies—computational systems, networks and sensors, artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology, bioinformatics, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, human-machine interfaces, and biomedical engineering—will soon enable the vast majority of humanity to experience what only the affluent have access to today.” See Paul Romer, “Endogenous Technological Change,” _Journal of Political Economy_ , 98, no. 5, pt. 2 (1990): S71–S102; and Diamandis and Kotler, _Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think_ , p. 10.

Eli Rabett in his lair, er, lab
People send me stuff.
Here at WUWT, we all tend to laugh at Dr. Joshua Halpern who fancies himself as a rabbit and writes in tongues third person as ‘Eli Rabett‘ about the evils of global warming to show everyone how smart he is, while twitching his nose at everyone else. He’s one of the more colorful characters of the warmist side of the debate who pretty much personifies that clique, though has strong competition from SUNY’s Scott “super” Mandia when it comes to being the most ridiculous of college scientists. Seeing how these folks tend to self-parody, I see that as license to poke a little fun at them. After all, he endorses this as a valid tactic with the “Eli Rabett approach on climate communication with deniers,”.
This episode of government stupidity about needing a rabbit license for a magic show, followed by a “disaster plan” for severe weather that may harm the rabbit, made me think of him, because what else could pop into your mind when you think of such things? Now with extreme weather aka #poisonedweather™ making bigger weather disasters every minute, we all need a disaster plan for props pets. Right?
I’m going to get right to work on one for the most prestigious member of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
I get word that David Burge (Iowahawk) writes on Facebook about a magician that is required to have a “disaster plan” for his rabbit, no this isn’t a joke.
I swear I am not making this up. In the annals of government stupidity, this story may very well be the Mount Everest. Bob McCarty Writes:

My USDA rabbit license requirement has taken another ridiculous twist. I just received an 8 page letter from the USDA, telling me that by July 29 I need to have in place a written disaster plan, detailing all the steps I would take to help get my rabbit through a disaster, such as a tornado, fire, flood, etc. They not only want to know how I will protect my rabbit during a disaster, but also what I will do after the disaster, to make sure my rabbit gets cared for properly.  I am not kidding–before the end of July I need to have this written rabbit disaster plan in place, or I am breaking the law.
Source: http://bobmccarty.com/2013/06/28/usda-tells-magician-to-write-disaster-plan-for-his-rabbit/
It gets even weirder, from the start of the episode with the USDA:
Finally, it was time for the  inspection at the Hahne’s home. Marty decided to ask some questions.
“My friend has a snake,” he said. The inspector quickly told him they don’t regulate snakes.
“No,” Marty said, “I mean he feeds his snake rabbits. He breaks their necks and drops them in the cage for the snake’s food. Does he have to have a permit for that?” Again, she told him there’s no regulation for that.
“So I could break my rabbit’s neck and feed him to my friend’s snake and I wouldn’t need a license?” Marty asked.
“Correct,” she said, “But you need a license to use him in your magic show.”
The obvious question (besides the snake food licensing one) is: does Howard University need a license to keep ‘Eli Rabett’ around for entertainment purposes and does Howard University have a disaster plan to keep Eli Rabett safe in case the university is flooded by accelerating sea level rise or flattened by an errant derecho? Inquiring minds want to know.

It may sound like a very strange paradox, but the best thing about this government sometimes is how inept and incompetent it is. They were labelled as visionary and transformational when they came into power, full of ideas about how they would change the country after ‘nine years of neglect’. Because of their Green arm, they cancelled many of National’s roading projects, wanting instead to focus on rail, cycleways, walkways and public transport in general. It was obvious to everyone except the government that this approach was going to cause massive traffic gridlock, which is indeed what has happened. After all, the ideology does not seem to allow for the fact that, while you are building the rail and cycle systems, people still need to be able to get to work.



NZTA went along with the government’s plans, wanting to develop more rail projects and reduce the number of roading projects. They were all in favour of the government’s plan. Two years later, NZTA find themselves in what would be considered an enviable position, if it were not so common among government departments and agencies; they have money to spend on projects, but no projects to spend money on.



So NZTA, a much-maligned government agency, has decided to spend the money it has been allocated on roads after all. And this does not please Climate Change Minister James Shaw one little bit. 



What is it they say? Oh dear, how sad, never mind.



Climate Change Minister James Shaw says it’s “very annoying” money allocated for Auckland’s light rail project will probably end up being spent on roads.



The Government’s promise of light rail from the [CBD to Mt Roskill](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115885818/nzta-backs-down-from-light-rail-looks-at-spending-millions-elsewhere), expected to cost $463 million, [has been put on hold until at least 2021](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/phil-twyford-defends-rapid-transit-as-nzta-looks-to-pump-millions-into-highways.html) – the original date Labour said it would be completed. 



“It should have moved faster than it was, and I think that the frustrations that our Transport Ministers have had with, you know, agencies and other factors in getting that over the line sooner is pretty evident,” Green Party co-leader Shaw told Newshub Nation on Saturday.



Well James, what can I say? You are part of this government. If the progress of the projects has been too slow, unfortunately, there is no one else to blame. You and your hapless government needed to make sure that all funding, consents, plans and development were fast-tracked (excuse the pun) to get the light rail system up and running as soon as possible. Sadly, much as you would like, you cannot blame National and ‘nine years of neglect’ for this.



NZTA wants nearly three-quarters of the money to now be spent on highways instead. National Party transport spokesperson Chris Bishop said it “can’t happen quickly enough”, saying the decision to allocate money to light rail has seen roading projects around the country stall. 



NZTA can reallocate funding from rapid transit to something else as long as it [doesn’t breach funding limits set out in the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/phil-twyford-defends-rapid-transit-as-nzta-looks-to-pump-millions-into-highways.html).



“Well, it is very annoying, because we think that there is a solution there,” Shaw told Newshub Nation host Simon Shepherd. 



The solution is to spend allocated funds on roading projects that have been delayed because, while everyone is waiting years or decades for the rail projects, people still have to travel to work, school, or wherever. That is what NZTA is doing, and good on them.



He said it shouldn’t dent voters’ confidence in the Government’s ability to deliver better transport solutions for the famously traffic-clogged city.



“We are going to deliver on it. And actually if you look at what we’ve done is we’ve diverted $14.5 billion over the course of the next years into light rail, heavy rail, walking, cycling, public transport and so on.



What an absolute joke. Please tell me what this government has actually done. Yes, it has built just over 200 houses in 2 years, against a promise of 1,000 in the first year and 10,000 every year after that. It has allocated $1.9 billion to mental health, but so far all it has done is to set up an office in Wellington, after 2 years. It has a ‘Cancer Action Plan’, but no drugs. It promised to solve homelessness, but now spends over $3 billion a year on housing assistance, most of which goes on motels. They have proved that they cannot deliver the things they say they will. Everyone knows it.



In the meantime, there is a small glimmer of hope for some of our much-needed roading projects. NZTA is not drinking the government Koolaid. The agency has been criticised for a number of things of late, but kudos to them for this.

"Many of the world’s winter athletes, now preparing for the season’s championship events, are frustrated with the response of sports officials to the Russian doping scandal and are wondering why implicated Russian Olympians still turn up at the starting line. Hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions, threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of Russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last Winter Olympics, in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. Russian athletes implicated in the Sochi cheating have continued to compete, and none have been disqualified by the International Olympic Committee, as officials continue further inquiries of their own. “We will not sacrifice a full and thorough investigation that will be legally scrutinized simply to speed up the process,” Mark Adams, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said Tuesday. Revelations of Russia’s doping schemes have compelled Olympic officials to expand their retesting of summer Olympians  —   which have so far resulted in sanctions against dozens of athletes  —   but their scrutiny has not affected many winter athletes so far. The Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations cited four major competitions that had been moved out of Russia for the   season after an outcry from athletes, including the   skiing World Cup finals and the bobsled and skeleton world championships. Accused Russian athletes have continued to participate in those competitions, the winter sports organization said, because of “the presumption of innocence, the right to be heard and due process. ” Responding to a petition signed by more than 150 athletes, global officials for biathlon will meet in Austria on Wednesday, ahead of that sport’s world championships, to discuss the doping scandal and broader disciplinary policy. Prominent athletes, including the French biathlon champion Martin Fourcade, a winner of two gold medals at Sochi, had threatened to skip the competition unless officials addressed their concerns. The athletes have called for stricter penalties for drug violations  —   including longer bans of up to eight years and higher fines of up to 1 million euros  —   while also asking that officials, in scrutinizing the accused Russian athletes, balance thoroughness with speed in order to preserve the integrity of this year’s competitions. “Given the unprecedented and urgent nature of the current situation,” the athletes wrote, “we do not have time to wait” until 2018, when biathlon’s full leadership is next due to convene formally. The biathlon officials are also expected to vote this week on moving the 2021 world championships out of Russia. The competition was assigned to the nation in the fall, after the International Olympic Committee had expressly directed sports officials not to award new events to Russia in light of the doping scandal. Should the biathlon officials decline to move the event, the World   Agency could impose a penalty, possibly threatening the sport’s place at the 2018 Winter Olympics, in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Russia’s national team itself could face disciplinary action ahead of the 2018 Games, something some antidoping officials have called a parallel punishment for systemic cheating at the last Winter Olympics. As Olympic officials review the evidence delivered late last year by the World   Agency and an independent investigator, the Canadian lawyer Richard H. McLaren, they are considering not just the individual cases across sports but what collective punishment may be warranted in light of the Russian government’s involvement. Much of Mr. McLaren’s evidence was made public on a website, with individual names redacted. The identities of the implicated athletes were shared privately with sports officials, although some sports organizations have called the evidence insufficient. “In some cases, provisional suspensions have had to be lifted and procedures dropped due to a lack of evidence currently provided by WADA to issue sanctions able to stand up to legal challenge,” the winter sports organization said in a statement. WADA, the antidoping regulator, is scheduled to meet with the winter sports organizations this month to discuss the evidence. Meanwhile, athletes are considering the implications of sanctions. Katie Uhlaender, an American skeleton racer who placed fourth in Sochi, has wondered for months if she will inherit an Olympic medal, after learning that the Russian athlete who placed third in that competition, Elena Nikitina, was among those whose urine sample was manipulated. Uhlaender has faced Nikitina in competition several times in the last month alone, after bobsled and skeleton officials lifted a provisional suspension on implicated Russian athletes. Investigations into those cases are continuing, those officials said. “The I. O. C. needs to step up,” Uhlaender said. “The McLaren report seems very clear: There was tampering. All I’m asking for is an even playing field. If you let someone get away with something, why wouldn’t they just continue doing it? Why wouldn’t others do it?” Few Olympic sports have taken such strong action on the issue as track and field, which voted unanimously Monday to keep the ban on Russia in place until the nation demonstrated change and fulfilled specific conditions."
"Iran will bar the United States wrestling team from a major international meet this month in response to President Trump’s order severely limiting travel from several   countries, including Iran. Bahram Qasemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announced the decision Friday morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The agency reported that the decision had been made by “a special committee, which opposed to presence of the team after necessary studies. ” Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans’ participation because of Mr. Trump’s order. “We’re in talks about it right at the moment,” said Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling. “We’re pretty devastated. ” A U. S. A. Wrestling statement, while noting that the group had not received official confirmation of the decision, said: “If these reports are true, U. S. A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about competition and good will through sport, and is no place for politics. ” The event, the Freestyle World Cup, is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in Kermanshah, Iran. Held annually, it pits the best wrestlers in the world in team competition. Last year, the event was held in Los Angeles, and it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018. Iran has won the event five years in a row. Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other’s countries, with few problems, if any. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Iran: 43 of the nation’s 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling. The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games when it was threatened with removal. There is an international wrestling meet scheduled for May in Times Square, an annual contest pitting top Americans against international stars. But it is not clear if Iranians will be granted sports visas to compete. Mr. Trump’s order bars visitors from seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Nenad Lalovic, the president of United World Wrestling, the international federation, said in a statement: “Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran’s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible. ” “United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season, and we’re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future,” it added. Mr. Trump’s order is a complicated issue for the United States Olympic Committee, which calls itself “the steward of the Olympic movement in the United States. ” The organization does not want to antagonize the president, so its response has been relatively muted. The committee is invested in a bid to bring the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, and that bid’s chances have been damaged by the executive order, which alarmed some of the International Olympic Committee members who will select the host city. “We are disappointed for our wrestlers, who have been warmly welcomed by the Iranian public on many occasions,” said Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee. Jordan Burroughs, an American who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and who was to participate in the World Cup, told The Associated Press: “These executive decisions are always so far beyond your reach. You always feel like, ‘Well, the presidency or these strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them, they’ll never affect me.’ This is one of the few times where something so personal has occurred. ” “There is such a common respect for wrestlers in Iran,” Burroughs told NBC. “They love wrestling. They’re huge fans of mine. I’m bummed about that. I really wanted to be part of something great in what I consider a great country. Obviously, my views and our country’s views are different. ” Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. But American wrestling officials had been hopeful that an exception could be made to allow the American athletes to participate."

They might not be practicing the world’s oldest profession, but lawyers have been always with us. In America political losers increasingly go to court, hoping to convince judges to trump the democratic process. The result has been a rise in dubious judge‐​made “rights” which infringe on the basic liberties of the rest of us.



The same trend threatens on the world scene. The latest vehicle for potential litigation is the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST), which the U.N.’s Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea explained “is not… a static instrument, but rather a dynamic and evolving body of law that must be vigorously safeguarded and its implementation aggressively advanced.”



Three decades ago President Ronald Reagan rejected LOST, an omnibus agreement which would have redistributed wealth from Western industrialized democracies to Third World dictatorships. The so‐​called G-77, or developing state lobby, hoped to create a new International Seabed Authority (ISA) to control seabed resources and mulct private mining operations.



Then the larger push for a “New International Economic Order” collapsed as the Soviet Union and its allied “socialist bloc” headed toward history’s trashbin. Even Third World governments came to admit that President Reagan had been right about LOST.



Washington should have pushed to sever the seabed regulations from more broadly supported treaty provisions governing navigation and other issues. However, treaties attract State Department diplomats like flames attract moths. The Bush and Clinton administrations decided to “fix” the seabed provisions by renegotiating LOST. The resulting compromise eliminated some of the convention’s most obnoxious rules but preserved the overall Rube Goldberg structure of organizations, committees, commissions, chambers, and more unchanged.



Worse, the revised text left regulatory landmines buried throughout. For instance, one of LOST’s biggest failings was the mandatory transfer of proprietary technology to Third World states as well as the Enterprise, which was to mine the seabed for the Third World‐​controlled ISA. The LOST “fix” only deleted one of two sections governing technology transfer.



Left intact was the requirement that the Authority “promote and encourage the transfer to developing States of such technology and scientific knowledge.” The Authority and member governments also were directed to “initiate and promote” programs “for the transfer of technology to the Enterprise and to developing states,” including “facilitating the access of the Enterprise and of developing States to the relevant technology.”



The revised text even added a new requirement: “If the Enterprise or developing States are unable to obtain deep seabed mining technology, the Authority may request all or any of the contractors and their respective sponsoring State or States to cooperate with it in facilitating the acquisition of deep seabed mining technology.” The Authority could use this language to recreate the mandatory technology transfer requirement.



Other regulatory ghosts haunt the revised text. The original treaty perversely limited mineral production; ambiguous language in the new version could yield the same outcome, despite claims that the accord now is market‐​friendly. Such controversies could end up in international court.



Although LOST focuses on the high seas, it includes language covering domestic pollution. The provisions are surprisingly expansive, or “stunning in their breadth and depth,” as Steven Groves of the Heritage Foundation observed in a new study. A decade ago Ireland relied on LOST to sue Great Britain over the commissioning of a mixed oxide plant because of the latter’s alleged impact on the Irish Sea. The plant had been approved not only by Britain, but also the European Union (EU). Ireland dropped the suit, but only because the EU sued Ireland for not filing its case in the European Court of Justice.



Many environmentalists believe that LOST could be used against the U.S. in the same way. A few years ago an environmental activist mistakenly sent me an email after our debate on the treaty. He acknowledged that it might be difficult to convince Americans that the treaty would not similarly bind America when the World Wildlife Federation and Citizens for Global Solutions were promoting LOST by claiming that the convention would stop Russia from polluting the Arctic. He worried that this inconsistency suggested that the treaty was in fact “some kind of green Trojan Horse.”



It is. Groves noted that “Some environmental activist groups have already demonstrated a propensity for supporting, participating in, and in some cases actually filing climate change lawsuits against U.S. targets, as well as taking other legal actions relating to the marine environment in U.S. courts and international forums.”



LOST also incorporates the so‐​called “no harm” rule, which obligates countries to regulate activities in order to avoid negatively impacting neighboring states. The duty makes sense as a guiding principle in designing domestic regulations and undertaking specific international obligations. But, warned Groves, approving LOST would transform “a sensible principle to regulate conduct between two neighboring countries into a seemingly unconstrained doctrine to impute global liability for alleged acts of atmospheric pollution.” Unaccountable international legal forums then would enforce the rule.



Worse, the debate over climate change has opened up grand new litigation vistas. And treaty enthusiasts are anxious to take advantage. William C.G. Burns of the Monterey Institute of International Studies exulted that LOST “may prove to be one of the primary battlegrounds for climate change issues in the future.”



He pointed to the Treaty’s expansive definition of marine pollution: “the potential impacts of rising sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in ocean pH as a consequence of rising levels of carbon dioxide in sea water” all could “give rise to actions under the Convention’s marine pollution provisions.” Even if the litigation did not succeed, he suggested that “the specter of litigation may help to deepen the commitment of States” to legislate on the issue.



Two decades ago environmental lawyers Durwood Zaelke and James Cameron wrote about the possibility of low‐​lying islands suing industrialized states over rising sea levels. Unfortunately, the prospect of international lawsuits is more than the gleam of an academic’s eye.



The Pacific island state of Palau announced last September that it would seek a ruling from the International Court of Justice barring nations from allowing emissions from their territory to cause climate change affecting other countries. Palau indicated that it would rely on LOST as well as the Kyoto Protocol. A decade ago Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu, also Pacific islands, threatened to sue under LOST, though as yet have not filed. Groves suggested that mountainous nations could similarly sue over shrinking glaciers. One could imagine other states claiming damages based on drought, desertification, or other alleged consequences of global warming.



The issue of climate change is extraordinarily complex. The best evidence is that the planet is warming, but the role of human activity and impact on the environment are far less certain and remain highly controverted. Nor is it possible to demonstrate causation between any particular emission and any particular consequence. There may be good political reasons to mitigate the distress of island countries, but such matters belong in international negotiations, not international courts.



However, as Groves warned, acceding to the treaty “would expose the U.S. to lawsuits on virtually any maritime activity, such as alleged pollution of the marine environment from a land‐​based source or even through the atmosphere. Regardless of the case’s merits, the U.S. would be forced to defend itself against every such lawsuit at great expense.”



Litigation could occur in several venues: the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International Court of Justice, an arbitral tribunal, and a “special” arbitral tribunal. There would be no appeals and all suffer from political elements which would interfere with the delivery of genuine “justice.” Indeed, noted Groves, the U.S. “has suffered adverse judgments in high‐​profile international lawsuits in the past.”



LOST would reinforce the litigation danger by creating obligations directly enforceable by U.S. courts. Annex III, Article 21(2) of the treaty states that tribunal decisions “shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.” In a 2008 case Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens contrasted another treaty with LOST, which, he wrote, did “incorporate international judgments into international law.” As a result, U.S. judges would become international enforcers.



There is a role for international litigation, but not for resolving important and complicated policy issues. Domestic politics and international diplomacy are messy and imperfect, but remain the proper forums. Ultimately environmental issues are too important to debate without involving those who would do the paying.



Treaty advocates recognize that the American people aren’t likely to favor buying a pig in a poke. So treaty negotiator Bernard Oxman suggested silence. Back in 1996 he admitted that the text “is amply endowed with indeterminate principles, mind‐​numbing cross‐​references, institutional redundancies, exasperating opacity and inelegant drafting.” Thus, he recommended “restraint in speculating on the meaning of the convention.” After all, he added, “it is essential to measure what we say in terms of its effect on the goal. Experienced international lawyers know where many of the sensitive nerve endings of governments are. Where possible, they should try to avoid irritating them.”



What should irritate Americans even more, however, is the knowledge that LOST proponents are attempting to hide their ambitions.



LOST is a complicated issue, far more so than proponents publicly acknowledge. Perhaps the treaty’s most dangerous aspect is creating a “dynamic and evolving body of law.” America already is paying the price for far too much and too expansive litigation domestically. The U.S. Senate should say no to LOST.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCo-author of “The Neglected Sun“/geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning made a presentation at the 7th International Conference for Climate and Energy in Mannheim, Germany, back in April. EIKE has now put it up. The presentation is in German and so I am providing below a round up of the main points made by Lüning.

Lüning starts by reminding the listeners that geology is key to understanding the past, which in turn can help us to better understand the present and provide valuable clues of what to expect in the future.
The German geologist is a specialist in the geology of Africa. The scientitific literature shows that the Sahara was green a mere 6000 years ago, and his slide at the 0:45 mark show remnants of that time.

Remnants of a green Sahara, 6000 years ago.
Back then, in the mid Holocene, it was 1 – 2°C warmer than it is today and the Sahara was teeming with wildlife.
At the 2:20 mark Lüning shows a slide of cave painting, in the middle of the Sahara, depicting wildlife seen at the time:

Cave paintings of wildlife in the middle of the Sahara.
The changes over the Holocener period clearly are greater than what we are seeing today and are due to natural flcutucations, primarily solar activity. Lüning adds at the 3:40 mark:
This is a geological context that unfortunately is lost on many people like physicists who believe their formulae more than they believe the true facts.”
Greenland is cooling
At the 4:10 mark Lüning brings up the Axforf paper of 2013, which shows Greenland was “2 – 3°C warmer 6000 to 4000 years ago than it is today” and that the ice survived.
At the 5:00 mark he presents a 2013 paper by Lecavalier et al showing that Greenland has cooled 2.5°C over the last 8000 years.

Greenland has cooled 2.5°C over the last 8000 years.
On his slide Lüning writes:
Despite the thousands of years of continuous warmth, the dramatic ice collapse never occurred.”
At the 6:00 mark Lüning shows a chart from Bob Carter, also showing nothing unusual is happening, Co2 playing only a minor role.
At the 7:30 mark Lüning brings up the IPCC 1990 millennium temperature chart that distinctly shows a warmer Medieval Warm Period and a little ice age. At the 8:30 various hockey sticks are shown, which Lüning describes as “incorrect”. “Even Michael Mann had to admit that he had exaggerated”.
Climate driven by solar activity
Starting at the 9:45 mark, his charts show that solar activity correlates well with temperature, which Lüning calls “a surprisingly good match”. He then presents the various solar cycles that the sun undergoes, going into the works of Gerard Bond, who made temperature reconstructions using layers of ice-rafted material in the North Atlantic. Lüning calls the synchronicity between solar activity and temperature found by Bond “stunning”. See chart 13:20 mark below)

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Strong correlation between solar activity and temperature.
At around the 14:00 mark Lüning recounts how he naively expected an explanation from Rahmstorf on why Bond’s findings were being ignored. Rahmstorf replied that “Bond’s cycles could not be reproduced by other groups” and that “Bond himself later stopped believing in his cycles” and that “Bond cycles are a scientific dead-end”.
But at the 14:45 mark, Lüning clearly shows this was not true, and presents a 2003 paper by Hu et al, where Bond is one of the co-authors. That paper too also showed a good correlation between solar activity and temperature over the last 12,000 years. Here the theory was enforced, rather than not being reproducible, as Rahmstorf falsely claimed. Another 2005 paper that included Bond as a co-author is shown at the 15:45 mark.
Clear solar signal found worldwide
Lüning then shows other papers showing solar activity driving climate patterns all over the world, in places like Australia, Oman, North Caorlina, China. He sums them up in chart at the 17:04 mark.
IPCC models have no chance of success
Lüning says that there is clearly a solar signal in climate over the millenniums, and therefore says the IPCC models have no chance of ever successfully modeling the climate. He says that the IPCC models have gotten worse, and not better.
Lüning at the 20:00 mark presents evidence showing that the recent warming is due primarily to the extremely high level of solar activity over the 20th century. Even the flowrate of the Parana River in South America is in sync with solar activity (21:45). Even Lake Victoria fluctuates in sync with solar activity (22:30).
Lüning then brings up the solar amplifier and Svensmark’s theory (23:20) and that cloud formation is modulated by cosmic ray intensity, which in turn is modulated by the sun’s magnetic field. Lüning believes such research deserves some funding (applause) and that the sun acting as one of the major climate modulators makes perfect sense.
Warming of last 20 years “statistically insignificant”
At the 28:00 mark he calls the warming of the last 20 years “statistically insignificant” and says it has indeed stagnated no matter which dataset you look at. At the 28:15 mark he shows how the IPCC’s previous prognoses are “all too hot”, see following figure:

Models have all been false.
At the 29:00 mark he calls the recent claims of an unprecedented warning unjustified and shows that similar warming episodes have occurred in the past. Even Phil Jones admits it.
Ocean cycles responsible for the 1980-2000 warming
At the 30:00 mark Lüning says the natural oceanic cycles have been responsible for the recent decadal temperature fluctuations, and at least for half of the most recent 1980 – 2000 warming. The remaining half has to be responsibly assigned to the other factors. At the 31:20 mark, he believes that cooling is ahead for the 20 years:

 Cooling projected for the next 20 years.
Cooling ahead
He thinks it is also possible that the low solar activity will lead to a cooling of one or two tenths of a degree Celsius over the next 5 years, which he says “could be very interesting for the discussion” (32:00). He cites Judith Curry. At the 33:00 mark he cites other papers showing that CO2 climate sensitivity has been overstated and needs to be corrected.
At the 37:30 mark Lüning tells the listeners he expects a huge drop in overall solar activity to take hold in the decades ahead and global temperatures to drop by 0.2°C by 2030 (see following chart).

Lüning believes 0.2°C cooling is possible by 2030.

One of the coolest things to come out of the United Nations climate thingy was a new free trade deal between five small nations. Our media reported the following last week:



New Zealand will lead a five-way trade talks with Norway, Iceland, Costa Rica and Fiji to try to use trade to combat climate change by slashing fossil-fuel subsidies and abolishing tariffs on environmental goods. 



The whole thing is a bit funny as these nations [combined make up 0.31%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions) of the global greenhouse gas emissions. There’s something about the rankings amongst those five nations that made me raise my eyebrows.



We output 0.17% of global greenhouse gases, but Norway only outputs 0.10%. That’s a bit odd. We have a bunch of farting cows and the[ Norwegians produce 2% of the world’s oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production), to the tune of [over $40 billion](https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/economy/governments-revenues/) in annual profits. They’re 15th in total production and 4th per capita.



All of that money goes into a sovereign wealth fund which pays out superannuation for Norway—and it’s [the wealthiest pension fund in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/09/22/norways-sovereign-wealth-fund-hits-1-trillion-infographic/#7049bd9983c9) valued at over one trillion dollars.



With such a fat stack of petrodollars in the bank, **how do they have a lower carbon footprint than ours?**



Here’s the kicker: exporting oil doesn’t count towards your nation’s CO2 polluto-meter, so you can drill and sell as much of it as you like while staying clean and green.



Let’s kill two birds with one stone.



First, ramp up our production of oil, natural gas, and coal to the max.



Second, put all the money into our own sovereign wealth fund that will provide generations of New Zealanders with pensions—all without costing taxpayers a cent.



All that talk about raising the age of retirement is small thinking. The current system enslaves the current generation of workers to pay for the superannuation of the past. A system based on savings is urgently needed, and we have enough buried in the ground to make it happen.



While we’re at it, there’s one other great thing about Norway we could import during these trade talks: whale meat. Yum.

"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The U. S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. Almost 100 U. S. companies  —   including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  —   filed a legal brief arguing that the order is unconstitutional. President Trump’s confrontation with the courts may foreshadow years of legal battles, and in Congress   debates have turned into proxy battles over a combative president. Here’s what to watch for this week. _____ • Mr. Trump, who returned to Washington after military briefings in Florida, has rejected criticism. In a Twitter post, he said polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order were “fake. ” In another, he bristled at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing. But the chaos and shock waves at home and abroad appear to be prompting Mr. Trump and his top staff members to begin rethinking their improvisational approach to governing. _____ • A U. S. task force of influential China specialists, including former government officials and scholars, reports on two years of assessments of one of the world’s most important bilateral relationships. Set up during the Obama administration as relations began turning rocky, the panel will recommend ways to pursue U. S. interests given the current political strains. _____ • Other than a timing error that left the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, briefly hanging outside 10 Downing Street and disagreements over the Iranian nuclear deal and Israel’s advancement of settlements, his meeting with Theresa May was cordial. Mr. Netanyahu was on his way back to Israel when the Knesset passed a provocative law retroactively legalizing Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land  —   a measure almost certain to be nullified by the high court, but one that makes the ascendance of the country’s right wing inescapable. _____ • Remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago. Extremely effective treatments draw on studies and tests by a research center in Dhaka. And a vaccine accepted by the W. H. O. is being stockpiled for epidemics. _____ • In an epic, overtime Super Bowl, the New England Patriots came back from a   deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons,  . We also reviewed Lady Gaga’s halftime performance and the commercials. _____ • Introducing The Daily, your audio news report. Our reporter Michael Barbaro runs down the big stories and the big ideas. Fifteen minutes a day, five days a week. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. • More than 46 billion digital red packets  —   online versions of envelopes of cash  —   were sent on WeChat, the Chinese social media platform, during the Lunar New Year period, China’s   media reported. • President Trump’s  travel ban has disrupted the business of corporate travel to the U. S. “Many groups will just look to move the meeting elsewhere,” one industry leader said. • The new head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has rapidly moved against net neutrality and consumer protections. • Qatar Airways inaugurated the world’s longest scheduled commercial flight, 16 hours and 20 minutes, connecting Doha to Auckland, New Zealand. • U. S. stocks were weaker.

The Berlin International Film Festival opens this week with a tale of survival, that of one of the 20th century’s greatest jazz guitarists: Django Reinhardt. He was born in Belgium in 1910 to a Roma family that earned a living playing music from town to town. Reinhardt started off playing the banjo in Paris dance halls. At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique. He rose to fame in the ’30s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed. Instead, his fame  —   and the popularity of an officially discredited art form  —   may have saved him. “The Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax,” said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer. “Jazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see Jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe. ” Reinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
A hugely positive bit of news to wake up to this morning. The UK has become the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. The government says the Pfizer/BioNTech jab will start being made available across the UK from next week. The UK has already ordered 40m doses - enough to vaccinate 20m people, with two shots each. About 10m doses should be available soon. Experts have drawn up a provisional priority list, targeting people at highest risk. Top are care home residents and staff, followed by people over 80 and other health and social care workers.
Lockdown in England is over, but 99% of the population is waking up to tighter restrictions than before it began. Some freedoms have returned though. Non-essential shops and other businesses such as beauty parlours, hairdressers, and gyms are able to reopen in all areas. Spectators can begin returning to sporting venues in tiers one and two, and swimming pools can reopen - although not all will, we're told. The measures were approved by MPs despite Boris Johnson suffering his biggest rebellion to date - see what our political editor thinks. Tiers will be reviewed in two weeks' time - check what you can do right now and why your area is in the level it is.
The health secretary has announced that relatives of all care home residents in England will be able to visit over the Christmas period if they test negative for Covid-19. He promised more than a million tests would be sent to homes over the next month, along with extra PPE. Vic Rayner, from the National Care Forum, said it was ""a huge step forward"". BBC health editor Hugh Pym says the news will be welcomed by families struggling with separation, but there's a danger of hopes being raised only to be dashed again because not all facilities will be able to meet the demand for a visit in time for Christmas.
Retail discounts in the run-up to Christmas are now commonplace, but lockdown has left stores with an excess of seasonal stock to shift. That means prices are falling \- good news for consumers at least - with the biggest discounts at fashion and DIY stores, according to the British Retail Consortium. Debenhams has launched a huge stock clearance - so big its website has been overwhelmed. The retail sector in general is having a really tough time, and it's often young retail staff who are especially hard-hit - we spoke to some feeling the strain.
As part of our CEO Secrets series, we've been looking at businesses that have launched during this very difficult year. This week, we hear from people whose jobs are under threat in hospitality and have decided to try something new. Bruce Tate was in a bad place after the first lockdown. His business, Need Music, handled live bookings for pubs and weddings, but was forced to close. Now he's transformed his office into a cycling cafe. Read his story and others for a much-needed dose of optimism.

Greenpeace International is calling to make executives liable for funding “climate denialism“.
This would be tantamount to abusing the legal system as a weapon to harass and shut down freedom of science and the fundamental human right of freedom of expression.
Are bloggers next?
The next obvious step would be to go after bloggers for spreading “climate denialism“, as most of them, this blog included, are not funded at all and are running purely voluntarily. All the blogs I know operate independently of any funding activity taken by fossil fuel companies. Greenpeace writes:
Greenpeace International, WWF and the Center for International Environmental Law have written to the executives of large insurance corporations as well as fossil fuel and other carbon major companies [1], seeking clarity on who will pay the bill if such a lawsuit is brought against their directors or officers [2].
Generally, liability policies provide coverage for claims that put individual directors’ and officers’ assets at risk. These liability policies protect individuals who are conducting their business in good faith but are at risk of being held liable for undesirable business occurrences, which may be beyond their control.  However, a serious question is whether these policies would cover a director facing a climate-related claim [3].

The belief that corporate executives are guilty of brewing bad weather events is no different than ancient tribes psychopathologically blaming and sacrificing humans at an alter in a bid to appease angry gods.Today environmentally fanatic activists like those at Greenpeace are calling for the same thing. This gets down to raindancing and weather-brewing. Read on…
Leanne Minshull, Greenpeace International’s Climate and Energy Campaigner, says the cost of climate change is personal. ‘It’s personal to the victims of super typhoon Haiyan who lost family members and homes in the Philippines. It’s personal to farmers in California and Australia whose land is now too dry for farming. It should also be personal for any oil, gas and coal company directors who mislead the public by funding climate denialism and stopping action on climate change. The responsibility – not just the devastating effects – should be personal.'”
If anything, NGOs and Greenpeace need to be held personally accountable for blocking Golden Rice in Asia, a food that could have prevented millions of children from going blind and thousands of dying prematurely from vitamin deficiency.  That we know is absolutely very clear.
Carroll Muffett, President of the Center for International Environmental Law, says from ‘asbestos to tobacco to oil spills, history shows that those who mislead the public, the market or the government about the risks of their products, or the availability of safer alternatives, can face substantial legal liability, both as companies and as individuals. As the impacts of climate denialism and regulatory obstruction become clear, we want to understand how corporations, insurers, and officers and directors are allocating those risks among themselves.  Just as importantly, we ask what steps they’re taking to prevent the misconduct that creates those risks in the first place.'”
Samantha Smith, leader of WWF‘s Global Climate and Energy Initiative, says fossil fuel companies owe it to their shareholders and the public to tell us the truth about the devastating impacts of their activities on our shared climate. ‘Sooner or later, those who hide the facts and oppose policies to fight climate change will be held to account by the courts. By signing this letter, we hope to bring attention to the importance of truthful, transparent and responsible corporate reporting and policy engagement on climate change.”
The responses from the fossil fuel companies and insurers and will be published on the Greenpeace International website.”
The Greenpeace proposal is the latest authoritarian bully-tactic designed to intimidate those who have different scientific opinions, to stamp out scientific dissent, and to force a universal junk-science based green ideology on the rest of the population. Greenpeace is pioneering the newest path to thought totalitarianism.

“A little modesty might suit you better” – Count von Strack, _Amadeus_



I have to admit that it pains me somewhat to write this piece, because I was briefly acquainted with Professor Tim Flannery, many years ago. While he was an affable enough fellow, even then he was given to some rather odd views, for a scientist. For instance, taking James Lovelock’s “Gaia” hypothesis apparently absolutely literally – something Lovelock himself adamantly opposed.



But, in the years since, Flannery’s self-image seems to have oscillated wildly from self-proclaimed omniscient sage to grumpy Jeremiah.



Academic, author and former Australian of the Year Tim Flannery lamented the world’s failure to heed his warnings about climate change.



The dire situation, he concluded, led him “to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure”.



Flannery might have used this confession as an occasion to reflect on his frankly hilarious [record of dud climate predictions](https://www.riteon.org.au/tim-flannery-professor-of-dud-predictions-and-climate-falsehoods/). Unfortunately, self-reflection does not seem to be his strong point. The fellow who rants about “predatory deniers”, but then pontificates that “if you slag off people and degrade their reputations, you ultimately degrade your own,” is clearly short of a mirror or two.



Still, for all his paranoid conspiracy theories about alleged cabals of Murdoch journalists who are out to get him, Flannery might want to take heed of what even his scientific colleagues have been trying to tell him.



“Just because a guy is well known does not mean he knows what he is talking about,” said University of Sydney palaeontologist Dr Stephen Wroe. “I’ve got a fairly cynical view of Tim. He’s an opportunist. He knows climate change is a buzzword, but a few months’ work does not make him an expert” […]



And from archaeologist Jim Allen of La Trobe University: “I wish I could be as sure of anything as Tim is of everything”. Another archaeologist, Dr Judith Field of the University of Sydney: “Tim doesn’t let the facts get in the way of a good story. He does a lot of broadbrush stuff, with broad consequences, and some of it is just plain wrong” […]



[Environmental engineering professor Stewart] Franks remarked “He is perhaps best described as an amateur enthusiast.”



Or, as someone once put it to me somewhat more pithily: “First, Tim talked about stuff I didn’t know about, and he sounded really impressive. Then, he talked about something I do know about, and I realised that he’s just full of shit”.



Like another star eco-activist, Paul Ehrlich, Flannery has become something of a running joke for his dud predictions. Despite all that, he says with a straight face:



Asked at [a] press conference about his credibility, he stated “I’ve been really consistent with what I’ve said, which is that we’ve got a water problem in this country.”



Even more consistent than his wildly wrong predictions is Flannery’s ability to turn on a dime and adamantly deny have ever said what he said. Virginia Trioli is a senior ABC journalist, and certainly no right-wing stooge.



In 2011, ABC journalist Virginia Trioli stated “I’ve sat with Tim Flannery at forums and the like, where he has point-blank said: no, I never said that. And I’ll say: yes you did, here’s the quote. And then he’ll run a gag with the audience, a plea to get them on side, saying it must have been in the News Limited papers. And you’ll get a ha, ha, ha. And I’ll be there going, no, here it is, it’s actually in a Fairfax paper, not that that matters anyway. So this is intriguing to me because he has a little bit of a reputation of saying things and then denying it.”



Flannery not only denies his own words but he completely misrepresents others’.



Flannery […] last week wrote of impending climate doom and mass death, stating “British scientist James Lovelock has predicted a future human population of just a billion people.” As Bolt noted in 2012, that was in 2006, and Lovelock later disavowed his alarmist views, the scientist also criticising Flannery for his.



Lovelock [specifically repudiated Flannery](https://www.climatedepot.com/2012/04/23/alert-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-reverses-himself-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change-so-was-gore-the-problem-is-we-dont-know-what-the-climate-is-doing-we-thought-we-knew-20-years-ago/), alongside Al Gore. Ouch.



Tim, it has to hurt when one of your own heroes gives you a public shellacking, but perhaps you might want to use that as an occasion for some humble self-reflection, instead of just amping up your self-righteous screeching?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIce Core CO2 and Temperature
The “Delay”
By Ed Caryl
There has been some interest in the lag in ice cores between temperature as measured from oxygen isotope differences, and the CO2 content as measured directly in gas bubbles. The literature seems to agree that the lag is something between one millennium and 800 years. As I had downloaded the EPICA Dome C data for both, resolved to 100 years, I decided to play with the numbers.
The first thing discovered is that the CO2 data resolution for times older than 22,000 years was not 100 years, but a variable number much coarser than that, interpolated in 100 year intervals, The original data resolution is up to more than a thousand years for some stretches of time.
The other thing discovered in the charted data are three groupings in time: the ice age time up to 20,000 years ago, the melt interval from 20,000 to 10,000 years BP, and the recent 10,000 years. The following charts show what the whole 100,000 year time interval looks like. The first figure is an XY plot of temperature versus CO2 concentration for the last 100,000 years.

Figure 1a is the CO2 plotted against temperature with no delay. Figure 1b is a plot of best fit for delays between plus 1000 years and negative 2500 years. For best R2 value the delay is 900 years. For highest temperature response versus CO2, the steepest linear trend line, it is at 2200 years.
An 800 to 1000-year value is what most researchers are finding looking at ice core data. Look here, here, and here. But in the current era, the last 50 years, lag times are less than a year. Look here, here, and here.
But notice the grouping in Figure 1a. There seems to be a difference between colder and warmer times, and a large gap where the temperature was increasing rapidly. What do we see when these groups are isolated and measured?

Figure 2a is the CO2 plotted against temperature with no delay for the time period from 100,000 years BP to 20,000 years BP. Figure 2b is a plot of best fit for delays between plus 0 years and negative 2500 years. For best R-square value the delay is 2100 years. The highest temperature versus CO2 response (the steepness of the trend line) is 2200 years.
During the ice age, the data has low resolution leading to low R2 values, but the delay is longer than 900 years. It is now measured at 2100 and 2200 years for the R2 and temperature response values, a much longer delay. For the emergence interval when the ice is melting and temperature and CO2 are rising sharply, and the CO2 data resolution is much higher, we should get a clearer picture of the delay, and indeed we do.

Figures 3a and 3b are of the time period from 20,000 years BP to 10,000 years BP. During this interval the delay is much shorter, the R value much higher, and the delay is about 400 years. It is longer at 1000 years for the maximum temperature change for a CO2 change (the trend slope).
So now that it has warmed up, and again holding a more or less constant temperature and a more or less constant CO2 value, what is the delay during the last 10,000 years?

Figures 4a and 4b show a multiple number of delays, including zero delay, 300 years and 700 years for the last 10,000 years. It looks like multiple delays are happening in this interval.

In Figure 4a, there appear to be two groups of data points, above and below 265 ppm CO2. The dividing point happens to be at 5000 years ago. If we split the data at 5000 years BP, we get these two sets of plots.

Figure 5a and 5b are plots from 10,000 year BP to 5000 years BP. In this period the delay is 700 years and both methods agree.

Figures 6a and 6b are plots from 5000 year BP to the present. The delay is zero but the R2 values are very low. The relationship between temperature and CO2 appears to be very low.
I will summarize with two more plots. Figures 7a and 7b are summaries of the previous plots:

Figure 7a is a plot of delay versus the R2 value, and 7b is the delay versus the average CO2 concentration during each interval.
As the CO2 concentration goes up, the delay, and the R2 value goes down, until at the present time, and indeed for the last 5000 years since the CO2 concentration has reached 265 ppm, there has been no delay.
There are several possible interpretations for these observations.
First, there is a delay dependent on CO2 concentration. The difficulty with this interpretation is that no one has proposed a mechanism for such a delay. Indeed, few have even noticed that the delay changes over time.
The second possibility is that there is no delay, and that what we observe is simply due to gas rising in the firn before it closes off. This has been proposed, here, as at least a partial explanation. But this doesn’t explain the variation in the delay, and certainly does not explain why there is no delay at all for ice less than 5000 years old.
A third explanation might be that the delay is due to the thermohaline oceanic circulation. When the ice age is at maximum, the circulation slows and large temperature fluctuations (see Dansgaard–Oeschger events below) during the ice age get embedded in the circulation, reappearing as large CO2/temperature differences when sea water returns to the surface after one cycle. When it warms up, the circulation speeds up again. When it gets as warm as it is now, the constant ocean surface temperatures completely hide the delay as the temperature differences are lower, and short term temperature versus CO2 solubility in the surface ocean dominates.
A fourth explanation might be that the delay is related to Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) events. These occur at multiples of 1470 years, and a few missing ones in the record would account for the average delay measuring 2200 years with a rather broad peak. The third and fourth explanations might be combined. The equivalent Bond events in the Holocene are of a much lower magnitude, and may not appear in the last 5000 year record.
During the ice ages the atmosphere was much drier than during interglacials. We know this because we know that deserts and grasslands were much larger and rain forests smaller. There is much less evaporation over ice than over open water. The greenhouse effect would be lower due to both CO2 and water vapor reductions. During the Holocene, CO2 increased along with water vapor. The temperature response to both is logarithmic, the same added CO2 and H2O has less and less effect. However, the larger variable is H2O. It can vary from nearly zero over deserts to saturation over tropical seas. Of these two gases, water vapor in all forms is the control on temperature, not CO2. This is why we see temperature driving CO2, and not the other way around.
Nowhere here do we see any indication that CO2 is driving temperature.

"TUNIS  —   Since their revolution in 2011, Tunisians have tussled among themselves to define their new identity after successive dictatorships. Belatedly, they have started reclaiming their history as well. Dictatorships have a way of manipulating historical narratives. So alongside any of the most pressing issues of the day, the past, too, is in play. The struggle to shape the past, and give it new authenticity, can be witnessed all around the Tunisian capital. Last summer, the Tunisian government restored a statue of Habib Bourguiba, the founder and first president of the republic, to its original place on the capital’s main avenue. The famous symbol of Mr. Bourguiba  —   astride his horse, arm aloft rallying Tunisians to independence  —   had been banished to a seaside neighborhood in 1987, after he was ousted by his prime minister, Zine   Ben Ali. (Mr. Ben Ali was himself overthrown decades later during the Arab Spring uprising.) The current president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who served in Mr. Bourguiba’s cabinet, was the main driver behind reinstating the statue, which he said was intended to reinforce his call for national unity and a strong state. Mr. Bourguiba’s statue had replaced a humiliating symbol of colonialism: an image of the colonialist politician Jules Ferry with a Tunisian woman at his feet proffering an olive branch, he reminded Tunisians. “That used to be the symbol of colonialism, and Bourguiba is the symbol of freedom, of independence and of the modern state,” he said at the unveiling. Many Tunisians do indeed respect Mr. Bourguiba as the father of the independent nation, yet he was also a dictator who imprisoned his opponents and clung to power for over 30 years. The young revolutionaries who spearheaded the Arab Spring uprising greeted the return of the statue with a flurry of jokes on social media about the waste of money. Far from cementing his reputation, moving the statue opened a new debate around Mr. Bourguiba’s legacy. “People talk of a ‘new Bourguibism,’ but it does not exist,” Med Dhia Hammami, a journalist and activist, said. “There are no ideas coming out of that. ” With the new freedom gained since their revolution, some of Mr. Bourguiba’s victims are being given a chance to set the record straight at public hearings of the Truth and Dignity Commission. One of them, Hamadi Ghars, 85, a journalist in the independence movement, gave a damning portrayal of Mr. Bourguiba at the commission’s first public hearing. Mr. Ghars described how Mr. Bourguiba had betrayed thousands of his fellow   fighters when he accepted an interim deal with the French government that allowed the colonizers’ security forces to continue controlling the country. “We were happy with independence and were waiting for reconciliation,” Mr. Ghars said. Yet Mr. Bourguiba then ordered them to surrender to the French, who bombed the fighters in the mountains. “They killed hundreds of young Tunisian men,” he recalled. “I don’t doubt that their bodies are still in the mountains and rivers today. ” Mr. Ghars was captured and sentenced by the French to 20 years imprisonment and 10 years hard labor, which he served under Mr. Bourguiba. “They destroyed a dream of unity,” he said. “Usually history is written by the victors, but this is the opposite,” said Adel Maizi, the president for preservation of memory at the commission. “These testimonies will reveal the truth. ” “Dictatorship always tries to keep things secret,” he explained. “These kinds of testimonies are against forgetting. They will preserve memory for the country and serve as a way to guard such things happening in the future. ” Tunisians are discovering other forgotten chapters of their past that the two dictators tried to obscure. Crowds have flocked in recent weeks to an exhibition on the opulent, and at times profligate,   reign of tribal princes when Tunisia was part of the Ottoman Empire. The exhibit is housed in the   Ksar   palace. Once a royal residence, it was used as a barracks and a hospital and has been shuttered since the 1980s, its collection of French paintings and Ottoman magnificence hidden from view. For a year, the Rambourg Foundation has been restoring a part of the palace and its collections to unveil the history of Tunisia between 1830 and 1881, the period when princely rulers known as beys ruled the country before it was colonized by France. Ridha Moumni, a curator of the exhibit, insists it is not political, but a matter of history. Yet he is displaying events that Tunisia’s dictators sought to suppress. “We have a very rich heritage that no one knew about,” Mr. Moumni said. “Our goal was to show that Tunisian modernity did not start with independence or colonization. ” The exhibition offers many Tunisians their first glimpse of the   court through royal portraits and rich costumery. More important, it provides a history lesson on the significant reforms of the era  —   the founding of the army, the drafting of a constitution and development of diplomatic relations  —   that helped forge a nation. Among the original documents on display, one abolished slavery in 1846  —   before the United States did so, Mr. Moumni pointed out. Others include a constitution drafted in 1860 that recognizes the rights of all citizens, including Christian and Jewish minorities, and census registers, in Hebrew and Arabic, belonging to Tunisia’s ancient Jewish community. Students and a university teacher touring the exhibition said it was the first time they had seen images of Tunisian royalty. Another discovery is the diversity of Tunisia’s leaders  —   from the Christian foreign minister, Giuseppe Raffo, to a Circassian general, Kheireddine Pasha, and the former slave Mustapha Khaznadar, who married into the royal family and rose to become the bey himself. One of the most popular displays  —   in the throne room, and beside the very table upon which it was signed  —   is the Treaty of Bardo, under which the beys, facing a crumbling dynasty and mounting debts, surrendered to become a French protectorate. The beys were subsequently blamed for clearing the way for seven decades of French rule and were condemned to obscurity by Mr. Bourguiba after Tunisia’s independence. “He wanted to erase this from the national memory,” Mr. Moumni said."

_Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
__—__   
  
Just five weeks after _Science_ magazine prominently featured a paper proclaiming that the multidecadal slowdown in the rate of the earth’s average temperature rise—aka, the “pause” or “hiatus”—was but a figment of bad data, comes a new paper in _Science_ magazine explaining the physical mechanisms that have led to the slowdown.   
  
Wait, what?   
  
You read it right. What _Science_ laid to rest but a month ago, _Science_ has now resurrected. Science (with a capital “S”), and those dedicated to it, should not be amused.   
  
But such is the nature of the game. _Science_ the magazine is more interested in generating publicity for itself than in best serving Science the field—a point being increasingly raised by prominent scientific figures.   
  
The new paper, whose title even contains the dreaded H-word (“Recent hiatus caused by decadal shift in Indo-Pacific heating”), is authored by Veronica Nieves and colleagues from the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The paper itself is rather technical look at how the hiatus has manifested itself in various compilations of measurements (and models) of the ocean’s temperatures at depth.   




Never once do the authors act as if the hiatus didn’t exist, but rather present data showing how the pause in the rise of the oceans near-surface temperatures came to be. Basically, they identify a broad and shallow patch of the Pacific Ocean as being primarily responsible for slowing the rise in global near-surface temperature, but find that the cooling of that patch during the past decade has been offset by a warming in an adjacent and deeper patch of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They write:   




[T]he decade long hiatus that began in 2003 is the result of a redistribution of heat within the ocean, rather than a change in the net warming rate.”



The authors do not describe how this behavior, either spatially, temporally, or in magnitude, compares with climate model expectations of the behavior, although they do reject a recent prominent finding that claimed there was not a “systematic overestimation of the temperature response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the [climate model] ensemble” after correcting for the recent downturn in solar activity coupled with uptick in low-scale volcanic activity (Huber and Knutti, 2014).   
  
But, the main story here is not the new findings (which will require further analysis to unpack their significance), but that _Science_ magazine is publishing a paper describing physical mechanisms behind the hiatus that was accepted in its final form on June 24th, three weeks after _Science_ ’s paper announcing the hiatus to be a non-event.   
  
The new paper contains a lot of science while the earlier paper rehashed some old findings (published elsewhere) and then spun them to make it seem as if the hiatus didn’t exist.   
  
Which one do you think was published to grab headlines and generate attention?   
  
But, really, what should you expect from a journal whose editor-in-chief, Marcia McNutt, last week wrote in an editorial about climate change titled “The two-degree inferno,” things like “time for debate has ended,” that “action is urgently needed” and this gem directly aimed at those who stand in the way (like trying to publish research findings to the contrary?):   




In Dante's Inferno, he describes the nine circles of Hell, each dedicated to different sorts of sinners, with the outermost being occupied by those who didn't know any better, and the innermost reserved for the most treacherous offenders. I wonder where in the nine circles Dante would place all of us who are borrowing against this Earth in the name of economic growth, accumulating an environmental debt by burning fossil fuels, the consequences of which will be left for our children and grandchildren to bear? Let's act now, to save the next generations from the consequences of the beyond-two-degree inferno.



It is high time for everyone to realize that _Science_ magazine can no longer be considered a science journal, but instead has joined the ranks of advocacy publications, for better or for worse.

Roland Eichhorn of the Bavarian Office of Environment explains how the temperature of the mountain is being monitored. The fear is that global warming will lead to a thawing of the permafrost and lead to dire consequences in the form of crumbling rock and ground instability.
Eight years ago a small diameter, 45-meter long hole was bored through the rock summit to allow precise temperature measurement and future assessment The film reports that permafrost measurements are also being taken at other places, such as inside a tunnel – as shown in the clip. The Environment Office hopes that the recent warming has had little impact on the permafrost. The film tells us the result:
Indeed, there has been no change. “
Eichhorn says that the temperature at the measurement location has remained constant between -1.3°C and -1.9°C. Bavarian public television says:

With current, the TU Munich is measuring the extent of the permafrost here. The results are reassuring. The warmth from outside has not had an impact, at least that of last summer’s.”
But Eichhorn and Bavarian television warn against assuming the situation won’t change, saying permafrost warming could start very quickly and soon. Eichhorn adds that:
Warming is taking place much faster in the Alps than it is in the lowlands. We have here almost double the warming over the last decade. That means that the eternal ice could begin to melt.”
Eichhorn and the Environment Office should not be surprised that the permafrost refuses to warm up, let alone melt. Perhaps they are not looking at the available data properly, or are ignoring it and spreading falsehoods.
Indeed other data show that the Alps over the past 2 decades in general have been COOLING. Recall how German meteorologist Dominik Jung wrote last year that also four other high elevation stations in the Alps had been assessed: Zugspitze in Germany, Schmittenhöhe in Austria, Sonnblick in Austria and Säntis in Switzerland. Result:
They all yielded the same amazing result: Winters in the Alps over the last decades have become significantly colder, the data show.”
No wonder the permafrost in the Alps isn’t melting or even warming.

Climate activist Joe Romm at a 350.org rally in Washington DC (Photo credit: 350.org)
Over at Climate Progress, the alarmist organ of the Center for American Progress, Joe Romm is fond of citing an offhand remark from this WUWT story as “proof” of my alleged evilness.
“Scientists” Pull a Snow Job on Reporters in Teleconference
The offending phrase that gets Romm all riled up?
Forbes supports our position. A number of alarmists have been organized to team up on the comment section to defend the undefensible. Please add your voice of support to shout them down in the comments section.
Problem is, I never wrote that update paragraph at the top of the article, Joe D’Aleo did.
Joe Romm has cited the “shout them down” phrase in his references to WUWT and my name no less than 13 times in his blogs: 
False Balance Lives: In Worst Climate Story Of The Year, PBS Channels Fox News
MIT Climate Scientist’s Wife Threatened in a “Frenzy of Hate” and Cyberbullying Fomented by Deniers
Hot Dog Bites Skeptical Man: Koch-Funded Berkeley Temperature Study Does “Confirm the Reality of Global Warming”
Climate Secret: NSF Quietly Closes Out Inspector General Investigation with Complete Vindication of Michael Mann 
Comment here on comments and the new design
Scientific American & Lemonick pull a Charlie Sheen — or a Richard Muller, which is much the same
Yes, the false accusation that Gore was exaggerating came from none other than Roger Pielke, Jr.
What kind of media analysis could possibly conclude the Washington Post covered climate well in 2009? 
Berkeley temperature team explains attack on its initial findings by WattsUpWithThat was pure fabrication
Bombshell 1: Climate science deniers claim to have full access to Berkeley temperature study work-product — and are now working with the Berkeley team!
Deniers finally concede that “the rate of atmospheric CO2 growth has been increasing.” 
Inhofe, Horner, McIntyre and Watts fabricate another phony “despicable smear” against Michael Mann
Anthony Watts urges WattsUpWithThat readers to disrupt Forbes blog: “shout them down in the comments section”
Last week, I finally had enough of his shenanigans and emailed him, and he made a change to the most recent story for which I thank him, but the other stories remain unchanged. He also suggested in his reply email that I make a note on the blog entry that it is D’Aleo’s words, not mine, and I’ve done that.
Also last week it was revealed that Joe Romm had concerns over accuracy of the blog posts at Skeptical Science: Skeptical Science gets Romm-Bombed
Romm wrote to John Cook, and Cook summarized in their secret offline forum :
“Just got this email from Joe Romm: You must do more post vetting. More errors are creeping into posts and it will start making people like me wary of using them.” – John Cook [Skeptical Science], December 2, 2011
So in that spirit of accuracy, I would think that Joe would want to go back and correct his 12 other mistakes on that “shout them down” phrase he is so fond of using. We’ll see.
But here’s a test to see just how much integrity he has. You see it seems there has in fact been a coordinated effort on the part of Skeptical Science to do exactly what Joe Romm accuses WUWT of doing. Here’s some of that dialog as posted by PopularTechnology.net:
============================================================
“I posted over at Politico just recently. Hey, we can tag team it a bit if you like, use time zone differences.” – Glenn Tamblyn [Skeptical Science], February 10, 2011
“I think this is a highly effective method of dealing with various blogs and online articles where these discussions pop up. Flag them, discuss them and then send in the troops to hammer down what are usually just a couple of very vocal people. It seems like lots of us are doing similar work, cruising comments sections online looking for disinformation to crush. I spend hours every day doing exactly this. If we can coordinate better and grow the “team of crushers” then we could address all the anti-science much more effectively.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“Rob, Your post is music to my ears. I’ve been advocating the need to create a “crusher crew” for quite some time. I was not however able to get much traction on it with fellow environmental activists here in South Carolina or nationally. Like you, I spend (much to my wife’s chagrin) many hours each day posting comments on articles. One of haunts was the USA Today website […] The bottom line, would you be willing to patrol articles posted on the USA Today website?” – John Hartz [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
This started a new forum discussion entitled, “Crusher Crew“.
“Badgersouth and I were just discussing the potential of setting up a coordinated “Crusher Crew” where we could pull our collective time and knowledge together in order to pounce on overly vocal deniers on various comments sections of blogs and news articles.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“May I suggest first on our list as being the *#1 Science Blog* “Watts up with that”? They get a few people come there to engage from time to time but rarely a coordinated effort.” – Robert W. [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
“I think it might be better to start out with smaller fish. Build a community and a team. Find some methods and strategies that work. Then start moving up the denier food chain with our targets set on WUWT. I could see this expanding into a broad team of 100 or more people (outside the scope of this SkS forum of course). […] We just need to raise our collective voices to drown them out. I would venture to guess that most people here know of 4 or 5 regulars on comments sections that would be interested in coordinating their efforts. I know probably 10 or 20 people who would like to help with this.” – Rob Honeycutt [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011
This eco-strike squad was highly endorsed by John Cook,
“The Rapid Response Network would be a good way to coordinate this kind of activity, identifying new articles, logging responses, supporting each other. Can i suggest if a group engage in this, that they use the RRN as beta testers to he’ll me develop and refine the system?” – John Cook [Skeptical Science], February 11, 2011

Skeptical Science hacked, private user details publicly posted online (Skeptical Science, March 25, 2011)
===============================================================
I had to chuckle at this admission:
“May I suggest first on our list as being the *#1 Science Blog* “Watts up with that”? They get a few people come there to engage from time to time but rarely a coordinated effort.”
Even more hilarious, is this comment left by Skeptical Science author and moderator on Romm’s first essay where he bring the “shout them down” issue up:

Rob Honeycutt says:
 March 4, 2011 at 2:50 pm
I think Anthony Watts relishes his position as a climate thug.
Given the evidence cited above for his own behavior, that’s a classic case of projection by Honeycutt if I’ve ever seen one.
So now the integrity test for Joe Romm is: will you condemn Skeptical Science for actual organized behavior of the same kind that you condemn me of from an off-the cuff comment made by a guest blogger?
So, as it turns out Joe D’Aleo was right, there is an organized effort “…to team up on the comment section to defend the undefensible.“. Maybe he didn’t phrase the call to action well, but all D’Aleo was doing is urging people to exercise their right to free speech if they choose to disagree. There’s no organized effort. I’ve received no complaints from Forbes or any other online venue.
We’ll see how Mr. Romm handles this integrity test when it comes to pointing out the “drown them out” calls of his own misbehaving friends. If he has any integrity he’ll condemn the Skeptical Science organized practice in the same way he has condemned WUWT and me for that offhand remark by D’Aleo.
Ball’s in your court Joe.
================================================================
UPDATE: Joe D’Aleo responds in comments:
Joe D’Aleo says:
 October 1, 2012 at 3:34 pm

Guilty as charged. I posted that in frustration after many attempts by me and others to post comments refuting obviously flawed claims on numerous blogs that were blocked by moderators. That site, like WUWT was not restrictive, which I encouraged people to respond to. Obviously if readers did not agree with me, they would not /should not do so.
Many times after failing to have my comments appear on some blogs and sites, I have resorted to sending an email with facts, charts and diagrams to the author to try and educate them. SInce you can’t do that in comments and a picture says a thousand words, it may be more effective, but my guess is that they just discard.
Downside then is my argument is never seen by the knee jerk commenters with their litanys…”obviously shills for big oil”, ” 97% of scientists agree”, “deniers are anti-science” , “it is far worse than we ever thought”, “the climate is nearing the tipping point”, “deniers don’t care about the air and water”……that fill the comment section.
Any comments that get through ignore the facts I present and attack my integrity, reasons for not believing, and intelligence. They go ad hominem.
As more soylent green says so well, since this i not a scientific debate and never was is “shout them” down really inappropriate?
By the way a skeptic was invited to give a talk in New England on natural factors and a professor organized a group to come in and disrupt the talk – not wait for the Q&A session after with tough questions but to try and make it impossible for the speaker to present his case. I experienced that kind of resistance twice in talks in Vermont where a group tried to convince the museum to cancel my talk and the second when a talk at a college was constantly interrupted with challenges ironically to pictures of bad climate sites. The person involved kept insisting these were not real sites. It was in the early days of surfacestations.org and I used stations from Anthony, Roger Pielke Sr. and the late John Daly.

I’ll bet the next AGW claim we’ll see will be “tropical storms last longer”.

NASA Sees Stubborn Nadine Intensify into a Hurricane Again

Infrared data from NASA’s Aqua satellite today, Sept. 28, revealed strong convection and thunderstorms have built up again in Tropical Storm Nadine as it moved over warm waters in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. That convection strengthened Nadine back into a hurricane today. Nadine has lasted over two weeks, but is nowhere near breaking the record for longest-lived tropical cyclone.

NASA’s Aqua satellite passed over long-lived Nadine on Sept. 28 at 0441 UTC (12:41 a.m. EDT) when it was still a tropical storm and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument captured an infrared image of the storm. A large area of strong thunderstorms developed around the center of circulation with very cold cloud top temperatures colder than -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius).
On Sept. 27, when NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite passed overhead, convection was limited, and rainfall was light around the storm. The TRMM rainfall image showed Nadine had light rainfall surrounding most of the center of circulation. The heaviest intensity of about 20 mm/hour (~0.8 inches) appeared to be located just northeast of the center. That has changed 24 hours later as thunderstorms have re-developed and heavier rainfall appeared in a larger area of the storm.
At 11 a.m. on Sept. 28 Hurricane Nadine’s maximum sustained winds had climbed back up to hurricane strength and were near 75 mph (120 kmh). Twenty-four hours before, Nadine’s maximum sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kmh). Nadine is currently located near latitude 29.6 north and longitude 34.7 west, about 730 miles (1,175 km) southwest of the Azores Islands. Nadine is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 kmh) and is expected to turn north-northwest over the next day.
Hurricane Nadine marked its seventeenth day of life today, Sept. 28, and is expected to continue lingering through the weekend of Sept. 29 and 30.
Nadine has a long way to go before breaking the record for longest life of a tropical cyclone. According to NOAA, in the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Ginger lasted 28 days in 1971. The Pacific Ocean holds the record, though as Hurricane/Typhoon John lasted 31 days. John was “born” in the Eastern North Pacific, crossed the International Dateline and moved through the Western North Pacific over 31 days during August and September 1994. Nadine, however, is in the top 50 longest-lasting tropical cyclones in either ocean basin.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp at the skeptical website Science Skeptical here writes about one of the incredible (but very real) absurdities of Germany’s “EEG” renewable energy feed-in act, which forces power companies to buy all green power that gets produced, whether needed or not, and even power that doesn’t get produced.
=====================================
When the wind turbine is idle…
By Rudolf Kipp
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
For some weeks now I have been observing from my window the operation of an Enercon 101 wind turbine. On many Sundays when there is a fair amount of wind its rotor remains idle. Next to it there are smaller 1 MW turbines which continue turning. At first I thought little of this. After all on Sundays not as much electricity gets consumed. Yet, this is true only in an indirect way. Electricity from the wind turbines are usually given the right of way into the power grid before fossil-fuel generated power. That means when the wind turbines are switched off because their power is not needed or the grid is not able to take it in, the wind-park operator gets compensated. Here the amount of compensation is not determined by the actual wind strength prevailing at the time the turbine is idle and the corresponding amount of energy that would have been generated, rather it is determined by the turbine’s rated capacity. According to the German feed-in law, an Enercon 101 turbine with a rated capacity of 3 MW must be compensated 90% should it be ordered to remain idle and not feed-in energy.
That means the turbine I saw standing idle 10 hours on a Sunday was compensated to the tune of 10hrs x 3MW/hr x 90% = 27,000 kWh. At 15 cents per kwh, the turbine operator is entitled to €4050.00…for nothing.
On the other hand if the very same turbine had been allowed to operate under the prevailing moderate wind conditions on that Sunday, thus putting out say 33% of its rated capacity, then it would have fed in 9900 kWh into the grid, meaning the turbine operator would have earned only €1485.00…for 9900 kwh of real electricity.
What a wonderful business you can make with the German feed-in act! Doing nothing gets rewarded to the max, bringing in multiple times more money than if you actually delivered something!
===================================
Just for your information, the average output for a wind turbine in Germany is only about 20% of its rated capacity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust a couple of anecdotes today to illustrate how wacky the climate-change religion is getting.
First is a short blurb appearing at the online Linux Magazine bearing the title: “Mobile phones are climate killers“. This is for real.
Using your mobile phone and sending text messages apparently is contributing to bad weather and the death of the climate. Linux magazine writes:
The greenhouse gases coming from the recharging of mobile phone and tablets – this year already will be 6.4 megatonnes, about half of what is projected for 2019, – is equivalent to the emissions of about 1.1 million cars.”
Linux Magazine cites a study conducted by Juniper Research.
The other sign showing the climate trend is getting increasingly kooky that caught my eye today is a photo posted by Rudolf Kipp at Facebook.

Would you like your wine dry, sweet…or green?
I’m sure glad I drink Scotch instead. And when it comes to wine, I never liked Dornfelder anyhow.
And seeing how masses of people are stupid and gullible enough to accept all the nonsense hook, line and sinker, a little Scotch now and then certainly helps.
And a final word to all the distillers of Scotch out there. I warn you: If I hear or see any of this bio/sustainable madness with regards to the production of your products, then I’ll never buy another bottle from you again. I hope especially you Islay distillers take note.

"**UK regulators have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.**
But while many people want an injection as soon as possible, others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies.
This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment.
Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies.
The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.
As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective too.
That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,0000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech.
In trials, half of the people are given the vaccine and the other half a dummy or placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results have been analysed, to avoid bias.
All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently.
The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine trial was voluntarily put on hold at one stage to investigate why one participant - out of many thousands - had died. It restarted once it was clear it was not related to the vaccine.
Approval will only be given for a vaccine if the government regulator, the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is happy that it's both safe and effective.
The MHRA is part of the Department of Health, and employs more than 1,200 people. Its head is Dr June Raine, who has spent her career working in medicine regulation.
In becoming the first agency in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine, Dr Raine said: ""The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world"".
Checks on the vaccine will continue to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.
If anyone suspects they are suffering a side effect from a vaccination, they can report it to the MHRA.
Independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it first
It has drawn up interim advice on priority groups for the Covid vaccine and how many doses to use.
The JCVI, which has about 20 members who are experts on vaccines, is led by Prof Andrew Pollard, who works at the University of Oxford.
There are lots of different Covid vaccines in development.
Some contain the pandemic virus itself in a weakened form.
The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like Sars-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19.
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines use bits of genetic code to cause an immune response, and are called mRNA vaccines.
These do not alter human cells. They only present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.
Some Covid jabs contain proteins from coronavirus.
Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.
There is no evidence that any of these ingredients cause harm when used in such small amounts.
Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.
Some people do suffer mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.
This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.
Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed.
Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, who advises the MHRA, said it hadn't identified any ""serious adverse reactions"" during the trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
He said: ""Most of the adverse effects were mild and short-lasting, usually lasting for a day or two, similar to the kind of effects you get after any other vaccine"".
He added that the MHRA had a ""vigilant"" strategy to carry on monitoring the safety of the vaccine.
Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation).
Once a coronavirus vaccine is approved, it is likely that people will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past.
That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.
Guidance from Public Health England says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with long Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered.
Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine.
And some vaccines are grown on hen's eggs, or cells from chick embryos.
There are hundreds of Covid vaccines in development. We don't have details on every ingredient yet, but many of the Covid vaccines are expected to be vegetarian or vegan friendly.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.
Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives.
The first doses that become available will probably be offered to people with the highest need - such as the elderly - who could become severely ill.
It is not yet clear how much protection vaccines might give in terms of stopping people from spreading Covid.
If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease."

The world lost a great champion of liberty with the passing of Allan Meltzer on May 8, 2017, at the age of 89. A longtime Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University, Allan was a prodigious worker who wrote hundreds of articles and more than ten books, including his monumental _A History of the Federal Reserve_ and more recently _Why Capitalism?_ The latter provides a strong defense of limited government, the rule of law, private property, and free markets, which he saw as the surest means to increase the wealth of nations.



Allan had a passion for ideas and a desire to influence policy; he sought to make the world a better place by safeguarding economic and personal freedom. He became a major player in the marketplace for ideas—writing, teaching, advising policymakers, serving on editorial boards, cofounding the Shadow Open Market Committee and the Carnegie‐​Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy with his close colleague and lifelong friend Karl Brunner, acting as president of the Mont Pelerin Society founded by F. A. Hayek, serving on the Council of Economic Advisers, chairing the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (also known as the “Meltzer Commission”), and participating in numerous conferences.1 He continued working right up until his death.



I first met Allan in the early 1980s, when he began to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference. His paper “Monetary Reform in an Uncertain Environment” was delivered at the first conference, in January 1983, and published in the _Cato Journal_ later that year; it was reprinted in _The Search for Stable Money_ (University of Chicago Press, 1987), a book Anna J. Schwartz and I coedited.



In that article, Allan examined alternative monetary regimes and their implications for reducing risk and uncertainty. He sought a rules‐​based regime that would minimize uncertainty and best allow markets to flourish. He preferred, at the time, a quantity rule that would have the monetary base grow in line with the growth of real output adjusted for changes in the velocity of base money. Such a rule, he argued, would anchor expectations regarding the path of nominal income and achieve long‐​run price stability. However, the rule had to be credible and be supplemented with a fiscal rule that limited the taxing and spending powers of government. He did not want the Fed to finance government deficits or to allocate credit.



It is important to note that Allan was not opposed to private money. At the 1983 monetary conference, he argued:



Individuals or groups should be permitted to issue and use privately produced money or monies.… The objective of policy rules is to reduce the uncertainty that the community must bear, not to prevent voluntary risk taking [Meltzer 1983: 109].



Allan was open-minded and was willing to change his policy advice based on logic and evidence.



He continued to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference for many years and contributed 15 articles to the _Cato Journal_ (Table 1). Although he was often critical of Fed policy, he thought Paul Volcker was correct in ending double-digit inflation by slowing the growth of money and credit, and that Alan Greenspan was correct in following an implicit monetary rule to prevent wide fluctuations in nominal income during the “Great Moderation.”





Meltzer, however, was highly critical of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy and wrote in the Spring/Summer 2012 _Cato Journal_ :



Overresponse to short‐​run events and neglect of longer‐​term consequences of its actions is one of the main errors that the Federal Reserve makes repeatedly. The current recession offers many examples of actions that some characterize as bold and innovative. I regard many of these actions as inappropriate for an allegedly independent central bank because they involve credit allocation, fill the Fed’s portfolio with an unprecedented volume of long‐​term assets, evade or neglect the dual mandate, distort the credit markets, and initiate other actions that are not the responsibility of a central bank [Meltzer 2012: 255].



He kept up his criticism until the end, writing articles for the Hoover Institution, where he was a Distinguished Senior Fellow,2 with such titles as “Fed Up with the Fed” (February 17, 2016), “Fed Failures” (March 9, 2016), and “Reform the Federal Reserve” (October 12, 2016), all of which appeared in _Defining Ideas_ (Hoover’s online journal). His last article appeared on April 25, 2017, less than two weeks before he died.



The last time I saw Allan was in Zurich, in September 2016, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Karl Brunner’s birth at a conference organized by the Swiss National Bank. Allan discussed Karl’s contributions to monetary theory as well as to political economy in general. In his paper, “Karl Brunner, Scholar: An Appreciation,” he emphasized that Brunner



highlighted information, institutions and uncertainty as well as the importance of microanalysis in macroeconomics. Karl Brunner explained that nominal monetary impulses changed real variables by changing the relative price of assets to output prices. And he concluded that economic fluctuations occurred because of an unstable public sector—especially the monetary sector—that disturbs a more stable private sector, a policy lesson forgotten or never learned by many central banks.3





Those ideas also were central to Allan’s work—both with Karl and independently—and they are evident in his interpretation of Keynes’s monetary theory.



In _Keynes’s Monetary Theory: A Different Interpretation_ , Meltzer (1988) argues that the vast literature on John Maynard Keynes neglected the importance he placed on credible rules, which he thought would reduce uncertainty and improve economic welfare.



In particular, Allan was influenced by Keynes’s classic _A Tract on Monetary Reform_ (1923), which discusses rules for domestic (internal) price stability and for international (external) price stability—that is, exchange rate stability. In thinking about a rule to reduce the variability of unanticipated changes in prices and outputs, Meltzer (1989: 78–81) draws on Keynes’s distinction and his recognition of the benefits of reducing both internal and external instability. The problem, of course, is to choose the appropriate institutional framework. Countries operating _independently_ cannot achieve both internal and external stability, argued Keynes, unless a key country anchors its price level by enforcing a credible rule.



Building upon Keynes’s insights, Meltzer (1989: 78) notes that if each major trading partner makes domestic price stability a priority, then uncertainty about the future path of prices will diminish and exchange rates among the partners will be more stable. To realize both internal and external stability, Meltzer proposes a simple rule: each major country should set “the rate of growth of the monetary base equal to the difference between the moving average of past real output growth and past growth in base velocity” (ibid., p. 83). If each country complies, the rule will reduce the “variability of exchange rates arising from differences in expected rates of inflation.”4



Meltzer’s proposed rule is “forecast free” and adaptable; it is mildly activist but nondiscretionary, similar to Bennett McCallum’s (1984) monetary rule. By choosing to stabilize the _anticipated_ price level rather than the actual price level, monetary authorities will not need “to reverse all changes in the price level,” argues Meltzer (1989: 79). Instead, the actual price level is allowed “to adjust as part of the process by which the economy adjusts real values to unanticipated supply shocks.” In particular, Meltzer’s monetary rule “does not adjust to short-term, transitory changes in level, but it adjusts fully to permanent changes in growth rates of output and intermediation (or other changes in the growth rate of velocity) within the term chosen for the moving averages” (ibid., p. 81).



Under the Fed’s current operating procedure, in which the Fed sets a federal funds rate target range with the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) as its upper limit and the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement rate as its lower limit, Meltzer’s monetary rule could no longer work as he imagined it might.5 Because the IOER rate is higher than comparable market rates, at least some banks now find it worthwhile to accumulate excess reserves instead of trading them for other assets. The economy is, in other words, kept in a purpose-made “liquidity trap,” so that the traditional monetary “transmission mechanism” linking increases in the monetary base to changes in bank lending, overall spending, and inflation, no longer functions as it once did. Instead, barring vast changes in the quantity of base money (“quantitative easing”), to alter its policy stance the Fed has to change its IOER and ON RRP rates, thereby influencing not the supply of but the overall demand for the Fed’s deposit balances.



Before serious consideration can be given to implementing any rules-based monetary regime, the Fed needs to normalize monetary policy by ending interest on excess reserves and shrinking its balance sheet to restore a precrisis fed funds market. Once changes in base money can be effectively transmitted to changes in the money supply and nominal income, Meltzer’s rule would reduce uncertainty and spur investment and growth.



The key point, however, is that Allan wanted to explore alternative monetary rules and select those he thought would work best to reduce the variability of prices and output. That comparative-institutions approach was evident in all his work. He recognized that, ultimately, the choice of a rule would be heavily influenced by the political economy. His careful scholarship was intended to help shape the climate of ideas and public policy in the direction of what Richard Epstein (1995) has called “simple rules for a complex world.”



Although Allan was known primarily for his work on monetary theory and history, he was deeply interested in the role of government in a free society; the relation between institutions, incentives, and behavior; the determinants of economic growth; the theory of public choice; the damaging effects of official foreign aid; and the distribution of income.6 He wrote many articles for the popular press, including the _Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times_ , and _Financial Times_ , and he was always willing to help younger scholars and students understand the complexities of political economy.



Allan Meltzer was a great scholar and teacher, a friend of liberty, a man of integrity who kept his word,7 and a fine human being. He was persistent in his research and his life. Allan taught at Carnegie Mellon for 60 years and was married to his lovely wife Marilyn for 67 years.



When Allan was five years old, he lost his mother and went to live with his grandmother for several years until he moved to Los Angeles where his family ran a business. Reflecting on his early years with his grandmother, Allan said, “Her most important influence on my career and my outlook was her strongly held belief that, in America (and only in America), there were no real limits other than ability to what one could achieve by personal effort” (Meltzer 1990: 22).



In his many accomplishments and honors, Allan certainly realized the American Dream, and had a life well lived.8 He will be sorely missed, but his work will live on.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn ugly pedophilia chapter of Germany’s environmentalist Green Party refused to be forgotten – and will now be dealt with through a hotline for “victims of sexual violence“.
The German Greens have scrambled to keep an embarrassing reality under the carpet of history, away from the public’s view. That notorious chapter is their once strident advocacy for the legalization of pedophilia, see background here.
On Wednesday Germany’s leftist Berlin-based TAZ published an article reporting the German Green Party has, after months of stalling, finally set up an official “telephone hotline for the victims of sexual violence.” The TAZ calls the move “surprising”.
Hat-tip DirkH
What was the extent of pedophile involvement in the Green Party? Spiegel wrote in-depth here (my emphasis):
No political group in Germany promoted the interests of men with pedophile tendencies as staunchly as the environmental party. For a period of time in the mid-1980s, it practically served as the parliamentary arm of the pedophile movement.” […]
When the Green Party was founded in 1980, pedophiles were part of the movement from the start […] were joined by the so-called ‘Urban Indians,’ who advocated the ‘legalization of all affectionate sexual relations between adults and children’.”
These “Urban Indians”, Spiegel wrote, “were often a visible part of Green Party gatherings.”

That dark past obviously has become an unbearable thorn for the Greens in the present. The TAZ writes that for years the top honchos of the environmentalist-pacifist party refused to take the step of setting up a contact-center for victims, preferring to downplaying the whole messy . But, to her credit, current party chief Simone Peter has decided to set up the hotline at Green Party headquarters, following the recommendation of the Green Party working group “AG Rehabilitation” which, according to the TAZ, has been since last December pursing the subject of pedophile involvement within the Greens.
Wikipedia presents a comprehensive overview (in German) of the Green Party’s debate on the topic and provides quotes from prominent Green Party leaders, such as Daniel Cohn-Bendit who in 1982 said on a French Antenne 2 (today, France 2) talkshow “Apostrophes“ on 23 April 1982:
You know, the sexuality of a kid is something absolutely fantastic. […] You know when a little girl of five years starts to undress herself, it’s just great because it is a game, a fantastically erotic game.”
Though some have attempted to downplay the issue as a past, fringe one within the Green Party, Cohn-Bendit himself insisted that the pedophilia rights were “mainstream” in the Green Party.
Keep in mind that for years leading Green figures such as Cohn-Bendit were welcome darlings of the European media. These are people who, as Spiegel wrote, “tolerated people whose agenda had nothing to do with progress and emancipation, but solely with the exploitation of their position of power and trust in relation to minors”
Perhaps Wikipedia editor and UK Green Party member William Connelly could put the German Wikipedia content up in English. Of course who could blame him for deleting it altogether? In the meantime, the ugly history is well-portrayed by Spiegel here.
Whether a hotline (open only 2 hours a week) will be enough to undo the damage caused by the Green Party’s earlier staunch encouragement of the exploitation of small children by fantasy-obsessed men remains highly doubtful.

It has been 18 years since the last round of successful multilateral trade negotiations concluded. The so‐​called Uruguay Round, which produced a number of comprehensive agreements to reduce trade barriers and established the World Trade Organisation as an arbiter of trade disputes, remains the high water mark in the annals of multilateral trade accomplishments.



Despite nearly two decades of trying to build on that success — most prominently through the ill‐​fated Doha Round negotiations — international consensus for new agreements has been elusive. Lack of political will, too many governments with disparate objectives, and mission creep raising national sovereignty concerns have all been cited as reasons for Doha’s demise. Yet, this lack of progress has not impeded trade perceptibly. Indeed, world trade as a share of global GDP increased year‐​over‐​year, in every year over the past decade except 2009.



Give some credit to lagged implementation of Uruguay Round commitments, as well as to an increase in bilateral and regional agreements. But trade negotiations may be less important than once thought.



More of the credit for increased trade flows belongs to unilateral liberalisation of import barriers, the emergence of once sluggish and moribund economies in the developing world, and the ongoing revolutions in communications and transportation, which have inspired disaggregation of production processes and enabled the emergence of a truly global division of labour.



In a global economy increasingly characterised by cross border investment, international collaboration in production and integrated, transnational supply chains, the mercantilist “Us‐​versus‐​Them” zero‐​sum game assumptions at the heart of most governments’ trade negotiating strategies have become outdated to the point of being counterproductive.



It is difficult to imagine how negotiations based on the fallacy that import liberalisation is a grudging concession made to secure better access to export markets can persist very much longer, when a growing number of domestic interests in every country require greater access to imports.



One common explanation for why governments did not descend into a spiral of tit‐​for‐​tat protectionism during the Great Recession, as they did at the outset of the Great Depression, is that multilateral trade rules, which did not exist in the 1930s, prevented a trade war in 2009.



That may carry some weight, but a more plausible explanation is that in 2009 virtually all major trading nations had producers, who rely on access to imported intermediate goods to produce their final products, insisting on openness. In the 1930’s very few such entities existed, as nearly all of the components of a final product were usually made in the same country.



In 2009, when G20 trade and finance ministers were pledging and reassuring each other that they would not turn to protectionism, the Canadian and Mexican governments decided to reduce tariffs on most industrial inputs. Why? Because they recognised that business revenues would suffer on account of contracting global demand, and that dropping tariffs would reduce costs of production and preserving some profit margin.



Imports have always produced the enduring benefits of expanded trade — greater choice, better quality, lower prices and domestic efficiencies inspired by stronger competition. But the trend toward transnational production puts a growing number of producers — not just consumers — on the pro‐​import side of the ledger. And that makes current trade policy formulation particularly anachronistic and untenable.



But for the time being, the common fallacies about imports are reinforced by politicians and media, who depend on sports metaphors to confer meaning and to inspire actions, always with the effect of obscuring the real benefits of trade. Hence, in the United States exports are considered Team USA’s points, imports are the foreign team’s points, the trade account is the scoreboard and the several hundred billion dollar trade deficit means that Americans are losing at trade. And they’re losing — so the story goes — because their trade partners cheat.



President Obama has done little to correct those misperceptions. In fact, he’s fanned the flames, as has Mitt Romney, who promises to crack down on China’s rampant unfairness, which he blames for US job loss, on his first day in office. The president exhorts US exporters to “win the future” or to secure foreign market share before other countries’ exporters get there, as if the size of the pie were fixed.



This encouragement, with its incessant emphasis on exports as the benefits of trade and imports as costs we must minimise, only reinforces the misconception that trade is a zero‐​sum game with distinct winners and losers. But trade is a voluntary transaction that occurs, not between countries but, between individuals or businesses seeking to maximise value. The transaction would not occur if both parties didn’t perceive themselves as being made better off. Yet policy and rhetoric enshrine the myth that the party on the import side is somehow made worse off.



The centrepiece of the Obama administration’s trade policy is the National Export Initiative, with its goal of doubling US exports over five years to reach $3.14 trillion by the end of 2014. The NEI identifies all sorts of levers the US government will pull to assist exporters — systematically rigid enforcement of trade agreements, conclusion of new agreements, tax‐​payer‐​backed export financing, government‐​chaperoned and subsidised marketing trips abroad and more.



But the NEI systemically neglects a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export‐​oriented activities of exporters. Nowhere in the NEI’s 68‐​page plan to double exports is the word “import” mentioned, except with respect to the section that speaks about strengthening the trade remedies laws to better discipline “unfair” imports.



The NEI presumes that US exporters are born as exporters. But before those companies are exporters, they are producers. As producers first, most exporters are consumers of capital equipment, raw materials and other industrial inputs and components.



Many of the inputs consumed by US producers in their operations are imported or the costs of the inputs are affected by the availability and prices of imports. Indeed, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for 58 per cent of the value of all US imports last year. That would suggest that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of US exporters, and not the scourge described in popular rhetoric.



Yet the NEI commits not a single word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs — as the Canadians and Mexicans did for their businesses in 2009. By neglecting these domestic impediments, the administration pretends that the obstacles to US competitiveness and export success are all foreign‐​born.



The reform focus must be broadened to include consideration of the full range of home grown policies — such as taxes, regulations, tariffs and contingent protectionism — that affect US producers and put them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign competitors. And that portends a very different kind of trade policy.



In the 21st century, it is inaccurate to characterise international trade as a competition between “us” and “them”. Because of foreign direct investment, joint ventures and other equity‐​sharing arrangements, quite often “we” are “they” and “they” are “we”.



The largest steel producer in the United States is Mittal, a majority Indian‐​owned company with headquarters in Europe. The largest German steel company, Thyssen‐​Krupp, recently completed a nearly $4 billion investment in Mobile, Alabama to serve, among other markets, the growing number of foreign‐​nameplate automakers producing throughout the southern United States. Nearly 6 million Americans work for foreign‐​owned companies in the United States.



“American” icon General Motors now produces more vehicles in China than it does in the United States. And the multinational production and supply chain through which Apple products famously make their way from drawing boards, laboratories and design centres in the United States to components factories throughout Asia to assembly plants in China and then into the hands of the world’s consumers exposes the banality of national trade accounting, which presumes to confer a “Made in” status on products to facilitate the imposition of import barriers. How absurd.



Current US trade policy, with its tendency toward bestowing favours on chosen exporters and serving as a conduit of corporate welfare and industrial policy, stands in stark contrast to the naturally and rapidly evolving global commercial environment, with its rich soil ready to fertilise competing combinations of labour, physical capital and human talent — tomorrow’s providers of abundance.



Policies that do not try to channel incentives for the benefit of specific groups or specific objectives but instead provide the greatest opportunities for citizens to partake of the opportunities afforded by our increasingly integrated global economy are the ones that will maximize economic growth and national welfare.



Producers operating in the United States, whether they are domestic, foreign or some combination of the two, compete with other producers for US and foreign market share. So do their upstream suppliers and downstream customers. In this competition, policy should be neutral.



Rather than predetermine winners and losers, trade policy should aim to attract human capital and financial investment to the highest value‐​added activities possible. Of course that implies a considerably diminished role for trade policy, which should be focused exclusively on ensuring openness and predictability with respect to import rules and customs procedures. The rest depends on transparent financial regulations, liberal immigration policies, limited frictions in labour, financial and goods markets, and respect for and adherence to the rule of law.



Although trade’s critics speak of a “race to the bottom”, where governments compete for investment by lowering the standards — a concern unsupported by trade and investment flows — it is really more appropriate to speak of a race to the top.



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided, where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate, where the spectre of asset expropriation is negligible, where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape, where the local work force is productive, where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions and so on. Thus, there is a race to the top, as governments compete to secure for their people the highest value‐​added rungs possible on the global supply chain.



This 21st century economic reality demands better than trade policies rooted in 16th century mercantilist dogma. It demands policies that are welcoming of imports and foreign investment, and that minimise regulations or administrative frictions that are based on misconceptions about some vague or ill‐​defined “national interest”.



To nurture the promise of our highly integrated global economy, governments should stop conflating the interests of certain producers with the national interest and commit to policies that reduce frictions throughout the supply chain — from product conception to consumption — as well as in the flow of services, investment and human capital.

UPDATE: graph of damage losses including 2012 posted below. It says all that needs to be said.
This ad is running in rotation at the NYT today, and it needs an application of Dr. Roger Pielke Jr.’s handy bullshit button.


Steve Milloy writes at junkscience.com:
Insurers know that bad weather comes and goes… and after it comes, it’s not likely to come again for a long time… that’s why they’re called “100-year” storms.
Click for the Hartford’s “Weathering the Storm” web site.
There at that website they write:
Superstorm Sandy devastates the east coast with heavy winds and storm surges that flood major cities and shorelines while dumping record snow in West Virginia and knocking out power as far away as Cleveland, OH.
…
Unpredictable weather seems to be the new norm.
I call BS on that last sentence.

Sandy was not only predicted, many meteorologists nailed the path well in advance.  In fact, some have called it ‘Their finest hour’:
From CCM Mike Smith:
Here is the European computer model’s forecast made at 2pm last Wednesday. It shows a hurricane near the coast of New Jersey or DelMarVa yesterday evening. The computer models showed more and more of the details of this ferocious storm as the time grew nearer.

The U.S. models didn’t do well, at first, taking the storm out to sea. But, human forecasters at AccuWeather and elsewhere put their knowledge and experience to work and leaned on the European heavily to get preliminary warnings and preparatory advice 4.5 days in advance. Those forecasts stayed consistent and got more detailed as time passed. By Saturday, we were predicting the flooding of the subway and two airports in NYC.
You’d think The Hartford insurance group would have experts for this and would have looked at the IPCC SREX report. But then again, they may just be out for gouging profiting at the expense of the stupid.
Dr Roger Pielke Jr observes:
===============================================================
The full IPCC Special Report on Extremes is out today, and I have just gone through the sections in Chapter 4 that deal with disasters and climate change. Kudos to the IPCC — they have gotten the issue just about right, where “right” means that the report accurately reflects the academic literature on this topic. Over time good science will win out over the rest — sometimes it just takes a little while.
A few quotable quotes from the report (from Chapter 4):


“There is medium evidence and high agreement that long-term trends in normalized losses have not been attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change”


“The statement about the absence of trends in impacts attributable to natural or anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical and extratropical storms and tornados”


“The absence of an attributable climate change signal in losses also holds for flood losses”


The report even takes care of tying up a loose end that has allowed some commentators to avoid the scientific literature:
“Some authors suggest that a (natural or anthropogenic) climate change signal can be found in the records of disaster losses (e.g., Mills, 2005; Höppe and Grimm, 2009), but their work is in the nature of reviews and commentary rather than empirical research.”
He was prescient with this:
You may find yourself having to use the bullshit button in locations that are supposed to be credible, such as Nature Climate Change and the New York Times.
But, I’ll bet he didn’t think it would be used on advertising.
===============================================================
If I were a Hartford customer, I’d be on the phone with my agent, and not to order additional insurance.
UPDATE: Pielke Jr. adds this. 2012 was no Katrina year.

The graph above shows an updated estimate of the 1900 to 2012 normalized hurricane losses for the United States. The normalization methodology is described in Pielke et al. 2008 (here in PDF) and the data presented in the graph comes from the ICAT Damage Estimator, which extends the analysis of Pielke at al. through 2011.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe green energy orgy in Germany is over. The music has stopped and the wine that once flowed freely has long run out. The green energy whores and pimps can go home.
In a stunning admission by Germany’s Economics Minister and Vice Chancellor to Angela Merkel, Sigmar Gabriel announced in a recent speech that the country’s once highly ballyhooed transformation to renewable energy, the so called Energiewende, a model that has been adopted by a number of countries worldwide, is “on the verge of failure“.

Speaking at an event at SMA Solar, Germany’s leading manufacturer of solar technology, Gabriel even dropped yet another admission bomb:
The truth is that in all fields we under-estimated the complexity of the Energiewende.”
Gabriel is not only the national economics minister and vice chancellor to Angela Merkel, he is also head of Germany’s socialist SPD party, which is now the coalition partner in Angela Merkel’s CDU/SPD grand coalition government. Moreover Gabriel was once the country’s environment minister and a devout believer in global warming and in Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth.
In the speech Gabriel tells the audience how the energy transformation is on the verge of failure:
Those who are the engines of the transformation to renewable energies, that’s you, you don’t see how close we are to the failure of the energy transformation.”
Gabriel says that major reforms are thus unavoidable, and he calls efforts for energy consumers to get off the grid “pure madness”. That’s not what they want after all. Gabriel is now calling on companies who produce green energy for their own use to ante up as well:

The complete exemption from paying feed-in tariffs is a model that is wonderful for you as a business model, but is one that is a problem for everyone else.”
The solar energy audience reacts with dead, stunned silence (3:03). That can’t believe what they just heard.
The mood at SMA Solar, which has been a huge benefactor of the renewable energy subsidies brought on by Germany’s EEG feed-in act, was somber and shock and Gabriel delivered the reality. Many in attendance seemed unable to fathom what Gabriel was unloading: the heady days at the green energy feeding trough are over – live with it.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here writes:
The responsible persons in attendance at the Hessen-based photovoltaic SMA Solar and all the other profiteers of the EEG feed-in act saw their jaws drop when this late and blunt admission was made.”
That Gabriel would make such comments can only tell us that the situation and the costs surrounding the Energiewende must be far more dire than most of us realize.
Germany’s renewable energy gravy train has derailed for good. Other countries take note!
Finally, give credit to Gabriel for not shying away from what needs to be done and for taking the responsibilities as economics minister very seriously. Finally a person in power who gets it!
Other reading: Even media now mocking failed Energiewende.

Like a zombie rising from the grave to stalk the living, the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST) has haunted Washington for the last 30 years. President Ronald Reagan refused to sign and seemingly killed the omnibus agreement. But his successors revived the misnamed “constitution of the oceans.” There is talk of a renewed push for ratification by the Obama administration and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry.



LOST is one of the more obscure panaceas sold in Washington. If the issue is Chinese maritime assertiveness, Arctic oil exploration, or other maritime disputes, the answer is supposed to be LOST. Ratify the convention and international controversies will be magically resolved.



The convention is a complex, unwieldy document joining diverse ocean‐​related measures. LOST was fashioned when communism claimed to be gaining on capitalism, dictators of newly independent states asserted the international moral high ground, and income redistribution characterized Washington’s domestic policies.



Indeed, the convention was but one element of the “New International Economic Order” designed to promote global income redistribution, taking money from productive First World democracies and giving it to collectivist Third World autocracies. To this end, LOST established the International Seabed Authority (ISA), currently located in the hardship post of Jamaica, to regulate private ocean development, mine the seabed through an entity called “the Enterprise,” and subsidize favored nations and groups.



The ISA is a Rube Goldberg creation, with Assembly, Council, Tribunal, and assorted committees, commissions, and chambers. Most important are the rules. Complicated and seemingly endless, they were drafted to limit access to international resources and force the West to give money and technology to members of the so‐​called G-77, the once influential international lobby for Third World dictators (a few democracies lurked among the developing nations at the time, but not many).



Negotiations proceeded under Richard Nixon, who cared little about economics, and Jimmy Carter, who cared little about redistribution. But Ronald Reagan worried about both and refused to sacrifice U.S. sovereignty for the privilege of creating a mini‐​UN to mulct the American people. To the horror of international diplomats, bureaucrats, and activists, President Reagan refused to sign the final agreement in 1982.



Filled with moral indignation about capitalist outrages, the Soviet Union denounced the U.S., but also refused to sign. The Europeans emphasized their enduring love for their former colonies, which then dominated the G-77, and signed LOST—but refused to ratify the convention. Then, as collectivism collapsed throughout the communist and developing worlds, even Third World states increasingly admitted that President Reagan had been right. Private markets, not government diktats, were the key to prosperity.



Unfortunately, treaties attract U.S. diplomats like flames attract moths. It’s hard for the State Department to imagine an international agreement to which America is not part. So the Bush and Clinton administrations renegotiated the convention. The result was a set of amendments approved in 1994, which led most nations to accept the treaty.



Advocates spoke of having “fixed” the treaty. But they had not.



The document isn’t as terrible as before. However, only in Washington does “less bad” count as “good.”



Even the State Department acknowledged that the amended “Agreement retains the institutional outlines of” the original draft. That is, the convention’s principles and basic structure remained the same. Only some details changed.



Every regulatory body survived. The so‐​called “parallel system,” whereby Western miners subsidized the ISA’s Enterprise, persists. Private companies still must survey and provide free mining sites for the Enterprise. Financial redistribution to the Third World continues. The revised treaty, like the original, encourages public cartels while discriminating against American mining firms.



Taxpayers from wealthy states still pay for the privilege of being regulated by a Third World‐​dominated entity. If the U.S. joins it would become the deepest pocket to be picked. The ISA would even be entitled to revenue from oil development on America’s extended continental shelf.



Alas, the institutional safeguards against over‐​spending are limited and temporary. The Clinton administration put great store in exhortation. The 1994 amendments included Section 1, paragraph 3, pledging that “all organs and subsidiary bodies to be established under the Convention and this Agreement shall be cost‐​effective” and Section 5, paragraph 1(c), stating that the royalty “system should not be complicated and should not impose major administrative costs on the Authority or on a contractor.” No doubt, no one would ever violate such precepts.



One of the most important criticisms of the treaty was the mandatory transfer of proprietary mining technology. The revised LOST deleted one provision, but left another unchanged.



The ISA is directed to “promote and encourage the transfer to developing States of such technology and scientific knowledge.” Additionally, the Authority and member nations “shall initiate and promote” programs “for the transfer of technology to the Enterprise and to developing states,” including “facilitating the access of the Enterprise and of developing States to the relevant technology.”



Moreover, the amended text adds new language: “If the Enterprise or developing States are unable to obtain deep seabed mining technology, the Authority may request all or any of the contractors and their respective sponsoring State or States to cooperate with it in facilitating the acquisition of deep seabed mining technology.” What is to stop the ISA from interpreting the revised text to require technology transfers as LOST originally intended?



The potential for dubious “interpretation” is one of the convention’s greatest threats. The U.N. proclaimed that LOST is not “a static instrument, but rather a dynamic and evolving body of law that must be vigorously safeguarded and its implementation aggressively advanced.” Some treaty proponents forthrightly celebrate expansive litigation possibilities.



William C.G. Burns of the Monterey Institute of International Studies argued that LOST “may prove to be one of the primary battlegrounds for climate change issues in the future,” even though no one drafting the convention thought about temperature controls. Burns noted the Treaty’s expansive definition of marine pollution, writing that “the potential impacts of rising sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in ocean pH as a consequence of rising levels of carbon dioxide in sea water” could “give rise to actions under the Convention’s marine pollution provisions.” If nothing else, he suggested, “the specter of litigation may help to deepen the commitment of States” to legislate on the issue.



U.S. courts might be obligated to enforce decisions under LOST. Annex III, Article 21(2) states that LOST tribunal decisions “shall be enforceable in the territory of each State Party.” In _Medillin v. Texas_ Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens contrasted the Vienna Convention—which the Court determined was not self-enforcing—with LOST, which he argued did “incorporate international judgments into international law.”



LOST supporters warn against discussing such possibilities. Bernard Oxman of the University of Miami acknowledged that the convention “is amply endowed with indeterminate principles, mind‐​numbing cross‐​references, institutional redundancies, exasperating opacity and inelegant drafting.” Thus, after release of the revised agreement he advocated “restraint in speculating on the meaning of the convention or on possible differences between the Convention and customary law” lest critics gain additional ammunition against ratification.



Other LOST supporters simply tell everyone what they think will sell. For instance, groups like World Wildlife Federation and Citizens for Global Solutions contend that LOST could stop Russia from polluting the Arctic. However, treaty proponents simultaneously insist that the agreement would not affect domestic American law. One treaty advocate admitted the contradiction in an email which inadvertently ended up in my hands, noting the consequent difficulty in allaying “conservative fears” of LOST being “some kind of green Trojan Horse.”



When treaty critics point to the continuing economic threat posed by LOST, its advocates try to repackage it as guarantor of America’s navigational freedom. In fact, on this narrow basis the U.S. Navy long has backed the treaty, which expanded territorial seas, created a large exclusive economic zone, and largely codified customary maritime freedoms.



An additional paper guarantee might be nice to have, but as Steven Groves of the Heritage Foundation noted in a recent study, “The navigational rights and freedoms enjoyed by the United States and the Navy are guaranteed not by membership in a treaty, but rather through a combination of long‐​standing legal principles and persistent naval operations.” In any case that really affected U.S. security—think naval transit during a period of crisis or in a war—LOST would not matter.



A country contemplating halting U.S. vessels would weigh its interest and capability, not the treaty’s provisions. Washington responding to foreign interference with navigation would do the same. Over the last couple centuries powerful naval powers, particularly Great Britain (Napoleonic Wars, War of 1812, World War I), Germany (World War I), and the U.S. (Civil War), routinely ignored the protests of neutrals and tramped underfoot customary international law and treaty obligations which restricted maritime operations during war.



Some LOST advocates nevertheless contend that only adherence to the convention will afford America the opportunity to prevent new restrictions on navigational freedom. However, noted Groves: “the evidence indicates that the navigational provisions … are already locked in to the extent that any aspect of international law can be. Indeed, the passage of time has demonstrated that nations—[LOST] members and nonmembers alike—have generally adhered to the convention’s navigational provisions in good faith and that those provisions have endured, not eroded.”



Of course, this doesn’t mean nations don’t sometimes make excessive territorial claims. They do, _even after ratifying the convention_.



Perhaps the area of greatest controversy is the South China Sea. China vehemently denounced U.S. intelligence activities 75 miles off of China’s Hainan Island and harassed the naval vessel concerned. Washington had the better legal argument, but Beijing’s LOST interpretation was not implausible. In this case only U.S. naval power offered certain, unambiguous protection of navigational freedom.



Beijing has been similarly asserting ownership of islands and control of waters against its neighbors, treaty members all. Nor have the Chinese worried about consistency, sending their survey ships into waters claimed by Japan. Two years ago Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee: “In the past several years, they have become more aggressive in asserting claims for the [EEZ] which are excessive under almost any international code.”



For years America has preserved its maritime freedoms through reliance on customary international law, negotiation with straits and archipelagic nations, and a strong navy. Concluded Groves: “By forgoing [LOST] membership, the United States is in no way hindering its ability to secure, preserve, or otherwise protect its navigational rights and freedoms.” While the convention’s navigation provisions are useful, they cannot justify accepting the rest of the text, most particularly the seabed mining regime.



LOST refuses to die, but it remains a bad deal for America. Despite the 1994 amendments, the convention’s redistributionist economic provisions remain flawed and Byzantine bureaucracy remains counterproductive. The treaty’s navigational guarantees, though much better in substance, are not essential. The U.S. Senate should vote against ratifying LOST and put the treaty out of its misery.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC’s tone, amplified by the media, speaks volumes: With its latest report, the UN organization is attempting to incite and lead a global coup d’état – with the main focus on Europe and North America.
Predictably the media in Germany are reporting today on the release of the IPCC’s Working Group II report and the new, shrill levels of alarm it has reached. The overall underlying tone from much of the German media is: The whole world needs to panic and drastic action is urgent and warranted!
Never mind that global temperatures have not warmed at all in over 15 years. The message coming from the German media is as clear as it is alarmist: Go for the hostile takeover! We’ll be behind you.
The center-left Die Zeit writes:
According to the new UN climate report, climate change is going to have more drastic impacts if man does not put the brakes on it more than it has up to now.”
And adds it’s not yet too late to act:
Through rash and comprehensive measures to reduce CO2, the dangers can be considerably reduced.”
Nothing like a thinly veiled call for a coup d’état.
Berlin’s leftist TAZ here writes that climate change is “blossoming and thriving“, warning that:

The galloping global warming is going to have drastic impacts. The UN climate report leaves no doubt a change of course is urgently needed.”
Tim Gore of Oxfam is quoted by TAZ:
The report is there and the message is clear: The impacts of climate change on the supply of food are worse than estimated earlier.”
The Handelsblatt, the business paper for the guilt-ridden rich, writes:
And getting control of the impacts of global warming, ocean over-acidification or climate-dependent natural catastrophes on millions of people is the largest humanitarian and economic challenge of our time.”
The Handelsblatt does add, though, that the IPCC risks failing in delivering the message because it seems to have “its finger permanently pressed on the alarm button” and that “many people have gotten used to the tone and only find it annoying.”
A correspondent on NDR Radio this morning said that the situation was dire, and that the scientists who authored the report were serious and that it had to be taken seriously. He mentioned that there were some dissident voices, but are mainly a gaggle of “Americans”, intonating they cannot be taken seriously.
Not every media outlet in Germany has allowed itself to be completely swallowed up by the uncontrolled fit of hysteria and calls for a green coup d’etat. Strangely Die Welt left the IPCC horror release off the top of its website (at least as of noon today), only posting an obscure story on how the country’s environment minister wants to combat climate change with textiles, saying that Germans might have to get used to wearing pullovers indoors in the wintertime.
At Spiegel, Axel Bojanowski writes that the climate debate has morphed into “a conflict between rich and poor countries” and that “developing countries are requesting payments from the industrial nations as indemnification“. Bojanowski also writes that the IPCC also had to backpedal on some of its earlier predictions involving species die-off, climate refugees, droughts in Africa, and hurricanes in the North Atlantic.

"MOSCOW  —   A Russian court on Wednesday effectively derailed a presidential run by Aleksei A. Navalny  —   the only opposition candidate with a broad, enthusiastic popular following  —   by reviving a    criminal conviction. The decision by the district court was widely viewed as a move by President Vladimir V. Putin to eliminate his only viable rival in an election scheduled for March 2018. Although Mr. Putin has been coy about his decision to run for a fourth term, there is little question that he will. Some observers had speculated that the president would want a weighty opponent to lend legitimacy to his next victory. The best chance for a competitive race came to a screeching halt on Wednesday, however, when a district court in the small city of Kirov, nearly 500 miles northeast of Moscow, pronounced Mr. Navalny guilty of defrauding a state company. Russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office. Since he first came to power in January 2000, Mr. Putin and his allies have gone to great lengths to silence or undermine all critical voices in Russia. It has been almost two years since the   assassination of Boris Nemtsov, another charismatic opposition figure, on the doorstep of the Kremlin. His is the most recent in a string of killings of prominent critics  —   politicians, journalists and human rights activists  —   that remain unsolved. Russian television is largely back under government control, as it was during Soviet times, along with most formerly independent news agencies. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment, civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared “foreign agents,” forcing many to close. Mr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin. He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption, exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary. In recent years, Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics. In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday, he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art, and he was caught up in yet another case involving the death of an elk. While he spent much of 2014 under house arrest, his younger brother Oleg was sent to jail for three and a half years. Mr. Navalny, who called the Kirov fraud charges baseless and politically motivated, responded to the latest judgment against him with defiance. “Putin and his gang of thieves are afraid to face us in elections,” he wrote on Twitter. “Rightly so: We will win. ” In a longer statement, he vowed to continue his presidential run. “We do not recognize this verdict. It will be overturned,” he said. “According to the Constitution, I have a full right to take part in elections, and I will do this. I will continue to represent the interests of people who want to see Russia as a normal, honest, uncorrupt country. ” The Kirov court’s ruling followed almost verbatim the judgment issued against Mr. Navalny in the same case in 2013, which resulted in a   suspended sentence. That verdict was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, and Russia’s Supreme Court ordered a new trial in December. Although the retrial was organized unusually quickly for Russia, Mr. Navalny announced that he was running for president before his latest conviction. Russian political analysts suggested that the prospect of Mr. Navalny’s gaining a national platform to further criticize Mr. Putin had proved too much for the Kremlin hierarchy to tolerate. “The danger associated with Mr. Navalny is easy to explain,” Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email. “If allowed to run, he will disseminate his corruption findings more widely than ever  —   and this disturbs very much Mr. Putin and his gang. ” Officials figured a predictable campaign against impotent opposition was a safer bet, analysts said. Some Kremlin insiders were concerned that letting Mr. Navalny run now would improve his standing for the presidential race in 2024, when Mr. Putin cannot run under current laws, analysts said. Mr. Navalny, 40, is a handsome, telegenic figure with a model family, much more approachable than the usually dour apparatchiks churned out by the Kremlin bureaucratic mill. Despite his earlier conviction, Mr. Navalny was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. He garnered 27. 2 percent of the vote, just short of the threshold needed to force the   candidate into a runoff  —   and enough to feed the Kremlin’s fears. Mr. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, announced that he would appeal the verdict and file complaints with Russia’s Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The European Union issued a statement criticizing the latest verdict, noting that its human rights court had already found that Mr. Navalny did not get a fair trial in 2013. “This latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr. Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia,” the statement said. Mr. Navalny and his team pointed out that there was a conflict between the electoral law and the Constitution, which does not list a criminal conviction among the specific reasons to bar a candidate. Legal analysts said that, just as in the fraud case, any rulings in the other cases against Mr. Navalny would undoubtedly favor the Kremlin. “You can complain about this, but the result will be clear,” said Andrei Y. Buzin, an expert at Golos, an independent election monitor. “The Constitutional Court will say that lawmakers have the right to impose the restrictions it deems necessary to protect the freedoms of other citizens. ” In the Kirov case, the court convicted Mr. Navalny of embezzling 16 million rubles, worth about $500, 000 at the time, by purchasing timber from a   company at   rates and then reselling it at market value. The investigators said Mr. Navalny had used his position at the time as an aide to the Kirov regional governor to persuade the company to sign the contract. Mr. Navalny said the timber was bought at market rates. As the judge, Aleksei Vtyurin, droned through the familiar decision in a barely audible monotone, reading from nearly the same verdict as four years ago, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter to mock the proceedings. “This is page 40 now, and there are 77 of them. It’s comfortable to have the verdict in hand,” Mr. Navalny said from the courtroom. Even before the verdict was announced, the government moved to shut down the logistics for his presidential run. On Tuesday, Russia’s leading information technology company, Yandex, unplugged the online account that Mr. Navalny had used to collect money from supporters."
"A man everyone calls Cheese won Somalia’s presidency on Wednesday, and the streets of the beleaguered capital, Mogadishu, exploded in cheers. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a former prime minister, was chosen for the top job, capping a   electoral process that had been widely criticized as corrupt even by Somali politicians who participated in it. Mr. Mohamed, better known in Somalia by his nickname, Farmajo (from formaggio, the Italian word for cheese, for which his father was said to have acquired a taste when Somalia was an Italian colony) was considered the protest candidate and less manipulated by foreign interests than the departing president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Mr. Mohamed enjoys wide support within Somalia’s army. The moment his victory was announced, celebratory gunfire rang out in Mogadishu as soldiers across the city sprayed bullets into the sky. Mr. Mohamed is rare on the Somali political scene for one reason: He is popular. Crowds of ordinary people poured into Mogadishu’s streets to cheer and whistle on Wednesday night. As one Somalia analyst put it: The least corrupt and    candidate won Somalia’s most corrupt and least democratic election. Go figure. Somalia, which has lurched from crisis to crisis since the central government collapsed in 1991, did not hold direct elections. Instead, Western donors helped set up a complicated indirect election in which Somalia’s regions and its myriad clans, subclans and subsubclans chose 329 members of Parliament, and those members of Parliament then voted for a president. Western officials thought it too dangerous to hold direct elections because of the persistent threat from the Shabab militant group, which has killed thousands across East Africa. On Tuesday, the Shabab fired mortar rounds into the area in Mogadishu where the election was being held. Mr. Mohamud, the incumbent, handily won the first round of voting, leading Mr. Mohamed by 88 to 72 votes in a field of more than 20 candidates. Many analysts said that Mr. Mohamud had built a huge war chest by receiving secret payments from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and other countries, and that he used that money to line up votes ahead of time in Parliament. Many analysts considered it his election to lose. But Mr. Mohamed seems to have tapped into growing resentment about corruption, or possibly, some analysts said, he had his own ways to win over lawmakers. In the last few years, Somali government officials have been steadily enriching themselves, analysts said, while much of the population has sunk deeper into poverty. Aid workers are now worried that millions of Somalis will soon face a famine it would be the third one in 25 years. In the second round of voting, the other presidential contenders threw their weight behind Mr. Mohamed. He won, 184 to 97. Western diplomats quietly cheered on Mr. Mohamed, seeing him as the most organized  —   and least crooked  —   of the contenders. But just about everyone agrees that Somalia still has a long way to go. The government provides few services and controls only small slices of territory. The only reason it controls any territory is the presence of thousands of African Union peacekeepers who have been battling the Shabab for years, taking heavy casualties. Mr. Mohamed, who was born in 1962, had a good reputation as prime minister. As soon as he took office in 2010, he set up a payroll system for soldiers, shrank a bloated cabinet and spoke out against corruption, even though graft continued to blossom on his watch. When he was pushed out less than a year later, as part of a bitter power struggle within the government, protests exploded. Before entering politics, Mr. Mohamed worked as a diplomat for the Somali government and later for the New York State Department of Transportation in Buffalo. He holds American and Somali citizenship, and when he returned to his cubicle in Buffalo after his short stint as prime minister, his   baked him a cake."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists like claiming that a bit of global warming can lead to mass-scale species extinctions and even threatens the very survival of human civilization. It’s one of the media’s favorite scare stories after sea level rise and super storms.
It turns out that the IPCC is now having “great doubts” about that. Yet another scare-story gets debunked!
Yesterday online journalist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here reports in a piece titled: Secret UN Report: IPCC Doubts Prognoses On Species Extinction.
H/t: DirkH
According to information obtained by Spiegel, the UN body “is now sowing astonishingly great doubt over its earlier predictions.”
Online Spiegel writes that scientists are now distancing themselves from their previous projections, and quotes the IPCC:

There is very little confidence in the models accurately predicting the extinction risks.”
Spiegel reports of an “acute lack of data” and that “biological findings have increased doubt over the expected species extinction“.
Spiegel adds:
Thus far, the IPCC admits, there has been no evidence showing that climate change has led to the extinction of a single species. […] With most life forms there’s a lack of data, says Ragnar Kinzelbach of the University of Rostock.”
Kinzelbach then says that climate change has been used as an excuse for inaction in other more urgent areas:
“Monocultures, over-fertilization or soil destruction destroy more species than do several degrees Celsius of temperature rise ever could.”

"ROME  —   When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with Pope Francis. In one of the cardinal’s antechambers, amid religious statues and   walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon  —   who is now President Trump’s   eminence  —   bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by    political elites. “When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I’m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,” said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting. While Mr. Trump, a   president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially   breakthroughs. Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with   parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon’s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff. Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists, notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration, climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president’s ideological guru. For many of the pope’s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican, who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some   “Rad Trads”  —   or radical traditionalists  —   see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers. “There are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal Catholic, I don’t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on issues where I won’t change his mind,” Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch of cannelloni. “Far more valuable for me would be spend time working constructively with Steve Bannon. ” He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and insisted that he shared the pope’s goals of ensuring peace and ending poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it. Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference organized by Mr. Harnwell’s institute. Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity. That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives, for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon’s vision. Less widely known are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a   “church militant” theology. Mr. Bannon’s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as “the smartest guy in Rome” are featured heavily on the website of Mr. Harnwell’s foundation. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser has maintained email contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by the cardinal’s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge of Mr. Bannon’s current outreach said the White House official is personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be the Trump administration’s ambassador to the Holy See. During Mr. Bannon’s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for Breitbart, the website that is popular with the   a   movement that has attracted white supremacists. “He really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,” said Mr. Pentin, the author of “The Rigging of a Vatican Synod?” a book asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents. Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon’s focus on countering a “cultural Marxism” that had seeped into the church. Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke  —   an experience that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as “incredibly powerful” for Mr. Bannon  —   Mr. Trump’s ideological strategist has maintained a focus on Rome. Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary “Torchbearer,” in which the “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson contemplates the apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also reunited with old friends, including Breitbart’s eventual Rome correspondent, Thomas Williams. A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a   brand of liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a “ . ” Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope, but that recent statements by Francis convinced him “Steve turned out to be right. That happens more often than not. ” Mr. Bannon’s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in public. On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the radio program Breitbart News Daily. Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled “Pope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration Into Europe,” Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope “seems almost to be putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate” migration. Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, “two or three steps removed from this?” Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican. Instead, the pope’s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend with posters of a   Francis above complaints about his removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. “Where’s your mercy?” it asked. Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around phony   of the Vatican’s official paper, L’Osservatore Romano, making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the pope and his exhortation on love in the family, “Amoris Laetitia,” which many traditionalists consider Francis’ opening salvo against the doctrine of the church. Set to the music of “That’s Amore,” an aggrieved crooner sings, “When will we all be freed from this cruel tyranny, that’s Amoris” and “It’s the climate of fear engineered for four years, that’s Amoris. ” Cardinal Burke  —   who has said that the pope’s exhortation, which opened the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive communion, might require “a formal act of correction”  —   has been unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon declined to comment for this article. Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining institutional influence after a scandal exploded at the Knights of Malta, a nearly    chivalrous order where he had been exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order’s grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said. Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last month’s   March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross. According to   Westen, the editor of Life Site News, who announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians “who have received a stab in the back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican. The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the   journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small “echo chamber. ” He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump’s ascent on the standing of Francis’ opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a “level of image” and “propaganda. ” The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. “He moves forward, and he moves ahead very fast. ” He added that Mr. Trump’s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim countries was “opposite” to the pontiff’s vision for how to foster unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist Muslims and Christians want. Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down. Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who reflected the pope’s emphasis on an inclusive church  —   far from the worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke. “It’s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like him,” Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago, said after the ceremony. “He is transforming the church in making us rethink how we have done things before. ” That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals. João Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would embolden Mr. Bannon’s allies in the Vatican to intensify their opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he shrugged. “The doctrine is secure,” he said, adding that the mission of the church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is passed down through the popes. “And today, Francis is Peter. ”"

The Mail on Sunday ran an article by David Rose a couple of weeks ago, pointing out just how woeful most climate models had been in predicting global temperatures in the last decade or so. Added to other media reports in recent months, the public at large, at least in the UK. are now gradually becoming aware that temperatures have flatlined for several years.
Desperate to counter this, the Guardian have reported on some work by Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science at Oxford University. They report:-

Forecasts of global temperature rises over the past 15 years have proved remarkably accurate, new analysis of scientists’ modelling of climate change shows.
The debate around the accuracy of climate modelling and forecasting has been especially intense recently, due to suggestions that forecasts have exaggerated the warming observed so far – and therefore also the level warming that can be expected in the future. But the new research casts serious doubts on these claims, and should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change.
The paper, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Geoscience, explores the performance of a climate forecast based on data up to 1996 by comparing it with the actual temperatures observed since. The results show that scientists accurately predicted the warming experienced in the past decade, relative to the decade to 1996, to within a few hundredths of a degree.
The forecast, published in 1999 by Myles Allen and colleagues at Oxford University, was one of the first to combine complex computer simulations of the climate system with adjustments based on historical observations to produce both a most likely global mean warming and a range of uncertainty. It predicted that the decade ending in December 2012 would be a quarter of degree warmer than the decade ending in August 1996 – and this proved almost precisely correct. 
The new research also found that, compared to the forecast, the early years of the new millennium were somewhat warmer than expected. More recently the temperature has matched the level forecasted very closely, but the relative slow-down in warming since the early years of the early 2000s has caused many commentators to assume that warming is now less severe than predicted. The paper shows this is not true.
   
These claims raise a number of issues, but let’s start by looking at the actual numbers. Plotted below are the annual HADCRUT4 anomalies, (based on y/e August, in line with Allen’s workings).

The decade averages, as indicated by the red lines, have increased from 0.196C to 0.467C, so on the face of it, Allen’s prediction was spot on. But we need to delve a little deeper.
1) Let’s start by making a general observation. The Guardian suggest that the results of this one model somehow vindicate climate modelling in general. This is clearly a nonsense, as we will see later, as is their claim that it “should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change”
2) The article also talks about “the relative slow-down in warming since the early years of the early 2000s”. This is more nonsense – warming has not “slowed down”, it has stopped.
3) The first thing to notice about Allen’s prediction is just how low it was, compared with most other models. His forecast of 0.25C warming in 16 years equates to about 1.5C/century, well below other predictions. We’ll compare a couple later.
4) His starting point, the 10 years ending 1996 were, of course, affected by Pinatubo. The years 1992-94 were about 0.15C lower than the years before and after, so it is reasonable to assume the decadal average was about 0.04C lower as a result. In other words, about a sixth of Allen’s prediction of a 0.25C increase is no more than a rebound from Pinatubo.
5) As there was warming between 1986 and 1996, the temperatures at the end of that decade were already higher than the decadal mean. The average of 1995/96 was 0.07C higher than the decadal mean. In other words, part of Allen’s predicted increase between 1996 and 2012 had already occurred before 1996.
6) By the time the paper was written in 1999, Allen, of course, already knew that temperatures had climbed significantly since 1996, with the average of 1997 and 98 being 0.46C. Remember that his model predicted a figure of 0.45C for the decade to 2012, (0.196C + 0.250C).
I wonder why we were not told then that there would be no net warming for the next 13 years?
7) Although the model has, fortuitously, accurately predicted the temperature to 2012, this does not mean that it has been validated. The lack of warming for at least 10 years is a significant feature, and any model that fails to predict this cannot be said to be validated. It is ludicrous to posit that it “should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change”. 
8) As I mentioned, many other models forecast much more rapid rates of warming. The Met Office’s decadal forecast in 2007, for instance, which predicted global temperatures in 2012 would be 0.60C higher than 1996.

http://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/met-office-decadal-forecast2007-version/
9) Or Hansen’s famous 1988 model, that predicted more than a degree of warming, even under Scenario B.

http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/dhm1353/Climate%20Change/HansenvUAH.png
Conclusion
Contrary to the Guardian’s claims, Myles Allen’s work does not indicate vindicate climate modelling in general, nor does it inspire confidence in current predictions.
Furthermore, Allen’s work fails to explain why temperatures have flatlined in the last ten years, and why his original model did not predict it. More importantly, it has nothing to say about what this pause means for temperatures during the next decade.
But you would not expect to hear any of this from the Guardian.

Now that forest fires are in the news, someone noticed that President Obama has proposed a new way of funding wild firefighting. Instead of borrowing from its fuels treatment funds when the Forest Service exhausts its regular fire-fighting budget, Obama wants to let the agency draw upon a new ""special disaster account"" that is ""adjusted each year to reflect the 10-year average cost of responding to such events.""   
  
Treating excessive firefighting costs by giving the Forest Service more money makes as much sense as attempting to suppress forest fires by throwing gasoline on them. In case you don't hear the sarcasm, it makes no sense at all.   
  
Obama is focusing on the wrong problem, the drawdown of funds intended for fuel treatments. The real problem is the incentives the Forest Service has to spend wildly on firefighting.   
  
As far as I know, no democracy has given any government agency a blank check to accomplish any goal--except the Forest Service for fighting fires. Even the Pentagon was given budgets for fighting World War II, the Cold War, and other wars. But in 1908, Congress gave the Forest Service a blank check for firefighting, saying the agency could spend as much as it needed to suppress fires, and Congress would reimburse it later.



Congress repealed the blank-check law in about 1978, leading to eight years of relatively modest spending on firefighting. But after two serious fire seasons in 1987 and 1988, Congress reimbursed the agency's firefighting debts, and since then it has muddled about, not knowing what to do. Obama's new proposal puts the agency firmly back in the blank-check mode.   
  
The president has underscored his support for excessive spending by allowing the Forest Service to buy four new air tankers, including a DC-10. The agency already had access to a DC-10, but rarely used it because it wasn't cost-effective. Now it will have two white elephants on its hands.   
  
Contrary to popular belief, firefighting has not grown more expensive because of anthropogenic climate change. The nation actually suffered worse droughts in the 1930s than in the last decade, and there is no evidence, in the forests at least, that recent fires are due to anything but cyclical climate changes.   
  
Nor are costs high because of new houses in the woods, or wildland-urban interface as fire people call it. Protecting these homes only requires treatment, either in advance of the fire through landscaping and home design or as fires approach through application of fire retardant, of the homes themselves and land within 150 feet of the homes. Anything the Forest Service does beyond that 150 feet is neither necessary nor sufficient to protect homes that are themselves untreated.   
  
Instead, lots of acres burn because the Forest Service now places firefighters well behind the fire lines and has them back burn everything between them and the fire lines. In some fires, close to half the acres burned are back burns.   
  
Meanwhile, costs are high because the Forest Service knows it has what amounts to a blank check, so it makes no effort to save money. As I explain in this Cato paper, the only solution is to ""divorce the agency from Congress’s blank check."" One way to do this might be to have national forests join state fire protection districts by paying an annual per-acre fee, and then letting the states worry about fire fighting. They would have much stronger incentives to control fire at the lowest, rather than the highest, possible cost.   
  
The president's concern that the Forest Service might hamper its fire prevention efforts by having to borrow from those funds to suppress fires is touching but needless. As shown by previous fires, Congress could fully fund fire prevention and fuel treatment programs for years without reducing the number of homes destroyed by fire each year. In fact, Congress is so willing to do anything to protect homes that the Forest Service practically depends on a few houses burning down each year to keep the money flowing.   
  
The Forest Service should educate homeowners about what they need to do to defend their homes from fire. Beyond that, what people actually do is between them and their insurance companies, which for too long have indirectly relied on the blank check to keep their costs down. Getting firefighting decisions out of the hands of federal agencies may be the only way to let this happen.

THIS WEEK:

Climate Realism: In an essay posted by American Thinker, Fred Singer explains his motivation for engaging in an exchange with noted economist William Nordhaus that was published in the New York Review of Books. Please see Article # 1.

******************
Svalbard Again: The small Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard (about the size of West Virginia) has become popular again this week. Svalbard is located at 76 and 80 degrees N, about 450 miles north of Norway, between Norway and the North Pole and between Norway and the northern part of the east coast of Greenland. Although the climate is classified as arctic, it is tempered by the (comparatively) warm North Atlantic Current which flows along the western and northern coasts of Spitsbergen, the main island, keeping water open and navigable most of the year. CIA Fact Book: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sv.html
It is the warm North Atlantic Current that may be misleading some in interpreting recent research of a lake in Svalbard. In an apparent update of a study published in May, researchers from Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory concluded that the lake is warmer today than any time in the past 1800 years, including the Medieval Warm Period, and that the Little Ice Age was mild.
Alarmist headlines quickly committed the logical fallacy of composition – that which applies to Svalbard applies to all of the Arctic. However, as even the press release of the research states:
“Evidence from tree rings and ice cores shows that southern Greenland and parts of North America were warmer from 950 to 1250 than today, with the Vikings taking advantage of ice-free waters to settle Greenland.” The temperatures in Svalbard may be an aberration from changing North Atlantic Current rather than any broad trend. Please see links under Seeking a Common Ground.
******************
Methane Emissions: One of the popular refrains by global warming alarmists is that if carbon dioxide (CO2) causes significant warming it will be amplified by the release of methane from the deep ocean. An international research effort exploring the sea bed of Spitsbergen (part of Svalbard) found methane seeps where microbes have been feasting for hundreds of years – no evidence of anything new. It would be interesting to see a cataloguing of these microbes as to any relationship with the microbes that feasted so heavily during the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
******************
Circumpolar Vortex: New research indicates that changes in the northern circumpolar vortex,
strong winds that circulate clockwise (east to west) generally centered on the North Pole, may significantly influence the North Atlantic Oscillation, and thereby affect climate change. Writings by H.H. Lamb in the 1970s and 1980s brought out the importance of the circumpolar vortex in affecting weather and climate. These were systematically ignored in later reports by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), particularly in its Summary for Policymakers.
The new research links the changes in the stratosphere at altitudes up to 30 miles with changes in the ocean currents. Unfortunately, as all too common, the writing in the press release is overblown, which detracts from findings. It remains to be seen if the research is a significant new contribution. The authors try to link changes in vortex to changes in stratospheric ozone and CO2. However, as Lamb pointed out, changes in the vortex can be used to explain part of weather and climate change long before ozone and CO2 became an issue. Please see links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Wind Power: There has been a blow-up in England where two researchers challenged a study by Gordon Hughes stating that using wind turbines in place of coal or natural gas power plants does not necessarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The response from Hughes was swift and deadly. No doubt such controversies will continue as more citizens are questioning the wisdom of wind power, which is driving up electricity costs.
If one accepts that increase atmospheric carbon dioxide is a benefit to plants and to humanity, the arguments are moot. Consumers want reliable electricity, which can illuminate their homes at the flick of a switch and heat their homes on cold, still nights. Reliable power should be considered the primary source and unreliable power a secondary source. Economically, it makes no sense to add an unreliable source, such as solar or wind, unless the secondary reduces overall costs. Increasingly, experience in Germany, England, Spain, US, etc, are showing that these unreliable secondary sources are increasing overall costs, not reducing them. Therefore, they are an unneeded luxury good. Adding into this mix, General Electric announced a new gas fired turbine that can be more readily adjusted to the erratic nature of wind. However, if it does not reduce overall costs, it is yet another expensive toy. Please see links under Questioning European Green and Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind.
******************
Electric Vehicles: All-electric vehicles and gas-battery hybrids took another public hit this week with Toyota announcing it will not put into production a new all-electric car, and with continuing poor sales of gas-battery hybrids. But, perhaps the most damning statement came from the widely-respected Consumers Report review on the Fisker gas-battery hybrid called Karma. Combined, the US Federal Government and the State of Delaware have given Fisker two hundred million dollars in subsidies, ostensively to build a car in Delaware. The Karma is built in Finland and a second car, to be built in Delaware, is no longer considered viable. As to the review: “Most Karmas are going to be bought by the rich and famous,” said the Consumer Reports reviewer. “That’s good, because they can afford another car to drive if their Fisker’s in the shop.” Who knew the somber Consumers Report had a sense of humor? Please see links under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Vehicles and Below the Bottom Line.
******************
Taxes on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Although US Congress is out campaigning, the possibility of taxing carbon dioxide emissions continues to be discussed by the Washington establishment. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) produced a report re-stating a prior study that about one-half of the massive Federal Government deficits can be covered by 2020 with taxes on carbon dioxide emissions of $20 per metric ton starting in 2012 and increasing 5.6% annually to about $31 per metric ton by 2020. Since 2009, the deficits have been running over $1 Trillion per fiscal year.
The report seems to be competently done, but the impacts of economic dislocations are probably understated and the question of use of the new revenues is a major issue. It must be remembered that after using its computer models to evaluate the stimulus bill, the CRS predicted that the bill would keep unemployment from exceeding 8% and it would be down to about 5.5% by mid 2012. Unemployment has not been as low as 8% since the passage of the bill and, using the size of the labor force of 2009, it stands above 11%. Please see links under Cap and Trade and Carbon Taxes.
******************
Silent Spring: This week marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of the book Silent Spring, which marked the transformation of conservationism and prudent environmentalism (wise use) to radical environmentalism. The book falsely asserted that virtually all forms of cancer have environmental causes. Thus, cancer can be virtually eliminated by eliminating all forms of human “pollution”, no matter what or how benign or beneficial the activities may be. This unscientific legacy continues in the EPA and other government agencies.
Probably, the worst form of neo-colonialism that ever took place was driven by radical environmentalism following the EPA banning the use of DDT on the unsubstantiated claim that it may cause cancer. (Wise use would have been more appropriate.)
By the early 1950s, tropical doctors demonstrated that indoor spraying of huts was a safe, highly effective way of drastically reducing malaria in humans. The EPA ban was used to make the world-wide banning of DDT a condition for foreign aid. As a result, in tropical countries, tens of millions died and hundreds of millions suffer from reoccurring bouts with malaria, largely preventable by the indoor spraying of huts with DDT. This is not a proud moment in American or Western civilization. Please see links under Environmental Industry.
******************
Energy Independence? The concept that North America may become independent of the rest of the world for fossil fuels continues to stir controversy. The US and North America are largely independent in coal and, thanks to hydraulic fracturing, in natural gas. In 2011 the top three oil producers were ranked, in order, as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/top-5-oil-producing-countries-in-
2011.aspx#axzz27yXosbru Preliminary 2012 data indicates that the rankings may change to Saudi Arabia, the US, and Russia for 2012.
Significant infrastructure investments must be made before the US or North America can become independent in oil. Such investments require that the production of “tight oil”, that released by hydraulic fracturing of shale, be sustained and that international prices of crude oil remain above historic levels. Further, deepwater oil developments require high prices. Several analysts suggest that prices must remain above $70 a barrel. As stated in prior TWTWs, the budgets of the primary exporting countries require that the world price remains above $70 per barrel.
There is a lack of historic knowledge on the productive life of tight oil, as well as deepwater oil. The standards used to evaluate traditional sources may no longer apply to these sources. Also, the non-traditional sources continue to undergo innovation that may result in lower production costs. Please see links under Energy Issues and Oil and Natural Gas, The Past or the Future?
******************
Number of the Week: Over 18,000 in a few days. As mentioned last week, the Public
Broadcasting System (PBS) had a one-hour segment on climate change that featured self- proclaimed former skeptic Richard Muller and included others such as Judith Curry and (horrors!) Anthony Watts. Immediately, certain web sites sprung into action and within a few days delivered a petition signed by over 18,000 people censoring PBS for including Anthony Watts. [In her comments on the program, Judith Curry stated that Watts appeared to be more a lukewarmer than she.]
The ombudsman of PBS publically stated that this program was not the finest hour for PBS, to which Curry agrees, but for other reasons. In his explanation of the program, it was not the finest hour of the ombudsman. No doubt those who make exaggerated claims of the difficulties global warming alarmists face with a hostile public will systematically ignore this episode of PBS.

1. Climate Realism
By S. Fred Singer, American Thinker, Sep 26, 2012
http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/climate_realism.html
Even with the Kyoto Protocol due to expire at the end of this year, Obama persists in giving highest priority to climate change policy if re-elected. Does the U.S. really want to lead the world in committing economic suicide? It pays to look at the rapidly disappearing scientific rationale for trying to mitigate a putative future global warming.
In an essay “Why the Global Warming Skeptics are Wrong” in the New York Review of Books of Feb. 22, 2012, Yale professor William D. Nordhaus attempts to counter the arguments of a group of 16 prominent scientists who published an essay, “No Need to Panic about Global Warming,” in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 27, 2012.
Two crucial points may have been overlooked in the debate:
**Evidence for anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is problematic.
**A modest warming is likely to be beneficial — not damaging.
First, some background: I have known Bill Nordhaus for about 40 years; he certainly is no wild- eyed alarmist, but rather a highly respected specialist in environmental economics. Through his association with the U.N. climate-science panel, he is familiar with the main arguments supporting the IPCC’s contention that human activities, mainly rising carbon dioxide levels from energy generation, have been responsible for much of past warming. He does not question this IPCC claim; however, I have no reason to believe that he supports any of the drastic CO2-mitigation schemes — be they carbon sequestration or alternative “green” energy projects — or that he has illusions about the efficacy of the Kyoto Protocol or similar measures of international control.
So I will simply try to address questions Prof. Nordhaus posed in his NYRB essay, to which I responded in a (Aug. 16) letter in the NYRB. I wanted my response to reach NYRB readers, typically liberal academics, lawyers, and teachers.
1. Is the planet in fact warming? This crucial question cannot be answered honestly unless one specifies the time interval referred to. Clearly, the climate has warmed since the last Ice Age. It has also warmed since about 1850, in recovering from the Little Ice Age (roughly 1400-1800 AD). But is has not warmed since the Medieval Warm Period of 1,000 years ago, or since the Holocene Optimum, which reached even higher temperatures 5,000-8,000 years ago. Nor has it warmed during the past decade.
Coming closer to the present, we see a warming between 1910 and 1940, which is real but not caused by human activities. Most would agree that the Earth’s surface cooled slightly between 1940 and 1975 — even though carbon dioxide, a greenhouse (GH) gas, had been steadily increasing during this period. Temperature data show a sudden, unexplained jump around 1976- 1977. Surface weather stations then report a modest increase in temperature up to the year 2000 –  although different analyses disagree on details and have been frequently revised. Many people, including Nordhaus, tend to identify this reported increase as caused by the almost parallel increase in CO2. In its Summary, the latest IPCC report (2007) states explicitly that this reported (surface) warming trend is sure (>90%) evidence for anthropogenic global warming (AGW).
**We note, however, that the atmosphere, both over land and ocean, did not warm during this same post-1978 period — even though atmospheric theory and every climate model predicts that the tropical atmosphere should warm nearly twice as rapidly as the surface. This atmospheric evidence comes from instruments in weather satellites, producing the only truly global data — and, independently, from thermometers in balloon-borne radiosondes.
**In 2000, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences assembled a team of distinguished scientists to discuss the puzzle of surface warming in the absence of an atmospheric warming trend. However, their report, “Reconciling observations of global temperature change,” could not reconcile the disparity.
**I note that an analysis of ocean data has shown no significant warming during the period of 1978 -2000. Independent non-thermometer data (so-called proxies, like tree rings, ice cores, ocean sediments, stalagmites, etc.) also show no warming trend between 1978 and 2000. Significantly, there has been no warming for the past decade. All this, in spite of constantly rising CO2 levels.
The inescapable conclusion — or perhaps I should say suspicion — is that land-based weather stations may be reporting just local temperature increases but that there is negligible global warming. If correct, this surmise would remove the main evidence for the IPCC’s claim about the existence of appreciable AGW.
2. Are human influences an important contributor to warming? Obviously, the answer must be no — if one accepts the evidence about the nonexistence of recent warming. Nevertheless, it should be stated that since CO2 is a GH, and since most if not all of its increase is human-caused, there must be some minor human contribution to climate change. The real scientific puzzle, not mentioned by Nordhaus, is why the observed temperature trends are so much smaller than what models calculate.
3. Is carbon dioxide a pollutant? Lawyers might say, Yes, this is what the Supreme Court ruled in 2007, but scientists are not so sure. A pollutant, by definition, must produce harmful effects. CO2 is a natural constituent of the atmosphere, non-toxic, invisible, having no physiological effects we know of — even at high concentrations. Its definition as a pollutant relies entirely on its alleged causation of significant global warming and on the additional assumption that a warmer climate is damaging.
(We should take note that CO2 is Nature’s plant fertilizer. The world’s important crop plants developed when CO2 levels were much greater than today’s. Innumerable experiments have demonstrated that higher CO2 concentrations are beneficial for plant growth and therefore benefit global agriculture. Plants not only grow faster, but require less water. All of this is well-known to agricultural experts and to the owners of commercial greenhouses, who often raise CO2 levels artificially to increase productivity. Perhaps we should be grateful to China, the world’s largest emitter of CO2.)
However, before considering CO2 as a “criteria pollutant” subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, the Supreme Court ruling requires the EPA to demonstrate by independent research that higher levels of CO2 are damaging to “human health and welfare.” But the EPA’s Endangerment Finding and supporting Technical Support Document (TSD) have been attacked by a large number of plaintiffs. The case was lost before the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia; it is likely that it will return to the Supreme Court, which may get a chance to modify its 2007 decision.
4. Are we seeing a regime of fear for skeptical climate scientists? Being fairly senior, I am not much affected by the animosity towards skeptics, revealed by the leaked e-mails from Climategate. However, I seem to have lost friends in the academic community and have had considerable difficulty in getting technical papers published in journals whose editors have openly expressed their bias. My real concern is for younger scientists who are just trying to establish their professional careers.
5. Are the views of mainstream climate scientists driven primarily by the desire for financial gain? This is a leading question; I would assume that scientific curiosity is the main driving force. Financial gain may be only one of several additional factors, along with prestige and academic advancement, invitations to important conferences, prizes, etc. However, I would point to the large sums, about $20 billion during the past decade, that the government has spent on climate research, of which only a tiny fraction has gone to skeptics. I also note the multi-million-dollar grants to “mainstream” climate scientists by private foundations, and even by oil companies such as Exxon and BP. Not surprisingly, the number of scientific publications is roughly proportional to this level of financial support.
6. Is it true that more carbon dioxide and additional warming will be beneficial? Briefly, my answer is yes.
First, Nordhaus correctly states that net benefits (benefits minus costs) should be maximized. This is mathematically equivalent to the well-known result that one should increase pollution control as long as marginal benefits exceed marginal costs. As an expert economist, however, Nordhaus should expand his discussion of more important points:
**The discount rate plays a crucial role in the present case, where costs are incurred today, while benefits may be realized 100 years hence. Nordhaus himself uses realistic discount rates of 4%, but he should be more critical of others, like Lord Nicholas Stern, who use discount rates close to zero, which severely skews any cost-benefit analysis by greatly over-estimating the present dollar-value of benefits.
**Further, one must ask if there is really any net damage at all from a warmer climate. I wonder why Professor Nordhaus never mentions the work of Yale resource economist Robert Mendelsohn and his 23 economist-colleagues, whose acclaimed book concludes that a modest warming and higher CO2 levels would actually enhance GDP-raising average income, prosperity, and general welfare. True, there are also respected economists who hold a different view; the 1996 report of the IPCC lists results of several of their analyses. While these agree surprisingly well on the total amount of damage, I found that they strongly disagree on individual sectors (like agriculture and others) that make up these totals. And they all assign large economic damage to sea-level rise — even though there is no observational evidence for an influence of short-term (decadal) temperature changes on the rate of rise of sea level.
Finally, it should be obvious, perhaps, but needs to be stated explicitly that if a warmer climate produces positive net benefits rather than damages, then, in principle, one cannot even conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Nor should one try to mitigate emissions of CO2 in any way; our current policies are simply misguided.

2. What Arctic Foxes Know About Global Warming
By Matt Ridley, WSJ, Sep 21, 2012 [H/t William Readdy]
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444450004578002500275382408.html?KEYWORDS=Arctic+fox+global+warming
This week probably saw the Arctic Ocean’s sea ice reach its minimum extent for the year and begin to expand again, as it usually does in mid-September. Given that the retreat of Arctic ice has become a key piece of evidence for those who take a more alarmed view of global warming, it’s newsworthy that 2012’s melt was the greatest since records began in 1979, with sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere shrinking to about 1.3 million square miles, or about half the 1979-2008 average.
As this column has sometimes pointed out ways in which the effects of global warming are happening more slowly than predicted, it is fair to record that this rate of decline in Arctic sea ice is faster than many predicted. Although an entirely ice-free Arctic Ocean during at least one week a year is still several decades away at this rate, we are halfway there after just three decades.
Arctic melts on this scale have happened before, however. Svend Funder of the Danish Museum of Natural History and his colleagues recently studied the northern coast of Greenland, where the land-fast sea ice never breaks up, even in a year like this. Yet evidence of wave action in the past (indicating open waters) and waterlogged driftwood show that for 2,500 years in the “Holocene Optimum” period, when Arctic summer temperatures were two to four degrees Celsius warmer than today, the summer melt of the Arctic Ocean routinely left half as much ice as this year.
Another study, by Jørgen Berge and colleagues from the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway, and other institutions, discovered a downward migration of egg-carrying amphipod crustaceans that enables them to recolonize Arctic ice from ice-free areas using deep currents. They say this implies that some animals are well adapted to the seasonal loss of ice.
In the Holocene Optimum there was no collapse of the polar-bear population or “point of no return.” The extent of Arctic summer sea ice then increased steadily, reaching a maximum during the very recent so-called Little Ice Age of 1500-1850. Potential confirmation that this was an unusually icy epoch comes from a newly published study by Durham University (in Britain) of the genetics of Arctic foxes on Iceland.
Greger Larson and his colleagues found that the remains of 17 Arctic foxes in Iceland from the ninth to the 12th centuries shared a single genetic signature, while the modern Icelandic fox population has five different genetic types. During the cold centuries, they infer, genetically diverse Arctic foxes from the Eurasian continent apparently reached Iceland via sea ice.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the extent of summer Arctic sea ice then shrank after 1850, before expanding in the 1960s. Clearly, the Arctic Ocean’s sea ice is both more variable and more vulnerable to warming than expected. But is the current rapid retreat caused only by warming? At least some of it might be caused by soot from dirty, coal-fired power stations. Some scientists have noticed that the decline in Arctic sea ice correlates better with the rapid growth of coal consumption in China than it does with global temperature. As the argument goes: Soot falling on white ice darkens it, which results in faster melting in summer sun.
Correlation does not always mean causation, but if soot is contributing to sea-ice melt, then it is moderately good news, because cleaning up soot emissions from power stations could be both cheaper and quicker than cutting carbon-dioxide emissions.
There’s also the puzzling fact that Antarctic sea ice shows no sign of summer retreat, and the current winter’s peak extent is well above average. The sea-dominated Southern Hemisphere is certainly warming more slowly than the land-dominated Northern Hemisphere, but it has still been warming. If warming is supposed to be “global,” shouldn’t sea ice retreat at both ends of the world?

3. Power Plants Aim to Curb Their Thirst By Rebecca Smith, WSJ, Sep 21, 2012 http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444433504577649914114390298.html?mod=IT P_pageone_1
The drought that parched more than 30 states this summer is forcing the power industry to rethink its heavy use of water and adopt technology to use less of it.
Electricity generation is the biggest single user of water in the U.S., according to an analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey, which found that power plants account for nearly half of all water withdrawn from American rivers, lakes and seashores each day—more than 200 million gallons worth.
The water, which surpasses by far the amount used for irrigation, is converted to steam to turn turbines, and is used to cool equipment at many kinds of plants, including nuclear, coal and gas units. Much of it later is put back, though in heated form.
This summer, however, some power plants had to cut electricity production because of low water levels or because water was too warm to cool nuclear reactors. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the period from August 2011 through July 2012 was the hottest 12-month period on record in the U.S. since 1895.
Low water levels remain a concern for both power companies and the agencies that operate electric grids across the country, the federal Energy Information Administration said earlier this month.
“The power industry is all over this issue,” said John Moura, associate director of reliability assessments for National Electric Reliability Corp., the federal organization responsible for electric-grid dependability. “The net result is going to be a reduction in water use by the power industry.”
The federal Bureau of Reclamation, the second-biggest producer of hydroelectric power in the country with dams across the western U.S., said electricity output in the drought-stricken Colorado River system is down 16% from a decade ago. To cope with persistently low water, the agency is installing new turbines that can generate electricity with lower flows in places like the Hoover Dam, on the Arizona-Nevada border.
“We’re just getting started,” said Kerry McCalman, senior hydropower adviser, “but results are good so far.”
Rising water temperatures also are causing trouble. In July, Exelon Corp.’s EXC -0.33% Braidwood nuclear plant in Illinois had to get special permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue running when the plant’s cooling-pond temperature reached 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
Operators of the Millstone nuclear-power plant in Connecticut shut down one of two reactors when the temperature of Long Island Sound reached 75 degrees in early August. Plant spokesman Kenneth Holt said the two-week shutdown resulted in 255,000 megawatt hours of lost power production worth several million dollars.
Dominion Resources Inc., D -0.24% Millstone’s operator, is conducting a study it hopes will convince regulators that the plant is safe to run even if water temperatures are high.
Some companies are replacing coal-fired plants, which use a lot of water, with less-thirsty natural-gas plants. In Salem, Mass., Footprint Power LLC got community support to do just that, in part because of the water savings.
The existing Salem Harbor coal plant was allowed to withdraw as much as 670 million gallons of seawater each day and discharge water that was as much as 28 degrees hotter, changing the ecology of the harbor. The new gas-fired plant, which the company hopes to have in operation in 2016, will use no seawater, said Peter Furniss, the chief executive of Footprint Power, which recently bought the site from Dominion.
Mr. Furniss said the reduction in water use is key to garnering regulatory approvals in Massachusetts.
AES Corp. AES -0.98% wants to build new gas-fired units at its existing plant site in Huntington Beach, Calif., which will use a $30 million air condenser instead of relying on seawater for cooling. Currently, the Huntington Beach plant uses an average of 270 million gallons of seawater and 260,000 gallons of fresh water each day. If AES gets permission to build the new gas-fired units and finds a buyer for the power, it plans to stop using seawater and cut fresh-water use to 41,000 gallons a day.
“Huntington Beach is surf city,” said Stephen O’Kane, program engineer for AES, which is based in Arlington, Va. “When they heard we were proposing to eliminate using ocean water for cooling, that was a huge plus” in generating public support for the plan.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNorth Pole and South Pole Ice
By Ed Caryl
Why do the north and south polar regions seem to be opposites? Why is ice increasing around Antarctica, and decreasing in the Arctic Ocean?
The answer lies in the other ways that these two regions are opposites. At the South Pole lies a continent. The ice cap there lies over land, is up to two miles thick over rugged terrain, and can move (flow) only very, very, slowly, largely due to gravity. Only the sea ice can move rapidly, and that movement is at the whim of the wind.
At the North Pole, there is an ocean. There is (except for Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago) only sea ice, again moving at the whim of the wind. The difference is the large chunk of continental ice at the South Pole is surrounded by ocean, instead of (at the North Pole) a large ocean surrounded by land.
In order to visualize conditions, here is a diagram of the earth’s winds.

Figure 1 is a diagram of the winds and atmospheric cells over the earth. Source: NASA.
In general, there is rising air over the tropics, leading to low pressure, thunderstorms, and warm dry air moving north in the stratosphere to fall as high pressure at the “Horse Latitudes” over the northern and southern hemisphere deserts. This air then flows towards the equator and is turned toward the west by carioles force from the earth’s rotation, resulting in the trade winds. Tropical thunderstorms act as heat pumps, converting rising, warm, moist air into cool, dry air, allowing the heat to radiate to space at the top of the stratosphere, and the moisture to fall as rain. If there is more heat, there are more thunderstorms to get rid of it, and more moving air.
The falling air at the Horse Latitudes exchanges energy with the Mid-latitude cells, resulting in the mid-latitude westerlies, then, in turn, energy is traded to the Polar cells. This results in low pressure at the 60° north and south latitudes and high pressure at the poles. At the surface in each set of cells, heat is picked up from the surface and moved to the top of the atmosphere. At the top of the atmosphere in each set of cells, more heat is radiated to space. In the south, the mid-latitude cells are mostly over cold water and don’t pick up much heat. In the north, the mid-latitudes cells are more over land and pick up more heat. In the south, the Polar cell is over the high icecap, nearly in the stratosphere, and the polar high has very cold, dense, dry, air. In the north, the Polar cell is over ocean, the surface is at sea level, and the winds are still exchanging heat with the surface.
The result is, that as heat in the tropics increases, even slightly, the upper levels in these cells radiate more heat to space, the highs increase where colder air is falling, and the lows get lower where air is rising. At the South Pole, this results in lower temperatures and stronger winds at the surface. At the North Pole, because the ice is floating on Arctic Ocean, the winds tend to break up the ice, and more open water moderates the temperature. The higher the winds, the more the ice is broken up. The smaller ice area in the summer of 2012 was because a cyclone did an exceptional job breaking up the ice.
At the Antarctic coast, the increased wind and lower temperatures create more ice. The very cold winds blowing down hill off the continent blow the ice away from shore, creating polynyas. As the air is very cold, the open water immediately freezes, and the resulting slush (brash ice) is in turn blown into the downwind sea ice. As long as the wind is blowing, this is a continuous process. These polynyas are visible from space.

Figure 2 is a satellite view of the Antarctic coast and the mid-winter sea ice. The dark spots at the coast are wind-caused polynyas, open water where new sea ice is formed.
The outer edge of the sea ice is not where new ice is formed; it’s the inner edge. The outer edge is where the ice is melting. The outer edge is expanding in area because that part of the Southern Ocean is getting colder.

Figure 3 is the Southern Ocean sea surface temperature for latitudes south of 60°. Source NOAA, here.
If you look at absolute temperature, it is easy to see what is going on.

Figure 4 is the absolute sea surface temperature for the Southern Ocean south of 60°. The graph is from NOAA.
In Figure 4, note that since 2007, the Southern Ocean south of 60° South is now seldom above freezing. Saltwater freezes below -1.8°C, but ice does not melt until the sea surface is above 0°C.
To summarize, the polar winds are blowing harder because the tropics and temperate zones are warming. The southern ice is expanding because the winds are blowing harder and the Southern Ocean is cooling, again, probably because the winds are blowing harder. It is all part of the earth’s thermoregulatory system.

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

Business leaders are fuming over Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s nervy use of the Martin Act, the state law that gives him super‐​broad powers to investigate and press charges against alleged financial fraud. For example, Schneiderman has gone after several large energy firms for allegedly over‐​optimistic financial comments on upstate gas “fracking,” a charge conveniently aligned with his own anti‐​fracking stance. Recently he used the act in an attempt to upset a settlement deal between bankers and the feds over mortgage misdeeds — critics charge him with “blindsiding” the Bank of New York Mellon with what BNYM calls “outrageous” and “baseless” fraud charges.



But it’s a mistake to see Schneiderman’s left‐​tilting politics as the main source of the problem. As became clear under the reign of then‐​AG Eliot Spitzer, the trouble is with the state of the Martin Act itself. And the state of that law results from a devil’s deal that many leading New York City firms were happy enough to accept — until it blew up in the complacent faces of their execs and lawyers.



Albany passed the Martin Act in 1921, strengthening it at intervals so that it now grants more sweeping powers to New York’s AG than his federal or state counterparts wield. Equally important was that, over the decades, it became subject to an “unspoken gentleman’s agreement” (as Nicholas Thompson called it in a 2004 _Legal Affairs_ piece).



Crusading prosecutors like Louis Lefkowitz used the act to chase out of town the crumbums, sad sacks and grifters of the investment world. And up to a point — a point painfully symbolized by the career of Bernard Madoff — it seemed to work. A lot of shady penny‐​stock operators, worm‐​farm promoters and small‐​town Ponzi guys did head for states where such doings were less effectively policed.



That in turn pleased many on Wall Street — who gained from the general public impression that if you were dealing securities in a major way out of New York, you’d had to pass closer inspection than some guy from Florida or Utah.



Trouble is, with few well‐​established businesses pushing back, the Martin Act was turning by stages into a blank check for the prosecution. Under its terms, the AG can subpoena witnesses or demand the production of documents without probable cause or a grand jury’s say‐​so. He can sue anyone for alleged fraud without showing that anyone relied on the alleged misrepresentations to their detriment, and, astoundingly, without even having to show a guilty state of mind or intent to commit fraud. In this the act goes far beyond both federal securities law and common law.



Moreover, the law gives the AG almost total discretion over the public release of once‐​private documents and testimony — a perfect weapon for trying cases in the press. To top it all, targets of subpoenas do not enjoy rights against self‐​incrimination or even a right as of law to have a lawyer present.



Rather than resist the chipping away of the historic rights of those accused of wrongdoing, New York courts blessed ever‐​more expansive construction of the law’s terms on grounds that the Martin Act is after all “remedial.” Was the act turning into a menace to civil liberties? Few in high‐​level law and business circles seemed particularly to care: It wasn’t happening to _their_ clients.



Then Eliot Spitzer broke the deal.



In those days Spitzer was a national idol, flying high with indictment after indictment, headline after headline, settlement after settlement, opining about every issue under the legal sun (notably including the need for stiffer sentences for “johns”) and demanding that disgraced execs never be allowed to practice again in their old lines of business.



Famously, he sicced the Martin Act with great success against Merrill Lynch and other pillars of American finance. Most targets settled fast — who wouldn’t fold when the law gives the prosecutor all the legal cards?



Successors have followed in his path. Then‐​AG Andrew Cuomo used the law to browbeat utilities into issuing more warnings about climate change, supposedly with investor protection in mind rather than his environmentalist allies. Schneiderman is playing the same game. No end is in sight.



I don’t like crumbums and grifters either, but might we not be better off if someone had stuck up for their due process rights back when?

"In late September, a group of tech leaders started a   effort to raise $100, 000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76, 324. For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent. No longer. After President Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order restricting immigration,   has gone   political. Companies are being pushed by their employees, by their customers and sometimes by their ideals. They are trying to go far enough without going too far. Nearly 130 companies, most of them in the technology field, filed an amicus brief late Sunday in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which declined to reinstate the travel ban after a lower court blocked it. The brief, which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Uber and Intel, said Mr. Trump’s order “violates the immigration laws and the Constitution. ” “Silicon Valley is stepping up,” said Sam Altman, who runs the valley’s most prominent   incubator, Y Combinator. “The companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don’t support. ” It is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable  —   not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind. Many of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after an upbeat meeting with the   in December. That modest approach, which even the most   executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections,  Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was forced to step down from one of the administration’s advisory councils. “People voted with their feet, and Travis listened,” said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100, 000. “We need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way. ” Resistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home. “You don’t have a voice with the president if you didn’t vote for him,” he said. “But employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values. ” Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses. Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. “It’s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,” said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They all have the same leanings. ” Mr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google’s former slogan “Don’t be evil” is the most forceful expression of this. “If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,” Mr. Shotts said. Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration.   hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards,” and saying it would create “much collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values. ” At an   meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington State’s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort, Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said. The immigration battle is in Microsoft’s  .   of its employees were affected by the order, the company said. Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there. “In 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,” said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. “The most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation. ” Mr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous “for the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren’t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can’t fix the monetization of fake news. ” Perhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up. Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified. It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a   for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of   Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software. “I’ve actually been pretty obsessed with C. R. M.s lately,” said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help. Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the     Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.   in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore. New York Seattle Boston and other cities. He talked about Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of “Lean In,” which asks women, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women’s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march. When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it. “We have to protest in public,” he said. The event raised $30, 000 for the legal aid groups. “It looked like   of the room were newcomers,” Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement. “I want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,” he said. “We have to make sure we’re pushing at least as hard as Trump is. ”"

On May 17th, Willis Eschenbach posted “Sailing on the Solar Wind” on WUWT. In it he used a graph of the daily solar wind data since 1963. I wish to thank Willis for his effort in tabulating the daily data AND for making it available for the rest of us.
That graph had some shapes that were hauntingly familiar. Here it is, repeated, but with the vertical axis reversed. Less solar wind is warming, more is cooling.

Figure 1 is a plot of the daily solar wind data since 1963, courtesy of Willis Eschenbach, here.
I saw two large white-space notches in this plot, one at 1996-7, and another at 2008-9, where the solar wind decreased for long periods. These are just before the two recent El Niños of 1998 and 2010. I downloaded Willis’s data and converted it to monthly averages so that it could be compared to the various available temperature data. Here (Figure 2) is that data with a three-month centered average applied to both the solar wind data and the Hadley Center HADSST3 sea-surface temperature.

Figure 2 is a plot of the solar wind (inverted) and sea surface temperature since 1963.

Note the similarity. The solar wind acts similarly to the cosmic ray impact described in Cosmic Rays and the Impact On Climate. A decrease in solar wind occurs just prior to an increase in temperature. This probably happens because the solar wind acts in a similar fashion as CME’s in producing Forbush decreases in Neutron flux. Both produce an increase in cosmic ray production of cloud nuclei. But why the delay? Several temperature data bases were investigated and compared, using one-month delay steps and computing the R-squared value in Excel for each comparison. Figure 3 resulted:

Figure 3 is a plot of the response to a solar wind change (reduction) on various temperature databases. All temperature data were obtained from www.woodfortrees.org. and de-trended.
Two questions are suggested by this data. Where is the initial temperature change taking place? And why is there a delay? The answers seem to be: 1) The initial warming is in the tropics, specifically in the central Pacific in the El Niño region. In that area, there is no delay, the warming occurs immediately and for the following 3 or 4 months. (The green trace.) The other sea surface temperature data base, HADSST3, and its 3-month average, also reflect the initial immediate warming, but also have a peak at 8 months after, probably for those areas away from the tropics that are warmed later, either by moving currents, or by moving atmosphere.
The land data, HADCRUT4, shows a peak at 8 months and again at 11 months. The reason becomes a little clearer when the hemispheric components are examined. The southern hemisphere reacts quickly then drops off after 8 months, probably because the oceans react faster than the land. The northern hemisphere reacts at 8 months and 11 months because the northern hemisphere has greater land mass.
I recognize that this relationship is speculative. But the relationships seen in Figure 3 are consistent and devoid of “noise”. Delays outside of the range shown have consistently very low R-squared values. It is suggested that this research area bears further study.

I get an encouraging volume of feedback publishing these reviews. Some people disagree at times and give me their own angle on the candidates. Occasionally a candidate will express displeasure about their own rating but even then, the feedback is communicated politely which I really appreciate and don’t always deserve.   




Near the beginning of this project, I rated the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board (East Coast Bays subdivision) and missed someone from the list: Independent candidate **Victoria Short.** Several people pointed this out rather quickly. I resolved to be more careful from now on. Weeks later, supporters of Victoria are still politely asking me to look at this again, suggesting that she would actually be a far better candidate than others I had recommended.  
  
Given the support Victoria Short has from a wide selection of residents in East Coast Bays, I decided to swallow my embarrassment and have another look before voting papers start going out to letter boxes. Victoria Short has worked as an electorate agent for 6 years for a local MP, while Alexis Poppelbaum, listed above Short in voting guides, has also mentioned working in Murray McCully’s electorate office.   




I can see how I’ve made this mistake and, based on what I know now, think it would be an injustice to do nothing.  




 **Hibiscus and Bays Local Board (East Coast Bays subdivision): TAKE 2!**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



There are 11 candidates standing for four positions. You may cast up to four votes in this FPP election.  




 **Edward Benson-Cooper** – Independent **$**  




A chiropractor currently serving on the Waitemata District Health Board. It ran a deficit of nearly $15 million in 2018. 



Moving along…



 **Christina Bettany** – Backing the Bays **$$**



Has served one term. From her profile:



“I am passionate about our environment so have taken a special interest in sedimentation, recycling and waste management. I have been an active supporter of our local environmental groups in their planting and pest-free programmes as well as stream restoration initiatives.”



Sounds fine.



“I take climate change issues seriously.”



You bloody had to add that, didn’t you.



Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a climate change denier. I’m a climate change is a role for Auckland Council denier.



 **James (Jim) Brown** – Independent **$$$$$**



Doesn’t look like he shortened his name out of frustration at people [asking if he was related to the singer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI1NfFExOSo)



“His concerns for the area include Transport and deterioration of Infrastructure. ‘Our community has outgrown its facilities and we’ve overreached our support network’. He can’t promise to fix these problems, but what he can offer is a focus on practical solutions using logic, a common-sense attitude, a willing ear and an open mind.”



That sounds just sensible enough for me to pretend I didn’t see common-sense mentioned.



 **David Cooper** – Independent **$$**



A current local board member. I’m curious as to why the 2016 People over Politics ticket is no more. Maybe it is the hollow ring of ‘People Before Profit’ which always results in no profit for the people.



He has a background in infrastructure engineering and strongly supports openness and transparency, having voted for the unsuccessful motion to open up local board workshops to public view.



I’m told Cooper is a keen golfer. A very keen golfer. Judging by the way he allegedly organises his diary, golf is a higher priority than local board meetings. But I couldn’t possibly speculate…



 **Elizabeth Hall**



Hall is concerned that every day items are not always available locally and believes that with new apartment buildings and rest homes, the town centres need diverse well stocked shops.  
  
Doesn’t go on to advocate Hibiscus Coast and Bays Local Board run supermarkets but she doesn’t really need to.



 **Gary Holmes** – Backing the Bays **$$**



Currently serving on the local board, Holmes has been accused of a conflict of interest for managing four Business Improvement Districts; the Glen Innes, Uptown, Dominion Road and North West business associations – through his company Campaigns Ltd.



In 2013, when six storey apartments were proposed for Browns Bay, [Gary Holmes accused planners and councillors of using Browns Bay](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/8362530/High-rise-plans-are-flawed-says-councillor) “like a token in their game of Monopoly where they are trying to see how many people they can squeeze into the small seaside suburb”.



However Holmes has been only too happy to advocate for high-rises in the [BIDS that his company manages.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106665885/auckland-council-agencys-posh-apartment-plan-knocked-back)



 **Julia Parfitt** – Backing the Bays **$$$$**



Should Julia be unsuccessful in her candidacy for Albany ward, she will romp home for the local board.



 **Susana Perez** – Independent **$$$**



Perez moved to New Zealand in 1996 and has been involved in multiple charity groups including the East Coast Bays Lions. She is interested in improving road safety and the provision of adequate lighting on roads. Her interest in improving recycling is outside the proviso of local board but appears to be standing for the first time, so I think that can be overlooked.



 **Alexis Poppelbaum** – Backing the Bays **$$$$$**



Having worked as a senior staffer to Murray McCully, Poppelbaum may well be very effective if current East Coast Bays MP Erica Stanford is a measure of the talent McCully’s former office contains. A policy Analyst at PHARMAC and Communications Manager at the Brain Health Research Centre and experience in planning and preparing multi-million dollar budgets.  
  
Take my vote!



 **Victoria Short** – Independent **$$$$$**



Victoria is a life-long East Coast Bays resident and with six years experience liaising with Council and central government supporting an electorate MP, she will know the system inside out. If elected for her first term, Short will hit the ground running with the knowledge and abilities to match many incumbents. Victoria is familiar with the speed at which the area is growing and recognises the urgent need for East Coast Bays to invest in additional infrastructure to cope as well as upgrading existing facilities.



She also wants to improve engagement between residents and the local board so that those who want to be involved in decision making have the opportunity to be heard.



Based on the feedback I’ve had from residents and elected representatives of East Coast Bays and beyond, Short is hard-working and very knowledgeable. Her excellent engagement with parliamentary constituents really speaks for itself, when so many locals have spoken on her behalf to fix her omission from the original article.



 **Glen Stanton** – Independent **$**



Glen is also standing for the Upper Harbour Local Board. He wants the beaches cleaned up and coastal walkways upgraded. His dream project is a World Class walkway from Browns Bay to Takapuna.  
  
Could that be a legacy project with a third-world class price tag?



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You get four votes

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

When Beth sought help to flee her abusive partner before the first lockdown in March, she and her daughter were placed in a women's refuge.
But she fears women in that situation today might not get that as domestic abuse services warn a lack of capacity will lead to more people dying.
The Welsh Government said Â£1.3m had been spent to help accommodate victims.
Domestic violence services say they have struggled to cope with a surge in referrals since schools reopened in September, with many cases previously going unreported.
Charities NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid say support services for children in Wales were already ""sparse"" and ""underfunded"", with people relying on a ""postcode lottery"".
""He was accusing me of sleeping with other people while I was working,"" said Beth, which is not her real name and is being used to protect her identity.
""He would say I wasn't a fit enough mother to look after his daughter. It was then becoming physical.
""He began to push me, shove me, kick me out of the bed. One day I had a bottle of Coke poured over my head because I was accused of not calling him when his food was ready.
""It was having an impact on the little one, she was hearing and seeing things.""
Beth, from south Wales, managed to flee and spent the next eight months living in a women's refuge with her 11-year-old daughter, who has complex needs.
Beth said she finally decided to call for help after her mother threatened to ring social services - but she had to wait for her partner to leave for work and her daughter to go to school.
She said making that initial phone call was the most difficult step.
""It's the not knowing where you're going to go after that phone call, who's at the end of the phone and who's going to help you,"" she explained.
Beth said social services managed to find her a refuge before she went to pick her daughter up from school that day.
""[My daughter] was all questions about why I hadn't brought my own car to pick her up,"" she recalled.
""I explained that we weren't going home and I remember her saying to me: 'We'll be ok now and we'll be safe, because daddy can't shout and do anything now can he?'""
A domestic abuse service in Powys says it has had to put a waiting list in place after a ""huge surge"" in cases, and feared the worst for those they could not support.
""We're really struggling with referrals and for the first time in my career, we've had to introduce a waiting list,"" said Kate Annison, who runs the children's service at Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre in Newtown.
She said referrals had more than doubled between August and October compared to last year, adding that children's support services often reveal more about the scale of the abuse taking place.
""The children are disclosing a lot of things that were happening over the previous lockdown or are still happening. There's been a huge surge in cases,"" Ms Annison said.
""We've had to put six people on the waiting list for support so far - that's four families.
""Making people wait even a short amount of time could mean that they get hurt really badly. These decisions we're making could ultimately result in a death.""
She said her team were already aware of a case where a family member died after being told there was not enough space in any refuges.
""We know they tried a few different services in a few different areas but failed to find any space,"" she said.
""Unfortunately, they then pulled out of trying to find somewhere and there was a fatality in that family.
""That victim was asking for support at the time they were able to, potentially when the perpetrator was not around.
""If we'd have had the capacity as a nation to put them into refuge then they would be safe now. Unfortunately, due to the lack of capacity, there is somebody who's died and young people are in care.""
Both NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid said many services were underfunded and relied on charitable donations and grants to get by.
""What the pandemic has done has just exacerbated something that was struggling already,"" said Angelina Rodriques, of the Atal Y Fro refuge and support service in the Vale of Glamorgan.
""If a service hasn't got the finances or the resources, then all you're doing is holding women and children on waiting lists.
""Referrals are coming in every day and you can't keep up. We're doing the best that we can in this situation, but we're missing loads of people around the Vale of Glamorgan.
""It will result in people losing their lives, because they can't get the support at that time.""
Despite now feeling safe, Beth said she feared the long-term impact of the pandemic on victims of domestic abuse.
""I think it will be 100 times more difficult to reach out to those services now,"" she explained.
""If I was in the same position in March or April then I don't think I would have got out, I think I would still be there.
""You need to get out of there before that predator even knows anything about what's going on - you need to get out that door.""
A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise the extreme pressures facing women fleeing domestic abuse with children.
""This year we have invested over Â£1.3m for disbursed community accommodation for those for whom refuge might not be the right answer.""
She added it had provided local authorities with Â£50m for housing support, including for those fleeing domestic abuse, as well as other grants, guidance and training.

"PARIS  —   Former President Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered by a judge to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012   campaign, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday, the latest impediment for a politician who not long ago was hoping for a comeback. Mr. Sarkozy, 62, a mercurial   politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling. Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3, 750 euros, or about $4, 000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the   Republican Party. His diminished role in French politics would limit the fallout from a trial, but the judge’s decision comes amid growing anger against the political establishment and reflects increased scrutiny of its financial and personal arrangements. Mr. Sarkozy would be the second French president since 1958 to go on trial for a financial scandal. Jacques Chirac, who was president from 1995 to 2007, was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of embezzlement and misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris. More recently, Christine Lagarde, a former economy minister for Mr. Sarkozy who went on to head the International Monetary Fund, was convicted in December of negligence for misusing public funds, but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. François Fillon, Mr. Sarkozy’s former prime minister and the Republican presidential candidate, is bearing the brunt of the current outrage after revelations that he used taxpayer money to pay family members for parliamentary work that might not have been genuine. In Mr. Sarkozy’s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law. At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18. 6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top   who included Mr. Sarkozy. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants. The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy’s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign. The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy’s campaign from the electoral authorities. Mr. Sarkozy has repeatedly denied being aware of any false billing, and the prosecutors have not charged him with wrongdoing in that regard. Instead, the charges of illegal campaign financing relate only to the overspending, for which he has already paid a fine. Thirteen other people  —   including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion  —   were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor’s office said on Tuesday. Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy’s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence. “The clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,” he said, “as it illustrates the inanity of the decision. ” Mr. Sarkozy tried a political comeback last year, steering his presidential primary campaign rightward and hoping that the French electorate would look past his legal entanglements. But he was knocked out of   presidential primaries in November. Mr. Fillon was recently embroiled in legal problems of his own, after revelations in the French news media that he used taxpayer money to put his wife and children on the payroll, ostensibly as parliamentary aides. The revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents  —   Mr. Sarkozy primarily  —   was untainted by legal scandals. “There is no point in talking about authority when you are not yourself irreproachable,” Mr. Fillon said in August during the primary campaign. “Who can imagine for a single moment General de Gaulle placed under formal investigation?” he added, a clear swipe against Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Fillon has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in the presidential race, despite opinion polls showing that he is no longer the favorite and might not advance to the second round of the elections."

Cato's Annual Monetary Conference last November hosted a ""shadow review"" of the Federal Reserve's own self-review, dedicated to examining ""whether the U.S. monetary policy framework can be improved to meet future challenges."" The articles in the spring/summer 2020 issue of the _Cato Journal_ , drawn from that conference, are now available online.



With inflation then consistent with the Fed's 2 percent target and unemployment at remarkable lows, the Fed likely didn't expect that the ""future challenges"" it planned to address would come so soon, or be so extreme. Today, thanks to the federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic shuttering businesses across the country, the Fed has once again reduced its policy rate almost to zero, while renewing its large-scale asset purchases and undertaking an unprecedented program of emergency lending that has all but erased the conventional boundary line separating monetary from fiscal policy. These developments make a reexamination of the Fed's policy framework seem even more important than they were last fall.



In his Editor's Note, Cato Vice President for Monetary Studies James A. Dorn writes that today, ""central banks have… greater discretion and lending authority than ever before. Monetary policy has morphed into fiscal policy. The Fed is in uncharted waters and a review of policies aimed at the 2008 financial crisis is inadequate. A major assessment of central banking and alternative money regimes is overdue."" Several participants in last fall's event have updated their articles to reflect these developments.



In the spirit of fostering dialogue and debate about what we can learn from past policy errors and how to apply those lessons going forward, the _Cato Journal_ is proud to present the articles summarized below. (To access the full text of an article, click on its title.)



 **""The Federal Reserve's Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices,"" **Richard H. Clarida, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Since the 2008 crisis, the global economy has changed in two critical ways, Clarida says. First, the natural rate of interest has fallen, and remained, well below its precrisis baseline. That makes it harder for central bankers to conduct effective countercyclical policy (which often means lowering their policy interest rate) during economic recessions. With the Fed's primary policy strategy increasingly in doubt, the Board of Governors is considering new tools it can use at the zero lower bound.



Second, the short-run Phillips curve, measuring the relationship between inflation and unemployment, is flattening. In and of itself, that's not necessarily a bad thing—but it does mean that Fed policymakers should take exceptional care to keep inflation at their self-assigned, 2 percent target, which they work to maintain together with maximum employment.



Given these changes, Clarida outlines three questions that the Fed needs to address in its review. First, given its mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, should the Fed reconsider its current practice of ""forgiving"" past inflation shortfalls or surpluses, without attempting to compensate for them? While it's possible for the Fed to adopt ""makeup"" strategies to correct for inflation inconsistencies, this can work only if the public trusts central bankers to stick to them, which may be asking a lot. Second, does the Fed need different tools to reliably fulfill its dual mandate? While Clarida does not say whether the Fed might retire any of its existing policy tools, he does say that Fed leaders are thinking about adding new ones. Finally, how can the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) improve the way it communicates with the public? While it does so more often, and in more ways, than it once did, Clarida suggests that there is still room for improvement.



 **""Independence and Accountability via Inflation Targeting,"" **Peter N. Ireland, Murray and Monti Professor of Economics at Boston College and Member of the Shadow Open Market Committee



Holding central bankers accountable for their decisions is vital to insulating them from partisan pressures. Yet, according to Ireland, accountability has proven difficult to achieve in practice. He illustrates this using examples from the Fed's own history: in the 1970s, ""despite the occasional appearance of a statistical Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment… [political efforts] to exploit that Phillips curve led… not to lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation but instead to the worst of both worlds."" Only ""by focusing first on keeping inflation low,"" and not on propping up employment numbers, did future Fed chairs restore the American economy and its labor force. ""Unemployment fluctuates no matter what,"" Ireland explains, ""but keeping inflation low and stable can promote the Fed's full employment objective.""



Ireland recommends that the Federal Reserve replace its current mandate with ""a new, streamlined mandate… to focus on stabilizing inflation around its own self-declared 2 percent target."" A numeric inflation target remains a key ""institutional safeguard"" for keeping Fed policymakers accountable to the public—while insulating them from political pressures.



 **""A Look Back at the Consensus Statement,""** Jeffrey M. Lacker, former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Distinguished Professor of Economics at Virginia Commonwealth University



The Federal Reserve only formalized the terms of its dual mandate in 2012, with the release of its ""Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy"" (often abbreviated as its ""consensus statement""). Lacker discusses two factors that may have limited the statement's efficacy. First, the FOMC advertised the consensus statement as a mere formalization of existing policy, meaning it produced only a minimal change in the public's inflation expectations. Second, it neglects to specify a numeric employment target—or even a concrete metric for its goal of ""maximum employment.""



Drawing from these lessons, Lacker makes recommendations for the Fed's current policy review. He commends the statement for beginning to rectify some of the more ""problematic"" elements of the Fed's dual mandate—namely, that ""it injects distributional politics directly into monetary policy"" by specifying a numeric inflation target. Yet the Fed must now decide whether, or how, to compensate when it misses that target. It must also resolve ongoing questions surrounding its employment mandate.



 **""NGDP Targeting and the Public,"" **Carola Binder, Assistant Professor of Economics at Haverford College



When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) first considered replacing its existing inflation-targeting regime with nominal gross domestic product (NGDP) targeting, the idea didn't get much of a hearing. Several years removed from that initial discussion, Binder gives NGDP level targeting a second look, arguing it compares favorably to inflation targeting when it comes to weathering new threats to central bank credibility and independence. The global trend toward populism does not bode well for central banks, which, being ""unpopular by design,"" are frequently the lightning rods of populist discourse: Binder's data show that regimes classified as ""populist"" or ""nationalist"" put greater political pressure on central banks—and higher pressure is also correlated with higher rates of inflation.



The Fed's ""twin deficits"" of credibility and trust make it all the more vulnerable to political interference. Partly to blame is that the FOMC conducts monetary policy via inflation targeting, which it has a harder time explaining to the public. Switching to NGDP level targeting, Binder says, would make the Fed's actions ""easier to communicate, more popular, and less prone to political interference than a flexible inflation target or dual mandate."" It would also ""allow the Fed to frame its policy decisions in terms of income rather than inflation""—something that households and politicians can see and feel directly, which makes it easier to grasp. Nor would the switch cause any major policy disruption: in fact, had the Fed switched to NGDP level targeting in 2012, it would seem all the more successful today, given the steady growth rate NGDP has maintained since the last recession. What's more, the low inflation and unemployment rates that we had seen from 2017 until quite recently would look like a policy victory, rather than an anomaly ""casting existential doubt on the Fed's model of the economy"" (which assumes that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated).



The Fed can protect its independence and enhance its credibility by replacing its dual mandate with a ""single, explicit, numerical"" NGDP level target, Binder says. This will make it easier for the public to gauge the Federal Reserve's credibility, easier for Fed officials to explain their decisions, and harder for politicians to subject the Federal Reserve to partisan interference.



 **""Federal Reserve Policy in a World of Low Interest Rates,"" **Eric R. Sims, Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame and NBER Research Associate, and Jing Cynthia Wu, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame and NBER Faculty Research Fellow



Since the last crisis, interest rates around the world have found a new normal: nearly zero percent. That's typical even for flourishing economies—and that might signal trouble for central bankers whose main monetary policy strategy is interest rate targeting. Because that strategy generally means keeping the central bank's policy interest rate in line with the natural market rate of interest, a natural rate of zero jeopardizes the central bank's ability to conduct accommodative monetary policy—which often means lowering their policy rate—in the event of a recession. Sims and Wu ask whether this new reality of near-zero interest rates requires a new policy framework to match—one that can better address the increased risk of natural rates hitting the zero lower bound.



While some suggest that the next recession might warrant sub-zero interest rates, Sims and Wu show that cutting rates below zero is not effective at stimulating recessed economies. Yet the converse strategy—gradually transitioning to a higher policy rate regime before the next recession hits—is equally fraught, and unlikely to do much good. Instead of shifting policy rates, they suggest that the Fed continue using two of its most powerful postcrisis tools, quantitative easing and forward guidance, to combat economic stagnation when natural interest rates broach their zero lower bound.



 **""Operating Regimes and Fed Independence,"" **Charles I. Plosser, former President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia



The Fed's postcrisis operating regime makes it more vulnerable to partisan pressures, Plosser writes, by allowing the size of the Fed's balance sheet, and therefore the overall volume of reserves, to have little—if any—bearing on its monetary policy decisions. As long as large excess reserves remain a standing feature of the Fed's operating regime, there is no limit to how large its balance sheet can become. This makes Fed policy a prime target for congressional meddling, with elected lawmakers coveting the central bank's abundant reserves for their own purposes. Indeed, lawmakers have already succeeded in funneling Fed money toward their pet projects: the crisis era bailouts, FAST act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were all funded by Congress exploiting the Fed's ""power"" to detach its balance sheet from the stance of monetary policy. Plosser writes that it is imperative that the Fed revise its current operating regime in order to protect its independence from congressional whims.



 **""How QE Changed the Shape of the U.S. Yield Curve,"" **Manmohan Singh, Senior Financial Economist, International Monetary Fund, and Rohit Goel, Financial Sector Expert, International Monetary Fund



Lending firms often re-use long-term securities as collateral for short-term loans, which they use to purchase additional long-term, interest-earning assets. Borrowing firms get that collateral back immediately upon repaying those loans—meaning that the same long-term securities can get ""recycled"" through short-term lending markets again and again. Re-using high-quality bonds as short-term collateral is a process ""akin to the money creation that takes place when banks take deposits and make loans,"" Singh and Goel write; and it ""change[s] the effective supply and demand dynamics at the long-end [of the yield curve], which then feeds back into short-term rates."" Their article is the first to analyze how that relationship has changed since the 2008 crisis. Before 2008, short-term policy rates ""drove"" interest rate behavior at the right end of the yield curve, so that ""market expectations about the future path of the overnight federal funds rate were reflected in 10-year yields and beyond."" Postcrisis, however, transactions using long-term securities as short-term collateral are fewer, and the influence these transactions have on short-term market rates are weaker.



Quantitative easing (QE) may play a role in that. An abundance of high-quality collateral ""lubricates"" the money markets. When, during a round of QE, a central bank buys up this long-term collateral and transforms it into so many permanent, static holdings on its balance sheet, its market availability declines, money markets dry out, and short-term interest rates rise. New regulations compound these effects, especially leverage ratios limiting how much collateral banks can hold, relative to reserves, at any given time.



Post-pandemic, Singh and Goel write, central banks should reduce the size of their balance sheets, and by extension, their role in lending markets. Unwinding central bank balance sheets, while freeing up more space for the assets commercial banks can hold on theirs, ""is likely to improve transmission to the short-end money market rates."" Regulatory changes should also keep ""central bank reserves and U.S. Treasuries… as equal as possible,"" granting dealer banks more freedom to exchange some of their leverage (in the form of reserves) for collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasuries). That, in turn, will bolster the velocity and money-creating power of that collateral. This is especially important now, since ""Covid-19 related bailouts will keep central banks' footprint even larger for even longer, unless regulations are softened to allow dealer banks more balance sheet capacity.""



 **""Monetary Policy Operating Frameworks: Are Reforms Heading in the Right Direction?"" **Andrew Filardo, Head of Monetary Policy, Bank for International Settlements and Visiting Fellow, Hoover Institution



Filardo examines the repeated, and unexpected, interest rate spikes that rattled financial markets during the final months of 2018 and September 2019. Many blamed these episodes on the Fed's gradual balance sheet unwind, which added risk to the market and subtracted reserves. Yet Filardo counters that these spikes were instead ""symptoms of deeper pathologies."" In particular, he attributes them to flaws in how ""monetary policy operations have been adapted to the new financial regulatory environment.""



Contrary to claims that the Fed's postcrisis, ""floor-based"" operating system offers the best chance of stabilizing the money markets, Filardo argues it actually _weakens_ incentives for financial institutions to lend to, and monitor, one another. With the Fed pumping large quantities of reserves into the market whenever money becomes scarce, private institutions rely on one another less for overnight lending. That makes them less likely to monitor one another's risk-taking behavior. If the Fed increases its lending activities, it could further erode market trust and stability. Filardo recommends two reforms for returning responsibility to the hands of private financial institutions. First, the Fed should abandon its current floor system and return to its precrisis corridor system. Second, it should adopt Filardo's own ""sequestered reserve rule,"" requiring financial institutions and regulators to negotiate an ""appropriate preannounced level of reserves necessary to satisfy liquidity regulations."" That ratio would curb institutions from hoarding excess reserves and encourage them to use reserves, alongside other high-quality liquid assets, in their day-to-day operations.



 **""Upgrading the Fed's Operating Framework,"" **David Beckworth, Director of the Monetary Policy Program at the George Mason University Mercatus Center



Beckworth reviews some of the major macroeconomic lessons of the last decade, examining monetary policy strategy experiments from around the globe—ranging from interest rate policy adjustments, to quantitative easing cycles, to policies aimed at expanding the monetary base. Ultimately, his survey leads him to suggest three measures for making the Fed more resilient to future crises. Along with adapting its operating framework for both positive and negative interest rate scenarios, switching from interest rate targeting to NGDP level targeting will help the Fed ""provide meaningful forward guidance."" To enhance the credibility of the Fed's operating framework, Beckworth also recommends that the Fed set up a standing fiscal facility for making ""helicopter money"" drops—with the stipulation that this facility be used only when the natural rate of interest breaches the zero lower bound. While he concedes that such a facility would allow monetary policymakers to engage in fiscal policy operations, he adds that its terms should be clearly outlined to keep the Fed's ability to marry fiscal and monetary policy constrained, rules-based, and limited in both duration and scope.



 **""Central Banking and the Rule of Law,"" **Paul Tucker, former Deputy Governor, Bank of England



How can central banks can restore their legitimacy and integrity when their incentives to compromise both are so high? Tucker approaches this question from the standpoint of political and constitutional theory, rather than economics, which lends a unique perspective to his analysis. ""[M]ost discussions, and especially justifications, of central bank independence are expressed entirely in the language of economics,"" he says; and economics, ""positing a benign sovereign, sets out to achieve a flourishing society in which well-being is maximized."" Political theory, on the other hand, ""alert to the possibility of a malign sovereign, aims to avoid tyranny.""



In constitutional democracies, Tucker says, central banks should not be exempt from ""the values of democracy, constitutionalism… and of the rule of law."" To that end, central bankers should design a transparent, rules-based, ""money-credit constitution"" for measuring their compliance with policy mandates. They should also be required to explain publicly any departures that constitution's terms. Central bankers should also keep their balance sheets ""as simple and small as possible""; avoid making drastic discretionary policy changes; resist lending to insolvent firms; and develop transparent contingency plans for would-be extraordinary circumstances that may require them to temporarily increase their financial-market footprints.



 **""How Natural Language Processing Will Improve Central Bank Accountability and Policy,"" **Charles W. Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia Business School, and Harry Mamaysky, Director of the Program for Financial Studies, Columbia Business School



However else central banking may change, central bank transparency is likely to improve, rather than worsen, in the near future. That's thanks to innovations in natural language processing (NLP) software, which can detect speech and language patterns associated with obfuscation or manipulation. While Fed bankers have a tendency to withhold the truth from the public, it's rarely out of malice. Instead, by making central bankers shoulder so many responsibilities—and therefore expose themselves to more blame—during economic difficulties, discretionary and unsystematic policy frameworks encourages them to dissemble. What's more, the lack of a definitive set of goals and metrics by which the public can hold them to account makes it easier for central bankers to dodge questions or provide meaningless answers about their policy decisions.



NLP can begin to address these challenges—with techniques that highlight evasive, long-winded explanations, or technology that reveals vague, meaningless, or redundant language in Fed policy statements. Calomiris and Mamaysky identify three ways that they foresee NLP improving central bank communications. First, NLP can help measure ""how nonsystematic and nontransparent policy is"" or reveal when central bankers ""are failing to disclose their true beliefs about a policy."" Second, NLP acts as a ""mind reader,"" clarifying ""which economic phenomena central bank policies are actually responding to."" It also works as an ""information leveler,"" reducing ""the information asymmetry between central bankers and the public about the state of the economy."" The authors predict that as NLP technology becomes more advanced, Fed policy will become more transparent (and systematic) in turn, with central bankers facing new incentives ""to recognize and address observable shortcomings.""



 **""How Politics Shapes Federal Reserve Communications,"" **Sarah Binder, Professor of Political Science, GWU and Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution, and Mark Spindel, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Potomac River Capital, LLC



Binder and Spindel reflect on the political origins—and consequences—of the double bind the Fed faces in its communication strategy. While transparency is vital for stabilizing market expectations and keeping central bankers accountable, it also makes it easier for politicians to blame the Fed when the economy sours. Now, conflicting and often impossible demands from Congress and the President make it nearly impossible for Fed officials to communicate openly. The authors discuss how our increasingly polarized political climate harms Fed transparency and independence, especially when it comes to inflation targeting and balance sheet operations.



One of the most politically troubling economic trends facing the Fed is the weakening relationship between inflation and unemployment. The idea that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated has been a bedrock of Fed policy for decades, and is even the basis of the Fed's dual mandate. Now, however, ""setting market expectations of future policy"" through forward guidance ""is near impossible in light of the Fed's uncertainties."" At the same time, the Fed faces aggressive political jawboning from President Trump. Between the President's ""procyclical pressure for more dovish policy… compounded by already low rates and an enfeebled Phillips curve,"" the Fed has dispensed with most of its communications strategies and ""limited itself to meeting-by-meeting policy choices.""



Nor are these choices themselves free from political pressure. When it comes to managing inflation expectations, former Federal Reserve officials have refused to consider higher inflation targets, not for economic reasons as much as out of fear that Congress might object. Similarly, the Fed's balance sheet policies are at once a topic of congressional criticism and exploitation: though Republican and Democrat lawmakers have each questioned the Fed's paying interest on excess reserves, they have also both ""tapped Federal Reserve profits (a partial by-product of large balance sheet policies) to help fund political priorities.""



 **""Pitfalls of Makeup Strategies for Mitigating the Effective Lower Bound,"" **Andrew T. Levin, Professor of Economics, Dartmouth College, and Arunima Sinha, Assistant Professor of Economics, Fordham University



Levin and Sihna discuss three factors that make ""makeup strategies"" prone to failure. First is the challenge of ""expectations formation"": the public may not trust the Fed to carry through on a given makeup strategy; and unless people expect the Fed to change its own policy, they are unlikely to change their own patterns of spending and saving. Second is ""imperfect credibility"": the less credible a central bank is, the less capable it will be of influencing market behavior. Even a well-functioning and trustworthy central bank is not entirely credible—throwing the outcome of even the soundest make-up strategy in doubt. Third is ""model uncertainty"": all economic policies rely, to some degree, on economic modeling; and make-up strategies are no exception. Yet models are not markets, and cannot mirror reality perfectly. At best, models can merely help policymakers form educated guesses about how their strategies will pan out.



 **""Envisioning Monetary Freedom,"" **George Selgin, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives



Selgin's contribution addresses the question: what might a free market monetary system of the not-too-distant future be like? He begins by noting that, ""if monetary freedom means anything, it means that people are free to choose what sort of money they will keep on hand, or accept from others, in exchange for their labor, goods, or services. And enjoying such freedom… means that government regulations neither compel people to use any particular sort of currency nor prevent entrepreneurs making alternatives to the dollar."" What sort of monetary arrangements would these conditions give rise to? Among the changes Selgin contemplates are the fate of the U.S. dollar, new incentives for borrowers and lenders, and currency competition and valuation. The dollar will likely prevail in the short-term, he writes, with either a ""convertibility rule"" or a ""quantity rule"" regulating the total amount in circulation.



As for regulatory incentives, Selgin imagines a world where ""both explicit and implicit deposit insurance,"" are done away with, followed by ""all bank regulations [aside from those that] enforce voluntary contracts"" between borrowers and lenders. (That includes all government bailout guarantees.) Future financial transactions will be mostly digital and ""made using convertible [cash] substitutes, supplied by banks or other companies,"" tracked and executed by ""an intricate clearing and settlement system,"" he says. He also discusses ""converting today's Federal Reserve banks into so many private clearing houses,"" and allowing commercial banks the option to transact with them or a variety of competing clearing house systems.



Just how dramatic the changes will be between today's monetary system and that of a future, freer society, Selgin says, will depend not only on _what_ changes are made—but _how_ we make them.



 **""The Fed's Precrisis Monetary Framework is Well-Suited for a Free Society,"" **Bill Nelson, Executive Vice President and Chief Economist, Bank Policy Institute



Before the 2007–09 financial crisis, the Fed's primary means of regulating the money supply were purchasing U.S. Treasuries and conducting short-term sales of government securities. These limited functions meant it seldom intervened in day-to-day market transactions. Banks borrowed and lent among one another, and the Fed served only as their lender of last resort. Postcrisis, the Fed has augmented its earlier operating framework dramatically. Nelson discusses the consequences of these changes and makes recommendations for reform. He addresses the Fed's decision to house unlimited Treasury deposits at Federal Reserve banks as well as the Fed's QE3 (or ""QE Infinity"" program), which continued well past its promised conclusion date. Extending QE postponed, and then altered, the Fed's earlier plans to renormalize its balance sheet. Rather than sell back the assets it had purchased from market dealers, as it first intended, the Fed opted instead to allow those assets to roll off as they mature.



Nelson argues that returning to the Fed's pre-2008 operating framework will help the economy run far more smoothly going forward. He outlines the steps the Fed should take to shrink its balance sheet and reinstate its ""scarce reserves"" regime. First, it should tame fluctuations in its own reserve balance (which shifts wildly owing to ups and downs in the Treasury General Account, or TGA) by relying on frequent repo operations in the short run, and by shifting more of the TGA's reserves to the private sector in the long run. Second, it should dispel the popular misconception that TGA deposits are counted among the Fed's own assets. It should also enact policies that encourage banks to rely on collateralized daylight overdrafts and use the Fed's discount window judiciously—not as a first recourse for borrowing. It should also unwind its own asset portfolio as soon as possible.



 **""Four Principles for a Base Money Regime,"" **William J. Luther, Assistant Professor of Economics, Florida Atlantic University and Director, AIER Sound Money Project



Four properties define the optimal base money regime, writes Luther. The first is a stable inflation rate. While economists continue to debate whether the optimal inflation rate is slightly negative or slightly positive, it is certainly close to zero, Luther says—likely somewhere ""between –4 percent and 4 percent."" The second is demand-elasticity: changes in the total quantity of base money should depend, not on central bankers' discretion, but rather market demand. Luther adds the caveat that a ""demand-elastic"" regime does not mean adjusting the base money supply upon every shock in the real supply, ""since real shocks tend to be concentrated on a particular subset of markets."" The third is a uniform global currency. Not only does a uniform currency facilitate exchange in myriad direct and indirect ways; it also increases the benefits of exchange. ""A common currency area prevents a regionally specific money-supply mechanism,"" Luther writes. ""However, the financial system routes funds to those demanding them and remaining differences in regional price levels are relative-price differences. Taken together, this implies that the optimal currency area is the maximum currency area""—which is to say, global. The fourth is incentive-compatibility: those charged with creating and maintaining the monetary regime must not only be legally required, but incentive-bound, to uphold the rules by which it operates. While Luther notes that no monetary regime anywhere in the world possesses all four of these attributes, he says that taken together, they can serve as a guidepost for comparing, and improving upon, the ones in existence today.



 **""Money, Stability, and Free Societies,"" **Steve H. Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics, Johns Hopkins University



The greatest threat that financial crises pose to free societies, Hanke writes, is not the supply shock that comes with it, but the civil liberty constraints that come after it. He outlines three strategies for improving global monetary stability overall, and in turn reducing the immediate and long-term threats financial crises pose to our prosperity. The first is to formalize a loose, yet official, exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Hanke recommends that this rate be somewhere between $1.20 and $1.40 per euro. The second is to replace at least 100 central banks around the world with currency boards, which Hanke considers more stable, since unlike a central bank, a currency board is entirely non-discretionary and ""cannot engage in the fiduciary issue of money."" Its sole function is rather ""to exchange the domestic currency it issues for an anchor currency at a fixed rate,"" meaning that ""the quantity of domestic currency in circulation is determined by market forces."" Because currency boards have ""a [fixed] exchange rate policy… but no monetary policy,"" their economies consistently perform better than central banks' in areas like financial stability, lower inflation, debt reduction, and market productivity. Hanke's third recommendation is that governments greenlight private currency board systems, including digital currency boards like Libra. Like most businesses, central banks tend to regard these competitors as threats to their own market primacy. Unlike most businesses, however, central banks can effectively bar their competitors from entry via institutional strictures. Hanke argues against this: ""The competitive forces that will be unleashed by the private alternatives would be a great stabilizer and enhance economic freedom and free societies.""

"**The government has been setting out its case for tougher coronavirus measures. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said England's second national lockdown was brought in to stop the health service being ""physically overwhelmed"".**
The lockdown - which started on 5 November - is due to be replaced tomorrow by a stricter tier system.
Mr Gove was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme for the evidence behind the government's decisions.
He made a number of claims:
He's pretty much right. We make average bed occupancy in England over that weekend 87%, but on average - between 1 November and 22 November - it was about 88%.
Bed occupancy can be used to measure pressure on the health service, and hospitals are meant to try to keep occupancy rates below 85% to have some wriggle-room in case of a surge in patients.
But in previous winters it has often exceeded this. For example, on average over the past four years, the first week in December (we don't have comparable November data) has an occupancy rate of 95%.
This appears to show that hospitals are under less pressure than usual.
However, this is a very different year, says Helen Buckingham, director of strategy at the Nuffield Trust.
""The hospitals have significant constraints in how they can use their beds compared to previous years in relation to infection control and Covid. The measures they have to put in place mean they cannot use all the capacity they've got.""
For example, NHS Providers points out that hospitals are arranged differently this year, effectively split into three zones: beds for those with coronavirus, those awaiting test results and those who are negative.
And issues such as increased infection control - including cleaning and putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) - will take up more staffing time, reducing the number of beds that may be used.
""Another thing that's different this year is the availability of staff. We tend to think of beds as a piece a furniture, but a bed is no use to people unless you can staff it,"" says Ms Buckingham.
Staff absences due to illness or self-isolation will have an impact. During the last peak in April, absence rates hit 6.2% compared with 4% in the previous year.
So lower bed occupancy does not necessarily mean that demand or pressures are lower. NHS Providers says these pressures are currently more similar to a normal year than the figures suggest.
Finally, some of this lower bed occupancy is by design.
Surges in cases can happen very quickly. It took just a month for the number of people in hospitals with coronavirus to triple between October and November.
Mr Gove pointed to the R number when England entered its second lockdown on 5 November as evidence of the need for tighter restrictions.
The R number refers to the rate of reproduction of the virus. An R rate of one means that each infected person is passing it onto one other person.
Mr Gove was correct. Analysis from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which was published on 6 November but relied upon data up to 3 November, estimated the R rate was between 1.1 and 1.3 in England.
In the North West, the range of R was between 1.0 and 1.2. This was probably because Liverpool and Manchester had entered tier three by that point and had been under enhanced restrictions for months.
Mr Gove also claimed in the interview with the Today programme that ""as a result of the steps that we took, we were able to bring the R rate down and it's now below 1 across the country"".
According to data up to 24 November gathered by Sage, the R number in England has now fallen to between 0.9 and 1.0.
However, in five out of the seven regions in England, the upper limit of the range remains above 1.
The relevant ONS data is its infection survey, which is published weekly.
This doesn't normally include growth rates but the ONS published a special dataset on 31 October that did include these.
The special dataset shows the infection doubling time for the six-week period 12 Sept to 23 October, so not quite the ""six weeks before the announcement"" claimed (the lockdown was announced on 31 October).
The average over the six-week period was indeed that infections doubled in 15 days.
The regional figures show that the West Midlands and East Midlands, not the East of England as Mr Gove claimed, had a doubling rate of 12 days over this period.
However, neither the West Midlands nor the East Midlands are low-prevalence areas in terms of their infection rates.
The main infection survey report published at the same time shows infection rates in the East of England, South West and South East as less than half that of the two Midlands regions.

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

Barack Obama’s success at cultivating minorities, especially immigrants, seems to have caught the attention of Republican political strategists.



It isn’t clear how they missed the boat, since there are almost 40 million foreign‐​born people living in the U.S. — about 12.9 percent of the population. California has the highest percentage of foreign‐​born people (25.4 percent), followed by New York (10.8 percent), Texas (10.4 percent) and Florida (9.2 percent). Altogether, about three‐​quarters of foreign‐​born people live in 10 states.



How can Republicans appeal to immigrants now? Having talked so much about building electrified fences along our borders, denying jobs for unauthorized immigrants and deporting them, Republicans don’t have much credibility on this issue. “The GOP has a long history of fumbling immigration,” as Jason L. Riley put it delicately in his book _Let Them In_.



What are Republicans to do? Since they’re on a dead‐​end street, they must turn around, but they’ll have to do it convincingly — as if they like it and believe in it. Republicans since Ronald Reagan have generally supported pro‐​growth policies, so the most credible way to reach immigrants would be to aggressively promote an agenda that’s all about growth and opportunity.



A pro‐​growth agenda would look something like this: (1) cut taxes across the board, including taxes paid by investors and job creators; (2) simplify the tax code; (3) phase out regulations that make it more costly and difficult to create private sector jobs; (4) phase out regulations that throttle (or threaten to throttle) energy production; (5) phase out regulations that restrict trade; (6) stop politicians from trying to pick winners and lavish special privileges on political cronies; (7) no more bailouts — let the parties involved with a troubled company resolve issues in an established bankruptcy proceeding; (8) direct the Fed to protect the value of the U.S. dollar, so everyone can make plans for the future with more confidence; and (9) phase out immigration quotas.



Many Republicans might object to the idea of ending quotas that restrict the number of able‐​bodied immigrants who don’t pose national security risks. But Republicans believe in a market economy, and a market economy thrives when there’s free movement of people, goods and capital. Republicans sometimes seem to have forgotten about the free movement of people.



Consider that in the decade between 1900 and 1909, a near record 8.2 million immigrants arrived at our shores. About the only immigrants denied entry into the United States were those believed to have a disease or a criminal record. During this decade, the percentage foreign‐​born people in the population was at an all‐​time high. According to the Census Bureau’s _Historical Statistics of the United States_ , unemployment got down to 1.7 percent (in 1906) — the lowest recorded peacetime level in U.S. history.



How could this be? Well, when taxes are low, when there are few regulatory obstacles to enterprise, and it’s easy and inexpensive to start a business — entrepreneurs can create productive jobs fast, maintaining low unemployment even when the labor force expands rapidly.



Immigrants themselves create a substantial share of new jobs. Immigrants include the most entrepreneurial part of our population, because they take the very difficult step of leaving their homeland. By coming to America, they demonstrate that they’re open to new things and willing to work hard. The labor force participation rate of recent immigrants is reported as high as 94 percent, about one third higher than the general population.



A Kauffman Foundation study about Silicon Valley in the 1980s and 1990s pointed out that (1) immigrants accounted for about one‐​third of the scientists and engineers, and (2) Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs managed a quarter of the technology businesses. These businesses generated more than $16 billion of annual revenue and employed more than 58,000 people.



A 2007 study by researchers at Duke University and the University of California (Berkeley) analyzed high tech businesses started between 1995 and 2005. More than one quarter had at least one founder who was foreign‐​born. Their companies generated more than $50 billion of annual revenue and employed over 450,000 people.



A 2012 follow‐​up study by researchers at Duke University, the University of California (Berkeley) and Stanford University reported that “43.9 percent of Silicon Valley startups founded in the last seven years had at least one key founder who was an immigrant.” These companies generated more than $60 billion of revenue and employed some 560,000 people.



According to the National Science Foundation, during the last half‐​century, foreign‐​born students earned three‐​quarters of U.S. doctorate degrees in mathematics, engineering and computer science. Once they graduate, U.S. educated foreign students are awarded patents at a significantly higher rate than U.S.-born workers.



Moreover, economist Gordon H. Hanson, at the University of California (San Diego), reported in _The Cato Journal_ , “U.S. university departments that have more foreign graduate students produce more academic publications and have their work cited more frequently.”



Incredibly, U.S. immigration laws drive away many entrepreneurial immigrants, despite their immense contributions. The waiting list for a permanent resident visa (green card) has been as long as 10 years.



As a consequence, the Kauffman Foundation reported, the percentage of companies started in the U.S. by immigrants has begun to decline. Apparently this is because tens of thousands of immigrants have gone back where they came from to start businesses. About 80 percent of the Chinese surveyed and 70 percent of the Indians reported that the business climate is now better at home. This is a competitive world, and the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate.



MIT President Susan Hockfield noted that a quarter‐​century ago, the U.S. was _the_ place to be for technology innovators, but she warned that fewer foreign‐​born innovators are willing to put up with the “indignities” of our immigration laws. So much for immigration restrictions that harm us by driving away high‐​skill people.



What about low‐​skill immigrants? They’re people who commonly do farming, construction, maintenance, food service and household work.



First of all, these are often physically demanding jobs that most Americans don’t seem to be interested in. Also, many of the jobs are seasonal and require that workers move from place to place. Most Americans have more attractive options, in part because their English is better.



Second, some of the low‐​skill immigrant jobs — especially household work — enable high‐​skill people to spend more time on their professional work, particularly when such couples have children. Consequently, low‐​skill immigrants enable us to gain more benefits from high‐​skill people.



Third, the income people earn upon arriving in the United States is a poor predictor of future achievement. If we turned away every immigrant who didn’t have much money, we would have missed large numbers of people who became great successes. One need only recall the mass immigration of eastern European Jews who arrived destitute. They squeezed into New York City’s Lower East Side tenements, some 700 people per acre — reportedly more crowded than the slums of Bombay. Many of these people found work as day laborers, but their children became doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs.



Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Thomas Sowell reported that “immigrants begin economically below the level of existing members of their own ethnic group already in the country, but eventually rise to surpass them. The lengthy period required to equal the economic level of people of the same race or ethnicity born on American soil suggests the amount of human capital needed — experience, contacts, personal and institutional savvy.



However, the fact that immigrants eventually surpass their native‐​born counterparts also suggests that migration is a selective process, bringing the more ambitious or venturesome elements of a population.”



Beyond the economic benefits of immigration, there are enormous cultural benefits. New York and California are cultural capitals, in part, because they have high foreign‐​born populations. People tend to become more cosmopolitan when exposed to very different ideas about business, science, technology, art, music, literature, fashion, cuisine and all sorts of other things.



Immigrants probably first began to enrich our culture with their food. The overwhelming majority of foods we love are foreign‐​born — they originated someplace else.



Archeological evidence suggests that chickens were first domesticated in Pakistan. Sheep seem to have been first domesticated in what is now Iraq. Cattle, in Greece and Anatolia. The Egyptians were among the earliest people to cultivate wheat.



Apples are considered about as wholesomely American as anything can be, but the apple, _Malus pumila_ , seems to have come from central Asia. Pears and grapes are from central Asia, too. Oranges, peaches, apricots and Japanese plums are from China. Bananas, from India or Malaysia. Pineapples, from Brazil or Paraguay. Cherries, from northern Europe. Olives originated in the eastern Mediterranean.



As for vegetables, garlic and onions originated in central Asia. Scallions, sometimes referred to as Welsh onions, are from China.



The earliest green peas – _Pisum sativum_ – were cultivated around India, Ethiopia and the Near East.



Potatoes originated in the Andes, possibly Chile from which they were probably brought to Peru, then to Ireland during the 16th century, and Irish immigrants introduced potatoes to New England.



A meager‐​looking maize probably originated in Peru, then crossed with other varieties to emerge in Guatemala as flour corn which was brought to North America and hybridized into modern sweet corn during the 19th century.



Tomatoes originated in the Andes, but perhaps because they’re in the same botanical family as deadly nightshade, Americans avoided them until the 18th century, after Europeans showed they weren’t poisonous.



The American language became the richest in the world, because the settlers encountered so many different kinds of people.



From Native American languages came words like raccoon, possum, caribou, moose, skunk, squash, hickory, pecan, persimmon, moccasin and caucus. The names of most U.S. states are based on Native American words: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North & South Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.



A surprising number of American words are from Arabic, like alfalfa, algebra, sofa, spinach, sugar, carat, coffee, candy, cotton, giraffe, safari, jar, racquet, guitar, hummus, lemon, lime, orange, magazine, mattress, mummy, tariff, tuna, assassin and zero.



Many American words come from Spanish, like chile, chocolate, oregano, banana, avocado, barbecue, cafeteria, mosquito, alligator, rodeo, mustang, burro, corral, plaza, cannibal, canoe, cargo, poncho, stampede, tornado, bonanza, armada, amigo and adios.



Among the French contributions to our language: portage, chauffeur, acrobat, action, biscuit, caramel, chowder, cache, bomb, blonde, caress, camouflage, prairie, chapel, gopher, beauty, bribe, bureaucrat, calendar, bogus, chute, depot, début, capitalist and résumé.



The Dutch gave us cookie, cruller, waffle, cole‐​slaw, decoy, filibuster, golf, iceberg, leak, pump, skate, smuggler, spook, stove, aloof, bamboo, booze, boss, bedspread, wagon, sled, yacht, tulip, Santa Claus and Yankee.



Italians gave us mainly words about good living — spaghetti, ravioli, pizza, arugula, artichoke, broccoli, chianti, minestrone, ciabatta, panini, coffee, latte and cappuccino, as well as vista, harmonica, piano and opera. Then there’s volcano, umbrella, bankrupt, mafia, fiasco and gonzo.



From the Chinese: chow‐​main, chop‐​suey, stir‐​fry, ketchup, flophouse, kowtow and tycoon. Soy‐​bean, sushi, tofu, kimono, futon, bonsai, karate, jiu‐​jitsu, honcho and sayonara come from the Japanese.



Words of Yiddish origin include bagel, lox, blintze, nosh, kosher, kibitz, klutz, tush, schlemiel, spiel and schlep.



Germans gave us frankfurter, hamburger, delicatessen, sauerkraut, noodle, pumpernickel, pretzel, kindergarden, dunk, dumb, loafer, bum, gabfest and slugfest.



One might add that before English settlers came to America, their language had absorbed words from many different places, too. Over time, immigrants and their descendants go into so many different fields that the cultural benefits of immigration multiply.



Consider the Germans. The long list includes astronaut Neil Armstrong, dancer Fred Astaire, _Wizard of Oz_ author L. Frank Baum, landscape painter Albert Bierstadt, brewer Adolphus Busch, singer John Denver, entertainment entrepreneur Walt Disney, physicist Albert Einstein, New York Yankee legend Lou Gehrig, condiment king Henry J. Heinz, hotelier Conrad Hilton, comedian David Letterman, novelist Thomas Mann, dishwasher entrepreneur Frederick Maytag, journalist H.L. Mencken, movie director Mike Nichols, _New York Times_ publisher Adolph Ochs, pharmaceutical entrepreneur Charles Pfizer, architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, slugger Babe Ruth, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, novelist John Steinbeck, piano maker Henry E. Steinway, blue jeans peddler Levi Strauss, real estate wheeler‐​dealer Donald Trump and electrical industry pioneer George Westinghouse.



To be sure, not every immigrant contribution to our culture is wonderful, but not everything that native‐​born people do is wonderful, either. We’re free to choose what we like.



One of the most serious concerns about immigrants is that they’ll come here for entitlement benefits. This is an inherent problem with welfare states: they try to take care of those in need, but if they’re too generous, they undermine incentives to work, and everybody is worse off. Immigrants could become resented as freeloaders, which has happened in Europe.



For the record, authorized as well as unauthorized immigrants are barred from receiving federal welfare benefits. On the other hand, all children, including the children of foreign‐​born parents, are required to attend school. In addition, Medicaid is available for the children of immigrants. Others are treated in hospital emergency rooms, often at public expense.



Of course, entitlement benefits undermine the incentives for native‐​born people to work, too. Increasingly, the United States is divided between those who receive more government benefits than they pay in taxes, and those who pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. This problem has little to do with immigration.



Many opponents of open immigration seem to believe that some immigrants are more supportive of a free society than others. Europeans, for instance. But Great Britain, where so many historic breakthroughs for liberty occurred, adopted forced labor during the late 1940s, and it has had a big welfare state ever since, as does France, Italy and the rest of Europe.



Many entrepreneurial immigrants come from India which has a socialist state and China which has a communist state. Meanwhile, we see Hispanics working hard almost everywhere.



Questions have been raised about Muslim immigrants who presumably came here to escape oppressive regimes in the Mideast, Asia and North Africa. It is disquieting, though, not to hear many moderate Muslims speaking out against radical Islam.



What about Obama’s effort to recruit more Democratic voters among immigrants?



He might encounter difficulties. People seem less willing to support other races, nationalities or ethnic groups, than they are to support their own kind. In Los Angeles, for example, Latinos have resented blacks who held a far larger percentage of municipal jobs than their percentage of the population. Blacks, the least entrepreneurially inclined, have resented Latino entrepreneurs who mainly hired other Latinos by word‐​of‐​mouth. Similarly, a Los Angeles hospital, intended to serve blacks, ended up primarily serving Latinos, because the neighborhood changed. Blacks also resented Koreans — the most entrepreneurial of immigrant groups — and during the Los Angeles riots of the early 1990s, reportedly about 40 percent of the businesses torched were Korean. The _Washington Post_ went so far as to suggest that the “biggest bigots” are often minorities.



Several studies have suggested that the United States, until now anyway, has had much lower levels of welfare state spending and taxation than Europe, because the United States is more ethnically diversified, and there are more people concerned that their taxes will benefit another group.



Phasing out immigration quotas could help promote ethnic diversity and have an unintended consequence of undermining the political consensus for entitlements. This would be a good thing from the standpoint of federal finances, since runaway entitlement spending is the most important single factor that drives federal spending, deficits and debt, making it harder to fund other governmental functions.



If Republicans can do a better job promoting the freedom philosophy and pro‐​growth policies, enabling entrepreneurs to create more businesses and jobs, then it might be perceived as the party of real opportunity, which would help it become politically competitive again.



Nothing, not even welfare state freebies, is likely to be as persuasive as freedom, growth, jobs and prosperity.

"**Hospitality staff in some level two areas of Scotland are facing a ""torrent of abuse"" when turning away central belt visitors, MSPs have been told.**
Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, detailed instances of abuse directed at workers, which he described as ""frankly unacceptable"".
He said it was due to travellers going from level four to level two areas.
The Scottish government condemned such incidents and said all its decisions were aimed at keeping people safe.
People living in level three or level four local authorities - covering much of central Scotland - are currently not allowed to make non-essential journeys outside their own council area.
Different hospitality arrangements are also in place across the different levels.
Discussing his own hotel in Lockerbie, Mr Montgomery said: ""The weekend before last we were subjected to a torrent of abuse from people coming from the central belt - possibly going to the Gretna Gateway area to do some Christmas shopping.
""We had a protocol where we ask for a postcode and where they're coming from when people ring.
""Whenever you tell them you can't take the booking because of where they're from, the abuse staff are taking is frankly unacceptable.""
Mr Montgomery said both operators and customers had been left confused by the current system.
He said some staff in Dumfries and Galloway had also been subjected to abuse from people who had travelled from the central belt only to find they could not be served in pubs or restaurants.
He said there had been similar cases in the Scottish Borders and other areas in level two.
Giving evidence to MSPs, he said: ""We are faced with so many different tier systems that from one week we're open, next week we're not, we don't know where we are.""
He said that led to ""confusion"" for businesses and customers.
The Scottish government said it condemned any abuse of staff doing their part to ensure restrictions and guidelines were followed.
It said it had to balance measures to suppress the virus and protect lives with keeping businesses open and trading viably.
A spokesperson added it believed the current restrictions achieved that but it would continue ""constructive"" dialogue with the hospitality industry to listen to its concerns."
"ATLANTA  —   What, exactly, do you do with a    work of art, mythmaking and Civil War history that is longer than a football field, more than 40 feet tall and urgently in need of a new home? This city is finding out. After decades of deepening disrepair and disinterest in the painting commonly known as the Atlanta Cyclorama, workers this month are moving the panorama as part of a $35 million plan to rescue and maintain a titanic, deteriorating example of an art form that has mostly disappeared. Saving “The Battle of Atlanta,” which is among the largest oil paintings in the world, has proved to be an undertaking of remarkable complexity. It is rife with logistical tests, engineering quandaries, curatorial challenges and political and racial sensitivities that linger more than 150 years after Gen. William T. Sherman’s military campaign here. Yet after taxpayers spent years supporting an imperiled painting in a building troubled by leaks and temperature fluctuations, formal opposition to the effort, which is privately funded by multiple philanthropists, is strikingly scarce. “The fact that this painting has survived when so many others were left out to mold and rot and get burned up and whatever is nothing short of a miracle,” said Gordon L. Jones, the senior military historian and curator at the Atlanta History Center, which reached a license agreement with the City of Atlanta to display the cyclorama. “Everything that we know about Civil War memory, all of those stories, can in some way be described by using this painting as an example,” Dr. Jones said. Indeed. “The Battle of Atlanta,” prepared in Milwaukee by a team of German artists, was completed in 1886, when cycloramas  —   massive panoramic projects intended to give viewers the sensation of standing in the depicted landscape  —   were a leading form of entertainment, and the colossal works traveled the country. During its tour of the North, “Atlanta” was widely interpreted as depicting the 1864 struggle here for what it was: a decisive and pivotal victory for the Union that left an estimated 12, 140 people dead, most of them Confederate troops. Then the exhibition moved to the South, and in November 1892, The Atlanta Constitution newspaper printed a masterstroke of spin: an advertisement that said the cyclorama’s scene was the “only Confederate victory ever painted. ” The painting swiftly attracted large, and almost exclusively white, audiences and was donated to the city around the turn of the century. But the crowds dwindled, in part because motion pictures increasingly replaced cycloramas as entertainment, and generations of decline began. A major restoration that concluded in 1982 bought the Atlanta Cyclorama more time before the painting’s quality and appeal began to wane again. In recent years, elementary schoolteachers leading    field trips were among the most loyal visitors to the cyclorama. “I remember that when I took my permission slip home, my mom and my dad had a conversation,” said Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta, 47, who is black. “I remember it not being a typical permission slip that was quickly signed. ” But it fell to Mr. Reed, who will leave office next year, to help solve the contemporary riddle of what to do with the cyclorama, which black residents, in an earlier time, were allowed to view only one day a month. The city announced the agreement with the Atlanta History Center in 2014. The center will display the   relic on its   campus, located in an upscale area of Atlanta that includes the Governor’s Mansion and some of the city’s finest restaurants. The plan comes  —   somewhat serendipitously, its organizers said  —   at a time of scattered efforts in the South to move beyond the traditional Old South narrative surrounding the Civil War. In 2014, for example, the Georgia Historical Society dedicated a marker that sought to undermine what it described as “popular myth” about Sherman’s cruelty during the war. “It helps to bring some emphasis to why what happened here was important and why it’s not your grandfather’s Civil War anymore,” Dr. Jones said of   scholarship and presentation of the war. Mr. Reed said he was not bothered by the painting’s continuing prominence and possible resurgence. “As a black person, I’m quite comfortable with it because I know how the end of the movie turned out,” the mayor said. “The right result was reached. That doesn’t mean that we should not be privy to an expansive story of how we got to who we are today. ” But the deal that Mr. Reed helped to broker created the complicated task of moving the painting from the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum, which closed in 2015 to prepare for a relocation that will cumulatively require about 200 people. Not long ago, a   expert from the History Center’s insurer called Jackson McQuigg, the center’s vice president of properties, with a polite, terse request: “Walk me through it. ” Workers, Mr. McQuigg replied, will spend days rolling the painting, which is appraised at $7. 5 million, onto a pair of   spools. A crane will slowly lift the spools  —   “We’re hoping   goes faster,” Mr. McQuigg said in an interview  —   through   holes cut in the roof of the nearly   building. Then, once the   painting is resting aboard two trucks, the workers will let the clock tick. “We’re going to wait until everybody goes home and the traffic dies down and there’s no more Atlanta rush hour,” Mr. McQuigg said in the musty room where the cyclorama has hung for generations. “Heck, it might be 3 in the morning. ” The cyclorama’s former home will be converted into an event space for Zoo Atlanta, a private nonprofit. The painting, once it has been relocated, will undergo extensive restoration efforts before its formal reopening, scheduled for fall 2018. Among panorama proponents, the project in Atlanta, more than eight years after a restoration of the “Battle of Gettysburg” cyclorama in Pennsylvania, is seen as a crucial effort to preserve the medium’s past. Fewer than two dozen cycloramas from the late 1800s and early 1900s are believed to have survived the last century. “It’s a chance to represent a really major and widely consumed art form that most people have really forgotten about,” said Sara Velas, the president of the International Panorama Council and the artistic director of the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles. “It’s still impactful and entertaining, even if our attention span has changed from what it was in the 19th century. ” And in Atlanta, a city that was a cradle of the civil rights movement but is within sight of a   monument to the Confederacy at Stone Mountain, reviving the “Battle of Atlanta” cyclorama is also a means to clarifying history. “It’s been caught up in ‘the Lost Cause,’ and that made it a sore subject for a lot of people,” Dr. Jones said of the painting that stood nearby, shrouded in scaffolding. “We’ve got to unwrap that, and we’ve got to get past that, and we’ve got to be able to talk about ‘the Lost Cause’ objectively and talk about it for what it is and what it’s not. This is a way we can do that. ”"

By Ed Caryl
Nils-Axel Môrner is a Swedish sea level specialist. He claims that sea level is not rising more than about 1.1 mm/year, that the satellite data has been wrongly calibrated, and uplift and subsidence errors have contaminated the tide gauge records. In my research on sea level, some articles and papers show facts that indicate he might not be wrong.
The majority of tide gauges are at population centers that are also in areas where uplift and subsidence occur. For example, most of the east coast of the U. S. is subsiding, and most of Scandinavia is rebounding. The Pacific rim is very tectonically active with a mixture of up and down. So the real question is:
What is the sea level trend that most people are experiencing?
It is the sea level average trend for all tide gauges without any correction for uplift or subsidence. Here is that figure, their Figure 10, from here,

/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 1 is a simple mean trend of all raw data from all tide gauges, with no corrections, simply normalized relative to their 1961 to 1990 values. The lower plot is the number of extant stations in each year. The trend in the upper plot from 1900 to 2000 is about 0.5 mm/year or less.
Figure 1 would seem to indicate that sea level might have been higher in 1900 than at present. This is not true. The problem is that in 1900 there were only 40 or 50 stations, and they were skewed toward stations with subsidence problems showing rapidly rising sea level. As the station numbers increased, more stations were added with uplift or stability, rather than added stations with subsidence, skewing the data in the opposite direction. But, the upper plot in Figure 1 is the sea level experience of most of the population.

By WUWT regular “Just The Facts”
During the first crowdsourcing thread for the under construction WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page, we had a number solid recommendations and WUWT moderator D.B. Stealey dropped a virtual mountain of links into comments  here and here. The result is that the original WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page has more than doubled in size and continues to grow as more comments from the prior crowdsourcing thread are added. Given the large number of additions and the fact that we now have a number of near-duplicate graphs, it seemed prudent to continue this crowdsourcing exercise to gain further input on the validity and value of each and all of the graphs.
There will likely be at least one more crowdsourcing thread for the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page, in order to assess a number of the currently disputed, questionable and falsified graphs, including Briffa et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1998, Mann et al., 1998, Pollack et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1998, Mann et al., 1999, Mann et al., 2000, Briffa et al., 2001, Esper et al., 2002 and Jones and Mann 2004, AR4 section 6.6.1.1 2007 and Marcott et al. 2013. Note that two (1, 2) of the graphs currently on the Paleoclimate page have a Disputed label, as per this comment and Alley’s own graph, the x axis label should read Years Before Present (1950 AD) not (2000 AD)

However, disputes aside, a gigantic thank you to D.B. Stealey, and all of those who have contributed to the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page. The following are some of the new additions to the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page:

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

I am Patrick J. Michaels, Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington DC, and Cato is my sole source of employment income. Before I begin my testimony, I would like to make clear that my comments are solely my own and do not represent any official position of the Cato Institute.



My testimony concerns the selective science that underlies the existing federal determination of the Social Cost of Carbon and how a more inclusive and considered process would have resulted in a lower value for the social cost of carbon.



Back in 2015, the federal government’s Interagency Working Group (IWG) on the Social Cost of Carbon released a report that was a response to public comments of the IWG’s determination of the social cost of carbon that were solicited by the Office of Management and Budget in November 2013. Of the 140 unique sets of substantive comments received (including a set of my own), the IWG adopted none. And apart from some minor updates to its discussion on uncertainty, the IWG, in its most recent August 2016 report, retained the same, now obsolete, methodologies that were used in its initial 2010 SCC determination.



Here, I address why this decision was based on a set of flimsy, internally inconsistent excuses and amounts to a continuation of the IWG’s exclusion of the most relevant science—an exclusion which assures that low, or even negative values of the social cost of carbon (which would imply a net benefit of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels), do not find their way into cost/benefit analyses of proposed federal actions. If, in fact, the social cost of carbon were near zero, it would eliminate the justification for any federal action (greenhouse gas emissions regulations, ethanol mandates, miles per gallon standards, solar/wind subsidies, DoE efficiency regulations, etc.) geared towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.



 _Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity_



In May 2013, the Interagency Working Group produced an updated SCC value by incorporating revisions to the underlying three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) used by the IWG in its initial 2010 SCC determination. But, at that time, the IWG did _not_ update the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) employed in the IAMs. This was not done, despite, now, there having been, since January 1, 2011, at least 16 new studies and 32 experiments (involving more than 50 researchers) examining the ECS, each lowering the best estimate and tightening the error distribution about that estimate. Instead, the IWG wrote in its 2013 report: “It does not revisit other interagency modeling decisions (e.g., with regard to the discount rate, reference case socioeconomic and emission scenarios, or equilibrium climate sensitivity).”



This decision was reaffirmed by the IWG in July 2015 and again in its most recent August 2016 report. But, through its reaffirmation, the IWG has again refused to give credence to and recognize the importance of what is now becoming mainstream science—that the most likely value of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower than that used by the IWG and that the estimate is much better constrained. This situation has profound implications for the determination of the SCC and yet continues to be summarily dismissed by the IWG.



The earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined by the IWG in its 2010 report (hereafter, IWG2010) as “the long-term increase in the annual global-average surface temperature from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to pre-industrial levels (or stabilization at a concentration of approximately 550 parts per million (ppm))” and is recognized as “a key input parameter” for the integrated assessment models used to determine the social cost of carbon.



The IWG2010 report has an entire section (Section III.D) dedicated to describing how an estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the scientific uncertainties surrounding its actual value are developed and incorporated in the IWG’s analysis. The IWG2010, in fact, developed its own probability density function (pdf) for the ECS and used it in each of the three IAMs, superseding the ECS pdfs used by the original IAMs developers. The IWG’s intent was to develop an ECS pdf which most closely matched the description of the ECS as given in the _Fourth Assessment Report_ of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change which was published in 2007.



The functional form adopted by the IWG2010 was a calibrated version of the Roe and Baker (2007) distribution. It was described in the IWG2010 report in the following Table and Figure (from the IWG2010 report):







The calibrated Roe and Baker functional form used by the IWG2010 is _no longer scientifically defensible;_ nor was it at the time of the publication of the IWG 2013 SCC update, nor at the time of the August 2016 update.



The figure below vividly illustrates this fact, as it compares the best estimate and 90% confidence range of the earth's ECS as used by the IWG (calibrated Roe and Baker) against findings in the scientific literature published since January 1, 2011.



Whereas the IWG ECS distribution has a median value of 3.0°C and 5th and 95th percentile values of 1.72°C and 7.14°C, respectively, the corresponding values averaged from the recent scientific literature are ~2.0°C (median), ~1.1°C (5th percentile), and ~3.5°C (95th percentile).



These differences will have large and significant impacts on the SCC determination.





_CAPTION: The median (indicated by the small vertical line) and 90% confidence range (indicated by the horizontal line with arrowheads) of the climate sensitivity estimate used by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon Climate (Roe and Baker, 2007) is indicated by the top black arrowed line. The average of the similar values from 22 different determinations reported in the recent scientific literature is given by the grey arrowed line (second line from the top). The sensitivity estimates from the 32 individual determinations of the ECS as reported in new research published after January 1, 2011 are indicated by the colored arrowed lines. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. Likewise, Bates (2016) presents eight estimates and the green box encompasses them. Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing._



In addition to recent studies aimed at directly determining the equilibrium climate sensitivity (included in the chart above), there have been several other major studies which have produced results which qualitatively suggest a climate sensitivity lower than mainstream (e.g. Roe and Baker calibration) estimates. Such studies include new insights on cloud condensation nuclei and cosmic rays (Kirkby et al., 2016), radiative forcing of clouds (Bellouin, 2016; Stevens, 2015), cloud processes (Mauritsen and Stevens, 2015) and the underestimation of terrestrial CO2 uptake (Sun et al., 2014).



The IWG2010 report noted that, concerning the low end of the ECS distribution, its determination reflected a greater degree of certainty that a low ECS value could be excluded than did the IPCC. From the IWG2010 (p. 14):



“Finally, we note the IPCC judgment that the equilibrium climate sensitivity “is very likely larger than 1.5°C.” Although the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution, for which the probability of equilibrium climate sensitivity being greater than 1.5°C is almost 99 percent, is not inconsistent with the IPCC definition of “very likely” as “greater than 90 percent probability,” it reflects a greater degree of certainty about very low values of ECS than was expressed by the IPCC.”



In other words, the IWG used its _judgment_ that the lower bound of the ECS distribution was higher than the IPCC 2007 assessment indicated. However, the collection of the recent literature on the ECS shows the IWG’s judgment to be in error. As can be seen in the chart above, the large majority of the findings on ECS in the recent literature indicate that the lower bound (i.e., 5th percentile) of the ECS distribution is lower than the IPCC 2007 assessment. And, the average value of the 5th percentile in the recent literature (~1.1°C) is 0.62°C _less_ than that used by the IWG—a sizeable and important difference which will influence the SCC determination.



In fact, the abundance of literature supporting a lower climate sensitivity was at least partially reflected in the new IPCC assessment report issued in 2013. In that report, the IPCC reported:



Equilibrium climate sensitivity is _likely_ in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( _high confidence_ ), _extremely unlikely_ less than 1°C ( _high confidence_ ), and _very unlikely_ greater than 6°C ( _medium confidence_ ). The lower temperature limit of the assessed _likely_ range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4…



Clearly, the IWG’s assessment of the low end of the probability density function that best describes the current level of scientific understanding of the climate sensitivity is incorrect and indefensible.



But even more influential in the SCC determination is the upper bound (i.e., 95th percentile) of the ECS probability distribution.



The IWG2010 notes (p.14) that the calibrated Roe and Baker distribution better reflects the IPCC judgment that “values substantially higher than 4.5°C still cannot be excluded.” The IWG2010 further notes that



“Although the IPCC made no quantitative judgment, the 95th percentile of the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution (7.1 °C) is much closer to the mean and the median (7.2 °C) of the 95th percentiles of 21 previous studies summarized by Newbold and Daigneault (2009). It is also closer to the mean (7.5 °C) and median (7.9 °C) of the nine truncated distributions examined by the IPCC (Hegerl, et al., 2006) than are the 95th percentiles of the three other calibrated distributions (5.2–6.0 °C).”



In other words, the IWG2010 turned towards surveys of the scientific literature to determine its assessment of an appropriate value for the 95th percentile of the ECS distribution. Now, some seven years later, the scientific literature tells different story.



Instead of a 95th percentile value of 7.14°C, as used by the IWG2010, a survey of the recent scientific literature suggests a value of ~3.5°C—more than 50% lower.



And this is very significant and important difference because the high end of the ECS distribution has a large impact on the SCC determination—a fact frequently commented on by the IWG2010.



For example, from IWG2010 (p.26):



“As previously discussed, low probability, high impact events are incorporated into the SCC values through explicit consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. Although FUND does not include catastrophic damages (in contrast to the other two models), its probabilistic treatment of the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter will directly affect the non‐​catastrophic damages that are a function of the rate of temperature change.”



And further (p.30):



 _Uncertainty in extrapolation of damages to high temperatures_ : The damage functions in these IAMs are typically calibrated by estimating damages at moderate temperature increases (e.g., DICE [Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy] was calibrated at 2.5 °C) and extrapolated to far higher temperatures by assuming that damages increase as some power of the temperature change. Hence, estimated damages are far more uncertain under more extreme climate change scenarios.



And the entirety of Section V “A Further Discussion of Catastrophic Impacts and Damage Functions” of the IWG 2010 report describes “tipping points” and “damage functions” that are probabilities assigned to different values of global temperature change. Table 6 from the IWG2010 indicated the probabilities of various tipping points.





The likelihood of occurrence of these low probability, high impact, events (“tipping points”) is _greatly_ diminished under the new ECS findings. The average 95th percentile value of the new literature survey is only ~3.5°C indicating a very low probability of a warming reaching 3-5°C by 2100 as indicated in the 3rd column of the above Table and thus a significantly lower probability that such tipping points will be reached. This new information will have a large impact on the final SCC determination using the IWG’s methodology.



The size of this impact has been directly investigated.



In their _Comment on the Landmark Legal Foundation Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule Standards for Standby Mode and Off Mode Microwave Ovens_ , Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2013) ran the DICE model using the distribution of the ECS as described by Otto et al. (2013)—a paper published in the recent scientific literature which includes 17 authors, 15 of which were lead authors of chapters in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s _Fifth Assessment Report_. The most likely value of the ECS reported by Otto et al. (2013) was described as  
“2.0°C, with a 5–95% confidence interval of 1.2–3.9°C.” Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC by 42 percent, 41 percent, and 35 percent (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). This is a significant decline.



In subsequent research, Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) examined the performance of the FUND (Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution) model, and found that it too, produced a greatly diminished value for the SCC when run with the Otto et al. distribution of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC produced by the FUND model to $11, $6, $0 compared with the original $30, $17, $2 (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). Again, this is a significant decline.



The Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) results using FUND were in line with alternative estimates of the impact of a lower climate sensitivity on the FUND model SCC determination.



Waldhoff et al. (2011) investigated the sensitivity of the FUND model to changes in the ECS. Waldhoff et al. (2011) found that changing the ECS distribution such that the mean of the distribution was lowered from 3.0°C to 2.0°C had the effect of lowering the SCC by 60 percent (from a 2010 SCC estimate of $8/ton of CO2 to $3/ton in $1995). While Waldhoff et al. (2011) examined FUNDv3.5, the response of the current version (v3.8) of the FUND model should be similar.



Additionally, the developer of the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model, affirmed that the SCC from the PAGE model, too drops by 35% when the Otto et al. (2013) climate sensitivity distribution is employed (Hope, 2013).



More recently, the FUND and DICE model were run with equilibrium climate sensitivities that were determined by Lewis and Curry (2014) in an analysis which updated and expanded upon the results of Otto et al. (2013). In Dayaratna et al. (2017), the probability density function (pdf) for the equilibrium climate sensitivity determined from an energy budget model (Lewis and Curry, 2014) was used instead of the Roe and Baker calibrated pdf used by the IWG. In doing so, Dayaranta et al. (2017) report:



“In the DICE model the average SCC falls by 30–50% depending on the discount rate, while in the FUND model the average SCC falls by over 80%. The span of estimates across discount rates also shrinks considerably, implying less sensitivity to this parameter choice…Furthermore the probability of a negative SCC (implying CO2 emissions are a positive externality) jumps dramatically using an empirical ECS distribution.”



These studies make clear that the strong dependence of the social cost of carbon on the distribution of the estimates of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (including the median, and the upper and lower certainty bounds) requires that the periodic updates to the IWG SCC determination must include a critical examination of the scientific literature on the topic of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, not merely kowtowing to the IPCC assessment. There is no indication that the IWG undertook such an independent examination. But what is clear, is that the IWG did _not_ alter its probability distribution of the ECS between its 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2016 SCC determinations, despite a large and growing body of scientific literature that substantially alters and better defines the scientific understanding of the earth’s ECS. It is unacceptable that a supposed “updated” social cost of carbon does not include updates to the science underlying a critical and key aspect of the SCC.



I note that there has been one prominent scientific study in the recent literature which has argued, on the basis of recent observations of lower tropospheric mixing in the tropics, for a rather high climate sensitivity (Sherwood et al., 2014). This research, however, suffers from too narrow a focus. While noting that climate models which best match the apparent observed behavior of the vertical mixing characteristics of the tropical troposphere tend to be the models with high climate sensitivity estimates, the authors fail to make note that these same models are the ones whose projections make the _worst_ match to observations of the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades.



While Sherwood et al. (2014) prefer models that better match their observations in one variable, the same models actually do _worse_ in the big picture than do models which lack the apparent accuracy in the processes that Sherwood et al. (2014) describe. The result can only mean that there must still be even bigger problems with _other_ model processes which must more than counteract the effects of the processes described by Sherwood et al.



This illustrates the inherent problems with “tuning” climate models to try to best reproduce a known set of observations—efforts to force climate models to better emulate one set of physical behaviors can degrade their performance on other ones. Voosen (2016) recently reported on the climate modelling community efforts to be more open and transparent with their multitude of (secret) “tuning” procedures. Voosen’s reporting was eye‐​opening not only in revealing the degree to which climate models are tuned and the significant role that tuning plays in model projections, but as to the reasons why modelers have not wanted to be up front about their methods. I reproduce an extended and relevant excerpt here:



At their core, climate models are about energy balance. They divide Earth up into boxes, and then, applying fundamental laws of physics, follow the sun’s energy as it drives phenomena like winds and ocean currents. Their resolution has grown over the years, allowing current models to render Earth in boxes down to 25 kilometers a side. They take weeks of supercomputer time for a full run, simulating how the climate evolves over centuries.



When the models can’t physically resolve certain processes, the parameters take over—though they are still informed by observations. For example, modelers tune for cloud formation based on temperature, atmospheric stability, humidity, and the presence of mountains. Parameters are also used to describe the spread of heat into the deep ocean, the reflectivity of Arctic sea ice, and the way that aerosols, small particles in the atmosphere, reflect or trap sunlight.



It’s impossible to get parameters right on the first try. And so scientists adjust these equations to make sure certain constraints are met, like the total energy entering and leaving the planet, the path of the jet stream, or the formation of low marine clouds off the California coast. Modelers try to restrict their tuning to as few knobs as possible, but it’s never as few as they’d like. It’s an art and a science. “It’s like reshaping an instrument to compensate for bad sound,” Stevens says.



Indeed, whether climate scientists like to admit it or not, nearly every model has been calibrated precisely to the 20th century climate records—otherwise it would have ended up in the trash. “It’s fair to say all models have tuned it,” says Isaac Held, a scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, another prominent modeling center, in Princeton, New Jersey.



For years, climate scientists had been mum in public about their “secret sauce”: What happened in the models stayed in the models. The taboo reflected fears that climate contrarians would use the practice of tuning to seed doubt about models— and, by extension, the reality of human‐​driven warming. “The community became defensive,” [Bjorn] Stevens [of the Max Planck Institut] says. “It was afraid of talking about things that they thought could be unfairly used against them.” Proprietary concerns also get in the way. For example, the United Kingdom’s Met Office sells weather forecasts driven by its climate model. Disclosing too much about its code could encourage copycats and jeopardize its business.



But modelers have come to realize that disclosure could reveal that some tunings are more deft or realistic than others. It’s also vital for scientists who use the models in specific ways. They want to know whether the model output they value—say, its predictions of Arctic sea ice decline— arises organically or is a consequence of tuning. [Gavin] Schmidt [Head of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which, ironically concentrates on earth’s climate] points out that these models guide regulations like the U.S. Clean Power Plan, and inform U.N. temperature projections and calculations of the social cost of carbon. “This isn’t a technical detail that doesn’t have consequence,” he says. “It has consequence.”



Recently, while preparing for the new model comparisons, MPIM modelers got another chance to demonstrate their commitment to transparency. They knew that the latest version of their model had bugs that meant too much energy was leaking into space. After a year spent plugging holes and fixing it, the modelers ran a test and discovered something disturbing: The model was now overheating. Its climate sensitivity—the amount the world will warm under an immediate doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations from preindustrial levels—had shot up from 3.5°C in the old version to 7°C, an implausibly high jump.



MPIM hadn’t tuned for sensitivity before— it was a point of pride—but they had to get that number down. Thorsten Mauritsen, who helps lead their tuning work, says he tried tinkering with the parameter that controlled how fast fresh air mixes into clouds. Increasing it began to ratchet the sensitivity back down. “The model we produced with 7° was a damn good model,” Mauritsen says. But it was not the team’s best representation of the climate as they knew it.



That climate modelers were worried about being open about their methodologies for fear that “contrarians” would “unfairly” use such procedures against them indicates that the modeling community is more interested in climate policy (that may find support in their model projections) than climate science (which would welcome criticism aimed at producing a better understanding of the physical processes driving the earth’s climate). Given the degree of “secret sauce” mixed into the models at this point in time, a healthy dose of skepticsm regarding the verisimilitude of climate model output is warranted.



But even with the all the model tuning that takes place, the overall model collective is _still_ warming the world much faster than it actually is. As shown by Christy (2016, and updates), there is a gross departure of “reality” from model predictions. Christy (2016) noted that “for the global bulk troposphere [roughly the bottom 40,000 feet of the atmosphere], the models overwarm the atmosphere by a factor of about 2.5.” The warming influence of a large and naturally occurring El Niño event has, temporarily, added a blip to the end of the observational record. But despite this short-term natural warming event, collectively the models still produce about twice as much warming as can be found in the real world over the past 38 years. And as the warming of the recent strong El Niño event fades (global surface temperatures have returned most of the way to pre-El Niño levels; see Figures below), the model/real world discrepancy will start to grow once again.





_CAPTION: Five-year running mean temperatures predicted by the UN's climate models, and observed lower atmospheric temperatures from weather balloons and satellites (figure courtesy of John Christy).The last point is a four-year running mean, and the first two are three and four, respectively._







_CAPTION: Monthly temperature anomalies, January 1997 through December 2016 (surface observations; top) and January 1997 through January 2017 (satellite observations of the mid-troposphere; bottom) show the impact of the strong 2016 El Niño event and the fading warmth since. The surface readings are from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, and the satellite readings are from University of Alabama-Huntsville._



Another way to assess model performance is to compare model projection with observed trends in the vertical dimension of the atmosphere. Here again, as shown in the Figure below, models grossly produce much more warming than has been observed. This chart, courtesy of the University of Alabama at Huntsville’s Dr. John Christy, focuses on the tropics (between 20S and 20N)—the area where climate models project the greatest amount of warming through the atmosphere. The communal failure of the models is abject.



The characteristics of the vertical profile of temperature are important environmental variables in that it is the vertical temperature distribution that determines atmospheric stability. When the lapse rate—the difference between the lowest layers and higher levels—is large, the atmosphere is unstable. Instability is the principal source for global precipitation. Although models can be (and are) tuned to mimic changes in surface temperatures, the same can’t be done as easily for the vertical profile of temperature changes. As the figure indicates, the air in the middle troposphere is warming far more slowly than has been predicted, even more slowly than the torpid surface warming. Consequently, the difference between the surface and the middle troposphere has become slightly greater, a condition which should produce a very slight increase in average precipitation. On the other hand, the models forecast that the difference between the surface and the middle troposphere should become less, a condition which would add pressure to decrease global precipitation.



The models are therefore making systematic errors in their precipitation projections. That has a dramatic effect on the resultant climate change projections. When the surface is wet, which is what occurs after rain, the sun’s energy is directed toward the evaporation of that moisture rather than to directly heating the surface. In other words, much of what is called “sensible weather” (the kind of weather a person can sense) is determined by the vertical distribution of temperature. If the popular climate models get that wrong (which is what is happening), then all the subsidiary weather may also be incorrectly specified.

The trend in the bulk lower atmosphere (middle troposphere) from several different satellite data compilations (colored plus signs, top box) and several reanalysis datasets (colored crosses, top box) is compared with the model projection for the same layer in the box at the top of the figure.

These results argue strongly against the reliability of the Sherwood et al. (2014) conclusion and instead provide robust observational evidence that the climate sensitivity has been overestimated by both climate models, and the IWG alike.  
 _Agricultural Impacts of Carbon Fertilization_



Carbon dioxide is known to have a large positive impact on vegetation (e.g., Zhu et al., 2016), with literally thousands of studies in the scientific literature demonstrating that plants (including crops) grow stronger, healthier, and more productive under conditions of increased carbon dioxide concentration. A study (Idso, 2013) reviewed a large collection of such literature as it applies to the world's 45 most important food crops (making up 95% of the world's annual agricultural production).



Idso (2013) summarized his findings on the increase in biomass of each crop that results from a 300ppm increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide under which the plants were grown. This table is reproduced below, and shows that the typical growth increase exceeds 30% in most crops, including 8 of the world's top 10 food crops (the increase was 24% and 14% in the other two).



Idso (2013) found that the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide that took place during the period 1961-2011 was responsible for increasing global agricultural output by 3.2 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars). Projecting the increases forward based on projections of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, Idso (2013) expects carbon dioxide fertilization to increase the value of agricultural output by 9.8 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars) during the 2012-2050 period.



 **Average percentage increase in biomass of each of the world's 45 most important food crops under an increase of 300ppm of carbon dioxide.**





This is a large positive externality, and one that is insufficiently modeled in the IAMs relied upon by the IWG in determining the SCC.



In fact, only one of the three IAMs used by the IWG has any substantial impact from carbon dioxide fertilization, and the one that does, underestimates the effect by approximately 2-3 times.



The FUND model has a component which calculates the impact on agricultural as a result of carbon dioxide emissions, which includes not only the impact on temperature and other climate changes, but also the direct impact of carbon dioxide fertilization. The other two IAMs, DICE and PAGE by and large do not (or only do so extremely minimally; DICE includes the effect to a larger degree than PAGE). Consequently, lacking this large and positive externality, the SCC calculated by the DICE and PAGE models is significantly larger than the SCC determined by the FUND model (for example, see Table A5, in the IWG 2013 report).



But even the positive externality that results from carbon dioxide fertilization as included in the FUND model is too small when compared with the Idso (2013) estimates. FUND (v3.7) uses the following formula to determine the degree of crop production increase resulting from atmospheric carbon dioxide increases (taken from Anthoff and Tol, 2013a):





Column 8 in the table below shows the CO2 fertilization parameter (γ _r_ ) used in FUND for various regions of the world (Anthoff and Tol, 2013b). The average CO2 fertilization effect across the 16 regions of the world is 11.2%. While this number is neither areally weighted, nor weighted by the specific crops grown, it is clear that 11.2% is much lower than the average fertilization effect compiled by Idso (2013) for the world's top 10 food crops (35%). Further, Idso's fertilization impact is in response to a 300ppm CO2 increase, while the fertilization parameter in the FUND model is multiplied by ln(CO2t/275) which works out to 0.74 for a 300ppm CO2 increase. This multiplier further reduces the 16 region average to 8.4% for the CO2 fertilization effect—some 4 times smaller than the magnitude of the fertilization impact identified by Idso (2013).



Although approximately four times too small, the impact of the fertilization effect on the SCC calculation in the FUND model is large.



According to Waldhoff et al. (2011), if the CO2 fertilization effect is turned off in the FUND model (v3.5) the SCC increases by 75% from $8/tonCO2 to $14/tonCO2 (in 1995 dollars). In another study, Ackerman and Munitz (2012) find the effective increase in the FUND model to be even larger, with CO2 fertilization producing a positive externality of nearly $15/tonCO2 (in 2007 dollars).





Clearly, had the Idso (2013) estimate of the CO2 fertilization impact been used instead of the one used in FUND the resulting positive externality would have been much larger, and the resulting net SCC been much lower.



This is just for one of the three IAMs used by the IWG. Had the more comprehensive CO2 fertilization impacts identified by Idso (2013) been incorporated in all the IAMs, the three-model average SCC used by the IWG would be been greatly lowered, and likely even become negative in some IAM/discount rate combinations.



In its 2015 “Response to Comments Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866,” the IWG admits to the disparate ways that CO2 fertilization is included in the three IAMs. Nevertheless, the IWG quickly dismisses this as a problem in that they claim the IAMs were selected “to reflect a reasonable range of modeling choices and approaches that collectively reflect the current literature on the estimation of damages from CO2 emissions.”



This logic is blatantly flawed. Two of the IAMs do not reflect the “current literature” on a key aspect relating to the direct impact of CO2 emissions on agricultural output, and the third only partially so.



 _CO2 fertilization is a known physical effect from increased carbon dioxide concentrations_. By including the results of IAMs that do not include known processes that have a significant impact on the end product must disqualify them from contributing to the final result. The inclusion of results that are known _a priori_ to be wrong can only contribute to producing a less accurate answer. Results should only be included when they attempt to represent known processes, not when they leave those processes out entirely.



The justification from the IWG (2015) that “[h]owever, with high confidence the IPCC (2013) stated in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that ‘[b]ased on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones’” is completely irrelevant as CO2 fertilization is an impact that is apart from “climate change.” And further, the IAMs do (explicitly in the case of FUND and DICE or implicitly in the case of PAGE) include damage functions related to the climate change impacts on agriculture. So not only is the IWG justification irrelevant, it is inaccurate as well. The impact of CO2 fertilization on agricultural output and its impact on lowering the SCC _must_ be considered.



 _Additional Climate Model Parameter Misspecifications_



In addition to the outdated climate sensitivity distribution and the insufficient handling of the carbon dioxide fertilization effect, there has also been identified a misspecification of some of the critical parameters within the underlying box models that drive the pace and shape of the future climate evolution in the IAMs.



A recent analysis (Lewis, 2016) finds that the physically-based two-box climate model inherent in the DICE IAM is fit with physically unrealistic ocean characteristics. According to Lewis (2016):



In the DICE 2‐​box model, the ocean surface layer that is taken to be continuously in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 550 m deep, compared to estimates in the range 50–150 m based on observations and on fitting 2‐​box models to AOGCM responses. The DICE 2‐​box model’s deep ocean layer is less than 200 m deep, a fraction of the value in any CMIP5 AOGCM, and is much more weakly coupled to the surface layer. Unsurprisingly, such parameter choices produce a temperature response time profile that differs substantially from those in AOGCMs and in 2‐​box models with typical parameter values. As a result, DICE significantly overestimates temperatures from the mid‐​21st century on, and hence overestimates the SCC and optimum carbon tax, compared with 2‐​box models having the same ECS and TCR but parameter values that produce an AOGCM‐​like temperature evolution.



When the DICE 2‐​box model is parametrized with values for the ocean layers that are in line with established estimates, the value of the social cost of carbon that results is reduced by one‐​quarter to one‐​third during the 21th century. Lewis further point out that notes that “The climate response profile in FUND and in PAGE, the other two IAMs used by the US government to assess the SCC, appear to be similarly inappropriate, suggesting that they also overestimate the SCC.”



Ultimately, Lewis (2016) concludes:



It seems rather surprising that all three of the main IAMs have climate response functions with inappropriate, physically unrealistic, time profiles. In any event, it is worrying that governments and their scientific and economic advisers have used these IAMs and, despite considering what [equilibrium climate sensitivity] and/​or [transient climate sensitivity] values or probability distributions thereof to use, have apparently not checked whether the time profiles of the resulting climate responses were reasonable.



 _Sea Level Rise_



The sea level rise module in the DICE model used by the IWG2013/2015/2016 produces future sea level rise values that far exceed mainstream projections and are unsupported by the best available science. The sea level rise projections from more than half of the scenarios (IMAGE, MERGE, MiniCAM) exceed even the highest end of the projected sea level rise by the year 2300 as reported in the _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see figure).





_CAPTION: Projections of sea level rise from the DICE model (the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario ) for the five scenarios examined by the IWG2013 compared with the range of sea level rise projections for the year 2300 given in the IPCC AR5 (see AR5 Table 13.8)._ _(DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



How the sea level rise module in DICE was constructed is inaccurately characterized by the IWG (and misleads the reader). The IWG report describes the development of the DICE sea level rise scenario as:



“The parameters of the four components of the SLR module are calibrated to match consensus results from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).6”



However, in IWG footnote “6” the methodology is described this way (Nordhaus, 2010):



“The methodology of the modeling is to use the estimates in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).”



“Using estimates” and “calibrating” are two completely different things. Calibration implies that the sea level rise estimates produced by the DICE sea level module behave similarly to the IPCC sea level rise projections and instills a sense of confidence in the casual reader that the DICE projections are in accordance with IPCC projections. However this is not the case. Consequently, the reader is misled.



In fact, the DICE estimates are much higher than the IPCC estimates. This is even recognized by the DICE developers. From the same reference as above:



“The RICE [DICE] model projection is in the middle of the pack of alternative specifications of the different Rahmstorf specifications. Table 1 shows the RICE, base Rahmstorf, and average Rahmstorf. _Note that in all cases, these are significantly above the IPCC projections in AR4._ ” [emphasis added]



That the DICE sea level rise projections are far above mainstream estimated can be further evidenced by comparing them with the results produced by the IWG-accepted MAGICC modelling tool (in part developed by the EPA and available from http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/).



Using the MESSAGE scenario as an example, the sea level rise estimate produced by MAGICC for the year 2300 is 1.28 meters—a value that is less than 40% of the average value of 3.32 meters produced by the DICE model when running the same scenario (see figure below).





_CAPTION: Projected sea level rise resulting from the MESSAGE scenario produced by DICE (red) and MAGICC (blue)._



The justification given for the high sea level rise projections in the DICE model (Nordhaus, 2010) is that they well-match the results of a “semi-empirical” methodology employed by Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009).



However, subsequent science has proven the “semi-empirical” approach to projecting future sea level rise unreliable. For example, Gregory et al. (2012) examined the assumption used in the “semi-empirical” methods and found them to be unsubstantiated. Gregory et al (2012) specifically refer to the results of Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009):



The implication of our closure of the [global mean sea level rise, GMSLR] budget is that a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR is weak or absent in the past. The lack of a strong relationship is consistent with the evidence from the tide‐​gauge datasets, whose authors find acceleration of GMSLR during the 20th century to be either insignificant or small. It also calls into question the basis of the semi‐​empirical methods for projecting GMSLR, which depend on calibrating a relationship between global climate change or radiative forcing and the rate of GMSLR from observational data (Rahmstorf, 2007; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Jevrejeva et al., 2010).



In light of these findings, the justification for the very high sea level rise projections (generally exceeding those of the IPCC AR5 and far greater than the IWG‐​accepted MAGICC results) produced by the DICE model is called into question and can no longer be substantiated.



Given the strong relationship between sea level rise and future damage built into the DICE model, there can be no doubt that the SCC estimates from the DICE model are higher than the best science would allow and consequently, should not be accepted by the IWG as a reliable estimate of the social cost of carbon.



And here again, the IWG (2015) admits that these sea level rise estimates are an outlier on the high end, yet retains them in their analysis by claiming than they were interested in representing a “range” of possible outcomes. But, even the IWG (2015) admits that the IPCC AR5 assigned “a low confidence in projections based on such [semi‐​empirical] methods.” It is internally inconsistent to claim the IPCC as an authority for limiting the range of possibilities explored by the IAMs (which it did in the case of equilibrium climate sensitivity) and then go outside the IPCC to justify including a wildly high estimate of sea level rise. Such inconsistencies characterize the IWG response to comments and weaken confidence in them.



I did not investigate the sea level rise projections from the FUND or the PAGE model, but suggest that such an analysis must be carried out prior to extending any confidence in the values of the SCC resulting from those models—confidence that, as demonstrated, cannot be assigned to the DICE SCC determinations.



 _Conclusion_



The social cost of carbon as determined by the Interagency Working Group in their August 2016 Technical Support Document (updated from IGW reports from February 2010, November 2013, and July 2015) is unsupported by the robust scientific literature, fraught with uncertainty, illogical, and thus completely unsuitable and inappropriate for federal rulemaking. Had the IWG included a better‐​reasoned and more inclusive review of the current scientific literature, the social cost of carbon estimates would have been considerably reduced with a value likely approaching zero. Such a low social cost of carbon would obviate the arguments behind the push for federal greenhouse gas regulations.

"EVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It’s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable. Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the   bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one. Take Evernote, the   app. After nearly a decade attracting millions of users, the company last year severely restricted free use of its software while raising prices for its plans by as much as 40 percent. This month, Evernote also released a redesign for its mobile app, which users complained was bloated with unnecessary features that have made note taking too complex. Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy. ”We understand those kind of changes don’t make everyone happy,” said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. “In fact, we’ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years. ” People deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break. No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can’t recognize the warning signs. An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple’s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn’t show up. (It wasn’t the first time this happened, either.) Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving. “It’s still functioning, but you don’t see any changes in it for a very long time,” he said. “It’s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point. ” Another sign that it’s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app’s audience is a ghost town  —   like Yahoo’s   app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile   services like Instagram emerged  —   then it’s probably time to leave. Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr. The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs. As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive. Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around. “It’s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can’t take your furniture and your books with you,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Evernote is a good example. It includes an “Export notes” feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other   apps. Microsoft’s   app OneNote, along with Apple’s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app. Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of   images, and then upload them to a new photo service. When companies don’t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you. If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don’t need    notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app. On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app  —   which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement. The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in. Ditching Apple’s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple’s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better. After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app. Mr. Fitzpatrick recently decided to cut ties with Google Voice, the search giant’s calling and texting service, because it had remained unchanged for years. So he made backups of his call history, text messages and address books using Google Takeout, a web tool that he helped develop for easily downloading personal data stored on Google services. Then he switched to Signal, the encrypted messaging service, which has more modern features for messaging and phone calls, and disconnected his Google Voice. Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick. “A lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how alarmists say that the variation in solar irradiance was too small to have any real impact on the earth’s climate, and thus gets neglected by the IPCC?
Reader GuarionexSandoval has written a comment which I’m elevating to a post, see below. It too shows that if the variation solar irradiance from the 11-year cycle is negligible, then so must the alleged 400,000 daily Hiroshima bombs of heat that alarmists insist are being added to the climate system.
===================================
By GuarionexSandoval
I remember first reading about this in some moronic piece of agit-prop on Market Watch called New ‘War of Worlds’: Capitalism vs. Planet Earth Opinion: Global-warming rate today has impact of 400,000 daily A-bombs by Paul B. Ferrel.
400,000 daily A-bombs by Paul B. Ferrel
My reply:
Let’s crunch some numbers. The author claims that human effect on “global warming” is equivalent to 400,000 atomic bombs going off per day. We’ll assume he meant that all human activity results in a temperature rise per day the energy of which is equal to 400,000 atomic bombs. Since he didn’t specify what kind of atomic bomb, we’ll use Hiroshima since that’s usually the one used by those trying to score polemical points. The yield of the Hiroshima bomb was around 64.5 terajoules (TJ). So 400,000 of these would be about 25,800,000 TJ. The total amount of energy in TJ released by all nuclear explosions to date is around 2,135,000. So, he’s claiming that human effect on temperature each day is 12 times greater than all the nuclear weapons ever exploded. Gee, that sounds so horribly ominous.
But let’s compare that to the amount of energy on average that reaches the earth each day from the sun. The average influx is somewhere near 81,660 joules per square meter per minute. Given that the earth has a surface area of 510 trillion square meters, the energy is 41,646,600,000,000,000,000 J/minute or 41,646,600 TJ/minute or 59,971,104,000 TJ/day. But consider that over the 11 year sunspot cycle the energy output reaching the earth can vary by 0.1 percent (but other solar cycles can increase this up to 0.6 percent). So at maximum, it varies between 60,001,089,552 TJ/day to 60,151,017,312 TJ/day.
Just the variation of the 11-year sunspot cycle is responsible for a change in the daily solar energy influx equivalent to 930,249 atomic bombs per day. At the maximum the change would be equivalent to 5,581,494 atomic bombs per day. So, even if his claim were true, which it isn’t, the effect would be less than the natural variation from just the sunspot cycle alone without even considering other cycles such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation that cause a large fluctuation in average global temperature or the 200 year de Vries cycle that does the same or the progression from grand solar maxima to grand solar minima that does the same or regular changes in the earth’s orbit that do the same or changes in the solar magnetic field that controls cloud formation by changing cosmic ray flux that do the same or combinations of all these cycles that can really shift temperature radically in one or the other direction–like between the 100,000 year glacial periods and the approximately 10,000 year interglacial periods, such as our current interglacial, the end of which we are nearing. 
Bombs are equal to only 37 seconds of sunlight
So against all this, let’s compare his deliberately scary sounding atomic bomb imagery to the actual daily energy that reaches the earth from the sun: 59,971,104,000 TJ/day. That is 2,324 times larger than 400,000 atomic bombs or, rather, those bombs are equal to about 0.043% of the sun’s daily energy influx or 37 seconds of sunlight.

Now, let’s put this into the context of what’s actually been happening to global temperatures over the past 10,000 years. Over the past 9,000 years there has been a downward trend; over the past 3000 years, a steeply downward trend. From the Minoan Warm Period to the tiny little blip of warmth between about 1860 to 1998 (3 roughly equal periods of roughly equal increases of temp), the trend has been to ever colder warm periods and to ever colder intervening cold periods. The last cold period, referred to as the Little Ice Age, was the coldest the planet has been since the last worldwide glaciation. We are still warming up from the LIA and have far to go to reach the warmth of the Medieval Warm Period, farther still to reach that of the Roman Warm Period (according to Greenland ice core temperatures) and very far to reach the warmth of the Minoan Warm Period. The 20th century was also special in that there was a grand solar maximum that exceeded anything for millennia. We’re now on the down slope toward a grand solar minimum. By the end of the 1990s we reached the end of the positive phase of the Pacifical Decadal Oscillation and are headed in the negative or colder direction. We also reached the peak of the 200 year de Vries cycle and are headed back down. None of these predicts higher temperatures. He should hope that anthropogenic CO2 has the effect climate alarmists claim for it.
CO2 near 500 million year low
As far as his professed fear and trembling over CO2 being higher than any time in “recorded history,” first, it’s not true. There were times in the 19th century that atmospheric CO2 was measured at over 400 ppm. And, second, “recorded history” is a cute way to avoid looking at all the other ways that atmospheric CO2 concentrations are measured for times before “recorded history.” Again, he either lacks perspective or is deliberately failing to provide it. In the geological time frame, the current amount of atmospheric CO2 is near an all time low, vying with the Carboniferous and Permian Periods for the lowest atmospheric CO2 in over 500 million years. Its decline over the past 150 million years has been almost linear and completely unconnected with any sort of human activity, as was its abrupt increase at the end of the Permian period from about where it is now, just barely enough to sustain life, to over 2500 ppm.
Against this, the author’s piece can be seen to be one of two things: 1. Ignorant and uncritical re-posting of hysterical claims that make Orson Well’s War of the World hoax look like a Hello Kitty cartoon. 2. Deliberate deception in the service of a political agenda.
Given that his bullet points were either inaccurate, irrelevant, or completely untrue, I’d be tempted to say number 1.
But given his absurd allusion to 400,000 atomic bombs per day, I’m sort of leaning toward number 2.
And especially so when I consider Al Gore’s statement that he. Al, believes “…it is appropriate to have an over-representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is, as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are, and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis.”
H.L. Mencken described these types well:
“The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed–and hence clamorous to be led to safety–by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.”
“The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.”

The world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non‐​Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.



Religious persecution is a global scourge. Many of the worst oppressors are Muslim nations. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Bahrain, Iraq, and Egypt are all important international actors. All also mistreat, or acquiesce in the mistreatment of, anyone not a Muslim. Some of them even victimize Muslims—of the wrong variety. (In Syria it is opponents of the government which do most of the persecuting.)



Islamabad is another frequent offender. The most recent State Department report on religious liberty in Pakistan noted that “The constitution and other laws and policies officially restrict religious freedom and, in practice, the government enforced many of these restrictions. The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom continued to be poor.”



Minority faiths face violent attack. Believers are killed, churches are bombed, buses are attacked, homes are destroyed, social gatherings are targeted. Warned the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in its recent report: “In the past year, conditions hit an all‐​time low due to chronic sectarian violence targeting mostly Shia Muslims but also Christians, Ahmadis, and Hindus.” Last year the Commission cited a spike in violence against Shiites as well as “numerous attacks against innocent Pakistanis” of other religions.





A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected.



Although Islamabad did not launch these assaults, it did little to prevent or redress them. Even when scores or more are killed at a time there often is no effective response. Explained State: “The government’s limited capacity and will to investigate or prosecute the perpetrators of increasing extremist attacks against religious minorities and on members of the Muslim majority promoting tolerance, allowed the climate of impunity to continue.” Indeed, top government officials have been gunned down for defending freedom of conscience.



The most common tool of persecution may be a charge of blasphemy. Said USCIRF: “The country’s blasphemy laws, used predominantly in Punjab province, but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and frequently result in imprisonment.” Two years ago a mentally handicapped 12‐​year‐​old Christian girl was charged; after an international outcry even the authorities became embarrassed and the case was dismissed, an unusual outcome.



The blasphemy laws are made for abuse. Explained the Commission, “The so‐​called crime carries the death penalty or life in prison, does not require proof of intent or evidence to be presented after allegations are made, and does not include penalties for false allegations.” In fact, courts hesitate to even hear evidence, lest doing so also be considered another act of blasphemy. With evidence unnecessary, the charge has become a weapon routinely used in personal and business disputes, including a means to exact revenge for imagined offenses.



Between 1986 and 2006 695 people were charged with blasphemy. Today 16 people are on death row and another 20 are serving life sentences. Three Christians have been sentenced to death in the last few months. Many other Pakistanis are in prison waiting for trial, including English professor Junaid Hafeez, accused of blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. Penalties are not limited to the law. Explained the group Freedom House: “Regardless of the motives behind their charges and the outcome of their cases, those accused of blasphemy are subject to job discrimination, ostracism from their communities and neighborhoods, and even physical violence and murder at the hands of angry mobs, forcing many to live in fear.” Since 1990 at least 52 people charged with blasphemy have been killed before reaching trial.



Judges who acquitted defendants and politicians who talked of reforming the blasphemy laws also have been assassinated. In May gunmen killed Rashid Rehman, a human rights lawyer who was defending Hafeez. Previously _fellow attorneys_ threatened Rehman, “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more.” A pamphlet circulated after the murder asserting that Rehman met his “rightful end.” He was the first defense lawyer killed. He probably won’t be the last.



Pakistan has jailed more people for blasphemy than any other nation, but it is not the only country which punishes religious free speech. An incredible 14 of 20 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa criminalize blasphemy. Nine of 50 in the Asia Pacific, seven of 45 in Europe and three of 48 in SubSaharan Africa also do so. Eleven of 35 nations in the Americas have blasphemy laws. In the U.S. several states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, retain blasphemy laws, though they do not enforce them.



The group Freedom House published a detailed report on the detrimental impact of blasphemy laws on human rights. Put simply, these measures “impose undue restrictions on freedom of expression” and are “prone to arbitrary or overly broad application, particularly in settings where there are no checks and balances in place to prevent abuses.” Freedom House highlighted Algeria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Poland, as well as Pakistan.



In March the Commission made much the same point, issuing a special report entitled “Prisoners of Belief: Individuals Jailed Under Blasphemy Laws.” Victims include three atheist bloggers in Bangladesh, numerous Iranian Bahai’s, Christians, and Sufi and Sunni Muslims, 63 Sunnis and Christians in Egypt, an atheist writer in Kazakhstan, scores of Indonesians, and a Saudi blogger. Even Greece and Turkey have charged people with blasphemy.



The Arab Spring was supposed to bring liberty to the Mideast, but it had the opposite effect in some countries. For instance, in Kuwait, perhaps the most liberal Gulf State, the Islamist‐​dominated Assembly elected in early 2012 voted to impose the death penalty on Muslims convicted of blasphemy. The Emir blocked the law and later changed the election rules, resulting in election of a more moderate legislature.



Blasphemy prosecutions have been initiated in post‐​revolution Egypt and even Tunisia, viewed as the most successful participant in the Arab Spring. USCIRF commissioners Zuhdi Jasser and Katrina Lantos Swett wrote: “Rather than giving rise to greater individual liberty, this trend could turn the Arab Spring into a repressive winter, with forces of intolerance and tyranny dashing hopes for genuine freedom and liberal democracy.”



Nevertheless, Pakistan remains a particular problem. The country’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, emphasized the importance of religious liberty. But Pakistan became more Islamic over time, a process accelerated by dictator Mohammed Zia ul‐​Haq. His government not only criminalized blasphemy, but, noted Freedom House, enacted new laws which imposed “harsh Shari’a punishments for extramarital sex, theft, and violations of the prohibition of alcohol.”



The impact of such laws fell most heavily on religious minorities and liberals. Discrimination, intolerance, and violence have become pervasive. Noted Freedom House: “it is clear that Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are used politically and applied disproportionately to non‐​Muslims. Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” Intolerance has become the norm.



Unfortunately, there are spillover impacts from abusive blasphemy prosecutions. Blasphemy laws are bad in Western nations. They are far worse in the Muslim world. The problem is particularly severe in Pakistan. Warned Freedom House: “Pakistan’s blasphemy laws foster an environment of intolerance and impunity, and lead to violations of a broad range of human rights, including the obvious rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to due process and a fair trial; freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and the right to life and security of the person.”



Obviously, there is little the U.S. can do directly about policy in Pakistan. However, the International Religious Freedom Act empowers the State Department to designate countries as Countries of Particular Concern. Noted USCIRF: “Pakistan represents the worst situation in the world for religious freedom for countries not currently designated” as CPCs. State should remedy that lapse.



For some, religious liberty is but an afterthought, an esoteric principle with little practical impact. However, the willingness of foreign governments to respect freedom of conscience acts as the famed canary in the mine. A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected. And a society in which the life and dignity of the human person is not respected is more likely to become a hothouse for violent ideas, beliefs, and actions.



As we see in Pakistan today. Rising religious extremism, exemplified by abusive blasphemy prosecutions, threatens the integrity of the Pakistani state—and the security of its nuclear weapons. Although outsiders cannot reform policy in Pakistan, they can highlight a problem that endangers people not only in that nation but ultimately in many others around the world, including America.

"The   weather in New York City saw a   62 degrees on Wednesday, but a significant snowstorm expected to move in overnight prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to close schools on Thursday. The announcement came after the National Weather Service on Wednesday posted a winter storm warning for the city and a blizzard warning for the eastern part of Long Island. Forecasts called for 8 to 12 inches of snow throughout northern New Jersey, the Hudson Valley, Long Island, coastal Connecticut and the city. The heaviest snow was expected from early Thursday morning through afternoon, with wind gusts up to 35 m. p. h. the service said on its website. Nationwide, airports were reporting more than 2, 800 canceled flights for Thursday, according to FlightAware. com, a   website. Newark Liberty International Airport had 603 canceled flights, La Guardia Airport, 566, and Kennedy International Airport, 480, the website reported on Thursday night. On Wednesday, the temperature reached 62 degrees in Central Park, beating the previous record of 61 degrees set in 1965. Around the city on Wednesday, people were taking advantage  —   walking around in   and tank tops, sitting outdoors at cafes, enjoying parks and promenades. For children who longed for a snow day, the news of the snowstorm was a reason to cheer. Libby Courtemanche had taken her two sons, Christopher, 2, and Bradley, less than a year old, to a park in Huntington, Long Island, on Wednesday. “You know what’s gonna happen tomorrow?” she asked the   . “It’s gonna snow. And we’re gonna get to play in the snow. ” And this roller coaster ride of extremes is sure to provide fuel for those who gripe about the weather. It will be unseasonably warm Wednesday and unpleasantly wintry Thursday, but neither will be just right, of course. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the drastic shift in weather was “unusual, but it’s certainly not unprecedented. ” The extremes should not be seen as a sign that the gods are angry. Mr. Morrin said it could be explained by two competing weather patterns: cold air masses descending from the North that will push out a   warm air mass in time to chill the city and turn precipitation to snow. “Air masses move,” he said. “It’s just the timing. ” At Cozy Coffee in   Brooklyn, patrons headed straight for the back patio, where owner Migdalia Medina ran cups of coffee and small plates of food plates to people seated at picnic tables under a canopy of bare tree branches. “As soon as they feel it they start coming out,” Ms. Medina said of her customers. As for Thursday’s forecast, she said the patio seating “also looks good under snow. ” The New York weather historian Steve Fybish, who keeps records of the city’s weather dating to the 19th century, agreed that the weather swing was not unusual. He rifled through his records to find other days of similar extremes: a snowstorm and a   afternoon within a couple of days in 1984 69 degrees on a November day followed by five inches of snow in 1896. In February 2014, when the Super Bowl was at the Meadowlands, in East Rutherford, N. J. the weather swung sharply. While there had been concerns that the outdoor game at MetLife Stadium would be affected by the cold, game day registered a mild 49 degrees at the stadium and 57 degrees in the city. But the next day, the temperature plunged to 27 degrees followed by a cold snap that was punctuated by eight inches of snow. On Thursday, the snowfall is likely to be heaviest during the morning commute, Mr. Morrin said. “I don’t think there’s going to be anyone rushing anywhere,” he said. “The commute time will be impacted. ”"
"Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies. But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: “Liberty, Equality, Reality. ” “I’m not sure I’m the best vehicle for this,” said Dr. Eisen, whose professional attire consists of shorts and   bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature, a cause he has championed. “But if we want to defend the role of science in policy making, scientists need to run for office. ” Since Mr. Trump’s election, many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration’s views on science, climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax (although more recently said he would have an “open mind” about it) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science. But there is much that is still unclear about his administration’s attitudes toward science. The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman). Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years. “There are many conversations going on right now,” said Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first     protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. “Many scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past. ” A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 314 Action, has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2, 000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for   whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress. Other scientists have organized demonstrations  —   including a march now set for Earth Day, April 22  —   submitted letters or opinion articles to news organizations or joined efforts to preserve government data that they fear may otherwise disappear. Individuals and groups have also spoken out against Mr. Trump’s executive order restricting travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other countries, an action that has affected some researchers. But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists. “I have plenty of colleagues who say, ‘Leave me alone in my lab,’” said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. “Right now it’s mostly talking about what to do,” he said. “We’re scientists  —   we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there’s an elevated sense that this is very real. ” That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in “data rescue” events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. “For a problem like climate change, you can’t understand it if you don’t have data,” said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the   group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N. Y. U. event. Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E. P. A. which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency’s science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E. P. A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized. “I’m a great believer in science,” Mr. Ebell said, “but I’m not a great believer in politicized science. ” Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and   view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda. But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart. “I think that many people have moved well beyond that,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is enlisting scientists to monitor what is occurring in federal agencies. “It’s nonsense  —   you need to follow your own heart. You can do science and still be a good citizen. ” Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. “Early career scientists, younger scientists  —   that’s not an answer for them,” he said. Chanda   a cosmologist and particle physicist at the University of Washington, is one of those younger researchers. She has long been politically active  —   she comes from a family of organizers and attended her first demonstration when she was 2 months old  —   but for her the talk and actions of the Trump administration have led to a new level of concern. Dr.   said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration. Immediately after the election, she took to social media to criticize a news release from the American Physical Society that urged President Trump to strengthen scientific leadership and quoted his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again. ” “What history has taught us is that collaboration doesn’t work for science,” Dr.   said. “When we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn’t work for science. ” The news release was quickly withdrawn and the society apologized for any “offense it might have caused. ” Michael Lubell, a physics professor who was director of public affairs for the society but who was terminated without explanation, said that “initially people were very worried that if anybody criticized Donald Trump there would be retribution. ” “People are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn’t have a firm grasp on science policy at all,” Dr. Lubell said. “Now they are mobilizing. But there’s absolutely no strategy. ” Dr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run. But Jacquelyn Gill, a   at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to  —   eventually  —   make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to “do more than write letters. ” Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district. Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her. “I came into this career wanting to do science that’s in the public good,” she said. “And maybe now that means something different than it did before. ”"

I’ve commented on the failure of Obamanomics, with special focus on how both banks and corporations are sitting on money because the investment climate is so grim. Not exactly flattering to the White House.   
  
  
Using Minneapolis Federal Reserve data, I’ve compared the current recovery with the expansion of the early 1980s. Once again, not good news for the Obama administration.   
  
  
And I’ve shared a couple of cartoons — here and here — that use humor to show the impact of bad public policy.   
  
  
But here’s a Bloomberg story that provides what may be the most damning evidence that the President’s big government agenda is a failure: 



U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits from large investors even if it’s unprofitable, and lenders in return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks.   
  
  
Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as customers seek shelter from Europe’s debt crisis and falling stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance payments. With short‐​term interest rates so low, it’s hard for financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably.   
  
  
…At least one firm, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., tried to recoup some of the costs by charging depositors 13 basis points, or 0.13 percent, for holding unusually high balances.



Let’s think about what this article is really saying. Banks normally make money by attracting deposits and then lending that money to people and businesses that have productive uses for the funds.   
  
  
Yet the economy is so weak that banks are leery of taking more money. The story is complicated by other factors, including capital flight from Europe, taxes (or premiums) imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and various regulatory issues. But even with these caveats, it’s still remarkable that banks want to turn down money — or charge people for making deposits. That’s sort of like McDonald’s turning away customers because the firm loses money by selling Big Macs and french fries. Or, better yet, like McDonald’s turning away free goods from suppliers because not enough people want to buy the final product.

The federal government imposes a mandate to blend ethanol into gasoline. This “Renewable Fuel Standard” harms consumers, damages the economy, and produces negative environmental effects. The mandate has also spawned a bureaucratic trading system in ethanol credits, which the _Wall Street Journal_ reports is bankrupting a refinery in Pennsylvania.   






The rubber hits the road with that “10% Ethanol” sticker you see on the pump when you fill your tank. The sticker signifies that the government is imposing a foolish policy on the nation at the behest of a handful of selfish senators, who are bucking the interests of America’s 220 million motorists.   
  
  
Nick Loris discusses some ethanol basics at Down​siz​ing​Gov​ern​ment​.org. And Thomas Landstreet reiterated some of the problems with the mandate in the _WSJ_ the other day:   




The corn ethanol mandate was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Two years later, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which expanded the program by providing generous tax credits and subsidies to corn growers and ethanol blenders. It also established ambitious targets, increasing annually, for biofuels in the national fuel mix. The mandate soon diverted 40% of America’s corn crop away from the food supply.   
  
  
The government‐​imposed shortage caused corn prices to float from long‐​term mean levels of about $2 per bushel to more than $8 per bushel in 2012. This extraordinary price surge prompted a range of harmful responses in the farming industry. Farmers planted 17 million new acres of corn at the expense of soybeans, wheat, hay and cotton, driving prices for those crops to all‐​time highs as well. Cattle farmers, unable to afford corn gluten feed, culled their herds to levels not seen in 60 years, causing beef prices to rise an incredible 60% from 2007 to 2012. Over this five‐​year period, the IMF food price index rose 42%.   
  
  
…The country has endured a startling amount of economic disruption for what is clearly an inferior source of energy. Ethanol produces 34% less energy per volume than conventional gasoline, reducing cars’ fuel economy. As for its effect on the environment, a 2010 Congressional Budget Office study found that corn‐​based ethanol subsidies are terribly inefficient, with the government spending an estimated $754 per metric ton of avoided emissions—an astronomically high price tag compared with other policies. (The economics of climate change literature estimates the “social cost of carbon” at far lower levels, meaning the program is inefficient even on its own terms.)   
  
  
Moreover, ethanol is too corrosive to be transported through pipelines, so trucks must transport it. Growing corn also requires more water than other crops—and the policy gave farmers an incentive to plant only corn, which depleted the soil of nutrients. A 2008 study in Science found that converting natural environments for biofuel production can produce hundreds of times more carbon emissions than the biofuels themselves would save. No wonder ethanol mandates are losing support among environmentalists.



The ethanol mandate reduces freedom and costs you money at the gas pump for no reason other than to line the pockets of corn farmers, who already benefit from billions of dollars of federal farm subsidies. The mandate is stupid policy and ought to be repealed.

"**People with learning disabilities have been ""at the back of the queue"" during the coronavirus pandemic, a panel of MPs has been told.**
Those living in supported accommodation were left waiting weeks for guidance on testing and visits.
MPs were also told long-term social factors were likely to be more important than biology when it came to ethnic divides in the virus's impact.
The panel focused on what lessons could be learned.
James O'Rourke's brother Tony lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in a block of supported-living accommodation.
He said the family had been unable to visit him, even though people living alone in the wider community are allowed to form a support bubble with another household.
Mr O'Rourke said this was because guidance had been tailored towards large residential care homes and failed to account for people in his brother's situation.
He was giving evidence to a joint hearing of the Health and Social Care Committee and Science and Technology Committee.
This sentiment was echoed by Steve Scown, who runs Dimensions UK, a major provider of supported accommodation for adults with learning disabilities and autism.
""Consistently, the government guidance for registered care homes has been issued weeks in advance of guidance for supportive-living services,"" he said.
""There's been a focus on large registered care homes for older people.""
While the government's focus on older people was ""understandable"", these delays meant his service was still waiting for guidance on testing residents.
And in other cases, constantly changing guidance had left staff and residents confused.
Ann McCallum, who has a learning disability and advocates for others who do, said she had struggled to understand certain guidelines.
""It's not been in easy language for people to understand,"" she said.
""Politicians need to really not use jargon and give better instructions on all the rules that they want us to follow"".
Language around ""tiers"", for example, was confusing, Ms McCallum added.
Mr Scown said life-expectancy figures - between 14 and 18 years lower for people with learning disabilities - were evidence they were not valued ""as equal members of the community"".
And he cited ""frankly, disgraceful"" instances during the pandemic of medics placing do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) orders on patients with learning disabilities' files without consulting their families .
The MPs also heard evidence from experts about the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on people belonging to ethnic minorities.
Public Health England London regional director Prof Kevin Fenton said he was concerned about the availability of data on the impact of testing and contact-tracing among different ethnic communities and whether people were taking up testing and being reached by tracers.
A number of reasons have been given for why Covid disproportionately affects people belonging to ethnic minorities.
These factors are often linked.
Prof Fenton cautioned against ""looking for simple or easy solutions for what are very, very complex and difficult issues"".
But he said ""social and structural conditions have a much greater impact on your overall health and wellbeing"" than biological factors.
And that included housing, employment and the impacts of discrimination and stigma, which were ""much bigger determinants of wellbeing than, for example, your access to care or genetic profile""."

 **North Shore ward**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo.



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



This is going to be a tough one. When you look through the options you’ll see why. I suppose I could recommend not voting at all, but that kinda contradicts the point of this exercise. The biggest issue in this ward is the proposal to sell a Takapuna golf course, turning the site into a Town Centre for Takapuna. It has been viciously argued over for the last nine years. I support the sale.

Bunting has virtually no google footprint and unusually, no picture of himself in the candidate profile. All we have to go on is his candidate profile statement.



He has a construction business which has been building new homes on North Shore for ten years, after a career in the Navy based at Devonport. Unsurprisingly, he is frustrated at the money wasted by the Council complying with the RMA and building consent processes. No doubt this includes a significant amount of his own money too.



Bunting appears to be a reluctant politician. Despite the enormous changes taking place in the region he sees the same old faces on billboards each election and isn’t convinced they are going to tackle the issues he faces, building new homes in the area.



He says he is a straight shooter that he offers new blood, open-door meetings and recognising ratepayers pay his wages. Someone who knows how to run a business needs to represent North Shore at the Council table.



That looks bloody good to me.



[ **Chris Darby**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=d96d3952-bd5f-4c00-b2bc-9880eebe5d75&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– Taking the Shore Forward **$**



But first, view this video; [**Chris Darby Looks At Things**](https://www.facebook.com/CouncilDarby/videos/682562898879401/)



You may recall during my review of the Howick ward race I commented on the sloppy affiliations used by David Collings, running on a “Collings for Council” ticket. Darby’s affiliation is Taking the Shore Forward. Richard Hills is Darby’s running mate in all but affiliation lists his affiliation as A Positive Voice for the Shore.



Section 57(3) of the Local Electoral Act 2001 states: _An affiliation is ‘an endorsement by any organisation or group (whether incorporated or unincorporated).’_  




 _A candidate claiming a specific affiliation should supply with their nomination paper an authority to adopt the affiliation for the organisation or group concerned (i.e. letter of consent to use the affiliation from the organisation or group). This is a safety measure to avoid any illegal adoption of affiliations._



I’m highly sceptical that there are organisations named Taking the Shore Forward and A Positive Voice for the Shore that have supplied authorisations along with these two candidates’ nomination forms authorising them to use their names as endorsing organisations.



I’ve lodged an OIA request with the Auckland Council Electoral Officer who, to his credit replied quickly, to advise the nomination forms and supporting documentation are public documents which can be viewed at the Electoral Office. Alas, they’re only available to view during business hours so it will be a week before I can go in to view them. Will keep you posted.



Now, back to Darby. Little known fact, he was a supporter of Ngati Whatua’s occupation of Bastion Point, present on eviction day on May 25 1978. Prior to the formation of the super city, he served on North Shore City Council. He failed to be elected to Auckland Council 2010, settling for a place on Devonport-Takapuna Local Board, but won the Council race in 2013. Darby has generally sat with the left, his voting record closely matching Len Brown and Phil Goff. The latter appointed Darby Chair of the Planning Committee in 2016. In 2016, he was one of the Terrible Ten who voted in favour of the 9.9% rates increase.



Darby has positioned himself as a far-left, anti-car, pro-public transport extremist in favour of stringent planning laws leading to regulatory intensification. In 2015, when Labour joined National in supporting the extension or removal of the urban boundary, Darby said politicians should stay out of the issue. When new mega-mall Westfield NorthWest opened the same year, Darby labelled it “the anchor of more sprawl and a dire Henderson town centre left in its wake.” Darby seems to hold malls responsible for the decline of small business centres like Henderson; however, there are no mega-malls without customers. Their money clearly votes for increasing numbers of mega malls over blighted stretches of road.



Darby is on the side of those who wish to sell the Takapuna car park (probably the only thing I’d ever agree with him on), which really is playing with fire in this ward.



When Phil Goff announced free use of public transport for under 16’s on weekends, Darby was at the mayor’s side for the announcement as a strong advocate. Considering under 16’s don’t currently drive cars and the weekends have minimal congestion, the only reason for doing it is to instil bus/train usage into the minds of the young ensuring thorough brainwashing by the time they can drive.



In June of this year, the Governing Body approved a submission to the Government calling for universal design standards for residential buildings, requiring them to be accessible to all people regardless of age, disability or other factors. Currently, that requirement only exists for commercial buildings. Darby is a [cheerleader for the change](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/113192329/auckland-council-pushes-for-all-homes-to-be-accessible-in-building-act-review) because current rules disadvantage the 10% of Aucklanders that have a mobility impairment. Earlier attempts by Auckland Council to include this in the Unitary Plan were removed by the independent hearings panel who felt it would be in conflict with the Building Act. 



Every regulation added to a product or activity results in an additional cost. Sometimes it may be the opportunity cost of doing the activity a different, more efficient way but usually, the cost is visible and financial. If the number of Aucklanders needing accessibility adaptations in private housing is significant, removing regulatory distortion as a factor, the market will respond and the provision of such houses increase. The answer to a minor problem for some Aucklanders isn’t applying whole-scale compulsion to all new developments to include these features in every private home. Property rights is not a phrase in Darby’s lexicon, but there are volumes covering central planning of every aspect to the nth degree.



Darby’s blind hatred of private vehicles is being played out in the Auckland CBD, whether it be lowering speed limits to 30 km/h, increasing shared spaces giving pedestrians right of way or complete removal of car access entirely as is proposed for Auckland’s High Street, costing $14-22m. [Darby says](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/auckland-mayor-announces-plan-expedite-removal-car-parks-popular-city-centre-street), “Personal mobility and enjoyment trumps parking and kerbs to bring people out on the street. It’s time to trigger that change.”



Chris has identified several priorities if he gets another term on Auckland Council: securing a fair share of funding for the Shore (what is fair?), advancing Shore rail (0% achieved thus far but I’ll return to that), safeguarding strategic assets like Watercare, capping rates (he has voted for 9.9% increases previously) and reining in Auckland Transport (whatever that means).



Darby is also indulging in the climate change Kool-Aid. In saying that I’m not denying the climate is changing, I’m saying there is absolutely no chance anything Auckland Council does will have any impact on it.



Finally, Darby’s obsession with rail linking the Shore, which has got nowhere, is not something I’d completely write off as a worthwhile possibility. There is no denying the harbour needs at least one more crossing. I previously advocated a second crossing, linking the Meola Reef to Chelsea with a motorway linked up to the Albany Highway, at a cost of $5.5 billion. While I haven’t fully investigated the possibilities, a third crossing from Devonport to the Eastern Corridor would certainly suck the congestion out of SH1 and Lake Rd. 



It’s big-ticket stuff, but if rail were to become a reality on the Shore then it should be accompanied by a new parallel road crossing. I’d pay for it by applying electronic road pricing as an alternative to regressive petrol taxes, which still don’t come close to covering the cost of transport infrastructure.



[ **Grant Gillon**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a6285743-6d7d-44ed-a3b1-701beed8c6fa&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– More For The Shore **$**



Grant Gillon has previously worked as a firefighter and union official but his first political position was as an Alliance MP, a radical left collection of minor parties, from 1996 until its collapse in 2002. Gillon followed Jim Anderton from The Alliance to the new Progressive Coalition which vanished with Anderton’s resignation from politics.



Gillon has been on the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board since 2010, missing out on the North Shore Council seat by 128 votes in 2016.



On the Takapuna Car Park controversy, after initially opposing the sale, Gillon has switched to[ favouring an alternative plan put forward by designers Richard Reid & Associates](https://www.metromag.co.nz/society/society-politics/auckland-council-roadblocked-again-by-army-of-whingers-and-naysayers). 



Gillon’s planning ideology falls on the NIMBY/heritage imposition side of the ledger, opposing the development of denser multi-storey apartments. Heritage preservation is a bugbear particular to the Devonport area of his local board, where resident historical groups have run rampant against property owners, including businesses, with expensive court battles to prevent property owners enjoying the natural extension of ownership, making alterations to their buildings.



In 2014, Gillon backed the NIMBYs trying to block the redevelopment of the Baywater Village Marina, claiming that was what the community wanted. A Colmar Brunton poll at the time found that wasn’t the case, with 70% of residents polled being in favour of the development going ahead and 86% supporting new facilities for the Takapuna Rowing Club.



He says he will advocate strongly for reduced congestion on residential streets. However, his methods of congestion reduction tend to favour public transport options with buses and ferries and improved cycling and walking infrastructure.   
  
Private vehicle use is the overwhelming preference for Aucklanders, with car occupancy rates in Devonport and Takapuna averaging 1.2 people each. Were we talking about a private good or service, profits would come from providing what most consumers want. Because it is Council, with thinly-spread resources addressing an ‘expense,’ the strategy is altering preferences to cheaper transport methods by making private vehicles unbearable.

[ **View Danielle Grant’s campaign video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8q9WzHvClg)



Danielle Grant has served on the Kaipatiki Local Board for two terms and is standing again as well as running for the North Shore council ward, on the More For The Shore ticket with Grant Gillon.  
  
It’s a bit of an odd pairing up when you consider Grant contested North Shore on the right-wing Auckland Future ticket in 2016. This vote split led to popular and reliable Independent George Wood withdrawing from the Council race to form a new ticket on Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. The result of the 2016 election saw two left-wing candidates being returned to the Governing Body.



Grant Gillon, a former Alliance MP and union organiser is on the far left of the political spectrum so it is reasonable to presume that Danielle Grant’s driving priority is her own political career.



Her candidate profile provides overwhelming evidence that Danielle’s political principles are as flexible as a broken flip flop and leaves North Shore voters in a position of choosing the less bad option for their second vote.



Her message on congestion is that it is frustrating and she will hold Auckland Transport to account. That will be as effective as a slap with a wet wipe. She accurately identifies Lake Rd and Onewa Rd as the most urgent congestion hot points in the ward. Her solutions are “to lead the major projects we see before us [and] work for sensible solutions.” That’s a complete cop-out.



She advocates building more separate path options for cyclists, more frequent bus services and upgrades of the Bayswater Ferry terminal and an all weather service for Northcote wharf plus weekend ferry services in other parts of the ward. Completely useless.



Danielle Grant also states her focus is on Council core business. In reality, she is borrowing fiscally prudent buzzwords without taking them seriously. Increased funding for sporting groups, investing more money into increased numbers of Council owned social houses, and adding free wifi to bus stops are not core Council functions.



Grant also identifies climate change as a significant issue. That may or may not be the case but it isn’t a core Council issue. 



Prior to writing this article, I thought I’d be supporting Grant but now I don’t even trust her.



[ **Richard Hills**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=56ce699e-e685-4409-9588-12f268e7400d&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=North%20Shore%20Ward)– A Positive Voice for the Shore **$$**



Hills is the other left-wing incumbent in this ward, and essentially on the same ticket as Darby in every way except the affiliation slogan on their voting papers. He is also a longtime Labour party member, unsuccessfully seeking to be their candidate in the 2018 Northcote by-election. Hills beat Grant Gillon by 128 votes to become the Councillor in 2016.



Richard was awarded an A+ by radical left Generation Zero for his positions on housing, transport and the environment. No doubt that was helped by his support for Mayor Phil Goff’s dopey idea making buses free for under 15’s on weekends.



Projects which Hills takes some credit for driving include double-decker buses for Onewa Rd routes, water quality projects, the Beach Haven Ferry terminal and funding for parks, community facilities and Kaipatiki bush tracks.



The Devonport-Takapuna Local Board has attacked Auckland Council for later deferring the funding for some of those projects; however, Councillor Chris Darby says the reason for that funding deferment is the insistence of the local board on full public notification of the resource consent. That adds six to twelve months to the timeline, and Council finance policy only permits budgets to be confirmed when there is a reasonable chance of the project being delivered in the year it is budgeted for. Gillon has also complained that the local board only had three ‘growth funded’ projects in the area that were now funding deferred, another claim Hills points out is false.



Hills has also pushed the development of the Marlborough Park Youth facility and secured funding for Lake Rd, Birkenhead War Memorial and Skypath (which continues to suffer delays of its own).



Other priorities identified by Hills include making sure “those with diverse backgrounds are included in decision making.” upgrading bush tracks, playgrounds, sports fields and community facilities. He also wants to invest more in the arts; in my opinion that’s throwing money away rather than investing it.



Whatever I may think of Hills’ policy positions and achievements, he is at least engaging and competent. Hills has been effective and diligent over this term, make what you want from that.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** This is a hard pick. One unknown right wing candidate. Three well known left wing candidates. One former right wing candidate.

"**The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved by the regulatory body, the MRHA for widespread use.**
About 25,000 doses are set to arrive in Northern Ireland from next week and vaccinations could begin shortly after.
That is a few days ahead of schedule from the original estimate of 14 December.
But what does the vaccine's arrival mean and how will the rollout of the vaccination programmes work?
BBC News NI understands vaccinators will be the first to get the jab, from 9 December.
After that, interim guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) states the first people to get the vaccine should be residents in a care home for older adults and their carers.
They would be followed by those aged 80 and over as well as frontline health and social care workers.
The JCVI is a committee set up specifically for the purpose of deciding the order in which vaccines will be given.
The NI Department of Health has confirmed it will be following the JCVI's recommendations.
The first delivery of the vaccine coming to the UK contains 800,000 doses, with 25,000 for Northern Ireland.
It is expected that mass vaccination will only become available from the summer of 2021, according to previous comments from the health minister.
Robin Swann said there would be ""no quick fix"" and that it would be ""many months before the vaccination programme is complete"".
Mr Swann said ""next summer would be the extent of their plans"" when talking about a timeframe for widespread vaccinations.
Patricia Donnelly, who is heading up the vaccine rollout programme in Northern Ireland, said the fact the Pfizer vaccine had to be stored at a very low temperature and came in large packs meant it was more practical to bring those receiving it to larger centres - seven of which have been identified, including leisure centres and hospitals.
Work has already been carried out on identifying and preparing vaccination centres.
The Ulster Hospital is one of the designated vaccine points, with 18 areas set up for administering the injection.
The facility will cater for mostly South Eastern Trust staff but people who live in the area but work for another trust can opt to receive their jab there.
The vaccine has been produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and was the first to be approved for use in the UK.
It has reported 95% protection against Covid-19.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
The vaccine, which is made in Belgium, must be stored at about -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
Patients are given two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart.
Patricia Donnelly, who is leading the vaccine delivery project in Northern Ireland, said the vaccines came in what she described as ""pizza boxes"".
In each box there will be 195 vials, each containing five doses. This means each box will contain 975 doses.
There are some other promising vaccines that could also be approved soon.
One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered 7m doses that could be ready by the spring.
The UK has ordered 100m doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. That vaccine uses a harmless virus, altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19.
Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics.
Both work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine.
Some people have mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.
This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.
Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed."

While there is wailing and gnashing of teeth over the current midwest drought,

We have this interesting piece from the American Society of Agronomy :
Droughts can severely limit crop growth, causing yearly losses of around $8 billion in the United States. But it may be possible to minimize those losses if farmers can synchronize the growth of crops with periods of time when drought is less likely to occur. Researchers from Oklahoma State University are working to create a reliable “calendar” of seasonal drought patterns that could help farmers optimize crop production by avoiding days prone to drought.
Historical probabilities of drought, which can point to days on which crop water stress is likely, are often calculated using atmospheric data such as rainfall and temperatures. However, those measurements do not consider the soil properties of individual fields or sites.  
“Atmospheric variables do not take into account soil moisture,” explains Tyson Ochsner, lead author of the study. “And soil moisture can provide an important buffer against short-term precipitation deficits.”
In an attempt to more accurately assess drought probabilities, Ochsner and co-authors, Guilherme Torres and Romulo Lollato, used 15 years of soil moisture measurements from eight locations across Oklahoma to calculate soil water deficits and determine the days on which dry conditions would be likely. Results of the study, which began as a student-led class research project, were published online Jan. 29 in Agronomy Journal. The researchers found that soil water deficits more successfully identified periods during which plants were likely to be water stressed than did traditional atmospheric measurements when used as proposed by previous research.
Soil water deficit is defined in the study as the difference between the capacity of the soil to hold water and the actual water content calculated from long-term soil moisture measurements. Researchers then compared that soil water deficit to a threshold at which plants would experience water stress and, therefore, drought conditions. The threshold was determined for each study site since available water, a factor used to calculate threshold, is affected by specific soil characteristics.
“The soil water contents differ across sites and depths depending on the sand, silt, and clay contents,” says Ochsner. “Readily available water is a site- and depth-specific parameter.”
Upon calculating soil water deficits and stress thresholds for the study sites, the research team compared their assessment of drought probability to assessments made using atmospheric data. They found that a previously developed method using atmospheric data often underestimated drought conditions, while soil water deficits measurements more accurately and consistently assessed drought probabilities. Therefore, the researchers suggest that soil water data be used whenever it is available to create a picture of the days on which drought conditions are likely.
If soil measurements are not available, however, the researchers recommend that the calculations used for atmospheric assessments be reconfigured to be more accurate. The authors made two such changes in their study. First, they decreased the threshold at which plants were deemed stressed, thus allowing a smaller deficit to be considered a drought condition. They also increased the number of days over which atmospheric deficits were summed. Those two changes provided estimates that better agreed with soil water deficit probabilities.
Further research is needed, says Ochsner, to optimize atmospheric calculations and provide accurate estimations for those without soil water data. “We are in a time of rapid increase in the availability of soil moisture data, but many users will still have to rely on the atmospheric water deficit method for locations where soil moisture data are insufficient.”
Regardless of the method used, Ochsner and his team hope that their research will help farmers better plan the cultivation of their crops and avoid costly losses to drought conditions.

There is no trend whatsoever in US hurricane strength – this graph proves it. Click for story.
(via CFACT) The latest round of climate talks began this week in Doha, Qatar in the usual fashion – namely, with alarmist claims that the world is being imperiled by manmade global warming and it’s time for “action.”
Naturally, the U.S. is being chided to join the crowd, especially since it failed to do so last time by refusing to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. To pressure Uncle Sam into getting-with-the-program, some nations, like Gambia, have shamelessly stooped to using Hurricane Sandy and the outcome of our presidential election as a prod.
On Tuesday, the representative from Gambia said: 
“We hope that the year with a monster storm . . . as well as the re-elected leadership will lead the U.S. to be more active and will no longer be a disinterested bystander in this process.”
To address this matter, CFACT’s Marc Morano recently appeared on Fox News’ Neil Cavuto show and said that using storms as a poster child for global warming is devoid of science.
Watch the complete interview below.

Stated Morano:
“We have gone the longest period since the Civil War without a major landfalling category 3 or larger hurricane to hit the United States. If anything, global warming would prevent — at least Atlantic hurricanes — from making landfall.”
These facts have not deterred the Green activists and negotiators in Doha, however. Over the next few days, I and my CFACT team will be arriving in Doha to hold the UN’s feet to the fire.
As we proved in Durban last year, when the UN scuttled plans for an International Climate Court after we broke the story, CFACT knows how to be effective at UN conferences.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe ocean-acid-heads are tripping out once again, trying to scare the public with their hallucinatory visions of future marine catastrophes.
In a hearing by the Lower Saxony Environment Committee on June 16, 2014, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research) once again announced panic warnings of melting ice in the Arctic and ocean-acidification. EIKE reports here.

Geologist F.K. Ewert dismisses Stefan Rahmstorf’s alarmist claims of man-made ocean acidification. Photo credit: EIKE.
German geologist Prof. F.K. Ewert (photo) takes a close look at how these claims are exaggerated and how activist scientists attempt to use natural processes to create panic.
What follows is Prof. F.K. Ewert’s piece at EIKE in English (translated/edited by P Gosselin):

Expansion of Arctic sea ice, ocean acidification?
Statement on the presentation made by Prof. Dr. Rahmstorf (PIK) to the committee for Environment, Energy and Climate of the state parliament of Lower Saxony, 16 June 2014.
As is usual in so-called “climate science’, Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf is very selective with the facts: When they contradict the zeitgeist of man-made climate change, they get ignored. This way of conducting science is not new –– there have always been scientists who have served authority – and their own interests. Karl Popper recognized that science becomes ideology as soon as one stops to ask questions and only allows repetition instead. Plenty of examples are known.
German writer Goethe once said (18 Dec 1828): ‘One must always repeat what is true because fallacy is also constantly preached around us, and not from just one person, but by the masses in newspapers and encyclopedias, at schools and universities.’ At his presentation before the Committee for Environment, Energy and Climate at the state parliament of Lower Saxony on 16 June 2014, Prof. Rahmstorf once again practiced pseudoscience, this time it concerned Arctic sea ice extent and the ocean acidification.
Alleged shrinking of Arctic sea ice
The shrinking of Arctic sea ice up to the year 2012 was used by Rahmstorf as proof of the ongoing CO2-induced global warming. However the fact that sea ice grew 40% from August 2012 to August 2013 never got mentioned. The ice comes and goes because periodic, episodic fluctuations in temperature development also take place in the Arctic.
Ocean acidification

//-->




Prof. Rahmstorf informed that ‘our anthropogenic CO2 was causing an acidification of the ocean, which has increased 30%, and as a result the coral reefs are in danger.’
Are we really seeing the alleged acidity? No. This is because with a pH = 8.1 they are still very much alkaline. Foremost ocean researcher and climate agitator Rahmstorf apparently does not know about the chemistry of the ocean, let alone the coral reefs. Yet he sees himself qualified to judge this.
It is a fact that atmospheric CO2 concentration over the course of the earth’s history was far greater than it is today. And if that is the case, then so were the oceans. It is a fact that the pH value of the oceans has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1. This is nothing more then a small drop in alkalinity because water does not become acidic until the pH drops under 7.0. Whether the current pH change from 8.2 to 8.1 is new and unique, or can also be greater and how it was in former times, is unknown because no long-term measurements are available.
CO2 and H2O don’t want anything to do with each other and so they separate immediately after their first connection to carbonic acid. Only 1% of carbonic acid reacts and bonds with the plentiful amounts of calcium found in water to form calcium carbonate, which in water is only 0.0114 g/l soluble. While constantly new calcium carbonate forms, as lime slurry it has to settle and form limestone.
The biochemistry is more complex and involves many facets: One is that the skeletons of many animal species are formed with calcium carbonate. But not only clams and the like. Our limestone Alps for example were formed in large part from the calcium carbonate skeletons of protzoa. CO2 made it possible for their there calcium carbonate skeletons to be created.
Moreover CO2 is the building block of coral reefs. Their growth begins with algae that live in the corals, and they need CO2 in order to live and grow, and thus provide for the growth of calcium carbonate skeletons that eventually lead to the formation of the reefs. In addition to the large coral reefs of today’s tropical seas, there are countless relics made of large masses of calcium carbonate, also in our Central German mountains we are able to see them – e.g. in the Harz, Sauerland and Eifel regions. They were all once coral reefs in the ocean. Their CO2 content was considerably higher than today – and that was good because it produced huge quantities of limestone.
Therefore: without the building block of CO2 there would be no limestone and so no coral reefs! Admittedly the CO2 concentrations were greater than today. But it is unknown whether the pH value was maybe lower or higher than it is in our geological time and whether and how it changed.
And last but not least: What is the impact of the huge quantities of CO2 that are constantly pouring out of vents and volcanoes at the seabed? We neither know their quantities nor their temporal or spatial changes. One thing is certain: They are also involved in the formation of calcium carbonate and coral reefs.
Rahmstorf’s acidification theory leads us to ask on thing: What does this kind of climate and ocean research have to do with natural sciences?

As confrontation looms over Washington and Beijing, it is critical to identify the true nature of this challenge from an international relations perspective before any attempt to devise a counter measure. Wrong presumptions or prejudicial interpretations may lead to dire consequences of unforeseeable magnitude. One past example would be the U.S. government’s belief that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) before the American invasion in 2003. A more current example would be the American nuclear anxiety on North Korea and how President Trump bypassed conventional American strategic thinking and circumvented hawkish threats of preemptive nuclear annihilation to resolve a “draconian crisis” via “smart diplomacy.” These examples may shed light on a pathway to resolution for the current U.S.-China trade conflict.



The United States and China have ample experience of weathering a crisis on the brink of war, whether it was on the Korean Peninsula or in Indochina. China today remains on the U.S. sanctions list for certain high‐​tech products and military equipment. Both the Trump administration and Congress continue to criticize China regularly, ranging from human rights to religious rights, from the rule of law to the autocratic political system, from the state‐​owned banks to restrictive market access to foreign corporations, and from currency manipulation to unfair trade practices.



Recently, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson spoke in Singapore about a growing consensus in the U.S. establishment that views China “not just as a strategic challenge to the United States but as a country whose rise has come at America’s expense.” He warned that the arguments raised by many influential voices for the “decoupling” of the two economies, which have also fueled a new consensus in Washington that China is not just a strategic competitor but a “major long‐​term adversary,” will not be going away anytime soon. After reflecting on a decade of tough‐​minded but cooperative interaction with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan since the 2008 financial crisis, Paulson stated that he now sees the prospect of an “Economic Iron Curtain” (Paulson 2018).



It wasn’t so long ago that the two nations were working together to ensure the world functioned properly, including the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, and the six‐​party talks on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. In fact, further in the past, the two nations even worked together to contain the Soviet Union. It is difficult to imagine that, after just a few years, one change of government would lead to the current state of friction — with decoupling becoming a major topic among Washington elites, while the FBI and national security agencies are considering restrictions on university and immigration policies to keep Chinese students from studying science and engineering in the United States. If these ludicrous ideas are being bandied about, talks of the two nations spiraling into a new Cold War may no longer seem unimaginable.



There is no doubt that the United States and China are in a state of strengthening competition; denying the potential repercussion is like not seeing an elephant in the room. However, is war or decoupling the only option? Even those who normally advocate force to compel compliance should think twice in this case about alternatives or consequential outcomes. China is not Nazi Germany, certainly not the Soviet Union, and has no place on the so‐​called Axis of Evil that President George W. Bush used to describe North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and other governments that sponsored terrorism. No other label would justify the hostility toward China, a competitor/​partner in economics and politics of more than 40 years. The outdated American framework of thinking of countries as either adversaries or alliance partners no longer fits, especially in the case of China. It is time to heed Paulson’s advice that the stakes for the world are higher than ever before, therefore “we need to craft a new framework that works for today’s world, not the world of the past” (Paulson 2018).



The current state of U.S.-China relations weighs heavily on people from all sectors, including politicians, businessmen, and ordinary consumers. Most would define the current impasse as historical, with unpredictable outcomes, as friction may lead to direct conflict.



China and the United States are two nations with very different ideologies, demographics, social structures, economic development patterns, and power projections based on very distinct global outlooks. It is inevitable that they would need to address clashes in viewpoints with more intensity and deliberation. The outcome could lead to either conflict or partnership between two distinctive development models. Contemplating conflict may ultimately lead to war, with the current trade war only a reminder of a much graver situation. Maneuvering the differences toward partnership would ultimately require intelligent people, and it would lead to a peaceful resolution given time.



China and the United States are in different stages of development, and their ideological perspectives clash. Unfortunately, President Trump overlooks these key distinctions and focuses simply on the balance of trade and the size of the bilateral deficit with China. He thinks in terms of a zero‐​sum game, with one winner (China) and one loser (America). Moreover, he sees the trade imbalance as a threat to U.S. national security. Is this the proper path to examine trade and the overall relationship of two major world powers? Clearly not!



China will soon become the world’s largest economic power in terms of GDP in manufacturing and trade, mainly due to the size of its population. Is China then becoming a threat? Only if the American leaders would like to blindly believe so, or worse, if politicians twist China’s image into the “evil empire.” GDP or trade figures do not accurately represent the actual size of wealth or even power, they merely illustrate that there are many hard‐​working Chinese. As there are four times more people to feed in China than in the United States, intelligent people would notice the rather “unproductiveness” of the Chinese people on a per capita basis.



Henry Kissinger (2011) has dedicated an entire book on China appropriately named _On China_. However, in a previous book focused on U.S. foreign policy published just before the 9/11 attacks, he mentioned China only twice in passing (Kissinger 2001). I asked him then why he left out China in summarizing America’s world outlook. He brushed that aside and simply noted that it might not have been the right time to do so. Yet, if that was not the right time then, was it when President Obama in his 2010 State of the Union address declared that he did not “accept second place for the United States,” or when he announced his “Pivot to Asia” strategy and the establishment of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP)? Was it the right time when President Trump declared his trade war on China after abandoning the TPP? The rise of China is real, and it will not be stopped. Americans need to examine China’s rise positively and devise comprehensive strategies accordingly, in order to manage the coming new world order.



The rise of China does not necessarily mean the fall of the United States. Indeed, to assume that China’s rise will necessarily be accompanied by America’s decline is inaccurate, if not ignorant — especially by using simply trade and GDP figures for calculation and analysis. Many Americans did not foresee the rise of China, but to further that error by accusing China of intentional diversion would be irresponsible. Even if Americans had become aware of China’s rise earlier, any attempt to repress it would have been futile, just as America’s rise was inevitable, even if the Japanese fantasized that an attack on Pearl Harbor would hold off the United States from the war in Asia.



China’s economic rise will remain the greatest challenge to America for coming generations. How should the United States prepare for it? I believe it is essential to confront the challenges with honesty and openness, and to manage the generational challenges with confidence, strength and perseverance — just as the Chinese did when they were challenged, even humiliated and defeated, in the past two centuries. The Chinese people complained about the West and Japan’s invasion and occupation. However, they also spent time and effort on introspection to recognize their own mistakes and weaknesses and then sought to strengthen their country’s defense through military modernization. China did not exploit others in the process of growing its economy. As the _Analects_ state: “The man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.”1



The economic rise of China should not be perceived as a threat, just as the rise of the United States at the turn of the 20th century was not a threat to Great Britain, Europe, or anyone else. Only to those who would compare China to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union would the future seem perilous. Zbigniew Brzezinski saw China’s aspiration to world power as “neither revolutionary nor messianic nor Manichean” (Brzezinski 2012: 78–79). He believed that China saw “the rapid decline of America’s global primacy would produce a global crisis that would devastate China’s own well‐​being and damage its long‐​range prospects.”



Trade with China should not be perceived as a threat. U.S. consumers of final and intermediate goods have benefited from China’s opening to the outside world. Imports from China have widened the range of choices open to U.S. citizens and motivated more efficient production at home. Moreover, focusing on bilateral trade deficits diverts attention from the underlying weaknesses of the U.S. policy regime, in particular the unsustainable long‐​run fiscal deficits driven by rapid growth in entitlement spending, the unnecessary rise in defense spending, and tax cuts. The United States should seriously consider economic structural reform instead of empty talk by politicians. The worst threat would be to believe that there is nothing wrong in the U.S. economy or that American problems are caused by unscrupulous foreigners.



The “Belt and Road Initiative” is an attempt to strengthen other economies so that China can benefit economically and foster peace in the greater region. I believe the fundamental premise of western economic thinking is not a zero‐​sum theory, and trade serves as an important lever. Any economically motivated region would have a better chance of fostering peace among members that trade with each other than an isolated country with a significant wealth gap with its neighbors.



Trade works in different ways at different times with different products and among different traders. Either negotiations or war tactics can be used to resolve trade conflicts. In a civilized world, negotiations are the only path forward. The negotiations approach to settle trade disputes between the United States and China has worked well up to now and will likely prevail in the future.



Many authorities argue that the United States is ideologically committed to its liberal capitalist system. However, they do not want to openly admit that the United States is also driven by power, national interest, and world leadership. The obsession in Washington to hold on to the solo superpower status and the fear of losing absolute power have created this current zealous guardian of American national interest. Yet it is counterproductive to hyperinflate U.S. leadership via military and economic might or even the poorly defined “soft power.” The fate of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and even Imperial China should serve as warning to those who indulge in the dreams of an American empire. Indeed, the size of an economy, dominant position of its currency, industrial strength, supremacy of its technology, military budgetary resources, or the size of a nuclear arsenal have never bestowed the crown on a superpower. As Brzezinski (2012: 2–3) once warned, America simply cannot “retreat into an ignorant garrison‐​state mentality or wallow in self‐​righteous cultural hedonism” just when the world needs guidance on how to engage with the “new East.”



The influence of North Korea and Israel are good cases for the United States to reexamine its definition of power. They are both small nations enclosed in a hostile environment. With political and strategic shrewdness, they have become regional powers that maintain geopolitical balance in the best interest of their own survival. If we look back in history, the fragility of the Soviet Union seemed unfathomable, but its strong military force was defeated in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in 1969, China, with a very weak economy, had a border clash with the Soviet Union prior to President Nixon’s first visit to Beijing in 1972, and the United States sought out China to jointly counter the Soviet threat. These historical events are clear illustrations that the notion of a superpower needs to be reexamined if not redefined. The 2008 financial crisis struck when the United States was the world’s only superpower. America’s superpower status did not prevent the 9/11 attacks, nor did it allow the United States to achieve an easy victory in Afghanistan and Syria. Likewise, the United States did not successfully prevent North Korea from developing its nuclear capability, nor prevent Crimea from becoming a part of Russia. The superpower status conundrum needs to be reexamined.



The largest structural issue between China and the United States is the American obsession with its superpower status and the size of China’s population. With President Trump and the many ideologues around him, such obsession could intensify as they prepare to confront a large population of 1.4 billion on the rise.



Americans failed to recognize the economic rise of China when it was so evident. Indeed, the United States gets blindsided often, such as with the rise of India and Africa. China is only the first of a whole string of emerging economies that the United States will likely have to cope with in the coming decades. As early as 1997, Brzezinski declared, “America is not only the first, as well as the only, truly global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last” (Brzezinski (1997: 209). This realization represents an opportunity for economic growth and possibly a more harmonious world, rather than the end of something great. Power never represents greatness, even if we would welcome the humbling of one nation with the emergence of many. A wrong assessment could give rise to costly consequences and derail the trajectory of a great nation.



Most Americans know about the Cold War and how it ended. Our world does not need another one. China is not the Soviet Union, and the United States is also not the same 30 years later. China-U.S. trade and people‐​to‐​people relationships are in no way comparable to the Cold War. Unfortunately, there are politicians on both sides who cultivate fear for their short‐​term advantages. The populist movement in the West is where concern should be focused, and the October 2018 speech by Vice President Pence on China is unfortunately a highly debated illustration (see Pence 2018). Americans should remember how the wrath of McCarthyism harmed its country after WWII and recall the lessons learned from wars fought based on ideology. After many years of instability in Muslim nations caused by the Arab Spring and the continuing war in Syria, there is clearly no victory in sight for American interest. Vietnam remains governed by the communist party and is trading with the United States, after so much money spent and so many Americans killed during the war. North Korea remains after so many decades of conflict, and the U.S. president is still working hard to contain its threat.



No matter what happens to the current trade conflict, the United States and China are going to thrive in the next few decades. They will witness other powers emerge, and possibly challenge whatever dominant position they hold by then. _We should not see such rising powers as a threat, but as an economic opportunity._ Without such external stimulus, we may become complacent; just like what happened to imperial China two centuries earlier, when Great Britain used its gunboats to open up the Chinese market for opium trade, Americans believe China is overtaking them in terms of wealth. However, threat and challenge are not easily differentiated. It is also important not to mistake economic or containable geopolitical challenge as strategic threat and, in turn, overreact in military terms — the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Syrian Civil War are examples. Russia is clearly less a threat to the world compared to the Soviet Union. Maybe American strategic thinkers should devise an alternative framework with which to view its relationship with President Putin instead of narrowly identifying him as an expansionist.



In his latest book, titled _World Order_ , Kissinger declared, “The reconstruction of the international system is the ultimate challenge to statesmanship in our time,” and “the affirmation of America’s exceptional nature must be sustained” (Kissinger 2014: 371, 373). Hank Paulson also spoke of the negative consequences if the United States and China fail to find a consensus: failure would lead to “systemic risk of monumental proportions — not just to the global economy, as I dealt with, but to international order as we know it and to world peace” (Paulson 2018). Such risk could only be managed if Washington and Beijing provide “strong and wise leadership.”



War and conflict are not solutions to many problems of our time. We may no longer have great wars such as WWI and WWII, but the so‐​called small wars are still causing great sadness to millions of people and families. It is important to properly define the differences we are confronted with, and identify ways to resolve them, so that this world can be more harmonious. President Trump and President Xi have taken a great step forward at the G20 in Buenos Aires, when they agreed to resolve differences between the two countries through dialogue. They also interrupted any further escalation of trade tariffs in order to give negotiations an opportunity to work out. The current trade war between the two largest economies has already damaged the growth dynamics in the world. It is crucial that they manage to contain their economic differences and prevent the world from moving toward another recession.



Both China and the United States are great countries. Such greatness is not the result of their military strength or wealth. The American elite on foreign policy must not indulge in the self‐​fulfilling prophecy about America’s abstract greatness. True greatness can be achieved only after it withstands the test of history.



In the past, China suffered great humiliation under Western imperialism. In the search for its role and identity in the modern age, China also suffered greatly from civil wars, economic confusion, and human disaster caused by policy failure, which was best illustrated by Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Only when the Chinese leadership and elites reckoned with these past failures did reform begin. During the past 40 years, China has achieved great success in reforming the economy and promoting a higher standard of living and has gained respect from the international community. It is not difficult to learn from history, but lessons will be difficult if we resist the call of history. Both the leaders of China and of the United States clearly have enough intelligence to know when the time has come to heed the call for peaceful development.

David Rose of the Mail on Sunday is having a go at the Committee on Climate Change for their denial of the points raised in his article last week and this graph, which was sourced from NCAR and used in the Economist article noted on WUWT.

Rather stubborn, these blokes.
Excerpt:
The official watchdog that advises the Government on greenhouse gas emissions targets has launched an astonishing attack on The Mail on Sunday – for accurately reporting that alarming predictions of global warming are wrong.

We disclosed that although highly influential computer models are still estimating huge rises in world temperatures, there has been no statistically significant increase for more than 16 years.
Despite our revelation earlier this month, backed up by a scientifically researched graph, the Committee on Climate Change still clings to flawed predictions.
Leading the attack is committee member Sir Brian Hoskins, who is also director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College, London. In a blog on the Committee on Climate Change’s website, Sir Brian insisted: ‘The scientific basis for significant long-term climate risks remains robust, despite the points raised .  .  . Early and deep cuts in emissions are still required.’
He also claimed our report ‘misunderstood’ the value of computer models. Yet in an interview three years ago, Sir Brian conceded that when he started out as a climate scientist, the models were ‘pretty lousy, and they’re still pretty lousy, really’.
Our graph earlier this month was reproduced from a version first drawn by Dr Ed Hawkins, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Last week it was reprinted as part of a four-page report in The Economist.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s executive order on immigration has prompted a constitutional showdown that could leave a mark on the law for generations and seems likely to end in a landmark Supreme Court decision. A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions: How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration, and how much power has Congress given him? The likely answer to both questions: a lot. But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power. Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion. Here is a look at the leading arguments in the case. Many trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order. But none have issued an order as broad as the one by Judge James Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, who blocked the key parts of  the executive order, which had suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation’s refugee program. The case is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. That court on Saturday declined to issue an immediate stay of Judge Robart’s order, but it indicated that it would weigh in soon after additional briefs were filed, with the last one due Monday afternoon. After it rules, an appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely. Judge Robart’s brisk ruling contained almost no reasoning. By contrast, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the Federal District Court in Boston, issued a   decision on Friday refusing to block the program and discussing the legal arguments in detail. Judge Gorton also sketched out the broader picture. “The rich immigrant history of the United States has long been a source of strength and pride in this country,” Judge Gorton wrote. “Conversely, the public interest in safety and security in this   dangerous world is strong as well. ” The balance, he wrote, tipped in favor of Mr. Trump. Article II of the Constitution confers authority on the president, the Supreme Court has said, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration. In their brief to Judge Robart, lawyers for Washington State, one of the two plaintiffs, along with the State of Minnesota, said there were constitutional checks on these powers. “While courts generally give more latitude to the political branches in the immigration context, this does not mean that the political branches can act with impunity,” the brief said. “Federal courts,” the brief said, “have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct. ” In the Ninth Circuit, the Trump administration said judges were   to decide cases involving national security. “Unlike the president,” the administration’s brief said, “courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process. ” Noah G. Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington State, appeared to concede in court that there were areas in which Mr. Trump was entitled to act. But he asked the court to protect people whose lives had been changed by Mr. Trump’s order in a flash. “The focus of our claim,” he said, “is on people who have been here and have, overnight, lost the right to travel, lost the right to visit their families, lost the right to go perform research, lost the right to go speak at conferences around the world. And also people who had lived here for a long time and happened to be overseas at the time of this order, which came with no warning whatsoever, and suddenly lost the right to return to the United States. ” On Friday, defending Mr. Trump’s executive order in a Seattle courtroom, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, cited Youngstown Sheet  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, a 1952 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman’s assertion that he had the authority to seize steel mills during the Korean War. The most famous part of the decision is a concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, which set out a framework for considering clashes between presidential power and congressional authority. The president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent. The president’s power is at its “lowest ebb,” Justice Jackson wrote, when Congress has forbidden a particular action. Truman’s actions fell into the third category, Justice Jackson wrote. Ms. Bennett, by contrast, said Mr. Trump’s order was in the first category. “Here we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he’s acting at the apex of his power,” she said. A key part of immigration law does give the president broad power. It says, “Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. ” But another part of the law forbids discrimination “because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,” but only “in the issuance of an immigrant visa. ” The Trump administration argues that the power to bar entry, the subject of the first law, is broader than the limits on issuing visas. Lawyers for Washington State have said that the executive order violates the First Amendment’s prohibition against government establishment of religion because its provisions on the refugee program favor minority religions. “President Trump and his advisers have made clear that the very purpose of this order is to tilt the scales in favor of Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,” they wrote in their brief to Judge Robart. The Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president’s motives, the brief said, would violate the separation of powers. “The more searching inquiry envisioned by the states would create substantial    problems, by permitting probing of the president’s subjective motive in issuing the order,” the brief said. The states challenging the order face the initial hurdle of demonstrating that they have suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gives them standing to sue. Judge Robart ruled that they did, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which said Texas could sue to challenge President Barack Obama’s plan to defer the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants and allow them to work. “The executive order adversely affects the states’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,” Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases. In its Ninth Circuit brief, the Trump administration called the states’ asserted injuries “attenuated and speculative” and did not address the Texas decision. In court in Seattle on Friday, Ms. Bennett said the government disagreed with the Texas ruling."
"**What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales so far?**
We seem to be bombarded with different measures, but what do they mean and how does Wales compare with other parts of the UK?
Here, we try to answer some of the questions and explain what the different measures are and also give some of the most recent figures.
The south Wales valleys had been dominating for highest case rates, but had fallen back early in November. Now they have started to move up again,, albeit more gradually.
In the most recent comparable week, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot have been among the 10 highest case rate areas in the UK.
**Blaenau Gwent** has seen cases continue to rise, if at a slower rate, currently 453.7 cases per 100,000 people.
**Torfaen** had the highest case rate in Wales but has eased off a little to 402.3 per 100,000 in the last week and its positivity rate is now below 20% again.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.
Only Pontypool currently stands in the highest case rates in Wales, broken down at a localised level, at 846.7 cases per 100,000 in the last week - 77 actual cases.
**Newport** has also seen its case rate increase to 307.7.
**Merthyr Tydfil** hit a peak of 769 cases per 100,000 people at the end of October, by far the highest rate in Wales, and was the hardest-hit area in the UK.
There has been an improvement in recent weeks but it has risen again to 331.5 cases per 100,000 people
Although there is a mass testing programme in the area, results from these tests have not yet been released and do not count in the Public Health Wales statistics.
**Rhondda Cynon Taf** (RCT) also has a case rate of 304.6 per 100,000 now, fairly steady, reporting 779 new positive tests in the past week.
Ferndale and Maerdy has the highest case rate in Wales, 941.8 cases per 100,000 - 54 cases in the last week.
**Cardiff's** case rate stands at just above 226.8 cases per 100,000, having stabilised after a fall in student cases, although it has nudged upwards in recent days.
There are only five cases a day on average among Cardiff University students in this period.
The positivity rate in Wales had been slowly falling but has stabilised to 13.2% on average and 10 council areas saw an increase, although mostly negligible.
Neath Port Talbot has the highest now, with Torfaen not far behind. Conwy has the lowest, just 2.5% of tests proved positive in the last week.
**Wrexham's** case rate has risen to 194.2 cases per 100,000 and has overtaken **Flintshire** again but case rates in north Wales are fairly stable.
The lowest case rates in Wales remain in north-west Wales across **Conwy** and **Gwynedd.**
You can see a steady climb in **Swansea** and also **Neath Port Talbot** (NPT), where Cimla has the highest localised rate in Wales currently at 920.1 cases per 100,000 - 47 in the last week. Cwmafan is also fifthhighest.
**Carmarthenshire** has climbed slowly to 215.1 cases per 100,000 while **Bridgend** is 228.5.
Meanwhile, **Ceredigion's** contact tracing team has warned of an ""alarming spread"" of cases in the Cardigan area, with 55 cases linking back to ""super spreader"" events such as parties and large social gatherings in pubs over the last fortnight.
The county's case rate as a whole has increased in recent weeks - at 145.8 it has been getting closer to the Wales average - and in the Cardigan area the local case rate has eased off to 642 per 100,000 in the last week but still the sixth highest in Wales.
Why do we look at cases per 100,000 going back about three days?
Because of a lag in results coming back, Public Health Wales (PHW) said the case rate figures it publishes daily on its dashboard can be an underestimate.
So, it is more accurate to wait for those late results to come in before looking at what the picture is - a bit like in football, waiting on a Saturday evening for all the final scores to come in before looking at the league tables.
The latest infection survey in Wales suggests that Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October.
Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it's a further indication that infections could be easing.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 18,400 people at random in Wales over six weeks.
From the results, it can estimate that 16,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 21 November.
This is one in 185 people.
Last week's survey estimated that 18,400 people in Wales had coronavirus - about 0.61% or one in 165 people.
It says due to the sample size, results should be interpreted with caution.
Similar surveys suggest cases have levelled off in England (one in 85 people estimated to be infected) while falling back in Northern Ireland. Positivity rates in Scotland have increased in the most recent week, after appearing to have levelled off.
The highest Covid-19 positivity rates remain in north West England and Yorkshire and The Humber.
The highest positivity rates are seen among secondary school-aged children and older teenagers and young adults.
Local breakdowns are not possible within Wales.
The seven-day average in total daily admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases remains fairly steady, running at a daily seven-day average of 81 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19, the lowest for more than a month.
There has been a rise of Covid-19 infections within hospitals in recent weeks.
There were 203 hospital onset cases across Wales in the week to 22 November, according to official PHW figures.
But is a drop of the 269 in the previous week.
The biggest jump in the latest week has been in the Hywel Dda health board, with 42 ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases, more than double the previous week.
Apart from Cardiff and Vale, most other areas saw a decline.
This includes Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which reported 19 more deaths linked to hospital infections in the last week.
Over the summer PHW revealed hundreds of patients caught coronavirus while in hospital.
Early on the pandemic, there were high numbers of hospital infections in the Aneurin Bevan health board - which was a hotspot for Covid-19 in March - followed by Cwm Taf and Cardiff and Vale in April and in Betsi Cadwaladr over the summer
This followed analysis into ""probable"" and ""definite"" infections of patients, an issue particularly early on in the pandemic.
Overall, 94% of Covid-19 infections occur in the community - only 6% are caught within hospitals.
Health officials say we should also look at how many people are consulting their GP - as another indicator of how the virus is progressing.
This surveillance data involved about 400 GP practices.
PHW's data dashboard also shows consultations for flu and respiratory conditions. The most recent figures showed around 15 consultations per 100,000 people for suspected Covid-19, compared with about 1.1 per 100,000 for flu symptoms.
In Wales, there were 223 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending 20 November. This is 33 more deaths than the week before and 26.3% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
There were 65 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area - 44 in hospital. There have been 177 deaths from Covid-19 infections caught in hospital outbreaks up to last week.
There were also 47 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 38 deaths in Swansea Bay, 21 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 23 in Cardiff and Vale.
There were 21 deaths in Hywel Dda - more than double the figure last week - and eight deaths involving Powys residents, five of them in hospital.
The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 13 November was 3,464 deaths.
When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,536 deaths occurring up to 20 November.
RCT, with 503 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales. Cardiff has had 442 up to the latest week.
So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average.
Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.
In Wales, the number of deaths increased from 742 to 848 in the latest week, which was 195 deaths (29.9%) higher than the five-year average for that week.
In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes in 2020 up to 13 November was 32,059, which is 2,635 (9% ) more than the five-year average.
Of these, 3,240 (10%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.
The mortality figures up to the end of October show the peak was on 8 April.
It has been estimated by ONS that 88.9% of deaths where doctors have mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, that it was the underlying cause of death.
So in October, 236 deaths were due to Covid-19. But there were another 49 when Covid-19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate, and a factor in the death.
In Wales, 29,018 deaths from all causes had been registered by 7 November, which was 1,419 more deaths than the five-year average.
Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 2,629 of those deaths (9.1%).
Early on in the pandemic, the hotspot was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south east Wales.
Over the summer, Betsi Cadwaladr health board, in north Wales, showed more of a spike in Covid-19 deaths compared with health boards in south Wales.
But Cwm Taf Morgannwg, due to the hospital outbreaks, has now shown a rise in recent weeks.
RCT has 209.5 deaths per 100,000 people - the second highest rate across all local authorities in England and Wales.
This is followed by Merthyr (197.7 per 100,000, now ranked third for mortality rate involving Covid-19) and Blaenau Gwent (162, 30th).
Ceredigion now has the seventh-lowest death rate behind the likes of Isles of Scilly, Norwich, Hams and Hastings, with 31.5 per 100,000. Pembrokeshire is also in the bottom 20.
When looking at the highest death rates across England and Wales, Tameside in Greater Manchester is the highest, with the likes of Liverpool, Bury, Oldham and Sunderland also in the top 10.
Across England and Wales, north-west England again had the largest number of deaths involving Covid-19 (629 deaths) in the most recent week, which is nearly a third of deaths for the week.
Across the UK, there were 2,473 more deaths than the five-year average. Of 14,276 deaths from all causes, 3,038 involved Covid-19.
In the latest week, England had 2,471 deaths, followed by Scotland with 244 deaths, Wales with 223 deaths and Northern Ireland (100 deaths).
There have been a total of 851 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 20 November, making up 24.6% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.
Meanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) compiles its own figures, which showed they have been notified of 5,562 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March.
This is 41% more care home deaths than notified in the same time period last year, and 35% higher than for the same period in 2018.
Of these, 934 deaths involved suspected or confirmed Covid-19, which makes up 17% of all reported deaths.
CIW is now updating its figures every two weeks.
There were 58 care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, the highest number since mid May.
Eleven of the deaths were in care homes in RCT, nine in Neath Port Talbot and six in the Vale of Glamorgan.
The ONS said, across England and Wales, deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes as a proportion of all deaths in care homes rose in the latest week - to 18.9% of all care home deaths. Overall deaths in care homes were above the five-year average.
More than 1,600 extra deaths have occurred in people's own homes in Wales so far this year than average, according to analysis by the ONS.
Deaths from heart disease amongst men in their own homes were 22.7% higher compared with the five-year average - while there were more than 29% fewer deaths through this cause in hospital.
Deaths for women from dementia in their own homes almost doubled in Wales, while in hospitals they fell by 25.5%.
""While deaths in hospitals and care homes have dropped below the five-year average since the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic, we've consistently seen deaths in private homes remain well above the five-year average,"" said ONS analyst Sarah Caul.
Unlike the high numbers of deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals and care homes, the majority of deaths in private homes are unrelated to the virus.
Up to 11 September, there have been 7,440 deaths in people's homes in Wales, with 134 of these involving Covid-19. This was 1,624 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period.
Nearly two-thirds of these excess deaths came in the 70 to 89 years age group.
One expert has suggested these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital.
People may have been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted, Sir David Spiegelhalter of the Cambridge University said.
The ONS has published figures which suggest the mortality rate is nearly twice as high for Covid-19 deaths in Wales' poorest areas than its least deprived ones.
There were 151 deaths per 100,000 population in the period up to 6 November in the most deprived areas.
This compares with 73.8 deaths in least deprived parts, the ONS has said.
Wales on average has a mortality rate of 91.2 per 100,000, where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate.
The ONS has also developed a tool so people can see the number of deaths from the virus at a neighbourhood level.
Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in Wales in both April and May, before dropping to third in June.
Over the summer it dropped significantly as a cause of death, but was back to being third leading cause of death in October, behind dementia and heart disease.
The age-adjusted mortality rate in Wales for deaths due to Covid in October was 81.9 deaths per 100,000 - significantly higher than in England (63.5 per 100,000) for the first time.
This was still was 83.5% lower than the peak in April.
For flu and pneumonia, there were 34 deaths per 100,000 - the seventh leading cause of death.
Meanwhile, so far this year, there have been more than twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than flu and pneumonia in Wales up to the end of August.
ONS said a smaller proportion (65.2%) of Covid-19 deaths in Wales occurred in hospitals and private homes (4.9%) compared with 2020 deaths due to influenza and pneumonia and the five-year average.
However, 28.6% of Covid deaths occurred in care homes, more than twice the proportion of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia so far this year.
More than 1.5 million tests had been carried out by 28 November, including 710,227 on key workers and care home residents.
The biggest proportion of positive tests - 60% - are women and the age group with most positive tests are those in their 50s.
A total of 14,985 people in their 20s have also tested positive - 1,282 more than the week before and the number has been steadily rising.
The proportion has also slightly grown over the month and this age group is now nearly 17% of all people tested so far.
Nearly twice as many children under 10 and 46% more children and young people aged 10 to 19 are also testing positive than a month ago.
Separate figures, now published weekly, show more than half of schools have been affected by the virus since September.
We can also see from more detailed PHW figures how many different key workers and others have been tested - and how speedily results are coming back.
Across Wales, 3,491 care home residents were tested in the most recent week and 302 (8.6%) were positive - exactly the same figures as the previous week. But it has dropped from the numbers we saw at the end of October.
Also, 134 care home workers tested positive but 96% of tests were negative.
Broken down, these included 85 positive tests among care homes residents and key workers in Torfaen, 79 in Neath Port Talbot and 70 in RCT in the most recent week.
The ""test, trace, protect"" system for contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contact has seen an improvement in recent weeks.
Of the 5,330 positive cases that were eligible for follow-up in Wales in the most recent week, 92% were reached, 80% within 24 hours of referral to the contact tracing system and 89% were reached within 48 hours - both improving times.
This equates to 87% of those successfully reached being reached within 24 hours and 96% within 48 hours.
Of the 17,637 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 68% were reached within 24 hours of being identified by a positive case.
The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing.
The data is revised and PHW refines and verifies it and then each individual fatality is assigned to the date at which it occurred.
The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from all the different data sources - and how there is a difference of up to 1,125 deaths.
The figure for total deaths being given by PHW has been consistently around 60% of what has turned out to be the total figure when including all registered deaths.
NHS Wales' chief statistician argues to look at the trend and the curve of the outbreak, it is best to focus on deaths on the day they have occurred rather than the daily PHW figures as they first appear, as these can be volatile.
So the chart above shows the daily deaths, as they have been adjusted, as well as a seven-day rolling average.
By 28 November, there was an average of around 17 deaths a day, with the 31 deaths occurring on 5 November, the highest daily figure since the last week of April.
Meanwhile, analysts at Johns Hopkins University in America have been looking at the global picture in detail, giving regular updates, and currently rank the United Kingdom third highest in terms of mortality rate for major countries in cases per population.
Getting accurate figures on how many people recover is difficult.
NHS Wales in early November estimated nearly 16,000 people had been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus since the pandemic started.
Meanwhile, doctors are looking to the effects of ""long Covid,"" with one study estimating one in 20 people are ill for at least eight weeks.
Doctors at Wales' largest hospital, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in May said 30% of patients admitted to its intensive care unit with Covid-19 had died and said the road to recovery was long.
Another hospital in the valleys had a survival rate of 55% for those critically ill with suspected or confirmed Covid.
Analysis of more than 10,700 patients who had been in critical care units with Covid across the UK found 60% survived. Of those 6,460 who were transferred to acute beds, 91% recovered and were later discharged from hospital, 4.4% were still recovering in hospital and 4.9% died.
Further research into 856 critical care patients admitted from the start of September found 11.6% died and more than half were still in critical care."

 **Auckland Mayoralty**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



I had initially planned to complete all the ward contests before moving on to the Auckland Mayoralty, but that meant it may not be completed until early October. Due to the Mayoral race being the only contest that every Auckland voter participates in, I think getting this published next is the right thing to do.



As of September 26, just 3.19% of votes have been counted. At the same stage in 2016, it was 5.79%



The scheduled ward and some local board races will resume following my article on the Auckland Mayoralty; starting with Devonport-Takapuna Local Board then Orakei ward and local board races.  




[ **Tricia Cheel**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=37655be1-da03-42db-8e1c-1d37ea62f0b6&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– STOP Trashing Our Planet[ ****](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=37655be1-da03-42db-8e1c-1d37ea62f0b6&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)  




So far this election, I’ve never rated any candidate higher than 4 clowns. Congratulations Tricia Cheel on becoming the first to get a **5 clown rating!** For every loony, unscientific, paranoid conspiracy you can think of Tricia has so many more that you could never imagine.



Cheel also wants to ban fluoride, 5G and genetic engineering. She is vocally opposed to vaccines. Will be interesting to see how her vote in South Auckland compares to the rest of the country. If that didn’t trigger enough laughs, check out these:

Coote has just one priority if elected Mayor of Auckland. That is strictly equal treatment of all races by Auckland Council. He targets special rights and privileges granted to Maori first and foremost.



In principle I agree with him but there are two reasons why I hesitate to give him a ringing endorsement. Firstly, the Council has no power to remove the Independent Maori Statutory Board, it exists as a consequence of central government legislation. Secondly, organisations set up for the purpose of implementing racial equality such as 1 Law 4 All, Hobson’s Pledge etc. tend to attract nasty racist white people. I’ll probably attract a bit of flak for saying so, but I’ve associated with enough groups and people interested in that issue and they quickly become riddled with genuine racists.



Coote is also running in Waitakere ward, so I had a look at his profile to see if there is anything else that interests him. Just dogs. He is really anti-dog. I sympathise a little but hating dogs is not a tenable campaign platform.



[ **David Feist**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=0f71d784-540f-4378-a95f-8843672a1b02&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– LiftNZ **$$$$**



Feist is using the mayoral race to launch a new political party called [LiftNZ](https://www.liftnz.org.nz/). The policies are actually pretty good but have really been written with a central government election in mind. It is not currently a registered party.



Feist opposes the current compact city model Council planners have been pushing since the super city formation. Feist will abolish the urban boundary, permit housing on rural land, encourage targeted rates and widen motorways (not a Council responsibility). 



He would like to draft a new Unitary Plan with affordable housing as it’s main priority. The plan will have a “price trigger” inserted so more land is automatically released when rural land just outside the boundary is 20% more expensive than land just inside the boundary. I think he’s gotten a bit confused – land inside the boundary is 8 times the price of land outside. Maybe he should just stick with the original, sensible urban boundary abolition.



He will also allow residential subdivision on all land zoned rural in Auckland.

Genevieve looks one of those nosey neighbours who sticks their head over the fence to complain when your grass grows a bit too high.



The number one concern she has is the climate and she wants to create a plan that will reduce GHG emissions 45% by 2030 as the UN advocates.



She wants to achieve this by marginalising private cars, providing free public transport, electric buses and more safe priority lanes for bikes. By Marginalising cars, she means a 30km/h speed limit everywhere unless you’re driving a bus, except schools and hospitals which will be 5 km/h. OMFG, Are hospitals causing car accidents? Lime Scooters will be banned.



There will be a train to the greenhouse gas producing airport after the CRL is finished, then a train over the harbour bridge. A TRAIN OVER THE HARBOUR BRIDGE!



She also wants to protect Auckland’s environment by leaving Chamberlain Park as it currently is. Golf courses aren’t actually good for the environment so I wonder if she literally means leaving it as it currently is and removing golfers.



No concrete, sediment or untreated sewage in the ocean. Banning all plastic bags and drink bottles with zero waste to landfill. She also wants to plant native trees everywhere (on Chamberlain Park or not?), return Ihumatao to Maori guardianship (destroying the entire Treaty settlement process), stop all cruelty to sentient beings (need a lot more detail on what that could mean) and provide homes for all homeless people. Apparently, this is a “more humane, feminist attitude.” 



I initially felt a little bad about saying Genevieve Ford looks like a nosey neighbour sticking her head over the fence. Not any more.



[ **Phil Goff**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=761e0967-f8a3-4172-a310-3ea0ff04a863&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– Independent **$$**



Len Brown with his pants on isn’t the worst Mayor Auckland has had. That was Len Brown. Rates increases have been capped at 2.5% as Goff promised in 2016 but he has no intention of doing that if re-elected. He claims to have saved hundreds of millions of dollars through improved efficiency in the Council. “Hundreds of millions” is one of those phrases people use when they actually have no idea what the figure is.



Kinda like this excerpt from his [website](https://www.philgoff.org.nz/about) where I have no idea what he is saying 



“In 2016, we set out to plan to million years to make our city greener and combat the effects of climate change. This year, we will supersede that number.”



His other policies are a review of the performance of CCOs. AT is barely accountable and it was Phil Goff who removed councillors from the board of AT. He wants to plant 1.5 million trees over the next three years. He will reduce the cost of public transport for children, costing $4.1m a year. From 2020 the Council will only purchase electric or hybrid cars. All cleaners contracted to Auckland Council will be paid the Living Wage of $21.15 and work to end homelessness by identifying every homeless person by name and target services to those individuals.



This isn’t ground-breaking or revolutionary stuff. This isn’t visionary blue sky thinking. It’s minor window dressing.



On September 9, a [complaint related to Phil Goff’s 2016 electoral return was lodged with the Chief Electoral Officer. ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/115795846/auckland-mayoral-election-complaint-lodged-over-phil-goffs-2016-election-expenses)John Tamihere says it hasn’t come from his campaign “We know nothing and you have a cheek to cast aspersions, but not surprising.”



I was unlikely to support Goff but after looking at his website, I can’t understand why anybody else would either.

John has taught English in Universities for 10 years, which is quite surprising. He has been a representative for global companies and has extensive experience in government sectors in Auckland.



He knows what Aucklanders need and want. He’s not telling us though. His [website](https://www.johnhong4mayor.com/) does a good job of giving the impression that I got from his corflute signs. He looks like a politician standing for election in a democratic but highly authoritarian country like Singapore.

Ted kinda reminds me of a brash, hard-arsed Republican politician. That image is hurt a bit by his A3 hand painted, recycled signs. [You can see him](https://www.facebook.com/tedformayor.johnston.3) hammering these into the ground with a giant hammer, wearing a vest. It’s a pretty cool look.



He’s a 58 year old criminal lawyer from Otara, who stood for TOP in 2017. He wants to ban bikes from the city to reduce congestion, a rapid frequent rail system that takes people where they want to go and set up giant warehouses for homeless people in South Auckland so they would have somewhere to eat, shower and sleep.

In what threatened to be a two-horse race, Craig Lord has worked very hard to set himself up as the underdog third candidate. His campaign platform began as being proudly policy free, though he seems to have moved away from that as the election moved into voting mode. He is running a very professional campaign and invested in an [attractive website.](https://www.craiglord.nz/)

He wants council to forget about the niceties and focus on the necessities. Instead of increasing rates, get smarter about financial operations.

In 2010, [Snelgar changed his name by deed poll to John Banks](https://www.whaleoil.net.nz/tag/glen-snelgar/), intending to run for Mayor against John Banks and Len Brown.

[ **John Tamihere**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=68f84c52-138f-437e-95e1-56c3787c4bd3&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=)– JT for Mayor.co.nz **$$$$$**



Tamihere shoots from the lip and sometimes it gets him in trouble. Actually, it gets him in a lot of trouble, a lot. His sacking from cabinet by Helen Clark was the first time I’d heard of ‘front bum.’



John has accomplished a lot outside of politics, in his career as a barrister he argued cases in front of the Privy Council, eventually working for the Maori Land Court and the Department of Maori Affairs. In 1991 he became the Chief Executive of the Waipareira Trust, providing health and education services to Auckland Maori and he was elected back onto the board after leaving Parliament in 2005. He’s also been selected as Person of the Year by the Sunday Star Times, New Zealander of the Year by North & South and Man of the Year by Metro magazine.



JT is a divisive figure, with supporters as passionate as his opponents, due to his blunt and outspoken style. In Maori politics, Tamihere has been an advocate for urban Maori who often don’t have any links to tribal iwi, labelled by Tamihere as “feudal tribal structures” and dominated by elites. Tamihere says Maori need to “take responsibility for our own actions” rather than “blame others for our failure.” It would be easier to write a list of the people Tamihere hasn’t offended. I’d be on it.



Tamihere has injected excitement into 2019’s Mayoral election with his candidacy which it bloody needed. Previous challengers to the incumbent have been John Palino, Vic Crone and Mark Thomas, none of whom have brought the energy to the race JT has.



He might have been a Labour party man for many years and if it were the 1980s that would make sense but in 2019 the Labour brand has nothing in common with John.



Tamihere has unveiled some really bold and innovative ideas which have been measured, costed and are workable. Freezing taxes might make the existing Mayor and Councillors baulk, but it can be done if you’re not a flimsy ‘efficiency finding’ seat warmer. I ran on a rates cutting platform in 2013 and 2016 before withdrawing due to the overcrowding of candidates on the right. The sums added up then and John Tamihere has done that this time.



Plans to sell 49% of Watercare and Ports of Auckland while retaining ownership of the land the ports sit on will also generate extra funds for Council instead of repeatedly screwing the Auckland ratepayer. [Ports of Auckland paid $60m for 3 new cranes ](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/auckland-ratepayers-to-miss-out-on-at-least-100-million-after-much-touted-ports-of-auckland-cranes-go-unused.html)it hasn’t been able to use yet, resulting in the dividend paid to Auckland Council dropping by $100m. 



The proposal to turn the Harbour bridge into an 18 lane double decker with bus and rail added has been sneered at by biased reporters on the Herald (looking at you Simon Wilson) and criticised by Goff as unaffordable with a $10 billion price tag. Sources within the Tamihere camp ridicule that figure which has been costed by professional transport engineers as closer to $2b. Removing public transport from private transport on different levels will also remove additional pinch points on the motorway leading to the bridge.



Additionally JT has a plan to pay for the additional roading infrastructure using congestion charges and electronic road pricing. That’s the fair way to pay for roads instead of the regressive regional fuel tax, another soon to be casualty if John wins.



The tram from nowhere which hasn’t got anywhere but would ruin Dominion Rd will be scrapped under a Tamihere mayoralty. If you visit the Mt. Roskill shops on the intersection of Mt Albert and Dominion Rd, the tram has already destroyed local business areas and construction is still yet to start.



John Tamihere is a maverick and a straight shooter. He isn’t going to play backroom politics or follow in the footsteps of earlier dullards. Shake it Up and Sort it Out is his campaign slogan and I’m confident that is exactly what he will do.



[ **Peter Vaughan**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=d4ebb7d3-127f-4b5c-a307-8bcc68e67716&srchtype=Mayor&areavalue=) ****



I’d heard Vaughan was a numerologist, which is a bit strange though up until writing this article I figured he was sane.

He won an egg and spoon race but he isn’t going to win the Mayoralty. He wants to stop Round Up, 1080 and 5G.



5G is like 4G but better. 4G was an improvement on 3G. Before 3G was the equally terrifying but absolutely safe 2G. All that stays the same is the crowds of loopies who think it causes brain cancer. They survive because they lack the one thing brain cancer needs.



His first priority as Mayor will be to get all Councillors and senior executives to introduce themselves to one another if they don’t all die from 5G first.

Over the years, I’ve shared some outrageous examples of overpaid bureaucrats. 



Hopefully we’re all disgusted when insiders rig the system to rip off taxpayers. And I suspect you’re not surprised to see that the worst example on that list comes from California, which is in a race with Illinois to see which state can become the Greece of America.   
  
  
Well, the Golden State has a new über‐​bureaucrat. Here are some of the jaw‐​dropping details from a Bloomberg report. 



The numbers are even larger in California, where a state psychiatrist was paid $822,000, a highway patrol officer collected $484,000 in pay and pension benefits and 17 employees got checks of more than $200,000 for unused vacation and leave. The best‐​paid staff in other states earned far less for the same work, according to the data.



Wow, $822,000 for a state psychiatrist. Not bad for government work. So what is Governor Jerry Brown doing to fix the mess? As you might expect, he’s part of the problem. 



…the state’s highest‐​paid employees make far more than comparable workers elsewhere in almost all job and wage categories, from public safety to health care, base pay to overtime. …California has set a pattern of lax management, inefficient operations and out‐​of‐​control costs. …In California, Governor Jerry Brown hasn’t curbed overtime expenses that lead the 12 largest states or limited payments for accumulated vacation time that allowed one employee to collect $609,000 at retirement in 2011. …Last year, Brown waived a cap on accrued leave for prison guards while granting them additional paid days off. California’s liability for the unused leave of its state workers has more than doubled in eight years, to $3.9 billion in 2011, from $1.4 billion in 2003, according to the state’s annual financial reports. …The per‐​worker costs of delivering services in California vastly exceed those even in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio.





Actually, it’s not just that he’s part of the problem. He’s making things worse, having seduced voters into approving a ballot measure to dramatically increase the tax burden on the upper‐​income taxpayers.   
  
  
I suppose the silver lining to that dark cloud is that many bureaucrats now rank as part of the top 1 percent, so they’ll have to recycle some of their loot back to the political vultures in Sacramento.   
  
  
But the biggest impact of the tax hike—as shown in the Ramirez cartoon—will be to accelerate the shift of entrepreneurs, investors, and small business owners to states that don’t steal as much. Indeed, a study from the Manhattan Institute looks at the exodus to lower‐​tax states. 



The data also reveal the motives that drive individuals and businesses to leave California. One of these, of course, is work. …Taxation also appears to be a factor, especially as it contributes to the business climate and, in turn, jobs. Most of the destination states favored by Californians have lower taxes. States that have gained the most at California’s expense are rated as having better business climates. The data suggest that many cost drivers—taxes, regulations, the high price of housing and commercial real estate, costly electricity, union power, and high labor costs—are prompting businesses to locate outside California, thus helping to drive the exodus.



Yet another example of why tax competition is such an important force for economic liberalization. It punishes governments that are too greedy and gives taxpayers a chance to protect their property from the looter class.

South Korean President Park Geun‐​hye delayed her trip to the U.S. because of a public health emergency at home. That led to much chatter over whether the postponement was necessary and would harm the bilateral relationship.



Woo Jung‐​Yeop of the Asan Institute argued that “the focus of Park’s U.S. visit should be on what to discuss, not on when to reschedule.” After all, there was no obvious purpose in the trip: North Korea is a chronic problem but hasn’t done anything particularly provocative recently. The low‐​key summit plans, coming so soon after the high‐​profile visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left many South Koreans suffering from an inferiority complex.



However, the delay won’t make a future Park trip any more useful. There is much on which the two nations should cooperate, since the Republic of Korea has graduated from Third to First World status and sports one of the world’s largest and most advanced economies. But the military alliance is outdated. Despite having surged past the North, enjoying a 40‐​to‐​1 economic advantage and 2‐​to‐​1 population edge, Seoul continues to play the helpless dependent, unable even to command its own forces in a war.



The military relationship was forged in a different time. The U.S. and Soviet Union divided the Korean Peninsula after Japan’s surrender in 1945. There weren’t many alternatives. Continued Japanese rule would have enraged all Koreans and united Soviet rule would have enslaved all Koreans.



But the division resulted in two hostile Korean states. A three‐​year quasi‐​civil war erupted 65 years ago, in which the U.S. and West fought against China and the Soviet Union through their respective Koreas. After mass destruction, highlighted by millions of casualties and refugees, the conflict ended roughly where it started. With the ROK a wreck and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea backed by neighboring China and Soviet Union, only Washington’s security guarantee kept the South independent, if not exactly free.





What other nation with serious international ambitions subcontracts not only its defense, but control of its own forces, to another government?



That eventually changed. In the 1960s President Park Chung‐​hee, the present president’s father, suppressed all political opposition but reformed the economy, leading to the ROK’s dramatic growth. Democracy waited another quarter century, until the growing middle class tired of military rule.



Yet through it all South Korea’s defense dependency on America persisted. Seoul surpassed the DPRK in economic strength and achieved political stability. The Soviet Union disappeared and China joined the international community, with both Beijing and Moscow recognizing the South. South Korean businesses spanned the globe and Seoul began having military ambitions beyond the peninsula. No matter. The ROK insisted that abundant American forces must remain, backed by additional units aground in Okinawa and afloat and aflight in the Pacific.



The South Korean government hasn’t even been willing to take over operational control, or OPCON, of its own forces in wartime. It isn’t ready, it insists. Why not, one wonders? _North Korea_ commands its forces. One can’t imagine Kim Il‐​sung leaving the keys to his tanks with Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong after the Korean War concluded. What other nation with serious international ambitions subcontracts not only its defense, but control of its own forces, to another government? _For decades_.



Of course, some South Koreans admit that they most fear shifting command would encourage Washington to withdraw its troops. Thus, their objective is to appear as helpless as possible as long as possible to retain the U.S. troop tripwire. “Please, we just can’t do it without you,” Seoul tells Washington. It’s an embarrassing ploy by a country whose people want to be taken seriously abroad.



The present arrangement obviously is bad for America, other than for U.S. officials who enjoy running the world, or at least who think that they run it. The “mutual defense treaty” requires Americans to defend the ROK. In return, the South agrees to be defended. That’s the way it always has been, and nothing much has changed recently despite all of the talk of refashioning the alliance.



Protecting South Korea isn’t cheap. Promising to go to war means America might have to go to war. That’s a risk which should not be taken lightly. Being ready to go to war requires force structure. The more potential wars, the bigger the military needed. That the ROK helps pay for occupation costs ignores the more basic expense, the cost of raising, equipping, and maintaining the units themselves.



Nevertheless, Washington considered the ROK’s survival as compensation enough, at least in the early years, when the U.S. was prepared to defend South Korea as part of the larger Cold War struggle. But today the peninsula is militarily inconsequential. A North Korean victory would be just that, a North Korean victory, not the first leg of an exorable march toward global Communist domination. There would be no threat to America.



No question, of course, it would be an awful outcome. But that doesn’t mean it warrants a permanent “alliance” entangling the U.S. in one of the most heavily militarized and unstable regions on earth. Anyway, the North would win a conventional contest only if Seoul allowed the former to do so, by failing to build the defense which it is well‐​capable of deploying. The South is only _acting_ helpless.



Leon Whyte of the _Fletcher Security Review_ calls for expanding the alliance “beyond old parameters,” but there are no alternative purposes for the military alliance (in contrast to reasons for friends to cooperate). Some American policymakers imagine the ROK as part of an iron ring containing the People’s Republic of China, but few South Koreans want to make a permanent enemy of their big neighbor with a very long memory. It’s one thing to be defended by America in the extremely unlikely event that the PRC attacked the South. But to join the U.S. in a war against China over, say, Taiwan’s quest for independence or Tokyo’s control of the Senkaku Islands? Washington can dream on. The South Koreans ain’t that crazy!



The Pentagon imagines other military scenarios in East Asia—say a squabble in Southeast Asia—but they almost certainly wouldn’t justify American intervention. And even if they did, Seoul wouldn’t likely join in unless it was in the ROK’s interest to do so, in which case a formal treaty would be unnecessary. (The first President Park sent soldiers to Vietnam in order to convince Washington to keep U.S. personnel in the South.) A temporary coalition of the willing makes more sense than permanently defending another country in the hope that it might help out somewhere sometime. Seoul did kick in some support for America’s misadventures in Afghanistan and Iraq, but again, if the price was a permanent garrison on the peninsula, the cost was far too high.



Nor does Washington get much else out of the relationship. South Koreans have never purchased U.S. products as a reward for America’s defense guarantee. Nor has the Blue House ever pliantly taken orders from Washington. Seoul rolls out the red carpet when an American president visits, but acts in its own interest nonetheless. Army Lt. Col. James Minnich proposed that a “comprehensive, strategic alliance” cover climate change, human trafficking, and peacekeeping, but none of these have anything to do with a bilateral military pact.



Doug Bandow‐​John Bolton debate on Fox



The most important downside for the U.S. today is that defending the South puts America in the middle of a contest between North and South Koreas, Japan, China, and Russia. All have more at stake than the U.S. Washington is constantly badgering the PRC to do America’s bidding against Pyongyang. And North Korea is constantly threatening the U.S. only because the latter’s forces “are there,” in the South, threatening the DPRK. Pyongyang might not like Washington, but it wouldn’t care about America if U.S. troops weren’t on its border. The North likely would spend its time issuing threats against its neighbors instead. As it is, the Korean peninsula is one of the most important flashpoints which could drag America into a real war with potentially horrific casualties, even if the outcome was certain “victory.”



While it might have been inevitable that North Korea would have sought nuclear weapons, America’s involvement likely made it inevitable. As Henry Kissinger once said, even paranoids have enemies, and only nukes offer a certain deterrent to the North, which today would fight alone against the U.S. in a region filled with U.S. allies. Worse, Washington has proved its willingness to dismember (Serbia), undermine (Syria), and impose regime change (Afghanistan, Grenada, Haiti, Iraq, Panama), even after making a deal with a government (Libya). The fact that the Kim dynasty is evil does not mean that it has no legitimate security fears which might be assuaged by possession of a nuclear arsenal. Only by markedly reducing the threat perceived by the DPRK is Washington likely to have meaningful negotiations over nuclear weapons, like those going on with Iran, once viewed as a fellow pariah state.



Although the benefits of being defended are obvious, the ROK loses in several ways. The first is diminished self‐​respect. Real countries should defend themselves, not be dependent on other states. Persistent squabbles over the status of forces agreement highlight the tension of being a sovereign state and hosting foreign troops. South Koreans rankle over showing American personnel special consideration, but the U.S. can’t station forces in another nation without ensuring minimal legal protections.



Second, the South’s defense is in part out of its own hands. After the sinking of the Cheonan and shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, the U.S. urged restraint at almost any price. As Washington had the right to do, since it could be drawn into a war if Seoul retaliated and conflict erupted. Contracting out one’s defense to others necessarily yields control over major defense decisions.



Third, the ROK’s diplomatic strategy toward the North suffers. If Washington chooses the opposite approach, the result will be conflict and confusion. Moreover, the U.S. can use its dominant position to pressure South Korea to adopt America’s stance. Differences between George W. Bush and Kim Dae‐​jung were sharp, for instance. To the extent that Pyongyang views the South as merely a puppet regime the former will pay more attention to America’s tactics.



Fourth, secure in the U.S. defense guarantee Seoul has felt little pressure to seek a modus vivendi with Japan. The two prosperous democratic states should cooperate in defending themselves and promoting regional security, but have refused to leave history behind them. Both nations’ leaders made conciliatory remarks last Monday on the 50th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, but nothing substantive has changed. Both share the blame but face the same perverse incentives.



Fifth, relying on the U.S. encourages South Korea to accept permanent dependency. No special geographical feature of the peninsula keeps the country to the south militarily inferior. But Seoul has less incentive to invest in the military. If the South won’t defend against the North, which really does pose a threat, Washington can’t seriously expect the ROK to join America in containing China.



Doug Bandow‐​Michael Malice Forum



Finally, Seoul cannot consider building a countervailing nuclear weapon if necessary. Nonproliferation in Northeast Asia is a bit like gun control: only the potentially hostile powers, in this case China, North Korea, and Russia, have nukes. There’s no good reason for the U.S. to risk its security by putting the American homeland at potential risk to guarantee South Korea’s security against a nuclear‐​armed North. Perhaps the ROK should do the job itself. Especially since a realistic Seoul recognizes that the U.S. might not follow through on its promises if the North is able to retaliate against America.



Moreover, the mere possibility of the South going nuclear, likely followed by Japan, would encourage Beijing to redouble its efforts to achieve a nuclear free peninsula. This threat likely would be far more effective than the allies’ oft‐​repeated determination to apply more pressure on Pyongyang to return to the Six Party Talks, which the North abandoned more than six years ago.



South Koreans pay a high price for the convenience of an American security guarantee. While they have achieved much, they are stuck on the U.S. defense dole, as dependent as any domestic welfare recipient. When the two presidents next meet, they should discuss how to transform the U.S.-South Korea relationship into one of equals, in which the ROK gives as much as it gets.



With Seoul locked into its role as military dependent, America should stop playing the indulgent parent and push the adult child out into the real world. Better, Seoul should take the initiative and end its unnatural reliance on the U.S. Nearly seventy years of defense welfare is enough. It’s time for the ROK to grow up and take its place on the world stage.

"**Debenhams stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain.**
It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the chain's 124 shops cease trading.

However, the administrators said the outlook for a restructured operation was ""highly uncertain"" and they had therefore ""regretfully concluded"" that they should start winding up Debenhams UK, while continuing to seek offers for all or parts of the business.
There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams.
However, senior sources at Arcadia dismissed any link and told the BBC it was being blamed for the collapse of a deal that had never been agreed.
The 12,000 jobs at Debenhams are set to go over the coming months unless the administrators do a deal for all or parts of the business.
Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock.
Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them.
Geoff Rowley of FRP Advisory, joint administrator to Debenhams and Partner at FRP, said: ""All reasonable steps were taken to complete a transaction that would secure the future of Debenhams.
""However, the economic landscape is extremely challenging and, coupled with the uncertainty facing the UK retail industry, a viable deal could not be reached.""
With Debenhams to be wound down and Arcadia in administration, this is one of the blackest weeks for the British High Street and one that will have councils around the country pondering the future of their town centres.
Debenhams, which started as a single shop in central London in 1778, has withstood recessions, depression and world wars, but has succumbed finally to the twin threats of the internet and pandemic shutdowns.
It has been struggling financially since before the financial crisis, but successive restructurings have failed to find a winning formula.
In many town centres, Debenhams was one of the few sizeable anchor tenants left after the recent demise of BHS and others.
And this may not be the end of the bad news. If Arcadia were to go the way of Debenhams, it would mean another 13,000 jobs lost.
Shoppers are still able to buy items in stores and on the Debenhams website, until all the stock is sold.
Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during Black Friday, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them.
The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid.
However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund.
A supervisor who has worked at the Debenhams Bullring Birmingham store for five years said she had found out the news on a group call.
""The call was really sad. It genuinely felt like they had tried so hard and they had now lost the fight.
""Unfortunately the business is just outnumbered and the pandemic is something they, like all of us, could never have predicted,"" she told the BBC.
Retail trade union Usdaw said it was seeking urgent meetings with Debenhams' administrators and urged them to ""treat staff with fairness and dignity"".
Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said the company and its administrators had refused to engage with the union and accused them of treating staff ""appallingly"".
He added that the government needed ""a recovery plan to get the industry back on its feet"".
Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for its employees.
He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases.
Shoppers in Leeds raised concerns about what Debenhams stores closure would mean for the High Street.
""We won't have any shopping centres left, we'll have no town centres left if everyone shops online,"" said one shopper.
""It's been a long time coming, really,"" said another. ""It's been a long slow decline for Debenhams - it's not really changed with the times.""
In Edinburgh, one shopper said it was ""a shame"", adding: ""People are losing their jobs, It's a shop that's been there since I was born. All the girls bought their prom dresses there.""
Long-serving members of staff, or past workers, who were members of the company's two defined benefit pension schemes have been at risk for months of getting smaller pension payouts.
The two schemes - the Debenhams Retirement Scheme and the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan - have been assessed by the official rescue scheme called the Pension Protection Fund since April last year, affecting an estimated 11,000 members.
Those yet to retire, or who have retired early, could receive at least 10% less than they would have expected from their pension. If the schemes are found to be in a relatively strong financial position, they may not lose as much.
Others who have already reached pension age (thought to be about half of members) may see a smaller inflation-linked increase each year than they were promised.
More recent members of staff have a different type of pension, which they keep as a pension pot for retirement.

It’s easy to dislike Greta Thunberg, a scowling _enfant terrible_ with, as my Mum used to say, “a face like a smacked bum”. But that may be too hasty a judgement. As more details emerge of Thunberg’s self-confessed cognitive disabilities, one is more inclined to pity. Thunberg, if all that she says about herself is true, quite literally believes the false tales of climate apocalypse she has been fed.



The anger is better directed at the adults who have deliberately scared the living daylights out of Greta and her army of literal-minded child soldiers. These gullible children are being terrified into a mental health crisis by unscrupulous adults.



It is nothing short of a disgrace that young people are being used in this way.



A youth mental health organisation has found four in five Australian students are “somewhat” or “very” anxious about climate change. And half of them report being so on a weekly basis.



There is no other way of putting it — school students and university students are being brainwashed…



But the real test of these students’ beliefs is just how far they are willing to go live up to them. It’s easy to do the soft stuff – wagging a day off school and hanging out with your friends, collecting social media backpats and taking selfies – but if they **really** believed their own bs, there’s nothing they wouldn’t do to avoid the catastrophe they say they believe is bearing down on the world.



The bulk of the electricity we use for now and well into the future will be provided by coal-fired power.



So, if you are going to turn yourself inside out about coal-fired power, turn off your iPad, your phone and your laptop, instead of charging them with life-threatening coal-fired power.



Turn off the washing machine. Hand-wash your clothes.



Transportation generates about a third of global carbon dioxide emissions. Walking or cycling everywhere, including to and from school every day, as well as refusing to ever, ever take an overseas flight, would be one of the most effective personal actions these kids could take. Yet, less than 13% of students walk to school. As for long-haul flights:



Youth travel has become one of the fastest growing segments of international tourism, representing more than 23% of the over one billion tourists travelling internationally each year.



  
Meanwhile, the kiddies’ hysterical alarmism is badly distorting public policy and wasting trillions of dollars on useless green vanities.



[Bjorn Lomborg] “This year the world will spend $230 billion subsidising renewable energy … the Paris Agreement on climate change will cost the world from $US1 trillion to $US2 trillion a year by 2030.



“Astonishingly, neither of these hugely expensive policies will have any measurable impact on temperatures […]Doom and gloom distort our world view and can lead to bad policy. The future is bright and we need smart decisions to keep it so.”



So, climate strikers, instead of posing for happy snaps with buddies (and the sea of smiling faces posing for selfies at the climate strikes lead me to regard claims about “climate anxiety” with deep scepticism: these kids are clearly having the time of their lives), challenge your teachers and your “woke” elders to swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Assuming that they even can.



It’s time we had a royal commission into what’s happening to our young people on this climate change issue. Let the apologists and the hoax brigade swear on oath the veracity of what they are preaching in the classroom.



It might be the only way to slow a few people down.



Our children are entitled to the truth and they are not getting it.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **  
Rodney Local Board (Warkworth Subdivision)**



As of October 3, voter turnout is 23% down on 2016 which is an improvement on October 2. The Warkworth subdivision of Rodney Local Board is a bit more enthusiastic about doing their civic duty – just 3.7% behind the previous election. There are three seats in this subdivision, Local Board Chair Beth Houlbrooke the sole incumbent.



It seems an age ago but at the beginning of this election I wrote a [sneak peek](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/hold-the-press-a-sneak-peek/) of what was to come.



[ **Steven Garner – Rodney Now**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=0c044e11-ece0-4b52-9f54-cc40d2145920&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) ****



Garner’s affiliation has been difficult to nail down. The 2016 Independent candidate was on a Community Independents ticket on August 27 with Tim Holdgate though they were both Independent on [September 2](https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/34718-local-election-campaigning-underway.html). Campaign literature circulated without an authorisation statement is headed “independent looking out for you and Rodney Now.” He had no affiliation in the [Northern Action Group’s ](http://www.nag.org.nz/Voting%20advice%20for%20NAG%20Supporters-1.pdf)voting guide. [Snell’s Beach Residents and Ratepayers](https://snellsbeach.co.nz/RLBelection/) coverage of their candidate debate is pictorial only. There’s been no public break up between the two ‘Community Independents’ and googling ‘Rodney Now’ brought up [this article](https://m.localmatters.co.nz/news/35222-rodney-first-versus-independents-at-candidates-meets.html) in which Garner was referred to as an independent and he claims to be opposed to tickets in local government. Maybe there was a private break up?  




Garner has been an elected member previously. He served as Deputy Chair from 2010-16. Warren Flaunty was also on Rodney Local Board and notoriously several others at the same time in 2013. There were 40 meetings Flaunty couldn’t attend in their entirety. Garner was the ultimate part-time board member, with 47 meetings not seen through from start to finish.



There were many instances in which Garner’s attendance was a handicap rather than a help. Often his reports were unread and sealed in the courier packs or he would return from holiday and attempt to relitigate issues he couldn’t take part in as a result.



When it feels like the entire world is against you, sometimes you need to look at yourself to understand why. Garner isn’t that smart and has bought in to the idea that the Rodney First ticket is a conspiracy to squash himself and others in the area that oppose the current elected board members.



The [Rodney Community Voices](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2338166819738983/permalink/2338189306403401/) facebook group, set up by Glen Ashton about a month ago, appears to be in response to the idea that the local facebook groups (created by Phelan Pirrie years ago but now with multiple admins) are censorship or an attack on democracy. What this group implies, via unauthorised pictures posted on October 1, is that if there is no collusion by the independents, then Glen Ashton appears to have appointed himself manager of their ‘campaigns’.



It’s all a bit pathetic really.



[ **Tim Holdgate – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=db07dc9c-122c-4835-90f3-b7e309ae44f8&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) ****



Just finished wasting ten minutes of my life verifying Tim Holdgate hasn’t previously been elected to the Rodney Local Board. His candidate profile states 



“My Warkworth community involvement has included 10 years on the Mahurangi College Board of Trustees (4 years as Chairman), 7 years as trustee on the Harbour Sport Trust, member of the Mahurangi Collective for Sport & Recreation, together with various other sporting and cultural committees.



As a Rodney Local Board member demanding greater financial accountability and transparency from Auckland Council, specifically for Warkworth Subdivision ratepayers. We must get our fair rates share spent locally.” 



I wouldn’t want to cast aspertions, so clearly Holdgate doesn’t have an eye for detail and his grammar sucks.



Holdgate’s day job is in real estate and he is also a Registered Valuer. He has also spent 10 years on the Mahurangi College Board of Trustees, 7 years Harbour Sport Trust and a member of the Mahurangi Collective for Sport and Recreation. No flashy title accompanied that last grouping so I couldn’t possibly speculate what he achieved there.



His priorities if elected (snarky comments from me in brackets):



What an absolute knob.



[ **Beth Houlbrooke – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=17c9a4d5-7d1d-4ab3-b45b-448ca7a0b312&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$$$**



(disclaimer – yes, I know Beth. No, I didn’t spend several hours a day for more than a month writing a voting guide to an entire city election as part of some conspiracy to fix the Rodney Local Board election)



Beth Houlbrooke has been on the Rodney Local Board for two terms and Chair for the current term. Beth isn’t a familiar face around Rodney because she has lived there for 25 years. It is because she works incredibly hard and is present at just about every community event and meeting in one of the geographically biggest local boards in Auckland.



Following the endorsement of those who submitted to the public consultation on implementing a targeted rate to fund transport initiatives, the work of Rodney First and Councillor Sayers successfully advocated a multi-million dollar increase from Auckland Transport to deal with the poor condition of the roading network in Rodney. It won’t happen overnight but it will happen over the next few years (lightspeed in bureaucracies).



Before joining the local board, Beth was an award-winning business owner. Networking, building relationships and negotiating are key skills to be an award-winning business owner and those are skills she employs today. The relationships with various bureaucrats, politicians, officials take time to nurture and blossom into results for your constituents. Anyone who thinks a bullet-pointed list of demands is going to deliver for Rodney is already out of their league.



Should Beth be returned to the local board for a third term, her priority is expanding the public transport network delivered by Rodney Local Board’s target rate, completing the Warkworth Park & Ride (a result of AT increasing the sealing budget, coming from the transport targeted rate), making further improvements on town centres and several more projects that Beth won’t be able to complete without the Rodney First team being elected also.



[ **Paul Manton – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=01bce9f3-2544-43fc-944d-8f1120e198ee&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$$$**



Paul lives near Puhoi where he is co-chair of the Puhoi Community Forum and sits on the Mahurangi Sports Collective, which oversees activities on the Warkworth Showgrounds. Paul must see Tim Holdgate there all the time when he isn’t busy doing fundraising for local clubs or working on the Matakana Coast Trail Trust.



Paul moved to Puhoi 30 years ago, after doing an engineering apprenticeship and working for Shell Oil.[ The Rodney First website](http://www.rodneyfirst.org/) mentions the ticket’s goals in relation to community participation in parks and reserves. That includes a number of new walking trails and the maintenance of existing walking infrastructure. Paul Manton probably knows a thing or two about doing that. After many years working in organisations that form relationships with the local board, he is well equipped to take the step of joining the local board to help those organisations.



He sees his role on the board as being the focal point for parks and recreational organisations, ensuring the parks are properly maintained for use and the limited facilities are flexible in their utilisation.



[ **Ayla Walker – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e1baef4d-4af4-40ab-99e2-6cd5961f03eb&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$**



A resident of Ahuroa and proven election winner, having just been voted onto the Ahuroa School Board of Trustees. Walker is currently being mentored via One Warkworth Business Association having recently finished her business studies.



Mrs Walker is younger than most of those who are elected to and make a success of local boards. It is fortunate that if she is elected as part of a ticket, there will be plenty of support while she grapples with her role.



Ayla’s passion is the local environment and she wants to prioritise improving water quality and work with like-minded members of the community on recycling initiatives, and plant and animal pest control.



I saw the first mention of climate change in the Rodney contest in her list of priorities. 



She’s new.

"**Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said.**
The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines.
It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine.
The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content.
Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service.
But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"".
He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine.
He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions.
""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said.
Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online.
These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide.
Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram.
This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested.
Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine.
The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online.
Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines.
There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them.
Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England.
Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time.
""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated.
""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic.""
The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions.
Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"".
Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown.
A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported.
Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online.
Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily.
In 2019, the UK lost its measles-free status designated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children.
Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus.
In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue.
Last week, the government announced that social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news.
But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down.
""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said.
Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it.
On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid.
The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year.
The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people.
But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
The head of the MHRA said this week it will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"".
And this week, he said he had ""no inhibitions"" about getting one, adding: ""Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine.""
A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives.
""We take this issue extremely seriously and have secured a major commitment from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more swiftly.
""We continue to work closely with social media firms to promote authoritative sources of information so people have access to vaccine facts not fiction."""

From Stanford University encouraging news, a rechargeable Zinc-air battery would put electric cars into the realm of reasonable practicality, where with lead-acid batteries they are currently not.
Stanford scientists develop high-efficiency zinc-air battery
Stanford University scientists have developed an advanced zinc-air battery with higher catalytic activity and durability than similar batteries made with costly platinum and iridium catalysts. The results, published in the May 7 online edition of the journal Nature Communications, could lead to the development of a low-cost alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries widely used today.
This is a rechargeable zinc-oxide battery in a tri-electrode configuration with cobalt-oxide/carbon nanotube and iron-nickel/layered double hydroxide catalysts for charge and discharge, respectively. Credit: Yanguang Li, Stanford University
“There have been increasing demands for high-performance, inexpensive and safe batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and other energy storage applications,” said Hongjie Dai, a professor chemistry at Stanford and lead author of the study. “Metal-air batteries offer a possible low-cost solution.”

According to Dai, most attention has focused on lithium-ion batteries, despite their limited energy density (energy stored per unit volume), high cost and safety problems. “With ample supply of oxygen from the atmosphere, metal-air batteries have drastically higher theoretical energy density than either traditional aqueous batteries or lithium-ion batteries,” he said. “Among them, zinc-air is technically and economically the most viable option.”
Zinc-air batteries combine atmospheric oxygen and zinc metal in a liquid alkaline electrolyte to generate electricity with a byproduct of zinc oxide. When the process is reversed during recharging, oxygen and zinc metal are regenerated.
“Zinc-air batteries are attractive because of the abundance and low cost of zinc metal, as well as the non-flammable nature of aqueous electrolytes, which make the batteries inherently safe to operate,” Dai said. “Primary (non-rechargeable) zinc-air batteries have been commercialized for medical and telecommunication applications with limited power density. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop electrically rechargeable batteries, with the stumbling blocks being the lack of efficient and robust air catalysts, as well as the limited cycle life of the zinc electrodes.”
Active and durable electrocatalysts on the air electrode are required to catalyze the oxygen-reduction reaction during discharge and the oxygen-evolution reaction during recharge. In zinc-air batteries, both catalytic reactions are sluggish, Dai said.
Recently, his group has developed a number of high-performance electrocatalysts made with non-precious metal oxide or nanocrystals hybridized with carbon nanotubes. These catalysts produced higher catalytic activity and durability in alkaline electrolytes than catalysts made with platinum and other precious metals.
“We found that similar catalysts greatly boosted the performance of zinc-air batteries,” Dai said. both primary and rechargeable. “A combination of a cobalt-oxide hybrid air catalyst for oxygen reduction and a nickel-iron hydroxide hybrid air catalyst for oxygen evolution resulted in a record high-energy efficiency for a zinc-air battery, with a high specific energy density more than twice that of lithium-ion technology.”
The novel battery also demonstrated good reversibility and stability over long charge and discharge cycles over several weeks. “This work could be an important step toward developing practical rechargeable zinc-air batteries, even though other challenges relating to the zinc electrode and electrolyte remain to be solved,” Dai added.

Thirteen Years of Greening from SeaWiFS – image from NASA Earth Observatory

Elevated carbon dioxide making arid regions greener
31 May 2013
AGU Release No. 13-24
WASHINGTON, DC—Scientists have long suspected that a flourishing of green foliage around the globe, observed since the early 1980s in satellite data, springs at least in part from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. Now, a study of arid regions around the globe finds that a carbon dioxide “fertilization effect” has, indeed, caused a gradual greening from 1982 to 2010.
Focusing on the southwestern corner of North America, Australia’s outback, the Middle East, and some parts of Africa, Randall Donohue of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia and his colleagues developed and applied a mathematical model to predict the extent of the carbon-dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect. They then tested this prediction by studying satellite imagery and teasing out the influence of carbon dioxide on greening from other factors such as precipitation, air temperature, the amount of light, and land-use changes.

The team’s model predicted that foliage would increase by some 5 to 10 percent given the 14 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the study period. The satellite data agreed, showing an 11 percent increase in foliage after adjusting the data for precipitation, yielding “strong support for our hypothesis,” the team reports.
“Lots of papers have shown an average increase in vegetation across the globe, and there is a lot of speculation about what’s causing that,” said Donohue of CSIRO’s Land and Water research division, who is lead author of the new study. “Up until this point, they’ve linked the greening to fairly obvious climatic variables, such as a rise in temperature where it is normally cold or a rise in rainfall where it is normally dry. Lots of those papers speculated about the CO2 effect, but it has been very difficult to prove.”
He and his colleagues present their findings in an article that has been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.
The team looked for signs of CO2 fertilization in arid areas, Donohue said, because “satellites are very good at detecting changes in total leaf cover, and it is in warm, dry environments that the CO2 effect is expected to most influence leaf cover.” Leaf cover is the clue, he added, because “a leaf can extract more carbon from the air during photosynthesis, or lose less water to the air during photosynthesis, or both, due to elevated CO2.” That is the CO2 fertilization effect.
But leaf cover in warm, wet places like tropical rainforests is already about as extensive as it can get and is unlikely to increase with higher CO2 concentrations. In warm, dry places, on the other hand, leaf cover is less complete, so plants there will make more leaves if they have enough water to do so. “If elevated CO2 causes the water use of individual leaves to drop, plants will respond by increasing their total numbers of leaves, and this should be measurable from satellite,” Donohue explained.
To tease out the actual CO2 fertilization effect from other environmental factors in these regions, the researchers first averaged the greenness of each location across 3-year periods to account for changes in soil wetness and then grouped that greenness data from the different locations according to their amounts of precipitation. The team then identified the maximum amount of foliage each group could attain for a given precipitation, and tracked variations in maximum foliage over the course of 20 years. This allowed the scientists to remove the influence of precipitation and other climatic variations and recognize the long-term greening trend.
In addition to greening dry regions, the CO2 fertilization effect could switch the types of vegetation that dominate in those regions. “Trees are re-invading grass lands, and this could quite possibly be related to the CO2 effect,” Donohue said. “Long lived woody plants are deep rooted and are likely to benefit more than grasses from an increase in CO2.”
“The effect of higher carbon dioxide levels on plant function is an important process that needs greater consideration,” said Donohue. “Even if nothing else in the climate changes as global CO2 levels rise, we will still see significant environmental changes because of the CO2 fertilization effect.”

"NICOSIA, Cyprus  —   As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the “best and last chance” to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russia’s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted   Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the   south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiy’s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the   president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the   conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear   agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. The president said he accepted the ambassador’s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the   rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, “I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for. ” Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were “halfway” to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as “guarantors” of the island’s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the   nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported   forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russia’s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a   researcher who has long bucked   sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriots’ view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. “What they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,” said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, “The Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,” that demolished what he called a   “myth” that the West is to blame for Turkey’s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russia’s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as “politically unacceptable,” portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among   while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member. To Moscow’s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russia’s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as “the darling” of   forces “because he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult. ” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was “surprised by the   comments in the Cyprus media” and accused the media of creating “a smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement. ” Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassador’s apparent support for   rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. “Every time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,” Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russia’s   energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the   Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential   communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a   Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed   fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russia’s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called “preposterous” reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. “Evidently,   hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis) information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,” Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. “The fundamental mistrust” between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. “In Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,” he said. “You fight perceptions and ghosts. ” All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. “In this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,” Mr. Tzimitras said. “They don’t want it disrupted. ” Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus “forever. ” Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of   northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, “the solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankara’s will. ” The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle  —   demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a   policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. “His rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,” Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands “the games superpowers play. ” “We want the support of everyone who can give support,” he added. “It is a matter of survival. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNever has such a lousy product been given so many free passes: wind turbines. Yes, they are lousy products – sorry!
In a free market, where poorly performing products get knocked out rapidly, wind turbines still can’t hold a candle to regular power plants. They only survive because of subsidies, and exorbitantly rosy promises.

Burning wind turbine
Germany’s online engineering magazine Ingenieur.de here writes a short, but damning piece on wind turbine performance and reliability. Hat tip: Wolfgang Neumann at FaceBook. Ingenieur.de writes:
Lightening strikes, damage to power cable insulation, overheated gear-drives: Every month on average 10 wind turbines are destroyed by fire the British elite university Imperial College has found out in a study.” […]
Scientist Guillermo Rein of the Imperial College emphasizes that the risk of fire has been played down many times. Worldwide on average only 1 wind turbine fire per month is made public. However, in fact the real figure is ten wind turbine fires on average according to investigations by the university.”
No matter how you calculate it, wind energy is terrible. Even the most amateur of engineers are able to appreciate the ultra harsh conditions that wind turbines must inherently withstand just due to their design and siting. The power generation unit is far above ground level and gets subjected to forces and conditions that way beyond anything conventional power plants situated in buildings at ground level are exposed to.
Then there’s the trend to put them offshore where conditions are even far more violent and menacing. Only one conclusion can be drawn on the wind turbine concept: the contraptions are impractical. It’s tantamount to using 500 laborers to do the job of a single Caterpillar excavator.

It boils down to the simple economic logic: Wouldn’t it just make much more sense to replace all these little bicycle generators, which are propped up on sticks hundreds of feet above ground way out in the hicks, with a single big one that’s at ground level (where fires at least can be fought), is easy to maintain, and can run continuously?
Ingenier.de writes that the fires often result in “total damage” to the wind turbine and that especially offshore turbine fires “lead to considerable damage to investors”.
Gradually the public is getting the picture that this wind energy idea is turning into a megaflop, one that reminds us of early airplane designs with flapping wings. Wind turbine producers sure have taken governments and consumers to the cleaners – to the tune of hundreds of billions. The public was sucked into buying a real lemon.
As a solution to the burning problem, experts are calling for “improved materials”.
Firemen unable to even get near the fire
When a fire does break out, Ingenieur.de reports that firemen can’t even get close to the fire because the turbines are so high above ground. And even if they could there’s an acute danger from falling parts and rotors, and so they refuse to get anywhere near the damn thing! All they can do is watch the contraption burn down.
Overall Guillermo Rein, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, calls the results of the study “serious”.
Sounds like a nail in the coffin of a dumb idea that needs to be buried sooner than later.
Oh, there’s more. Rein will soon be publishing the results of a risk study that looks at solar energy. Get the popcorn ready.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski writes here about the grave error committed by the British Royal Society’s in its false claim that the Rhachistia aldabrae snail had gone extinct and that it had been due to global warming. Full story here in English.
Hat-tip: Reader DirkH.
Bojanowski calls the news of the extinction being false “good news”, but says that it has become “a problem for British Royal Society” and that the re-appearance of the alleged climate change victim has put the Royal Society “in difficulty“.
The story, first reported by the Times, is now catching some of the attention of the German mainstream media, which have been reluctant to report the good news. Bojanowski describes how scientists declared the snail extinct and how subsequent rebuttals were rejected.
Eventually a red-faced Royal Society admitted that the reviewers of the rebuttal were the very same who reviewed the 2007 paper which had declared extinction.
IPCC credibility questioned more than ever
Not only the Royal Society has been embarrassed by the snail’s re-appearance, Bojanowski also writes that “the case is also inconvenient for the UN IPCC“, which claimed global warming was threatening to make a number of species extinct and that the snail’s alleged disappearance was a sign of this happening.

On the IPCC Bojanowski writes:
Now credibility is in question more than ever”.
At the end Bojanowski tells readers, however, that the snail’s re-appearance is no reason to call off the alarm:
The number of snails at the Seychelles coral atoll has shrunk considerably since the 1970s. Reason unclear.”
The science is as murky as ever. But one thing is clear: some scientists were in quite a rush to declare it dead and to use it as a poster-child for global warming.
Backfired!

"**A man who pulled plastic sheets off clothes in a supermarket during Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown has been told to compensate Tesco over his protest.**
Gwilym Owen was filmed pulling off the sheeting in Bangor on the first day of Wales' 17-day autumn lockdown.
Supermarkets had been told they were not allowed to sell ""non-essential"" items during the firebreak period.
Owen, of Holyhead Road in Gaerwen, Anglesey, pleaded guilty to damaging the sheeting and disorderly behaviour.
He was sentenced at at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court to 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Â£200 to Tesco in compensation and Â£180 in costs.
Footage of Owen damaging the sheeting went viral after he uploaded it to Facebook.
Gilly Harradence, defending, told the court Owen had not entered the store with the intention of causing trouble.
""He just wanted to highlight the unfairness and illogicality of the regulations,"" she said.
Magistrates' chairman Alastair Langdon said Owen entered the shop to ""maliciously"" disrupt the running of the business and had used ""very nasty and abusive language"".
""You had no regard to the safety and welfare of staff or customers at the store,"" he said.
""Your actions must have been frightening and worrying to a number of people in the immediate vicinity.""
The Welsh Government banned the sale of non-essential items, such as clothes, during Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown which ran between 23 October and 9 November.
More than 60,000 people signed a Senedd/Welsh Parliament petition calling for the ban to be reversed, the largest ever submitted."
"LYON, France  —   The French   leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday, warning thousands of her   supporters of “two totalitarianisms,” globalization and Islamism, that want to “subjugate France. ” Ms. Le Pen’s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic. France, a prosperous country with the world’s   economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, “This is our country!” Americans, she said, had “kept faith with their national interest,” even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been “dispossessed of their patriotism. ” Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen’s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France’s   electoral process this spring. The weekend’s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis  —   her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday  —   offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election’s dynamic. The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron  —   he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire  —   spoke of “reconciling” France and of “working together,” and repeatedly addressed more than 10, 000 supporters in a giant stadium as “my friends. ” France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen’s war on globalization. The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies “fighting obscurantism” at home. They would have, “as of next May,” the date of the presidential runoff, “a homeland, and that will be France,” Mr. Macron promised. The candidates both present themselves as outsiders  —   Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen’s party has never held power  —   but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a   interviews, Mr. Macron’s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as “heads of companies. ” In contrast, Ms. Le Pen’s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: “I’m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I’m the candidate of the people!” Still, the slickly produced   National Front event at Lyon’s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country’s leaders for having agreed to Algeria’s independence  —   like Ms. Le Pen’s father, the party’s founder,   Le Pen. She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen’s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch’s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words “In the Name of the People,” and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French. Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump’s victory after years of electoral defeats in France  —   “The impossible becomes the possible,” Ms. Le Pen said of it  —   she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a “nightmare,” secure the country’s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France’s social benefits and offering little in return. “Our benefits are distributed to people all over the world,” she said. But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called “sovereignty” to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to “restore order” within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. “After decades of cowardice and   our choice is a choice of civilization,” she said. “Will our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?” The crowd ate it up. “She’s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,” said Eric Fusis, a    retired military officer from the Doubs. “It’s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,” he said."

Guest post by WUWT moderator Andi Cockroft
I wrote the other week of an Evening With His Lordship – aka Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley – in which I outlined his presentation made here in New Zealand.
Many commenters seemed to take issue with my spelling of “sceptic” – which of course is correct for an Anglo Saxon such as I, or some berated my referral to Christopher as “His Lordship” – which of course is equally correct for an Anglo Saxon – it is simply courtesy after all.
I do point out that most of my adult life has been spent developing computer “programs”, which read and write to “disk” (although I do sometimes rebel and use a disc) – and when the painful necessity arises, I can even spell “initialize” – so I am quite adaptable to US English when needed.
Hopefully here though, attending a presentation by Catherine Leining, one of New Zealand’s only two disciples of Al Gore, should prove less contentious – with I suspect very few real sceptics in the auditorium.
I had hoped to report quite dispassionately and simply compare the arguments put forward by Christopher and those by Catherine – but regrettably that is just not possible.

The two presentations could have not be further apart in technique had they tried.
Whilst Christopher mixed wit, scientific argument and many citations, the pitch by Catherine was primarily emotive.
Introduced by Wellington’s Green Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown, the first 25 minutes were spent on who Catherine was. The presentation proper started just before 6pm.
But none of the scientific papers, charts, graphs, comparisons etc of Monckton – no – here was weather in all its forms: floods, droughts, winds, snow – you name it – suddenly it is “weather is climate”.
Plenty of quotes – Hansen, Trenberth et al but surprisingly no mention of Mann ! None of which said anything other than “it’s worse than we thought”
Prof James Renwick was there to lend support, a leading light at NIWA in earlier times, now an associate Professor at Wellington’s Victoria University

From left to right: Mayor Celia Wade-Brown, Catherine Leining and James Renwick
But I digress. There was a slide with a couple of graphs on there, and I can report that not only is the hockey stick alive and well, it has a twin!!!
I wasn’t quick enough on the camera to capture the image, but the ever-so-typical Mannian flat-line with the uptick to infinity was shown above an almost identical graph showing CO2 concentrations in ppm – also heading skyward to infinity.

Of course this was followed almost immediately by the graphs comparing historic 10 (or was it 20) millennia temperature versus CO2 concentrations. The granularity of which was totally incapable of allowing any interpretation of what preceded what.
More CAGW threats followed, with the typical underwater Maldives stunt, and dire warnings of “likely” temperatures around the globe if we fail to act.
At no time was there any attempt to discuss or explain Climate Sensitivity, Albedo (other than briefly during Q&A), ENSO, Ocean Heat, Aerosols, Proxies, Solar Maxima… the list of missing discussions is almost endless
Towards the end, I was quite surprised that there were no “tipping points” – but in quick successions these were three – but so monumental were they that I forget what they were – something about public opinion I think.
A long presentation on what must be done (but not why it should be done), with windmills, solar, battery cars for all, self-sufficiency for Africa, Carbon Trading, bio-fuels, no more coal, no more bad oil – although apparently “Z” (a brand-name for Shell Petroleum over here) are the good guys and Exxon the bad guys
Towards the end, a series of “red herrings” – it’s the Sun (apparently not), warming has stopped (apparently not), there is no consensus (oh yes there is – 98% climate scientists agree), it’s all based on models (no it’s not), CO2 is a beneficial gas (no it’s not it’s harmful) and a few others.
In all, a very different style of presentation from His Lordship’s more scientific fact-based presentation, this one based primarily on assumptions that the CO2 theory is already fact and that we must act – but no justification of the underlying science to prove the affirmations.
Q&A was interesting – I asked why NIWA (responsible for the Climate record in NZ) was reporting temperature increases twice the global average – according to James Renwick no it’s not – it’s only about 10% above average – I’ll check that one.
Interesting discussion around polar temperatures (and this is where albedo was touched on), and apparently Antarctica is thawing just as much as the Arctic – it just has more ice so will take longer.
Finally, I knew it had to happen. NZ emits about 47% of its GHG’s from agriculture. A fervent Vega sitting in the gallery insists that if we all took Vitamin B12 supplements, we could all relinquish our addiction to beef and save all that flatulence.
On that note, I left. But since I had missed my evening meal to attend this presentation, I stopped off for a curry on the way home – if that doesn’t add methane to the atmosphere I don’t know what will.

James Shaw took advantage of the economic havoc wreaked upon Saudi Arabia to tweet about the evils of oil.



Oil is unreliable, erratic and volatile. We should not be relying on it for fuel.



This is one of the many reasons why it is critical that we diversify our transport options; so that they are clean, green, and not derailed by overseas conflict.



  
As we all know, the wind blows at a steady, usable, velocity at all times and is a reliable source of energy for wind turbines. Yeah/Nah.



And, the sun shines upon our solar panels uninterrupted by clouds (or nighttime) allowing a steady and reliable generation of electricity. Oops, no.



If we did not want our energy supplies to be disrupted by overseas conflict we could always exploit our own oil and gas reserves here in New Zealand. Oh, wait – Captain’s Call.



Oil has many sources around the world with no one supplier having a monopoly. Unlike the rare earths used in electric motors for EVs and in generators for wind turbines, which are largely controlled by China.



And mining cobalt and lithium etc is such a ‘clean’, ‘green’ enterprise, isn’t it James? After killing off all mineral exploitation in New Zealand, the Greens want us to increase the mining of minerals in other, less developed, countries. 



Let’s not mention the child exploitation that occurs to get the batteries produced for the EVs, shall we?



Fortunately, Trump has had a part to play in turning the US into an exporter rather than just a consumer of petrochemicals, otherwise the price shock for us could be worse.



And we haven’t even touched on the end-of-life issues for wind turbines, solar panels and EV batteries.



 **The Greens are unreliable, erratic and volatile. We should not be relying on them for Government.**

"For people in the market for a used car, the “certified  ” designation has long been the gold standard, an indication that a qualified mechanic has vouched for the car and that a buyer can expect a vehicle that is  —   hopefully  —   almost as good as new. But the Takata airbag recall, which is the biggest in history, has upended all of that. Now the certified designation  —   known in the auto trade as C. P. O.  —   will no longer necessarily have the same meaning. For one thing, last month the Federal Trade Commission made it easier for cars to be billed as “certified,” even if they were under recall and hadn’t been fixed yet. And just as significantly, Ford  —   with the F. T. C. settlement for cover  —   told its dealers this week that they could sell recalled vehicles and certify them too, so long as they did not advertise them as “safe” and required buyers to sign forms acknowledging that they were aware of the problem. Against this backdrop, one dealer in Florida has refused to sell recalled vehicles that he cannot get fixed, letting 100 or so pile up on a lot miles from his main showroom. He even sued a rival who he believes is selling recalled cars without disclosing that they have not been fixed yet. How did the   market get so confusing all of a sudden? For starters, the Takata airbag recall is unprecedented in its scope, with over 60 million airbags affected, but also in its complexity. Dealers can’t simply fix everything at once, because there are not enough replacement parts. As a result, the airbags most likely to cause harm are first in line for repair, and the lines for existing recalls and others to come may extend for at least a few more years. Given that situation, the Federal Trade Commission told General Motors and two dealers in December that it was just fine to advertise used vehicles as certified even if their airbags were under recall and had not been fixed. Just disclose it, the agency said (in a complaint that has sent jaws dropping throughout the auto industry). Until early this week, every major car company had said that they forbade their dealers from selling certified used vehicles with any open recalls, including ones for Takata airbags. On Monday, however, Ford broke ranks, issuing an update to dealers on its “enhanced” recall process and giving them permission to certify used vehicles that had open recalls after all. There are conditions for the dealers, including these: They must note the recall in two different places and have buyers initial a form. When parts arrive, they have to contact buyers to schedule a replacement. And no advertisements may make claims about “safety” or “safety inspections. ” So does Ford believe there is no competitive advantage to be gained from fixing all recalled cars before selling them? “It’s very difficult to answer that,” Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman, said. “We absolutely put safety first and fix everything we can. ” All the chaos, conflict and changing policies leave consumers in a frustrating position, trying to sort out who’s still selling cars that federal regulators have ordered to be fixed and just how much any seller is disclosing. While federal law prevents dealers from selling new cars with an open recall, no federal law forbids them from selling used ones that way, even if some state consumer protection laws might help an injured owner’s case. In the complex   ecosystem of   and with wholesalers and sellers of various sorts, this has created a number of challenges and a wide range of responses, including some prominent companies that have changed their policies 180 degrees. Whatever policies they set, automakers have only so much control, given that people who work at dealerships occasionally go rogue. Moreover, dealers sometimes certify a car as clean and put it up for sale  —   and then it’s recalled right after that. If the dealer does not catch it and pull the car out of the sales inventory, it is violating the automaker’s rules (and could attract the attention of the F. T. C. ). Buyers who wonder how safe it is to drive with a recalled Takata airbag and check the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website will learn the following: “The vast majority of Takata airbags will perform as expected. ” Oh, but: “Lives have been lost due to this defect. ” Reaction in the industry to Ford’s move was somewhat muted. Audi, BMW, General Motors, Honda, Kia, Mazda and Subaru said they had no plans to follow Ford’s move. Toyota’s response was a bit more squishy. “We are not going to speculate on what impact the F. T. C. ruling may or may not have on Toyota’s current policy,” Aaron Fowles, a Toyota spokesman, said via email. “But there have been no changes to date. ” The   chain CarMax has taken a similar approach to Ford’s. While it too had a recent   with the F. T. C. over disclosure issues, the company says that it is transparent as possible, from its online listings to its   interactions. But why sell cars with open recalls at all, thus putting the onus on consumers to sort out the repair? In a statement on its website, CarMax, which cannot repair recalled vehicles itself, states that “customers are in the best position to act on recall information. ” How can that be? Well, CarMax explains that dealers who are authorized to do recall repairs are more likely to repair cars quickly when working with an individual. If CarMax showed up with dozens of cars, those dealers might shun it because it competes with that dealer’s   operation. Does this sound like an extremely useful conspiracy theory designed to dump all the hassle on consumers, who have the least knowledge of how the system works? Would CarMax at least call out said manufacturers by name, to help get to the bottom of this? No, it would not. “Some manufacturers have provided guidance to their dealers that they should remediate recalls for dealer customers first,” a CarMax spokeswoman, Catherine M. Gryp, said in an email message. “Across the country, we have been put in the back of the line for recall repairs. ” AutoNation took a different approach, at least at first. In 2015, its chief executive, Mike Jackson, told Automotive News that the recall situation was “a dysfunctional nightmare that the industry should be ashamed of. ” The company pledged to sell no cars with open recalls, period. By last year, it was costing the company dearly, to the tune of 6 cents per share of its earnings in the third quarter. In November, it gave up and began selling some cars with open recalls (and full disclosures). The lack of Takata airbag replacements, the F. T. C. ’s decision and other anticipated regulatory rollbacks proved to be too much. “We are proud of the efforts we made, but sometimes the system beats you down,” Marc Cannon, the company’s chief marketing officer, said. Sounds kind of like what it feels like to be a consumer in the middle of all this. If you’re about to start shopping for a used car, begin at safercar. gov. There, you can look up cars  —   even the vehicle identification number of a specific car you’re considering  —   to see what recalls are in effect. A report from Carfax can help you figure out whether a recalled car has been fixed. But don’t stop there. Ask the dealer about any open recalls, as well as any proof they might have that they have gotten the recall fixed. Trust, but verify. (Actually? Don’t trust too much, and verify twice.) Worried about a car that you already have? You should be, both about future Takata recalls and others that we don’t know about yet. Rosemary Shahan of the Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety suggests registering your vehicle both with your car’s manufacturer and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration so that you get a notice if your airbag or anything else comes up for recall. Run the vehicle identification number through some checks yourself from time to time too, just to make sure you’re not missing anything. You might also hope that more dealers act out in the same way as Earl Stewart of Lake Park, Fla. He refuses to sell used cars with open recalls, but he doesn’t want to turn away people who are trading in cars with recalled Takata airbags that they have not been able to get fixed yet. This   policy isn’t just good customer service if he can’t take their trade, they might not buy another vehicle from him at the same time that they turn their old one in. As a result, however, he has 100 or so cars sitting in a lot waiting for repair. And when he sent secret shoppers into competing dealers to see how much disclosure they were doing about recalled cars they were selling, he was outraged at what he found. “Maybe this is unique to South Florida, but they are all extremely devious and proactively trying to sell recalled cars by saying there is no recall,” Mr. Stewart said. So he filed a lawsuit to try to swing others over to his way of doing things. “I don’t want the money  —   I just want to stop the practice,” he said. “We’re going to keep filing suits until they throw the towel in. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore the Obama administration charges blindly into a European-style feed-in act to promote renewable energies, they may want to look at what experts in Europe are saying about how well their own feed-in efforts are actually doing.
All pain and no gain – certified flop
An independent committee of expert advisors to the German government is recommending in a report that the country’s once highly ballyhooed EEG renewable energy feed-in act be scrapped altogether because it is 1) “not doing anything for the climate”, 2) “not promoting inn0vation” and 3) driving up the cost of energy.
The report will be officially presented to the government today.
In summary, the once highly touted German EEG renewable energy feed-in act has been all pain and no gain, and the experts see no reason to continue it.
$30 billion a year…yet “does not provide more climate protection”
According to the online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeiting (FAZ) here, the Research and Innovation commission of experts assigned by the German government says in its report that “there is no longer any justification for continuing the EEG Act.”
The experts cite “additional costs of 22 billion euros [$30 billion] per year” and conclude that the renewable energies have an “exaggerated impact on climate change“. Also the reports says the Act has not measurably boosted innovation.
“No measureable impact on innovation”

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The results of the experts’ report are damning in the harshest terms. The FAZ writes, quoting the report:
The conclusion of the expert commission is devastating: ‘The EEG act in its current form is not justifiable from an innovation-political view.”
The report also writes that “there has been no measureable impact on innovation“.
Well, why innovate if profits are guaranteed by massive subsidies?
The most damning text in the FAZ article probably is (my emphasis):
That’s why the EEG’s initiated expansion of renewable energies has led to no additional avoidance of CO2 emissions across Europe, rather they have only been shifted elsewhere. ‘The EEG Act thus does not produce more climate protection, rather it just makes it considerably more expensive.'”
Green energy proponents and lobbyists will certainly move quickly to ferociously attack and dismiss the report. The FAZ writes, however, that the expert recommendation is the latest in a series of expert reports that have reached the same conclusion. But the FAZ does not expect the government to follow the recommendations.
But the pressure on the German government to radically scale back the EEG act is mounting as citizens struggle with skyrocketing electricity prices. Germany has also come under heavy fire from other European countries who accuse the German government of misusing the feed-in act in ways to provide competitive advantages to certain companies.

"Editor’s note: We’re resurfacing this Eat column from last year for Smarter Living to give you some ideas for using up any leftover holiday wine. It is a new year. We have resolved, and a popular fixture in our resolutions is booze. We used it well: It went into punch. It went into grog. It went into mulled wine, cocktails and eggnog. It went straight in. It began in a trickle that became a geyser. Now we are pickled. Which is why January, though a poor time for drinking alcohol, is a good time for cooking with it. In particular, with wine  —   which is, in the elegant and spiritually stirring formulation of Robert Farrar Capon, the late Episcopal priest and cookbook author, ‘‘water that has matured according to nature’s will. ’’ Recipes using wine are notably less common today than they were half a century ago, when every fondue pot and chafing dish released rich gusts of boozy vapor. But there is little better use for the thousands of   bottles that litter refrigerators and counters than to help them effect a secular transubstantiation in our dinners. The alcohol in wine evaporates more quickly than water and is mostly gone after 30 minutes’ cooking. What is left is the taste of the grape that made it, among dozens of ghost flavors: cherry, violet, ash, pineapple, fresh leather, apple, black pepper, wet soil, mandarin, lilac or rose. Plus, a light acidity that keeps the palate alive and alert, and an unmistakable elegance that can be neither explained nor ignored. I have always found most enticing those recipes that truly rely on wine and demand it in quantity, raw and crude and as it is. The food writer Richard Olney recommends Soupe à la Bourguignonne, ‘‘Red Wine Soup’’: pork fat, butter, onions, flour, water, stale bread, herbs and almost an entire bottle of red wine. There is ‘‘Bavarian Wine Soup,’’ from ‘‘The Wine Cook Book’’ (1934): three parts wine to one part water, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and a beaten egg yolk, served with water crackers. Olney also describes a ‘‘typical Bordelais tourain,’’ which is usually eaten during the   harvest but could stand a winter reprise. Its ingredients are onions cooked in fat, salt, tomatoes, sugar, boiling water, stale bread and dry white wine. ‘‘A native,’’ Olney writes, ‘‘may first eat his sopped bread crust, empty out his (red) wine glass into the soup, and drink the rest from the soup plate, a performance known as faire chabrol’’  —   that is, ‘‘to act like a little goat. ’’ The simplest way to cook with wine is just to cook in it. A combination of half wine, half water or broth will cook any tough cut of meat flavorfully and subtly. But an even simpler and deeper pleasure can be found in cooking entirely in wine, with occasional pours of broth to keep things balanced, but the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the juice of the grape. Coq au vin is of this lineage. So is a variation I prefer: coq au vin blanc, or coq au vin jaune, which leaves the old rooster or capon tasting as if it got taken to a party it wasn’t expecting, thoroughly saturated in the complexities of deep dark yellow wine and a long night on the town. There are a few questions that bedevil those who decide to try their hands at cooking with booze. What kind of wine? Father Capon wrote the most useful rule: ‘‘White for lighter meats, red for heavier, but don’t make a fetish of it. ’’ I lean toward the dry and the     but nothing too delicate, because the delicacy will be lost in cooking, and nothing too tannic or inky, which will turn to acidic mud. Can a wine be too good for cooking? Olney writes: ‘‘One may respectfully find a place in the kitchen for a great wine only if heat never comes into contact with it. ’’ That makes sense. If a fine wine is going to be put anywhere but a glass, it must stay unchanged until it reaches its final destination. Can it be too bad? Olney says if you would not drink it, do not cook with it. The former chef Daniel Gritzer recently conducted experiments and found that a wine that started overly fruity and   ended that way, but that a wine that was once good, then oxidized, resulted in a very good dish. This is my theory too  —   it is mostly the alcohol in the wine that oxidizes when a bottle is open and old. It is also the alcohol that disappears in cooking. Don’t worry if uncooked wine tastes oxidized before it is added to a braise or stew  —   as long as it tasted good in its past, however distant. Are there spirits that shouldn’t be cooked in? Scotch, vodka, gin, tequila and moonshine do not make good stew. All of them are, however, capable of sousing and pickling a fish as they are of sousing and pickling a human. And to more attractive ends. Recipe: Boeuf à la Mode"

Lance Wallace writes in Tips and Notes:
The Congressional Budget Office has released an analysis of the effects of a carbon tax.
At $20 a ton. they estimate about $1.2 trillion in revenues over a 10-year period. A money quote for me is:


“Without accounting for how the revenues from a carbon tax would be used, such a tax would have a negative effect on the economy. The higher prices it caused would diminish the purchasing power of people’s earnings, effectively reducing their real (inflation-adjusted) wages. Lower real wages would have the net effect of reducing the amount that people worked, thus decreasing the overall supply of labor. Investment would also decline, further reducing the economy’s total output.”

The CBO goes on to soften this by saying that certain ways of spending the revenue (e.g., reducing deficits or marginal tax rates) might result in a net benefit. But just returning the revenues to the low-income homes most affected by the rise in cost of electricity (16%; range 7% (California) to 27% (Illinois, West VA, etc.)) would not decrease the total cost of the carbon tax.

These two political figures are chalk and cheese with very little, if anything, in common. They rule from opposite ends of the political spectrum, where Trump is a nationalist, the powerful master of a booming economy, and Ardern a globalist, seemingly unaware that her tiny nation is limping along at half speed precisely because her globalist theories don’t work in practice.



A man of action meeting a woman of unfulfilled promises, and it doesn’t take much imagination to know that Trump will not offer Ardern anything more than pleasantries. Trump is the master of the deal and Ardern will be sorely disappointed when all she brings to the table is her fist, with which she threatened following her bi-partisan meeting with Scott Morrison in July.



Following that meeting, [Ardern spoke to media](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/07/pm-jacinda-ardern-calls-on-united-states-to-play-larger-role-within-our-region.html) about her demand for greater US involvement in the region, suggesting that she and ScoMo were on the same page, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. 



“The Prime Minister [Ardern] is calling on the United States to play a larger role in Asia Pacific and says New Zealand will “suffer” if nations “look more inwardly”. 



  
Ardern seems to think that nationalists are introspective, whereas globalists, in contrast, are outward-looking. This implies Trump is only concerned about the US and uninterested in the rest of the world, which is not true. Trump puts the US first (why can’t Ardern do that for us?) but he also pays close attention to what is happening overseas.



“Ardern said there ‘has been a view in the past few years’ between Australia and New Zealand that there ‘hasn’t been the same level of attention from the United States within our region’.”



Ardern is presumptuous to speak on Australia’s behalf. She knows New Zealand has been ignored by Trump but Australia has not. ScoMo scored tariff [relief for Australia for 85%](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0203/03RP09) of its steel exports to the US, whereas Ardern failed to achieve any tariff relief whatsoever for us.



What ScoMo took to the US for his visit last week, from his earlier meeting with Ardern, was not table-thumping demands. “There are many larger… more powerful friends that America has, but they know _they do not have a more sure and steadfast friend_ than Australia,” [Morrison said](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/20/scott-morrison-lands-us-promising-another-100-years-friendship). Trump’s response was to accord ScoMo the highest honour he possibly could. A state banquet.



“Australian flags are fluttering alongside the Stars and Stripes at the White House, where Morrison will get a red carpet, honor guard, joint press conference and then dinner in the beautiful Rose Garden.



Morrison may air Australia’s nervousness about Trump’s trade war with China. In June, he warned of smaller economies suffering collateral damage and of the global system coming “under real pressure.” But this is likely to be a relaxed meeting between political friends, albeit with a lot of pomp and ceremony.



Although the head of state in Australia is Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, not Morrison, the White House is giving this the most prestigious category of state dinner. 



It’s only the second time that has been granted in the Trump presidency and the first for an Australian premier here since John Howard in 2006.” 



Our own PTPM won’t have to dust off her ball gown and heels. She will be very lucky if she even gets to meet the leader of the free world because, after all, these two have nothing in common compared to ScoMo and Trump.



“Morrison will cement his place in a growing conservative club – also including the likes of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson – drawn into Trump’s orbit.



Trump has defied controversy over his push to prevent illegal immigrants and asylum seekers from crossing the Mexican border. Similarly, Morrison, a former immigration minister, has worked to make Australia less attractive to would-be asylum seekers. 



His Liberal-National coalition also has much in common with Trump’s climate change skepticism, rejecting overwhelming scientific warnings to encourage lucrative fossil fuel industries. Australia is the world’s largest coal exporter.



Australia has joined Trump’s coalition to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, where Iranian forces threaten to interfere with the massive international flow of oil exports. 



One area that Trump especially appreciates is trade where the United States enjoys a surplus. The trade conflicts proliferating under Trump have bypassed Australia.”



Our PTPM talks about the importance of trade, but the path she chose for us is the globalist one enjoyed by the UK, Germany, France and Sweden. For this, we are expected to be grateful, but more than that, she wants to do a trade deal with the master of the deal? In our neighbour’s words: “she’s dreamin’”.



Either we are living in the wrong country or we have the wrong leader because Ardern is not us.

"CEDARHURST, N. Y.  —   On a brisk October day, Laura Gentile strolled through the orderly aisles stocked with matzo ball soup, apple juice, challah and cinnamon kokosh cake. Packing her cart with fresh peppers, canned tuna, pretzels and cake, she said the food pantry here on Long Island was the first where she felt like any other grocery shopper. It was welcome relief from the long lines and piles of unorganized food at other food banks. “You don’t feel destroyed just walking in,” Ms. Gentile, 45, said. “Renee greets you when you come in, and you can pick out what you want, what you need. You’re not just handed something. ” Renee Harris, the food pantry coordinator, said she knew from experience the importance of creating a welcoming environment. When her husband lost his job in 2009, she found herself shopping at food banks for the first time in her life. “I felt the employees watching me  —   like I might try to steal something,” Ms. Harris said. “And I ran out of the store crying. ” Then one day she stopped by the Rina Shkolnik Kosher Food Pantry. When her family got back on its feet a few years later, Ms. Harris started working there, hoping to replicate her experience for the 350 families who shop at the pantry each month. Emulating a traditional grocery store, the food bank is organized by food groups. Shoppers carry items home in marked bags donated by nearby shops. Ms. Gentile receives $182 a month in food stamps to feed herself, a    son, Malliki Outlaw, and a    daughter, Nevaeh Outlaw, who both have mental illnesses, she said. Once a month, she fills her cart with food from the pantry, a program of the Marion  Aaron Gural J. C. C. a beneficiary of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Having groceries in the refrigerator has made a difference in a home filled with difficulty, she said. At 19, Ms. Gentile and her young son were living with her parents, who she said had forced her to get an abortion when she became pregnant again as a condition for staying under their roof. She later moved out and became pregnant again while in an abusive relationship, she said, and gave birth to Malliki. Months later, she found out she was expecting twins. Two months along, she miscarried one of them. She named the surviving twin Nevaeh  —   heaven spelled backward. Abuse marks Ms. Gentile’s body. A white scar runs along her hand  —   the lasting effect of being stabbed by a sharp piece of plastic. She has also endured mental trauma. Ms. Gentile said she had lost count of the number of times her children had been hospitalized or institutionalized, because of the harm they were causing their mother and themselves. But she said the trouble had started after their father died in 2002. Ms. Gentile takes care of both children, who still live at home. Her son has bipolar disorder, and her daughter has anxiety, depression and mild intellectual disabilities. She said that medication and therapy had helped manage their symptoms, and that they had not been hospitalized since 2009. But Ms. Gentile’s own health problems, including depression, high blood pressure and arthritis, exacerbated by years of abuse, have worsened. She had an operation to remove her ovaries because of a precancerous cyst. Doctors have told her that she needs to have gallstones removed and both knees replaced, but she cannot afford the operations and fears leaving her children for the duration of the recovery without another caregiver. Injections would ease the pain in her arthritic knees, but her insurance does not cover the cost. Ms. Gentile, who worked as a medical office assistant and coordinator for a physical therapy clinic, stopped working in 2008 and started receiving Supplemental Security Income a year later. The family now subsists on a cumulative $1, 434 in Supplemental Security Income. The family’s benefits had previously been cut by $733 when her son’s Supplemental Security benefits were terminated in April, because proper documentation was not submitted. The benefits were reinstated this month but reduced by $30. In 2009 she moved from Queens Village to Far Rockaway in Queens. She sleeps on a makeshift bed and gives her children the two bedrooms. After a public housing subsidy, she pays $410 a month for rent. Marion  Aaron Gural J. C. C. provided Ms. Gentile and her children with $630 from the Neediest Cases Fund to cover her December 2015 rent and $650 to help with rent again in September. At the food pantry, Ms. Gentile walked to the front to check out. Ms. Harris warmly pointed out a bag of grapes, adding it and a few other items to Ms. Gentile’s cart. She reminded her to return in a few weeks for a Thanksgiving turkey. As Ms. Gentile left, grocery bags in both hands, she was smiling."
"Faiz Khalil was a colonel in the Iraqi Army whose work with the United States military may have provoked the killing of his    daughter. Mohamed Sharif was a student in Mogadishu, Somalia, an urban war zone terrorized by rival militias. Both arrived in the United States as refugees, through a yearslong process that involved hours of interviews and over a dozen background checks. In late January, President Trump signed an executive order to suspend that program, after months of claiming that the vetting process needed  . The State Department notes that refugees are the most rigorously examined travelers. As the program’s future hangs in limbo  —   last weekend refugees began coming in again,  after a legal challenge to the order  —   we trace the existing steps. Mr. Khalil, 54, now resides in Twin Falls, Idaho, as an American citizen, while Mr. Sharif, 26, lives in Aurora, Colo. as a legal permanent resident. The United Nations gathers the names of people who have fled persecution. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was in a daze when he arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad in July 2006  —   he had been unable to think clearly ever since his daughter Maha had not returned from school one day. Mr. Khalil had tried to keep his work with the United States military a secret, knowing it could make his family a target. But the day after Maha disappeared in 2004, he received a call from someone claiming to be from Al Qaeda. The man said that Mr. Khalil had been found out and would have to pay with Maha’s life. After learning that Maha was, indeed, dead, the family tried to stay in Baghdad. But they felt that the other children could be in danger, so, in 2006, Mr. Khalil left Iraq with his wife, Nahida Mohammad, their    son, Mamoon Jumah, and    daughter, Maryam Jumah. As unauthorized immigrants, they could not work and had to send the children to private school. Knowing that their savings would not last, Mr. Khalil registered them as refugees. ____ Mohamed Sharif At age 16, Mr. Sharif arrived alone at Kakuma, a desert camp for refugees in northwest Kenya, in 2007. Somalia had gone through more than a dozen attempts to form a government in his lifetime, and it was dangerous for him to return. Mr. Sharif moved into a   hut in the camp, where the temperature often topped 100 degrees, and registered as a refugee. There, he met Bisharo, a single mother from Somalia with two children, Adnan and Hodan. He picked up work as an electrician. They married, but there was no big wedding. “We didn’t have enough money,” he said. An officer hired by the United Nations asks questions about the applicant’s life. Then two officials review the case to determine if the person faces serious persecution back home. If concerns arise, the person is interviewed again or the case is closed. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil and his family arrived with their birth certificates, proof of Iraqi citizenship and marriage certificate, at a building in Amman. Armed guards were posted outside. Over seven hours, they were photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed. There were tears, yelling, frustration as other Iraqis were denied refugee status. When an official asked Mr. Khalil through an Arabic interpreter about Maha, he broke down in tears. “I could not control myself,” he said. As they waited for word, the family began to unravel. No one could sleep through the night. The parents walked their children to and from school each day, fearing something could happen. Then the call came. Mr. Khalil was to return with more documents, including Maha’s death certificate. ____ Mohamed Sharif It was a big day. By 2012, Mr. Sharif had waited years at Kakuma before an official arrived for an interview. Mr. Sharif wore a football    —   he had no dress clothes, and the camp was sweltering. Why did he leave, he was asked. Mr. Sharif described in Somali the way he had fled his home, fearing death. “I don’t have a home to go back to,” he later recalled having said. Months later, Bisharo gave birth to a girl, Nimo. But then Bisharo died. At 22, Mr. Sharif was the single father of three children. American contractors conduct   interviews to prepare for a visit from Homeland Security. Background checks begin. Faiz Khalil Mr. Khalil was asked about his time in the Iraqi Army. Why did he enlist? Because of the promise of a stable life. Why did he become an officer? There were benefits: a new car and some land. He described teaching American soldiers about the Iraqi chain of command, and telling them to request receipts with serial numbers for deliveries of items like batteries or tires. Otherwise, he said, some could end up for sale on the Iraqi black market. Mr. Khalil answered his interrogators “like a robot,” he said. “I lost my daughter, I lost my house  —   everything,” he said. During this time, Mr. Khalil and his family watched nervously as their bank accounts dwindled. They had to pay $3 a day per person to the Jordanian government to live there without authorization. They could not afford enough diesel fuel to heat their apartment through the winter, so the parents took turns waking up in the middle of the night to turn on the heater an hour at a time. ____ Mohamed Sharif This round, in 2013, took three days. In the first interview, Mr. Sharif and his interviewer cried as he spoke. In the second and third, he had to repeat his story. They asked about his birthplace, his parents, their marriage, his schooling, his journey to the camp, his religion. Had extremists tried to recruit him? Would he do anything against the law? “The answer is no,” he said later. “The reason we are here is to get a better life. ” The interviewers requested documents. “I didn’t have any,” he said. “Most of our people,” he said, “they didn’t go to school, they weren’t born in the hospital. ” That year, Mr. Sharif met Ubah Isse Mohamed, a camp neighbor, and they married. “She was loving,” he said. “The right person for my kids. ” Officers visit the camp to verify stories and take fingerprints. Some nations skip this step and rely on United Nations interviews during the process. Faiz Khalil Winter receded and the family was called back for a   appointment. Ms. Mohammad and the children were interviewed together he was questioned alone. American immigration officials asked hundreds of questions  —   many of them repeats from before  —   but they wanted even more detail. The family was fingerprinted again and their retinas were scanned. ____ Mohamed Sharif In the summer of 2014, American officials went to Kakuma. Mr. Sharif had to tell his story again. Then came several    questions. Had he ever been recruited by terrorist agencies? By radical groups? No, he said. No. Then he waited. A medical exam is conducted to identify needs and ensure that people with a contagious disease do not enter the United States until they have been cleared. Faiz Khalil By the summer of 2007, the Khalil children had begun to speak Arabic with a Jordanian accent. The family was sent to a clinic for three days of health evaluations that included   blood work and immunizations. Mr. Khalil and his children received   stress disorder diagnoses. In early 2008, Mr. Khalil got a call. “Congratulations,” he recalled an official saying. “You’re moving to Twin Falls, Idaho. ” Mr. Khalil had never heard of it. “I said, ‘This is in the U. S.?’” He did a quick search online: “It really scared me more, because I said, ‘I am going to nowhere. ’” They were scheduled to leave in September. As the day drew nearer, Mr. Khalil felt conflicted. Maybe they would fail, he thought. He had heard that life in America was difficult. ____ Mohamed Sharif Later that year, he got a letter. The United States wanted to welcome him. His family, which was further behind in the process, would have to stay behind. Then came a   medical checkup at Kakuma. In early December, he left for a local airport and flew to Nairobi. On Dec. 10, at midnight, he left Kenya for good. Nine nonprofit organizations help refugees resettle. They decide where these new immigrants will live, often opting for more affordable midsize cities. Faiz Khalil On the morning they were set to leave, Mr. Khalil woke up in tears, and he struggled to compose himself. At one point, overcome by fear, he asked their taxi driver to turn around. “Don’t listen to him!” Ms. Mohammad shouted. At the airport, something changed. “I had to be strong to support the family,” Mr. Khalil explained later. They traveled for 36 hours on four planes: first to Frankfurt, then Chicago, Salt Lake City and, finally, Twin Falls. It was close to midnight when they arrived. The children were exhausted. “It was just dark, nobody in the streets, so I was kind of like, ‘Where we are? ’” he said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He touched down at the Denver airport on Dec. 12, in the early evening. A man from Lutheran Family Services took him to a new apartment. The following night, Mr. Sharif walked outside to take in his first snowflakes. “I looked up at the skies, and got it in my eyes,” he recalled. “It was really just something amazing for me. ” “Some refugees who were in my neighborhood have been in the camp from 1991 until now,” he said. “For me, I can say this: I was the luckiest guy ever. Ever. ” Refugees can receive federal cash assistance for up to eight months. They can tap into federally funded language instruction courses, employment services and social adjustment programs for up to five years. They are required to apply for permanent residence after their first year. Faiz Khalil In the morning light, Twin Falls did not appear as foreboding. The children learned English quickly, while Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad practiced by watching “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Titanic. ” Both work as interpreters for a refugee resettlement center, and Mr. Khalil still advises United States military troops on working in Iraq. Mr. Khalil and Ms. Mohammad are registered independents and voted for Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump’s executive order on refugees was unfair, Mr. Khalil said  —   other Iraqis would suffer after working to help the American military. Maryam is now 14, but acts as if she were much older, her father said. Mamoon, 19, is “very American,” Mr. Khalil said  —   sometimes speaking to his parents with a “sharpness” to which they are unaccustomed. When Mr. Khalil thinks of Maha, he likes to look at old family photos. His children rarely bring her up in front of him. But when they do not know he is listening, he occasionally overhears them talking about her. “They have a good life, better than I had,” Mr. Khalil said. ____ Mohamed Sharif He is on the road constantly, working long hours as a truck driver to save for his family’s arrival. They live in Nairobi, but cannot go to school because they do not have Kenyan documents. Without them, he said, “I am alone. ” Mr. Sharif hoped to see them by Feb. 16, Nimo’s fourth birthday. His    in Indianapolis has already bought them toys. But a week into his presidency, Mr. Trump threw the future of Mr. Sharif’s family into uncertainty when he signed the refugee order. “My kids keep asking, ‘Daddy when are we coming? ’” Mr. Sharif has not told them yet. “They cannot know,” he said. “I don’t want to make them hopeless. ”"
"**Boris Johnson has urged MPs to back his stricter Covid tiers system for England, as he tries to head off a rebellion from his backbenchers.**
The PM said the NHS ""remains under pressure"" despite progress in tackling the virus during the nationwide lockdown ending on Wednesday.
So far 30 Tory MPs have confirmed they will oppose the measures in a vote taking place now.
But with both Labour and the SNP abstaining, they are expected to pass.
More than 55 million people will enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday if the plans are approved.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he recognised restrictions needed to continue, but he was ""far from convinced"" the new system will work, and economic help for firms was ""nowhere near sufficient"".
But, defending his decision to order his MPs to abstain, meaning they will not vote for or against, he said it was ""not in the national interest"" for his party to join Tory rebels and vote against the new tiers.
Votes in the Commons need a bit of mathsâ¦
Ahead of the vote, Mr Johnson said he recognised hospitality had ""borne a disproportionate share of the burden"" during the crisis, and confirmed an extra Â£40m for some pubs in tiers two and three.
The money will be distributed via councils to so-called ""wet pubs"" - those that don't serve food and so are the most affected by the highest levels of coronavirus restrictions.
The prime minister told MPs that the government could not ""move too quickly"" to end restrictions before a working vaccine is available.
He said he appreciated the ""feeling of injustice"" many feel at their tier allocation, and pledged to ""look in granular detail"" at the ""human geography"" of the virus when the tiers are reviewed in two weeks' time.
The government has promised MPs the chance to vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February.
The government announced last week that its tougher three tiers to tackle the virus would come into force when England's current lockdown ends in the early hours of Wednesday.
It will allow ministers to place areas into one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - but the majority of the population will face the higher range of restrictions.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, is among those to confirm he will vote against the new tiers later.
He told MPs the government had made ""no serious attempt"" to forecast the economic effects of the restrictions, and his Altrincham and Sale constituency, which is in Greater Manchester, had been ""unfairly"" put in tier 3.
And Damian Green, the MP for Ashford in Kent, expressed concerns about the UK's plan to loosen restrictions for five days over Christmas, saying the country must avoid exchanging a ""weekend of fun for a long winter of regret"".
Several Labour MPs, including Richard Burgon, Emma Lewell-Buck, and Graham Stringer, have said they will defy Sir Keir's orders and vote against the system.
Mr Johnson and the government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, addressed a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs - including members of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) - about an hour before the vote.
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the PM made a plea for unity, but did not offer any concessions on calls for county or borough-level restrictions, rather than tiers covering whole regions.
The PM was also pressed on how genuine the review of tiers promised on 16 December would be, added our correspondent.
Conservative backbencher Sir Edward Leigh said he would vote with the government with ""deep reluctance,"" calling the tier system a ""compromise"".
""How can I vote against this measure tonight when there is no alternative plan, when the result of my vote tonight is that frail and vulnerable people will die,"" he asked.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.
The SNP said it would abstain as the measures only affect England but the DUP's Sammy Wilson said he would vote against, describing the government's approach as ""Project Fear on steroids"".
The Federation of Small Businesses said the support for pubs was totally inadequate as it would only cover the cost of 200 pints or roughly a single keg of beer.
On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 603 people in the UK have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the official total to 59,051.
Government figures also show that as of 9am on Tuesday, there have been a further 13,430 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK."

Advice



Probably satirical.



It has long been claimed that increasing CO2 is warming the planet. But what causes this increasing CO2? We have been told that it is the evil ‘fossil’ fuels that are at fault.



However, new research has come to light that shows that there is a much stronger correlation with the CO2 growth: Population growth.



In light of this startling new evidence, the Irritating Persons Claiming Crisis (IPCC) are recommending that populations immediately be reduced to 1.5% above pre-industrial levels. At 2% above pre-industrial levels, humanity is doomed, they claim.



Taking all this very seriously, our local Green Party has proposed the Zero Population Bill, which seeks to make the NZ population neutral by 2050. When ‘population’ is referred to in the Bill, it is not only the human population that the Greens are concerned about: The population of animals on our farms will also come under these new regulations.



The net-zero population proposals have a number of benefits, fewer cars on the roads, fewer people travelling to work so less need for expensive and inefficient public transport. No need for trams down Dominion Road; no need for a bullet train service from Hamilton to Auckland (or somewhere near Auckland, anyway).



Clearly, with the Zero Population Act in force, the Emissions Trading Scheme will no longer be required as surrogate births will be illegal.



The Zero Population Act will set separate targets and pathways for long-lived populations (mainly geriatrics) and short-lived populations (mainly idiot drivers). Long-lived populations must go to net-zero by 2050 or sooner (accounting for natural attrition). Short-lived populations must be significantly reduced to sustainable levels, but not zero. This is usually achieved by Darwin Award winners and the like. 



The Zero Population Act will establish an independent Population Commission, consisting of 6 – 10 experts appointed by Parliament. The Commission has two main functions:



The Act will ensure New Zealand’s zero population transition is fair and cost-effective. The Act will honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Government must take into account a range of factors when setting population budgets, including environmental and social impacts, business competitiveness and inter-generational equity. 



The Zero Population Act framework is uniquely suited to cross-party agreement. It sets out legally mandated outcomes and process, without prescribing specific policies. It combines long-term clarity on policy direction with flexibility in its delivery.



The Zero Population Act will commit New Zealand to net zero population by 2050 or sooner. Getting to zero population in this timeframe will require broad political commitment, immediate action, and coherent long-term planning.



Getting to zero population by 2050 is possible, necessary, and will be beneficial for New Zealand.



Two recent reports have shown feasible options and pathways for New Zealand to transition away from population-intensive living. These reports are available somewhere on the internet. Read the benefits of transitioning to zero population.



The transition to zero population is inevitable, and already underway in many countries. Under the Paris Agreement, the world has agreed to a net-zero emissions future. Net-zero emissions is a prerequisite for net-zero population.



Starting our transition without delay will minimise costs and create benefits for New Zealand. 



_Note: Much of this was lifted from official sites by simply replacing the word ‘carbon’ with ‘population’. Both scenarios are equally stupid._

I hate to say it, believe me, but the cartoon in yesterday’s Dompost accurately sums up the way the National party is allowing themselves to be portrayed.



They seem to be dithering, **distracted by things that simply don’t matter** , while they ponder and mull over their stance on the Zero-Carbon Bill, the biggest economic hand-grenade a government of New Zealand has ever considered pulling the pin on.



 **They need to oppose this Bill in the strongest possible terms** , they need to be holding feet to the fire, they need to stay on message and point – this bill is economic sabotage and, it’s a fact, we will all be worse off, especially the lower earners.



They need to be especially targeting global-warming emperor-with-no-clothes Shaw and his blithe let-them-eat-cake shrug-off towards this bill’s victims:



“The modelling suggested **the poorest 20 per cent of households could be twice as worse-off thanks to climate action** as their counterparts on the average income, thanks to them spending a higher proportion of their income on products likely to increase in cost.  
 **Shaw said any change would be gradual** and Government interventions such as the Families Package would be key. The Families Package greatly increased the amount of money the poorest families gain from Working For Families and other benefits.”



Oh, OK, James, so the poor will only gradually get poorer, that’s nice, and only gradually more reliant on welfare hand-outs. I’m sure they’ll take comfort from that. These points need to be hammered home, hard! But instead, what do we get?



Never a truer thing spoken by _Stuff_ : “National doesn’t bite”. At a time when we need an opposition dog prepared to tear into this bill and its proponents, ripping them a new rear entrance if necessary, we get a toothless poodle who doesn’t want to “play politics”.



Get going, Mr Bridges, or get gone!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s eco-evangelical, leftie  weekly Die Zeit has a surprisingly sober online piece that almost got by me.
It actually harshly criticizes global warming science – unusual for Die Zeit, which is an influential “intellectual” weekly that has been preaching the science is settled for years. Not long ago it one-sidedly attacked skeptics and portrayed them as gangster-types led by Godfather and mastermind Marc Morano, aided and abetted by the evil Fred Singer and German Fritz Vahrenholt.
In the latest commentary, Andreas Frey of Die Zeit writes:
We need less alarmism, more fundamental research and courage to take risks!”
Climate alarmism headed for a dead-end
Frey compares the climate change scare to another scare that swept across Germany in the 1980s: forest die-off because of acid rain. That catastrophe never materialized, of course. Frey writes that the climate change movement is caught in the very same trap and finds itself well on its way to a dead-end.
The pattern observed is similar to the issue of forest die-off. Though the catastrophe never came about, forest still isn’t doing well. But who wants to hear about it?”
Damaged science
In point number 2 of his commentary, Frey writes that many climate scientists engaged “in spreading fear, warning of dire scenarios for our future“. But that has backfired, as Frey writes:
The flood of alarm threatens the credibility of the entire field – and thus damages science. But the alarmist is proud about having made the climate issue popular; he mingles gladly with politicians (and he even fancies himself as one) and thus knows precisely what is needed to curb the collapse of the planet: eat no meat, don’t drive cars, don’t consume electricity made with coal, don’t fly. Thus he has stepped over the line between science and activism.”
Media have been too uncritical

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In point no. 3, Frey surprisingly even writes that the media have been too uncritical of the science they’ve been fed by alarmist scientists…something that Die Zeit is guilty of well beyond the shadow of any doubt. In fact, skeptics get labeled as gangster-like evil climate mobsters (see above). Astonishingly, Frey describes the mindset of the media as follows:
Whatever you do, don’t say anything bad about climate scientists, don’t express any doubts about their results or forecasts – that could be fodder for climate skeptics! That’s how journalists often reacted.”
UN conferences have failed
In point no. 4, Frey claims that “climate diplomacy has failed. Emissions continue rising – all the UN conferences amounted to nothing.”
It probably was just too naïve to believe that the countries would come to their senses and obligate themselves to make cuts.”
Bring on fracking!
In point no. 5 he reiterates the global warming is still a real problem and adds that Germans must be willing to take more risks in combatting climate change. He says Germans must be more open to geo-engineering, CO2 sequestation and fracking.
Climate science has lost its relevance
In point no. 6 Frey writes of the “diminishing relevance of climate science” , which he says is confirmed by studies. Frey asks what’s the use of studies that show the world’s cultural monuments are threatened by sea level rise, and that El Ninos lead to more war? Frey thinks the science is often focused on the wrong things.
Finally, in point no.7 of the essay, Frey believes that climate scientists aren’t the ones who should be advising policy advisors after all. He writes that the science has to become more open to other scientists from other fields, such as sociologists, historians, geographers and ethnologists. He adds that “there are many possibilities for adaptation. In the climate debate adaptation will become an increasingly important topic, and everyone has to be allowed to join the discussion.”
Yes. it’s been a long time since we’ve witnessed sobriety at Die Zeit. It’s almost as if they forgot to take their dose on panic pills one day. Don’t get your hopes up.  This is probably the last sober piece we’ll see from Die Zeit for quite some time.

"HONG KONG  —   Three masked explorers appeared atop an apartment tower in Hong Kong’s North Point district and sent a black drone flying, over a clothesline, until it was buzzing more than 10 stories above the cars, trams and pedestrians on the street below. If history was any guide, the explorers said, the building the drone was filming  —   a 1952 theater with unusual roof supports  —   would eventually be demolished because it is not on Hong Kong’s list of declared monuments. The authorities are “renewing the city on behalf of the developers, not the people,” said one of the explorers, who goes by the alias Ghost in videos and whose pollution mask and fingerless gloves gave him the air of a bank robber or graffiti artist. The explorers belong to HK Urbex, a   urban exploration collective whose expeditions often require trespassing or walks through dark, abandoned or dangerous sites. But unlike some urban explorers, they do not court danger purely for its own sake. Their primary goal is to peel back layers of history  —   sometimes literally, by digging through dust and trash  —   and forge a video archive of Hong Kong’s   environment. “Until you peel them back, you don’t know what existed before,” said Ghost, 33. “Others are interested in the adrenaline rush, but we’re interested in the story. What can it tell us about the past?” Many buildings that went up here before Hong Kong’s 1997 return to China from British colonial rule have already been replaced by taller ones, as exceptionally high property values create economic incentives to cram more towers into an already crowded skyline. But some buildings lie fallow for years between tenant evictions and demolition, and others, like the 1952 State Theater that the explorers filmed recently, are partly open to the public. The State Theater’s main space, for example, is now a snooker hall. HK Urbex sees these structures as prime targets for urban expeditions. So far HK Urbex has released more than three dozen videos documenting their perambulations through derelict prisons, tenements, cinemas, hospitals, casinos, police stations, bomb shelters, subway tunnels, a shipwreck and other sites across Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia. Fans say the elegiac videos, cut with bleak soundscapes and often presented without narration, are poignant meditations on urban evolution and decay. “It’s about forcing us to confront the aesthetic of loss,” Lee Kah Wee, an assistant professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore, said of the group’s film oeuvre. “It forces us to come face to face with this debris of modernization and these ruins that are constantly accumulating, even as we keep building. ” The group says its most popular videos have been viewed more than 20, 000 times on YouTube. Its photographs and videos have also been cited or featured in an international art exhibition, a forthcoming photography book and an advocacy campaign to save Central Market, a 1930s landmark in central Hong Kong, from demolition. The group’s eight members, all longtime Hong Kong residents, use aliases in their work to keep public attention focused on their mission instead of their personalities but also because anonymity helps shield them from potential legal trouble. They agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified only by their aliases. The HK Urbex members often spend weeks researching obscure and abandoned sites before visiting them. Once inside, they document everyday items that they stumble upon  —   family portraits,   ancestral shrines, a broken piggy bank  —   and that will probably never be recorded in history books. “If not for this group of urban adventurers, all of these buildings would eventually disappear without anyone knowing what they meant to society at a certain point in time,” said Lee Ho Yin, the director of architectural conservation programs at the University of Hong Kong. He added that he regarded the group’s members as “extreme urban anthropologists. ” The Hong Kong government’s Antiquities and Monuments Office has granted 114 buildings and cultural landmarks permanent protection from development, and assigned grades to about 1, 000 historic buildings, a list that may soon include the 1952 State Theater. But Professor Lee of the University of Hong Kong said that the second classification did not legally protect buildings from demolition, and that Hong Kong officials  —   unlike their counterparts in Singapore, another wealthy Asian city and former British colony  —   rarely bestowed conservation status on modernist landmarks like the State Theater. “Unfortunately, the economy of Hong Kong is still very much pegged to property development,” he said. A spokeswoman for the Antiquities and Monuments Office, reached by telephone, declined to comment on HK Urbex or its activities. The group was formed in 2013 by Ghost and a friend, who goes by the alias Echo Delta. They both are   filmmakers, and they discovered their initial HK Urbex sites while scouting locations for film shoots, Echo Delta said. After a video they shot of a Hong Kong shipwreck received wide coverage in the city’s   news media, they said, they decided to create the HK Urbex Facebook page, and later a YouTube channel and Tumblr blog. HK Urbex members say their videos are visual expressions of the “localist” political movement that has recently gained support in Hong Kong and reflects a conviction among many younger people that their city’s identity is distinct from that of the Chinese mainland. The localist movement is itself an outgrowth of the   Occupy Central protests of 2014, which swept Hong Kong  and reflected a widespread fear among many people here that Beijing is running roughshod over the “one country, two systems” principle governing Hong Kong’s transfer to Chinese rule. The principle granted the city a high degree of legal, financial and political autonomy until 2047. “I guess we’re indirectly political,” Ghost said, as Echo Delta’s drone buzzed above North Point. After filming the State Theater, whose structural supports soar above its roof in concrete parabolas like those of a suspension bridge, Echo Delta and Ghost took a taxi to the city’s Central district. The idea was to check on some abandoned buildings that they have been monitoring over the years. One stop was Central Market, a 1930s landmark that Ghost had previously explored twice  —   first by sneaking past a security guard who was urinating and later by climbing in through a window. This time, a side door was unlocked. Echo Delta slipped inside, but a security guard quickly shooed him away. “Sorry,” he said. On nearby Bridges Street, a white residential building that the pair had once sneaked into was now ringed by a fence, with “X” marks in its windows. “They’ve cleared it out,” said Echo Delta, whose alias is a play on his   nickname. Later, they saw that while several abandoned buildings near the Graham Street Market had been razed for new construction, others were still standing, right beside the market’s   vegetable hawkers. One squat apartment building in particular, which had plants growing in its crevices, caught their eye. They lingered for a few minutes under its shadow, apparently transfixed by its architectural features. “Look at those long windows,” Echo Delta said quietly. “Victorian  —   no, Georgian?” “That would be one to look into,” said Ghost, the only white member of HK Urbex. His alias plays on a Cantonese slang term for foreigners. His partner nodded. “I bet it’s going to be turned into a Starbucks,” Echo Delta said."

We haven’t heard politicians complain much lately about “tax breaks for U.S. companies that ship jobs overseas,” perhaps because the next federal election is still more than a year away.   
  
  
An article in the _Financial Times_ today shows why that charge rings pretty hollow anytime in the election cycle. In an interview with CEO Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar Inc., the FT notes that the Peoria, Ill.-based maker of earth‐​moving equipment has been thriving even though the domestic U.S. economy has been stuck in low gear.   
  
  
Like many U.S. multinational companies, Caterpillar has been expanding its sales and profits by selling its products in rapidly growing emerging markets while spreading its production facilities around the world. Here’s the key passage for those politicians who complain about U.S. companies investing and hiring abroad: 



In recent months, [Caterpillar] has announced plans for new factories in Singapore, Thailand, China and Brazil.   
  
  
In the US, it is building a new distribution centre in Washington state while expanding its factories in North Dakota and Kansas.   
  
  
Caterpillar has hired about 29,000 people worldwide in the past 20 months, some 13,000 of them in the US, with most of the rest in China, Brazil, Mexico and the UK.



The Caterpillar experience shows that job creation is not a zero‐​sum game, where jobs created abroad by U.S. companies must come at the expense of production and employment in the United States. In fact, as I show in my 2009 book _Mad about Trade_ (pp. 100–104), the Caterpillar experience is not unusual. U.S. employment by parent companies will typically rise and fall in synch with employment at their affiliates abroad. For U.S. multinationals: 



Foreign and domestic operations tend to complement each other and expand together. A successful company operating in a favorable business climate will tend to expand employment at both its domestic and overseas operations. More activity and sales abroad usually require more managers, accountants, lawyers, engineers, and production workers at the parent company.



As for those “tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas,” I explained why they are not a problem in an op‐​ed in the _New York Post_ during the last election cycle. Keep it handy for when the demagoguery starts flying again next fall.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEuropean parliamentary elections are slated to take place May 22-25 and parties critical of the Europe’s course on a variety of issues, ranging from the euro-currency, bailouts and climate change, are faring well at the polls and have the establishment spooked. One good example of a climate policy/science-skeptical party is the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which is now showing strong support in opinion polls.

Germany’s climate policy-crtitical AfD party surging in the opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s European Parliamentary elections (for Germany, Austria and Luxembourg). Photo credit: AfD party
The UKIP party will soon be getting company in Europe. In Germany a newly formed party named the AfD Alternativ für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany), formed just last year, today is showing strong support, now polling at 7%, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
In general, as is the case with Britain’s UKIP party, the media have been portraying the AfD as a populist, right-wing party with suspicious leanings. But it appears the public isn’t buying that portrayal. Indeed the AfD represents a party that threatens to rock the coziness and harmony that the German establishment has enjoyed on issues such as climate and Europe. Much of the party’s support is coming from disenchanted conservative CDU/CSU and Free Democrat FDP voters, who have grown frustrated with their own parties.
I’m not a supporter of the AfD, and I’m not even familiar with their overall platform. As a US citizen I’m not even allowed to cast a vote. But one thing about the AfD party that I do support, however, is their skepticism regarding climate science and especially the country’s horribly destructive energy policy.

How can two stations less than 1/2 mile apart be so different? How can one set a new record and best it by two degrees while the other doesn’t? 

I was intrigued by this Record Event Report out of Las Vegas today because of the mercury reading, specifically in the “town” of Mercury:

Hmm, smashing. 113°F seemed high to me, since I was monitoring the state of the art NOAA Climate Reference Network Station in Mercury, NV earlier in the day I was surprised to see that value. I looked up the Mercury Desert Rock airport, and sure enough, there was 113°F. But, there was also another value.

Upon checking the data from the nearby Climate Reference Network station, I discovered that the highest temperature recorded there was only 110°F

Source: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mesowest/getobext.php?wfo=vef&sid=MRYN2&num=72&raw=0
The CRN monthly report says 111°F, so the high must have been very brief to not be captured in the 5 minute CRN data above.

When I say it is a nearby station, I really mean it. It is only 2164 feet (0.41 mile) away as I demonstrate on this Google Earth image:

I double checked the image by zooming in to be sure both stations are actually there, and they are. The signature of the ASOS aviation weather station is clearly visible as is the signature of the CRN station.
So what do we have here?

Two stations separated by 2164 feet, both are “official” stations operated by NOAA.
One station, the KDRA ASOS is designated for aviation purposes, but used for daily climate records. It has a single sensor, with a known history of problems. It is also near a big chunk of asphalt tarmac with an albedo different from the rest of the desert floor.
The other station, the MRYN2 CRN is a Climate Reference network station, has state of the art sensors, including triple redundant temperature sensors, with automatic quality control, is placed specifically to be away from influences such as asphalt tarmac, and is surrounded by albedo matching the desert floor.
The elevations are nearly identical with the airport ASOS station at 3238 feet and the CRN station at 3295 feet. That difference of 57 feet won’t amount to any appreciable delta in temperature due to the lapse rate.
The temperature difference at the time the ‘record temperature” of 113°F is recorded at KDRA is two degrees. The CRN station is at 111°F.

So which one is the real temperature? I suppose it is a case of which one gets used for the “official” official reading, in which case is the warmer KDRA ASOS station.
The nearby CRN station does call the KDRA station data into question, but the horse has already left the barn now that NWS has released the numbers to the media. I will lodge a request with NWS Las Vegas to have them look at Mercury ASOS system though in case it is on the fritz as so many often do.
Oddly, after spending millions of dollars on the Climate Reference Network, the old COOP and ASOS network still gets used for high and low climate records.

US News and World Report is running a poll on whether or not Hurricane Sandy was caused by global warming.  Here is the poll results currently: 

Since it is open to everyone, no matter what side of this opinion you come down on, see their web site to add your vote if you wish.
http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/10/30/was-hurricane-sandy-caused-by-global-warming
UPDATE: From reader input it seems this poll is apparently of even poorer quality than one would expect,  and allows multiple voting. NO to vote stuffing. Be honest, 1 vote per person please…though, they may allow you to think it was counted. Sigh, what a poor design for a national magazine. In any event none of that vote stuffing please. OTOH this lack of basic input control negates any value the poll may have. – Anthony

Many WUWT readers have seen the famous bit of propaganda produced by John Cook at the antithetically named “Skeptical Science” website, where he creates a series of steps along the graph of global temperatures suggesting that every time climate skeptics see a “pause” they claim global cooling. Of course, that’s nonsense, but for Cook, it has propaganda value much like his 97% consensus meme which is now falling apart.
The problem with The Escalator from “Skeptical Science”, is that it doesn’t show the alarmist favored view of temperature rise, for example, these IPCC projections from the Third Assessment Report that rocket skyward.

Here at WUWT, we are happy to help with a new, more humorous visualization of “The Escalator”, which I call “The Rocket”. 

h/t to WUWT reader Mark Eastaugh
Note: Some readers in comments apparently are just too serious, and miss the humor and satire tags along with the headline. Just laugh, it’s funny. When we get claims like “the oceans will boil” and temperature rises of 6C by the end of the century all you can do is make fun of it.
Here’s more examples of rocketing temperatures:

Antarctic Melt Alarm by the AWI …at -93°C!
By EIKE meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
On August 10, 2010, a new record cold was measured in Antarctica [1]: -93.2°C. Thus the previous record of -89.2°C set at the Vostok Research Station on 21 July 1983 was smashed by 4°C. The annual mean temperature in Antarctica at ice sheet at elevations of 2000 to over 4000 metres range from -30 to -50°C, and the trend is downward [2]. Now the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has announced in a press release [3]: “A record retreat in the ice sheets“. Can ice sheets melt at such record low temperatures? Has the AWI discovered some new physical law?
In the AWI release the following amazing thing can be read:

Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, have for the first time extensively mapped Greenland’s and Antarctica’s ice sheets with the help of the ESA satellite CryoSat-2 and have thus been able to prove that the ice sheets of both regions are momentarily declining at an unprecedented rate.”

These ice sheets mainly located in Greenland and Antarctica and are mostly around 3000 meters thick. On the Greenland ice sheet the annual mean temperatures are about -20°C, and -40°C in Antarctica. Antarctica is a huge polar continent, and Greenland is an island (peninsula) with a latitude range of 10°- 30° from the Pole and borders on the Arctic ocean. This is one explanation for the considerable temperature and climate differences. While Greenland has marginally lost ice during the summer over the last 20 years, the change in ice volume in Antarctica is very much in dispute [4] and hardly measureable with the needed accuracy (Fig. 1).

Figure 1  Trends in ice ice mass [5].
Only a small part of Antarctica has lost mass
Contrary to the claims made by the AWI, there are also satellite evaluations concluding that there has been a positive ice mass gain in Antarctica (Fig. 2):

Figure 2  Antarctic ice growth. [6]
Interesting in the release are the AWI claims about the “somewhat hidden” limitations for Antarctica:

The rate of loss for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has tripled for the same time period“

and

The scientists observed the most rapid elevation changes…at the Pine-Island-Glacier in Western Antarctica.” 

and

But: while the glaciers in Western Antarctica and on the Antarctic peninsula are shrinking, the ice sheet of Eastern Antarctica grew– however at such a minimal amount that the growth was unable to compensate for the loss on the other side of the continent.”

Firstly, here once again the Antarctic Peninsula and Western Antarctica – where the Pine Island Glacier is located – are being used as the poster child for the dramatic ice loss and for climate change. Unfortunately it has long been known that the ice calving and the melting there are related meteorological reasons: cyclic changes in the West-Wind-Drift (storms) and with associated sea currents [7]. The result: Almost the entire Antarctic continent has gotten colder over the past 30 years. The only exception is the Antarctic Peninsula.
West Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsula melt due to cycles
This is because the Antarctic Peninsula in located in the west wind zone of the southern hemisphere. This southern hemisphere wind belt is subject to stochastic cyclic atmospheric pressure variations, as is the case with all other global wind systems. This is analogous to the northern hemispheric North Atlantic Oscillation NAO). In the southern hemisphere it is known as the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO).
At the site “Wetter-Lexikon” (Weather Dictionary) [8] it is defined as:

The Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) is the fluctuation of the atmospheric pressure between the 40° south and 65° south latitudes. That means that this oscillation is defined by atmospheric pressure difference over the South Pole and the South Tropical regions. The strength of the AAO has an impact on the wind regime at the middle and upper latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The AAO influences the climate over a large part of the southern hemisphere, for example Antarctica, Australia, and the southern parts of South America.
The AAO index is computed from the atmospheric pressure differences. When the AAO is negative, then the cold high predominates over Antarctica. The polar east winds blow strongly around the South Pole. …. In the positive phase the west current shifts southwards so that more rain than normal falls in the southern part of South America and in Australia. Moreover mild air can reach down to the Antarctic coast.”

This means the Antarctic Peninsula can be affected!
This peninsula, including the South Shetland Island, is located in the west between 60°-75°S, and thus in the much feared cyclone zone of the Roaring Forties and Shrieking Sixties.

Figure 3: Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). [10]
Before about 1980 there was a dominance of meridional weather patterns, a time when zonal weather patterns predominated. That meant a strengthening of the westwind circulation and thus storm activity. At the same time milder air from the Pacific was led to the Antarctic Peninsula. Thus storms with mild air were led from the Pacific and resulted in ice meting processes. Moreover, higher waves mechanically broke up the ice. Here in recent times was the ice break at the Wilkins Ice Shelf at the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula [9]. The causes are meteorological and have nothing to do with a “climate catastrophe”.
When it comes to climate, the Antarctic Peninsula is only 1% of the Antarctic area.
So where is the accelerated sea level rise?
Despite all the uncertainties mentioned above, the AWI still comes to the following result:

When one calculates both together, the volume of both ice sheets is shrinking by 500 cubic kilometers per year.”

This of course would have to lead to an acceleration in sea level rise which one could observe. However, there has been no detected sea level rise acceleration! A very thorough overview of the latest peer-review publications [11] in fact reaches the opposite result:

Numerous evaluations of coastal tide gauges over 200 years as well as the gravity measurements of the GRACE satellite deliver again and again a sea level rise of about 1.6 mm/yr. … Here…the trends are in agreement: The sea level rise has been linear for at least the last 100 years; there is no acceleration in sea level rise. A signal indicating man-made CO2 (AGW) is nowhere to be seen. This stands in stark contradiction to the claims and especially the alarmist prognoses of the IPCC and some climate institutes.”

Two other facts on ice that were glossed over (avoided?) in the AWI press release:
1. In Antarctica there is a “100-year record” maximum sea ice extent [12]:

The sea ice around Antarctica has steadily increased since satellite measurements began in 1979 and in June, 2014, (peak of the Antarctic winter) reached a new record with respect to total area.”

2. At its current condition, the Arctic sea ice will reach its low late-summer peak in September, and will be well above the minima of the last years:

AWI’s own Antarctic station has measured a cooling trend
Finally, in a release [14], the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) also itself announced a 30-year cooling trend at its Neumayer-Station (70°S). According to the definition of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this is a climate trend. The AWI wrote:

The meteorological observatory at the Neumayer-Station III is an official climate observation station of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research…has been measuring daily the air temperature in Antarctica for 30 years.”

The AWI published the result in a chart with a linear regression trend (Fig. 5):
        
Figure 5: Temperature cooling trend at the NEUMAYER Station [14].
However the formulation used by the AWI to describe that cooling trend is quite peculiar (deceptive?):

A result of the long-term research: At the Neumayer-Station it has not gotten warmer over the last three decades.”

Indeed not! It has in fact gotten colder there. Why did they use the blurred formulation “not warmer” when the scientific finding on this AWI dataset is clear? Also at the Neumayer-Station there is an Antarctic climate trend showing cooling.
Most of Antarctica is cooling – not warming as the AWI implies
There are even more peculiar AWI formulations:

This development however is a regional change and the measurements from the Neumayer-Station III do not in any way represent the global climate changes.”

Here the question that comes to mind is: What is that supposed to be about?
Who could ever get the idea that a regional or a local temperature trend would allow conclusions to be drawn for global trends? Or should nobody get the idea that global warming” is not even global?
There are also other peculiarities in the AWI release:

Only at the center of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer.”

The Neumayer-Station (with its cooling trend) is located at 70°S, i.e. far away from the “center” of Antarctica. There it has gotten colder. Moreover the measurements and facts presented here and provided in the footnotes below contradict what the AWI is claiming: “Only in the center of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer“.
With the excption of the Antarctic Peninsula (<1% of the Antarctic area) there is a cooling trend in Antarctica and it also includes the surrounding sea ice [15]:

Both the UAH and the RSS datasets [16] show that the temperature surrounding Antarctica has slipped a few tenths of a degree Celsius 0.1°C from 1979 to today. The temperature anomaly in both datasets has dropped below zero, i.e. below the long-term reference mean value.” 

Summary: 
Measurements in Antarctica show a secular cooling trend. The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula and a part of West Antarctica (approx. 1% of the Antarctic area). In 2010 a new all-time record cold was measured: -93.2°C. The sea ice floating around Antarctica reached “100-year record” daily highs in 2014. With these observations, how anyone could conclude there has been a “record ice sheet retreat” [3]  remains a secret of the AWI.

"**It is not yet known when all care home residents in Wales will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
But Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton could not say when care home residents would receive it due to storage temperature requirements.
Care home residents and staff are among those identified as a top priority.
Other priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s.
The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
But Dr Atherton said getting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress"" and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Initially it will have to be provided to a limited number of sites, he said.
""We're trying to find ways, even with this vaccine, to provide a more disseminated approach to distribution.
""There are of course other vaccines in the pipeline - the Oxford vaccine for example which doesn't have such stringent requirements around temperature management and control.
""As that comes online, as we hope, that will that will give us a further ability to work our way through those priority lists.""
Dr Atherton added: ""I can't give you an exact date or a time frame, but we're working through that process as quickly as we can.
""Because those elderly residents, usually elderly in care homes, are one of our highest priorities.""
Everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr Atherton said, adding it would be ""a massive undertaking"".
Vaccines for younger people will be available after the over-50s have had their jabs, according to Gill Richardson, who chairs the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board.
Dr Richardson said the Welsh Government was taking steps to ensure the vaccination programme did not affect other NHS services.
""People will be invited to come and have the vaccine through the NHS - we'll be holding special vaccine clinics to make sure people can receive the jab, while keeping normal NHS services free to see people,"" she said at the Welsh Government press briefing.
""The vaccine is the best way to protect people, but no-one will be forced to have it if they don't want it,"" Dr Richardson said.
Dr Atherton added that a Public Health Wales survey had shown that 70% of people would be willing to have the vaccine, and 60% would want their children to have it.
There are plans for people who have had a jab to be given a record card but it is not anticipated that hospitality businesses in Wales will turn away people who cannot prove they have been vaccinated, according to Dr Richardson.
""We hope that people will come and have this extremely precious and significant commodity for free of their own volition, but there's no compulsion,"" she said.
The Welsh Government said two areas had been identified as appropriate delivery sites for the vaccine and local health boards would collect the vaccines directly from these sites.
Dr Richardson declined to say where the sites were, but added: ""We have looked very carefully at all the storage parameters and also ease of distribution so we can get this vaccine out as swiftly as possible to the immunisers who will need it in each of the health boards and trusts.""
People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are in the schedule and risk, it added.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Today's news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel...
""We must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus - regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.""
Dr Richardson said serious side effects from the new vaccine were ""extremely rare"".
She said people might get a sore arm or occasionally a raised temperature, but ""it's a very safe vaccine"".
She added that the ""safety profiles"" were ""really good"" for the elderly and those that have clinical conditions.
""We are extremely pleased to be offering what we feel is a very safe vaccine to the Welsh population,"" she added.
Dr Atherton said it was not yet known whether the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus.
He said it is known from data submitted by the company ""it's pretty good"" at stopping people getting infected and having serious infections.
""We just don't know yet whether it will stop transmission,"" he told the press briefing.
""That will only be known to us in the fullness of time when vaccines are rolled out.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""This is fantastic news and is what we have all been waiting forâ¦ it is vaccines like this one that will give us the protection needed to reclaim our lives.""
Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster and MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said the news was ""fantastic"" and there was ""a cloud beginning to lift"", especially for those in care homes and people who have been isolated.
""There's this prospect of being reunited with loved ones,"" she said. ""We really need some hope. It's such good news.""
Conservative MS for Aberconwy Janet Finch-Saunders said she had no concerns about the plans for the mass vaccination.
""The concern was always about whether a vaccine could be found and whether it would be approved, so today is a good day,"" she said.
As the NHS prepares for a challenging winter, with the additional pressures of delivering the vaccine, staff welcomed the news.
Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital who had coronavirus earlier this year, said: ""Excellent news and reflects the immense efforts and superb work undertaken by the medical research community.""
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, as two shots are needed.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade."
"WASHINGTON  —   Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don’t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  —   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  —   might not really be one of them. “The country doesn’t need saving,” Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. “I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,” he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. “Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. ” He added: “No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  —   from our perspective  —      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. ” Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president’s “drain the swamp” initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  —   inside and outside Congress  —   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. “Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,” Mr. McConnell recalled. “But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. “It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell’s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. “We have had very good unity on our side,” Mr. McConnell said. “People are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don’t find any decision that he has made surprising. ” He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. “A lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?” Mr. McConnell said. “He used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. ” It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president’s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell’s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. “It is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,” Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party’s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. “Sooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,” Mr. McConnell said. “Hopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. ” His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?"
"

Avert your eyes, believe me; it’s for your own safety. You may be blinded by the sight of Ms Ardern displaying her ‘international leadership’ credentials, because from what I know of them they won’t cover very much at all. Here’s hoping, fingers crossed, she reveals herself behind a screen rather than in front of one.



In a piffle-esque puff-piece propagandising Ardern’s contribution to humanity and laughably labelled “[Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s UN leadership challenge](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115877600/prime-minister-jacinda-arderns-un-leadership-challenge)” Stuff’s Luke Malpass toffees the big apple with this over-sugary spin:



“The prime minister has secured an important bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump. Tick **.”**



Well; isn’t Luke just the master of important-sounding words – a ‘bilateral meeting’ – gosh, I wonder what a unilateral meeting would look like; just Jacinda standing alone in a room talking to herself? Although the truth is that it would do about as much good. 



Mr Malpass immediately continues:



“But the substantial parts of her agenda – climate change and the Christchurch Call […]”



And that very stupid sentence perfectly encapsulates the far-Left’s agendas and attitudes. A meeting with the leader of the strongest economy in the world, a great opportunity to pitch for increased access to a lucrative market is ‘important’, but not the ‘substantial’ reason for Ardern’s visit to what, she imagines, is her own personal Glee Club at the wretched and rotten forum known as United Nations.



Her condescension towards President Trump was well-framed by Newshub’s Jamie Ensor:



“Jacinda Ardern may have revealed her feelings about US President Donald Trump by burying the announcement she’s meeting him near the bottom of a press release […] Normally, these things would be sung from the rooftops. **Jacinda Ardern buried it at the very, very, very, very, very bottom of a press release**. Fourth paragraph from the bottom after basically everything else she is doing in Tokyo and New York.”



Leadership, that ain’t. Nor wisdom or professionalism, nor common courtesy; in fact it’s stupid, but stupid is as stupid does.



Mr Malpass gets to Ardern’s actual ‘message’ with a positively ghoulish preamble that, although entirely inappropriate, accurately sums up Ardern’s ambition to forge the Christchurch murders into a personal yardstick to measure her ‘leadership’ by:



“In foreign affairs-land the Christchurch Call is a big deal. New Zealand rarely leads on global initiatives of this kind, but the Christchurch massacre threw New Zealand into a position of global leadership which **Ardern intends to exploit**.”



Yes; you read that correctly – the saintly woman fully intends to ‘exploit’ a murderous rampage. I guess you gotta’ do what you gotta’ do; poor thing. I should feel sorry for her, but I don’t. 



I feel only contempt for the person sucked into an evil scheme euphemistically re-branded after the awful event in Christchurch but which was hatched by soul-less Macron of France a long time ago under the sinister but more accurate title “[esprit de vigilance constructive](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/remise-du-rapport-de-la-mission-de-regulation-des-reseaux-sociaux/)” – “the spirit of constructive vigilance”. It seeks to unleash citizen against citizen in a [battle of the snitches](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/snitches-unleashed/). Facebook only signed on to it to avoid the stand-over threats calling for the company’s break-up by the EU, engineered by France’s repugnant socialist bloc. 



Ardern is a simple pawn, just a useful idiot, in pushing these reprehensible proposals, the systematic and quintessentially socialist suppressions of free expression that she hopes to champion and take ‘credit’ for. 



I wish her nothing but complete failure, because, as with stupid, failure is as failure does. Attempting to burnish her moral and ‘leadership credentials’, and personal career options, on the bodies of the buried put down by a maniacal and extremely disturbed monster, a total stranger to the country where his crimes were committed, is the ultimate in failure. That’s neither morality nor leadership; it’s positively macabre.

"A lawsuit filed by Melania Trump depicts her heightened profile as a “unique,     opportunity” to make millions of dollars in business, once again raising questions about the relationship between President Trump’s official role and his family’s business interests. Mrs. Trump’s suit, filed on Monday in a New York State court, accuses The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, of libel for reporting last year on claims that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The new complaint does not refer explicitly to the White House or Mr. Trump, or even her status as a candidate’s wife when the article was published and now as first lady. Instead, it refers to opportunities she had “to launch a   commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multimillion dollar business relationships for a multiyear term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. ” Because of the Daily Mail article, it says, “plaintiff’s brand has lost significant value,” greatly reducing those opportunities. It claims $150 million in damages. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump said she was not trying to make money from her role as first lady. Mr. Trump has fended off criticism that his business dealings around the world create conflicts of interest in his official role, and he has put his adult sons in charge of his businesses rather than sell his assets or put them into a blind trust. On the day he took office, the White House altered its online biography of Mrs. Trump, after complaints that the original wording promoted her line of jewelry. The Daily Mail published its article on Mrs. Trump on Aug. 20, quoting from a report in a magazine in Slovenia, Mrs. Trump’s native country, and a book about her. She and her representatives have insisted that the claims it repeated are false. On Sept. 1, Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in a state court in Montgomery County, Md. and on the same day, the tabloid published a retraction. Last week, the Maryland court dismissed the case, saying it did not have jurisdiction. The new case against Mail Media, a corporation that operates the Daily Mail’s website, was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where the company has offices. Mrs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger, Webster Tarpley, who published claims like those cited by The Daily Mail. She settled that case on Tuesday, and her lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said in a statement that Mr. Tarpley had agreed to pay Mrs. Trump “a substantial sum as a settlement. ”"
"**Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are two of only three areas in England which will be in tier one from next Wednesday.**
MPs and businesses have welcomed the news and spoken of ""relief"" at ""the end of a difficult year"".
The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are the only areas in tier one.
One Cornwall MP warned against the grading being ""grounds for complacency"".
Amy Newland, from the White Hart pub in Chilsworthy, said: ""I'm extremely relieved, at least we know that we can trade normally.""
She added that she felt sorry for pubs in neighbouring Devon which will be under tougher tier two restrictions.
""It's mixed emotions but a huge relief for us,"" she said.
Paul Eaton, who runs the Royal Inn at Horsebridge, near Tavistock, just inside the Devon border, said: ""Some of my regulars are already planning where they can go in Cornwall.
""It's a long border, with pubs scattered both sides.""
Kim Conchie, chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said it had been ""a difficult year"" but this marked ""the first stage of securing jobs and companies for our future"".
Holiday homes letting agent Lin Wallis in Cornwall tweeted she had five inquiries in 10 minutes after the announcement.
In the seven days to last Saturday the rate of infections in Cornwall was 59 per 100,000 people, the England average was 169.
In the same period there were 337 new cases, down by 176 on the previous week.
Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, said Cornwall returning to tier one restrictions was ""particularly good news for the thousands of hospitality businesses"".
He added: ""However whilst we can welcome this news it should be no grounds for complacency.""
Tier one means people can meet indoors and out up to a maximum group of six, pubs and restaurants can re-open, closing at 23:00 GMT but people will still be encouraged to work from home.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December."

Jacinda’s reception at the UN this year was not as starlit as it was in 2018. She was a novelty last year. The gloss does seem to be wearing off nowadays for Jacinda, as she pursues pet projects such as trying to control the internet, which nobody other than her, thinks has any realistic chance of succeeding. She has also been put in charge of a climate committee, which would probably be considered as a huge honour if it were not for the fact that the other countries on the committee are… well… either small fry or hypocrites.



You decide.



What a triumph – no, what a joke this woman is!!



But Matthew Hooton in his weekly article in our favourite newspaper has called for Jacinda to return to earth and deal with some of the problems back home.



Tuesday’s Herald Mood of the Boardroom survey suggests a business community much glummer than recent data justifies.



Even though most indicators are heading in the wrong direction, NZIER’s consensus forecasts are still far from dire. Growth is expected to remain in the 2-3 per cent range for the next three years, unemployment will sit around 4 per cent and wages will rise faster than inflation, which will stay low but above zero.



Hooton takes a very optimistic approach to the economy in the short term. With the business policies of this government and the uncertain global position, it is quite likely that growth will fall away much more rapidly than he seems to think.



Despite this, the Mood of the Boardroom indicates the lowest business confidence since the global financial crisis. This is consistent with ANZ’s August business confidence survey, down another 8 points to negative 52 per cent, with firms’ own expectations also falling into negative territory.



Employment, investment and export intentions are all dismal. Even consumer confidence, which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern believes is more important, languishes below its historic average.



Consumer confidence does not always fall immediately, and with interest rates at historic lows, some confidence will be found in the fact that money has never been cheaper. But consumer confidence can turn on a dime.



The prevailing negative mood demands another explanation.



Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr and his Monetary Policy Committee must be among the villains. As the Mood of the Boardroom indicated, August’s surprise 0.50 per cut in the Official Cash Rate (OCR) to a mere 1 per cent was meant to boost the economy but ended up spooking investors.



Interest rates have fallen too low for further cuts to mean anything real. Besides, most people understand that very low interest rates do not indicate a healthy economy. They may be a nice-to-have, but they are not a sign of good times ahead. 



Most rowdily, farmers feel under attack on multiple fronts including the proposed Zero Carbon Bill, the planned inclusion of agriculture in the Emissions Trading Scheme and David Parker’s radical water quality reforms.  
This rural revolt has plunged agricultural confidence down to a horrifying negative 68 per cent even though farmers are the most positive group about their own activity. 



Similarly, the oil, gas and wider minerals industries may be completely wrong that August’s draft Government Resources Strategy and Cabinet paper on the review of the Crown Minerals Act indicates Ardern wants an end to all extractive industries in the very near future. 



Is Matthew Hooton being a touch sardonic here, do you think?



**The Government’s own recklessness is the chief cause of negative sentiment taking hold in these two major export earners.**



Got it in one.



For Ardern, the Mood of the Boardroom suggests the abject failure of KiwiBuild and the sluggishness of infrastructure projects have had a wider effect. Even the Government’s failure to shift the tax burden away from wages and operating profits towards capital gains sent an adverse message about competence.



Ardern should be concerned that junior minister Kris Faafoi, is ranked her Government’s top performer. While Faafoi has done a perfectly adequate job, what does his ranking suggest about the competence of the rest?



We all know the answer to that. They are a bunch of incompetent fools.



This matters. According to another leading polling firm, CT New Zealand, only 9 per cent of New Zealanders are very confident that Ardern’s team could competently manage a major economic downturn if — as seems likely — one is on its way from abroad. Nothing better explains the degree of economic disquiet. 



9%. Really? I am surprised that so many think her government is capable of anything.



Once again, Ardern has done a superb job on the world stage this week, charming even Trump. She urgently needs to apply those skills to instil a sense in New Zealand that her Government knows what it is doing domestically.



This is not primarily about her re-election, although it is of course linked. The real problem is that if Ardern can’t get New Zealand business out of the dumps, a dangerous decline in the actual economic outlook looks certain.



  
I don’t think she has done a superb job on the world stage this week. I think she was overshadowed by Greta Thunberg, which must hurt Jacinda badly. But it is time for Jacinda to focus on domestic issues. Building houses. Ihumateo. The flailing economy. Homelessness. **The Labour sex scandal.** There is plenty for her to focus on at home.



But as we all know, Jacinda is the mistress of nothing more than photoshoots. She is incapable of doing anything real. Even at the UN this year, she has been downgraded from person of interest to minor celebrity.



It is true that Jacinda needs to deal with problems at home, but there is little chance of her doing it. She is simply incapable of doing anything real. She has no idea how to solve any of the problems that we are beset with today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFrank Bosse at Die kalte Sonne here puts the spotlight on a global warming forecast published by some British MetOffice scientists in 2007. It appeared in Science here.
The peer-reviewed paper was authored by Doug M. Smith and colleagues under the title: “Improved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model“.
Using sophisticated methods, the target of the paper was to forecast the temperature development from 2004 to 2014 while taking the internal variability into account.
The claims made in Smith’s study are loud and clear (my emphasis):
…predict further warming during the coming decade, with the year 2014 predicted to be 0.30° ± 0.21°C [5 to 95% confidence interval (CI)] warmer than the observed value for 2004. Furthermore, at least half of the years after 2009 are predicted to be warmer than 1998, the warmest year currently on record.“
The first chart shows their forecast:

Figure 1: Decadal forecast by Smith et al. (2007) for 2004 to 2014 (Source: Figure 4 of the a.m. paper).
Now that it’s 2014 and the observed data are in, we can compare to see how Smith et al did with their forecast. Boy, did they fail!
The following chart shows the actual result of the Smith et al forecast, showing the real observations since 1998:

Figure 2: Observed temperature development as to the MetOffice’s own data HadCRUT4 compared to the claims made in the Smith et al paper. The lower black line shows the linear trend of the observed results. The blue-gray lines show the confidence range of the forecast. The red line shows the linear trend of Smith et al. Chart modified from DkS. 



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Clearly we see that the Met Office observations show a cooling of 0.014°C over the 2004-2014 decade and is below even the forecast lower confidence limit. Moreover not a single year was warmer than 1998, despite having predicted at least three would be warmer.
According to Bosse, when the 2007 chart was published it was supposed to act as another nail in the coffin for global warming skeptics. The chart was even adopted by a German report titled: “Future information for the government.” Bosse writes:
Here one reads that ‘good decadal forecasts for policymaking and economy are very useful’ (page 6) … as long as they are ignored, one might add.”
Bosse calls the chart a fiasco because it falsely advised policymaking. Bosse adds:
Until today, since the first IPCC report of 1990, they have not made any progress when it comes to the central theme of climate prognoses: How many degrees Celsius of warming results from a doubling of Co2 concentration?”
Bosse writes that the 2007 Smith et al forecast failed neither to take known ocean cycles nor natural factors sufficiently into account and writes that the climate sensitivity value assumed by the IPCC must be reduced.
Now that 2007 is some years behind us, even Smith et al have realized their forecast was overinflated and so they produced a new paper which appeared last year. The latest by Smith has taken natural variability more into account and he is much more careful with prophecy-making. Still, the range of uncertainty the new paper offers makes it “more or less useless”, Bosse writes.

Figure 3: Latest forecast by Smith et al for global temperature until 2022 (Figure 8 of the aforementioned paper)
 Bosse concludes:
As long as man is unable to determine with the needed precision the role natural variability plays in our observed climate, calculating the impact of greenhouse gases will remain prophecy. Do you feel guilty that you are still using incandescent light bulbs? Don’t fret over it!
We’ll be revisiting Smith’s newest forecast in about 5 years time. In the meantime we have to ask ourselves if these people will ever learn. Science can take only so much damage.

"**The government hopes to start distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine imminently.**
However, the vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work?
In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan.
The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium.
It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given.
Pfizer has developed a special transport box the size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened.
Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose.
The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times.
His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice.
The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has said it is committed to meeting demand.
The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time.
In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details.
As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it.
Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators.
The situation in developing countries is even more tenuous.
Burkina Faso, in central Africa, reported last month that it was already short of about 1,000 clinical fridges.
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with UN children's agency Unicef, has an ongoing project mapping cold storage facilities in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Unicef wants to have 65,000 solar-powered cold fridges installed in low-income countries by the end of 2021."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump loves to set the day’s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump’s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another   day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a   empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. “We are moving big and we are moving fast,” Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. “We didn’t come here to do small things. ” But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable   president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. “What are we going to do about this?” Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president’s, said: “I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody’s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. ” “I personally think that they’re missing the big picture here,” Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump’s staff. “Now he’s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. ” One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to   but said the president’s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. “This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It’s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,” said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush’s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters  —   an important source of feedback and validation  —   and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day  —   too much in the eyes of some aides  —   often offering a bitter    of critics like CNN’s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. “Did you hear that, this guy thinks it’s been terrible!” Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club,    posting Twitter messages angrily  —   and in personal terms  —   about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a   checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president’s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump’s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump’s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan  —   whom he once described as “the enemy” and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded  —   a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can  —   for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. “The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,” Mr. Christie said. “The fact is that he’s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. ” In the past few days, Mr. Trump’s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of   an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. “This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president’s agenda. ” As part of Mr. Trump’s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump’s    management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in    combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway’s other duties as a   adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office   privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media  —   although he recently upgraded the   TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie  —   though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer’s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the décor  —   it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an   backdrop  —   so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a   developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump’s desk is a small    photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump."

I honestly cannot see the point of the Zero Carbon Bill. For a country that produces 0.17% of global emissions, and whose farmers are the most efficient and productive in the world, it just makes no sense. Why hamstring our economy for a rate of emissions that would make no difference even if they were eradicated altogether?



Unfortunately, the eco-warriors in the Green party do not see things that way, as you might expect. But thankfully, they may find themselves alone this time. 



The Government’s plan to [make farmers pay for their emissions](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/114267785/farmers-exempt-from-95-percent-of-emissions-charges-under-new-proposed-rules) **is on shaky ground** after Labour, the Greens, and NZ First have failed to agree on proposals.   
A draft scheme went to the environment, energy and climate cabinet committee, but failed to make it through after **ministers could not agree on it.**  
It has now stalled at the cabinet committee stage, while ministers work to agree on a plan. 



Well, how about that? I cannot deny feeling relieved, but what I hate about this inept government is the time and money that is wasted putting draft bills together, only to have their coalition partners throw a spanner in the works. They behave as if money grows on trees when, actually, it grows on taxpayers.



The news comes after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave the keynote address to a [climate change action summit at the United Nations in New York.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/116033750/pm-jacinda-ardern-calls-climate-change-perfect-trade-opportunity-in-optimistic-un-speech)



Well, it was only a 3-minute speech, and she can always claim she knew nothing – she is good at that.



Agriculture has been exempt from the emissions trading scheme (ETS) since it was created in 2008. The exemption is controversial as agriculture is New Zealand’s largest emitter, responsible for nearly half of total emissions. 



It does not seem right, however, to make life more expensive for food producers, especially as our economy is so dependent on them. Most other countries, such as the EU, have significant subsidies for their farmers, but we don’t. Ours stand on their own in every way. 



Senior ministers are concerned that the Government is **facing an agricultural revolt** as farmers grapple with a raft of stringent new regulations on water quality and environmental degradation announced by [Environment Minister David Parker](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115571186/environment-minister-david-parker-promises-to-clean-up-new-zealands-summer-swimming-spots).

**There is no suggestion at this stage that scheme is dead in the water.** Back tracking on introducing agriculture to the ETS would be a significant backdown for the Government, which had promised it would finally bring an end to the exemption. 



It might be dead in the water or watered down so much that it will be both unrecognisable and unpalatable to Green supporters. Time will tell, but let us just say that it is not exactly plain sailing at the moment… for the Greens, that is.



The deal that was eventually struck between the Greens, Labour and NZ First was that agriculture would be brought into the scheme if the Interim Climate Change Committee (ICCC) recommended it.  
But **NZ First managed to negotiate a sweetheart deal for the sector,** meaning that whatever recommendation was made, agriculture would only pay for 5 per cent of the total cost of emissions.  
Advice drawn up by the Government found this would add a charge of $0.01c per kg of milk solid, 0.01c per kg of beef, $0.03c per kg of sheep meat, and $0.04c per kg of venison at the current ETS prices.   
[The ICCC finally reported back in July](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/114267785/farmers-exempt-from-95-percent-of-emissions-charges-under-new-proposed-rules), recommending that farmers should enter the scheme under a special “levy and rebate” scheme.   
The recommendations were shopped around farmers at a series of roadshows which ended on August 13. After that the policy was refined and sent to cabinet committee.   
Some details of the scheme were agreed to last week, but there are still enough outstanding problems for the scheme not to progress beyond committee stage. 



This all sounds okay, but don’t forget David Parker’s water schemes and also the debacle that is Fonterra at the moment. The government cannot be blamed for Fonterra, but the last thing they want to do is to anger farmers even further. Most New Zealanders support the agricultural sector. We know we would be considerably poorer as a country without it.



Climate Change Minister **James Shaw hopes the bill will pass with the support of the National Party,** who supported it at first reading. 



  
Not on your life. James Shaw demonstrates both political naivety and climate stupidity if he thinks National will support this bill when his own coalition partners will not. He really does live in a parallel universe, doesn’t he?



What a slap in the face for the Greens. But, to quote the late Windsor Davies…



Oh dear. How sad. Never mind.

Guest essay by Rob Bradley
Rice’s Baker Institute Climate Embarrassment (Sass’s ad hominem response to Rep. Smith)
“The Baker Institute has some truing up to do in the multi-disciplinary field of climate change. Playing to its strengths, Rice University and Baker should host its third climate conference, titled something like ‘New Developments in the Physical Science of Climate Change.’
[Professor] Ronald Sass in his recent op-ed called for an ‘open, national debate on climate change.’ May Rice University and the Baker Institute lead the way.”
The Houston Chronicle this week ran opposing opinion-page editorials on the climate-change issue, one by Lamar Smith of the U.S. House of Representatives and the other by Ronald Sass, Fellow in Global Climate Change at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.

Politician Smith politely makes multi-disciplinary arguments assuming the best intentions of his opponents. Academic Sass goes ad hominem on the Keystone XL pipeline issue and refers vaguely to a scientific consensus for his position.
This, unfortunately, is not atypical. Under gatekeeper Neal Lane, the Baker Institute has refused to allow fair, open debate about natural versus anthropogenic climate forces and has championed sky-is-falling government activism. For example, Lane/Baker:

Killed publication of the proceedings of a fair climate-change conference held in 2000 with, for example, Patrick Michaels and James Hansen participating;
Held a high-priced, widely publicized, assume-alarmist-science conference in 2008, Beyond Science: The Economics and Politics of Responding to Climate Change, featuring John Kerry and John Holdren on the political side.
Refused to host a climate forum/debate in 2010 between Gerald North (Texas A&M) and Richard Lindzen (MIT), which ended up being co-sponsored by Rice’s Shell Center for Sustainability and the Center for the Study of Environment and Society.

New paper finds that aging weather stations record much higher daytime temperatures, 1.63°C higher than new stations
While we are all watching the heat wave developing in the US southwest, here is something to consider. Albedo on the surfaces of weather station shelters changes with time, something I and the volunteers have documented with the Surface Stations project. For example, here’s a aged weather station where the whitewash coating is coming off and the bare wood is becoming exposed:
Back in 2007, Pat Michaels wrote in an American Spectator column “Not so Hot“:
“Weather equipment is very high-maintenance. The standard temperature shelter is painted white. If the paint wears or discolors, the shelter absorbs more of the sun’s heat and the thermometer inside will read artificially high. But keeping temperature stations well painted probably isn’t the highest priority in a poor country.”
Now there is proof that changes in station shield surfaces affect temperature
A paper published  in the International Journal of Climatology finds that aging of the solar radiation screens on weather stations is causing a large positive bias in measured temperatures of 1.63°C, which by way of comparison is more than twice the global warming of 0.7°C recorded since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850.

According to the authors, “During the comparison [of the new vs. 5 year old] and 1 to 3-year-old screens, significant temperature differences were recorded at different times of the day. The differences, wider than the uncertainty amplitude, demonstrate a systematic effect. The temperature measured with the older screen is larger, and the maximum instantaneous difference was 1.63 °C (for 0–5 years comparison) in daytime hours.
During night-time the two AWS’s measure the same temperature (within the uncertainty amplitude). This behaviour, increasing with increasing solar radiation intensity and decreasing with increasing wind speed, is attributed to a radiative heating effect. The screen ageing has compromised the shield effectiveness introducing a significant change in the temperature evaluation.” The paper is yet another blow to the unreliable, biased, and highly upward-adjusted temperature record.
The paper: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.3765/abstract
Comparative analysis of the influence of solar radiation screen aging on temperature measurements by means of weather stations DOI: 10.1002/joc.3765
G. Lopardo et al
Abstract:
Solar radiation screens play a key role in automatic weather stations (AWS) performances. In this work, screen ageing effects on temperature measurements are examined. Paired temperature observations, traceable to national standards and with a well-defined uncertainty budget, were performed employing two naturally ventilated weather stations equipped with identical sensors and different only for their working time. Three different tests were carried out employing different aged AWSs: a 5-year-old AWS (AWS5) was compared with a new device (AWS0), a 1 year old (AWS1) was compared with both a 3 years old (AWS3) and a new one devices (AWS00). Due to solar and weather conditions exposure a degradation of the screen reflective coating is evident for the older AWSs (5 and 3 years old) and so a qualitative estimation of how different conditions of ageing affect the temperature drift was done.
During the comparison 0 to 5 and 1 to 3-year-old screens, significant temperature differences were recorded at different times of the day. The differences, wider than the uncertainty amplitude, demonstrate a systematic effect. The temperature measured with the older screen is larger, and the maximum instantaneous difference was 1.63 °C (for 0–5 years comparison) in daytime hours. During night-time the two AWS’s measure the same temperature (within the uncertainty amplitude). This behaviour, increasing with increasing solar radiation intensity and decreasing with increasing wind speed, is attributed to a radiative heating effect. The screen ageing has compromised the shield effectiveness introducing a significant change in the temperature evaluation. 
The experimental results of a further comparison, between 0- and 1-year-old screens, confirm the same conclusion showing a negligible ageing effect, within the uncertainty amplitude.

Gosh, is there anything it can’t do?
People send me stuff. I would not have believed this unless I saw it from Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, where I constantly wonder what sort of reality those people inhabit. See the yellow highlight. 

Maybe the guy is being tongue in cheek, maybe he’s dead serious, it is hard to tell. But, this sort of messaging is probably something that resonates with the caliber of people who would buy into Gore’s version of reality in the first place.
With messagaging like this, I think my first take on it still holds: Al Gore’s ‘Reality Drop’ is a bomb – so let’s give him a ‘hockey stick

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe days of an open welcome to “environmentally-friendly” wind parks in Germany are over.
When the turbines were small-scale and novel, people were generally open to them. But now that they have reached skyscraper dimensions, have proven to be unsightly, and have demonstrated poor performance, they are not welcome anymore.

German developers plan to install 60 wind turbines, each 700-foot tall, in one of Central Europe’s last remaining untouched regions, the Palantinate Forest, a UN designated natural monument. Photo beauty-places.com/palatinate-forest
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the picturesque southwest German region of Palatinate, where the online Die Welt here reports on the mounting fierce opposition that wind turbine developers are facing. The developers have their sights aimed at the hilltops of Germany’s fairy-tale-like Palatinate forest…an area that has been designated by UNESCO as a natural treasure and biosphere reserve. Here they hope to install wind parks with skyscraper-dimensioned turbines. Die Welt writes of the area:
It was the first cross-border natural reservation of this type in all of Europe because it also includes the Alsatian mountain range. Not very many Germans know that it is the largest uninterrupted landscape in Central Europe. Whoever wishes to see it, had better hurry up.”
850,000 sq m of virgin forest to be cleared
According to Die Welt, hungry wind park developers with deep pockets plan to install 60 wind turbines, each 209 meters (700 feet) tall in the area. Unsurprisingly this looming large-scale green industrialization of this particularly idyllic landscape has become too much to take, even for the most avid climate activist groups. Die Welt writes that for the first time all ten local environmental groups have closed ranks against the project, says Bernd Wallner of the Pfälzerwald-Verein (Palantinate Association). Opponents are rallying, calling it a matter of “homeland defense”.
Die Welt provides the technical details of the monster-size turbines: Each blade is 60 meters long and they will need elaborate roads to allow their transport to the site where they are to be installed. Each turbine will require 3000 tonnes of concrete and 100 tonnes of steel. In total 200,000 tonnes of concrete and 130,000 cubic meters of gravel will have to be hauled in by 60,000 trips by heavy cargo vehicles, which will involve the burning of 600,000 liters of diesel fuel and the clearing of 850,000 square meters of virgin forest.

Like putting turbines on Ayer’s Rock!
Environmentalists are fuming. Opponents accuse the wind turbine developers and the local and state authorities of covering up the environmental costs and impacts of the project and misleading the public. Critics say the senselessness of the project is tantamount to putting wind turbines on Ayers Rock.
Unrealistic profit projections used to “bait the public”
Opponents also accuse the wind park developers of putting out overly optimistic figures for expected wind turbine performance in order to bait the public. Die Welt writes:
Ernst Gerber believes the promises of profitability, with which investors and local representatives are being baited, are estimates from a naïve milkmaid: ‘Despite the subsidies, things are moving towards the lower limits of profitability.'”
Die Welt itself characterizes the promise of profitability made by the wind park developers as “rotten”, and that the region is one that is “low in wind”.
Threat to wildlife…violates the law
The wind park opponents also say that the monster turbines are a threat to wildlife and birds. What’s more, turbine critic Rainer Becker thinks they would violate the law, “The construction of the wind parks are clearly in violation of the existing laws and the international species protection act“.
Other opponents claim that big business and power companies in Luxemburg are ramming the projects through and ignoring the wishes of the local inhabitants, Die Welt writes.

 **Burn, Hollywood, Burn**  
A regular review by John Black



With the recent release of _Rambo: Last Blood_ and its critical mauling for daring to feature a violent and vengeful 73 year old man (the _Guardian_ called it an ‘enlarged prostate of a movie’; imagine if someone had called _Thelma and Louise_ a ‘diseased uterus of a movie’), I have decided to share my ‘Top 5 Grumpy Old Man Revenge Movies’ as a general ‘up yours’ to such ageist misandry.



My only criteria have been they must feature an old guy (at least 60 years old when the movie was released) with attitude and seeking vengeance of a violent nature. If you have your own suggestions, please let me know in the comments below.



5\. MACHETE



Let’s start with pure popcorn. Danny Trejo was 66 and a jobbing actor with a face like a dropped meat pie when he got his first starring role as ‘machete’ a real mean motor scooter who kills people …with a machete. But only after they really pissed him off by killing his wife in front of him…with a machete. Steven Seagal and (surprisingly) Robert De Niro play the bad guys.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Machete using a guy’s intestinal tract to abseil down a building.



4\. THE LIMEY (1999)



The only one in my list that could be confused with an art film. Former swinging sixties ace face Terence Stamp plays the enigmatic Wilson, a Brit gangster who travels to L.A. to find those responsible for his daughter’s death. Peter Fonda is Terry Valentine, the record producer sleaze whom Wilson thinks is responsible. It’s directed by Steven Soderberg who somehow finds the dark corners of the ever sunny L.A landscape. By the end Wilson is consumed by anger for the person really responsible for his daughter’s death – himself. Won praise at that year’s Cannes – but don’t worry it’s still worth a watch.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Wilson throwing Valentine’s heavy off a hilltop balcony.



3\. THE EQUALIZER



After his prostitute friend Alina is badly beaten by the Russian mafia, retired military intelligence officer McCall (Denzel Washington) takes them apart one vodka swilling goon at a time. That’s it basically. _Very_ loosely inspired by the famous Brit TV series.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: in the climactic scene set in a hardware store McCall gets very creative with a nail gun.



4\. HARRY BROWN



Michael Caine is the titular Harry, an ex-royal-marine who takes it personally when his fellow old codger and best mate Len gets it from some yoof on a London housing estate. Harry then sets about his civic duty by gunning down the vicious hoodlums who infest his neighbourhood. The Bill ain’t too happy about that. And neither are the gangsters. Controversial at the time because of Sir Michael’s real life championing of the law and order message of the film – as a former ‘sarf’ Londoner, he was shocked at how the area had declined. Some on the Left were [suddenly of the opinion that actors should keep out of politics](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/nov/16/michael-caine-ukcrime) – an opinion they seemed to have gotten over since Brexit, Trump, Climate Change etc. and all the luvvies being applauded for following the lefty line. 



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Harry giving a drug dealer a lecture on weapon maintenance (‘You have failed to maintain your weapon…son.’) before blowing him into next Thursday.



1\. GRAN TORINO



The platonic ideal of grumpy old men, Clint Eastwood, is Walt Kowalski, a hard-arse retired auto worker alienated from his family and aghast at all the ‘gooks’ moving into his neighbourhood. 



Walt, a Korean vet ends up defending the ‘gook’ family next door when they come under attack from gangbangers. He gives the wayward young man of the house, Thao, a crash course in manliness and together they make a stand against the hoods.



Probably the least violent of my pics but not if you accept the ‘language = violence’ concept of the radical Left. The film is brimming with pretty nasty ethnic slurs – mostly from Walt. There is a hilarious scene in a barber shop where Walt instructs Thao how to relate to other men using egalitarian ethnic jibes that every woke leftist should be forced to watch on a loop until they start voting for Trump. The radical ideas of the movie being that actions matter more than words and that rough working class men can actually be decent blokes. Shocking.



Why is it number one? Because Clint ‘Dirty Harry/The Man With No Name/The Unforgiven’ Eastwood, directed and starred in it, that’s why.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: the final confrontation with the gang.



Never shoot first.

KIRITAPU ALLAN to the Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government’s policies and actions?



Hon PAUL GOLDSMITH to the Minister of Finance: Does he stand by all of his statements, policies, and actions?



Hon JUDITH COLLINS to the Minister of Housing: What challenges and risks, if any, have been identified for the KiwiBuild programme?



Dr DEBORAH RUSSELL to the Minister of Finance: What recent reports has he seen on the New Zealand economy?



Dr SHANE RETI to the Associate Minister of Health: Does she stand by all her statements, policies, and actions regarding vaccination and the measles outbreak?

Hon Dr NICK SMITH to the Minister of Justice: Does he agree with concerns about the Referendums Frameworks Bill, such as from the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, “that ‘free and fair elections’ are a fundamental constitutional principle. One component of free and fair elections is that they are administered neutrally and impartially. This tells against giving the Executive a broad power to procure referendums and to frame the wording for such referendums.”?

At the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires today, the renegotiated NAFTA — in the U.S., the new agreement is referred to as the United States — Mexico — Canada Agreement, or USMCA — was signed by the three parties. The big question now is, what will Congress think of the agreement as it decides whether to ratify it? One aspect of this question is, what will the Democrats who now control the House think of it? And to get even more specific, I’m very curious to see what progressives think of it. While she is in the Senate rather than the House, Senator Elizabeth Warren may be a good indicator of what many progressives think. Yesterday, Senator Warren gave a speech at American University in which she set out “her vision for a progressive foreign policy that works for all Americans.” She covered a lot of ground, and I won’t go through all of it, but here is a key bit on trade policy:   




By the time the 2008 global financial crash came around, it only confirmed what millions of Americans already knew: the system didn’t work for working people — and it wasn’t really intended to.   
  
  
And it’s still not working. Tomorrow, the Trump Administration will likely sign a renegotiated NAFTA deal.   
  
  
There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. The federal government has certified that NAFTA has already cost us nearly a million good American jobs — and big companies continue to use NAFTA to outsource jobs to Mexico to this day.   
  
  
But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0.   
  
  
For example, NAFTA 2.0 has better labor standards on paper but it doesn’t give American workers enough tools to enforce those standards. Without swift and certain enforcement of these new labor standards, big corporations will continue outsourcing jobs to Mexico to so they can pay workers less.   
  
  
NAFTA 2.0 is also stuffed with handouts that will let big drug companies lock in the high prices they charge for many drugs. The new rules will make it harder to bring down drug prices for seniors and anyone else who needs access to life‐​saving medicine.   
  
  
And NAFTA 2.0 does little to reduce pollution or combat the dangers of climate change — giving American companies one more reason to close their factories here and move to Mexico where the environmental standards are lower. That’s bad for the earth and bad for American workers.   
  
  
For these reasons, I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and will vote against it in the Senate unless President Trump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families.   
  
  
…   
  
  
How can we make the system fair for working Americans? Lots of ways.   




Those four changes would fundamentally alter every trade negotiation. 



I disagree with most of her views on the impact of NAFTA, but putting that aside, what I’m curious about here is what it would take to get her to support the new NAFTA. I’ve read through her remarks a couple times now, and I still can’t figure out precisely what changes she wants and expects in NAFTA 2.0 in order to vote for it. First of all, the tax haven and monopoly issues are not likely to be addressed seriously through a trade agreement anytime soon, so we can ignore that part. On the other hand, the labor protections and worker issues are _already in_ the new NAFTA, and the Trump administration pushed for changes in this area that gave labor groups far more than President Obama’s Trans Pacific Partnership did. So what is Senator Warren’s goal with these statements? Is she laying the groundwork for a “no” vote on the agreement, regardless of any additions to the agreement the Trump administration might accept? Or are there changes on labor rights that would satisfy her and get her to vote in favor?   
  
  
My instinct is that she will not vote for any trade agreement negotiated by Trump, but we’ll see. Perhaps there is more potential with the younger progressives in Congress who are not as wedded to the economic nationalist views of senior Democrats. Has anyone asked Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez what she thinks of trade liberalization and whether there is a trade agreement she could support? I’m curious whether she and other young progressives who are open to immigration could also be open to trade. I’ve seen her sound skeptical about trade deals on Twitter, but now she will be governing rather than campaigning, and that could make her think more deeply about whether blocking trade with people in other contries is really a good policy.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
Scientists have known for decades that, as global carbon dioxide levels increase, so too does the standing biomass of the world’s plants. Carbon dioxide is a strong plant fertilizer.   
  
As plants grow better, they also increasingly act as carbon sinks as they convert atmospheric carbon dioxide, with a little help from water and sunshine, into carbohydrates stored as biomass. Some of that carbon is returned to the air annually through decomposition, but other portions are are stored for longer periods in the soil, downed logs, houses, etc. This plant-based carbon sink helps to offset the growth of global carbon dioxide emissions from human activities (primarily from the burning of fossil fuels). Together, the terrestrial carbon sink, along with the oceanic carbon sink, annually takes up more than half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions—and remarkably, as global CO2 emissions have increased, so too has the global CO2 sink.   
  
But now comes new evidence that plants may be helping to combat global warming through another mechanism as well, slowing the build-up of the atmospheric concentration of methane (a greenhouse gas some 25 times more effective than CO2 on a molecule-for-molecule bases at adding pressure for the world to warm).   
  
As shown in the fugure below the jump, the growth rate of the atmospheric concentration of methane (CH4)—which is projected by the IPCC to be rising rapidly—began slowing down in the early 1990s and even topped out for a few years in the mid-2000s. Since about 2007, the atmospheric concentration of CH4 has been rising again, but only at about half that of the pre-1990 rate.   






Figure 1. Atmospheric methane concentration (source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).This behavior is not understood by climate scientists. It contravenes alarmist scenarios of runaway global warming fueled by a positive methane feedback (the scenario for which is that warming leads to thawing of the arctic permafrost, which releases methane, which leads to more warming, and so on).   
  
A team of scientists from Lund University and Stockholm University set out to investigate recent claims that some plants release methane and are therefore a source of global methane emissions. They set up instruments to measure methane exchange on a collection of individual branches of four different tree species in a 100-year-old forest in central Sweden. A set of control experiments was also conducted in a laboratory setting. They just published their findings in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_. Much to their surprise, the researchers found that the trees (both in the field and in the lab) were _taking up_ methane rather than releasing it. They suggest that the presence of a “bacteria with the ability to consume [methane] would be a possible explanation for [the observed behavior].”   
  
That’s not the only good news.   
  
The researchers then executed the extremely risky (and oft ill-advised) maneuver of scaling up from a few tree branches in central Sweden to the level of the global forest canopy. Their research “indicates that the canopy might play an equally important role [in CH4 uptake] as the soil in the global context.” In other words, their results show that trees are playing a large (and hitherto unknown) role as a sink in the global methane cycle.   
  
The culprit? _Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide_.   
  
In the authors’ own words (with my emphasis): 



Two recent studies give alternative explanations to the slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane in the last decades. One of them indicates that it is due to a stabilization of fossil-fuel emissions (Aydin et al., 2011) whereas the other explains it by a decrease in microbial methane sources in the northern hemisphere (Kai et al., 2011). Our results offer a third explanation: _that an increasing amount of CH4 has been taken up_ _by vegetation during the last decades as a consequence of increased greenness (Myneni et al., 1997), NPP [net primary production] (Nemani et al., 2003) and GPP [gross primary production] (Chen et al., 2006) as observed by satellite remote sensing._



This is still highly a highly speculative result and one that will require a heck of a lot more study and independent confirmation. But it is a novel finding and goes to show that there is still a lot of interesting research ongoing in the field of climate (change), and that most definitely the science is not “settled.”

Meet the Plonkers.



Plonker-in-Chief is an Austrian-born socialist control-freak with a mental disorder. I’m not sure the world is ready for another one of those.



Nevertheless, she is here, ready to cripple the capital’s transport movements on Monday, extolling her charges to face arrest if necessary, to further her intellectually-stunted world-view and create ‘rebellion’. She is a self-described ‘pre-traumatic stress disorder sufferer’ and ‘activist’. Sea Rottman (although faux-tivist may be a better description), of ‘Extinction Rebellion’ is determined to disrupt Wellington this coming Monday.



Faux-tivist Rottman earns that title for her willingness to encourage her simpleton followers to face arrest in the name of climate-crisis. **But – she is unwilling to risk that same outcome for herself,** because for Precious, “It would be career-limiting if I was … arrested or convicted”. Poor thing. She ‘has to travel internationally’ for her work, spraying exhaust fumes all over her arrested followers in her wake as she jets off overseas to plan for a fossil-fuel-free world by 2025. I kid you not.



The faux-tivist hypocrite plans to disrupt our commute, to protest ‘carbon’, but recommends her fondlings, can you believe it, use a car, catch a bus, take the train or ferry to protest. I tell no lie:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8fe1c11dda9574151efec42a3a0f0f7da100092295b9a6e3a9595f348d00dea1.png)



The clown apparently sees no irony whatsoever in this. Surely she should be extolling the dumpty-doo’s that plan to disrupt our day in order to save the world from deadly carbon, to run, jog, scoot, hop, cycle, crawl or simply walk to protest, allowing them to experience what a fossil-fuel-free world will feel like.



But then again, catching a pic of the behemoth, I suspect she’s not a huge fan of walking. Don’t get me wrong, she is huge and I just strongly suspect vigorous exercise is not her thing:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0ab80ee96ed041e9f9883142e36cb4d9713b0b1ebd9b99119d095f10527f93.png)



When her majestic largesse claims “my aim is to make a difference and influence people to be more aware or reducing consumption” I think she actually seeks to ensure there’s more left over for her own plate, the underlying motive of most socialist mickey-mouthpieces.



Our hysterical faux-tivist is **so very concerned about rising sea-levels that she lives right next to the beach** at Wellington’s very lowest-lying place: Moa Point. She’s not even trying to hide her massive hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance. How do even the utterly stupid fall for these side-show charlatans?



She’s claiming to be anti-extinction but I propose the only extinction she possibly faces is falling asleep on the little beach opposite her house and being claimed as taonga by local iwi arriving with a chainsaw to take out her lower jaw.



Transport for me, but not for thee. Consumption for me, but not for thee. Arrest for thee, but not for me. She is truly world-class plonkery writ large. Very large.

"He is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3, 500. Perhaps that’s why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump  —   and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry  —   has quietly become the most   reading material on Wall Street. He is Seth A. Klarman, the    value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion. While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as “The Oracle of Boston,” where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised. In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing “perilously high valuations. ” “Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from   protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,” he wrote. “President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,” he continued. “While they might be popular, the reason the U. S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don’t work, they actually leave society worse off. ” In particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of   policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump’s stimulus efforts “could prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors. ” And he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy’s growth over the long term. “The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “The large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today’s artificially low levels. ” Much of Mr. Klarman’s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump’s leadership style. He described it this way: “The erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound  . ” He also linked this point  —   which is a fair one  —   to what “Trump style” means for Mr. Klarman’s constituency and others. “The big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,” he wrote. “Not only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he’s apparently deliberately so he says it’s part of his plan. ” While Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, “If things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst. ” Mr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner. While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: “His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president. ” In his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. “Despite my preference to stay out of the media,” he wrote, “I’ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander. ” From the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund’s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years. What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election  —   about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet  —   wrongly so far  —   that the stock market would fall he lost about $1 billion. Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes  —   he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard  Poor’s index  —   he blamed the influx of money into the industry. “With any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “No surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured. ” He continued, “To many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product. ” The lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity. Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes  —   at least that finance geeks will appreciate  —   is what he says is the irony that investors now “have gotten excited about   index funds and exchange traded funds (E. T. F. s) that mimic various market or sector indices. ” He says he sees big trouble ahead in this area  —   or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit. “One of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E. T. F. activity is that it will tend to ‘lock in’ today’s relative valuations between securities,” Mr. Klarman wrote. “When money flows into an index fund or   E. T. F. the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),” he wrote. “Thus today’s   companies are likely to also be tomorrow’s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings. ” To Mr. Klarman, “stocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it. ” “This should give   value investors a distinct advantage,” he wrote. “The inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become. ” How Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here’s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: “In matters of style, swim with the current in matters of principle, stand like a rock. ”"

In yet another climate change ‘save the planet’ rant, our dear friends at _Stuff_ and Nonsense have published an article about climate change Fake News in which, without a hint of irony, they publish fake news.



It begins:



A quick Google search often reveals that, yes, someone out there, somewhere, agrees with what we think, no matter how left-field our views.



So it proves with climate change.



One word change fixes that: “A quick Google search often reveals that, yes, someone out there, somewhere, agrees with what we think, no matter how left- ** _wing_** our views. So it proves with climate change.”



Then the fake news starts:



Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus – NASA **states 97 per cent of publishing scientists say humans are causing climate change** – some refuse to be shifted from their position of dissent. 



Way back in 2014 a [50 page paper](https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf) thoroughly debunked the “97%” myth. The _Stuff_ editors have had five years to read through these 50 pages, less than a page per month, and yet they persist in publishing fake news.



Here is a quick take-out summary from that paper:



 _Stuff_ goes on to criticise a regional council candidate for having a contrary position. Apparently he sent a video around which claimed that the World Meteorological Organisation secretary-general Petteri Taalas denied man-made climate change when he does not. I have not watched said video so cannot comment.



However, have _Stuff_ ever reported what Taalas did say?



 **The atmosphere created by media has been provoking anxiety**. The latest idea is that children are a negative thing. I am worried for young mothers, who are already under much pressure. This will only add to their burden. […]



While climate sceptisism has become less of an issue, now we are being challenged from the other side. Climate experts have been attacked by these people and they claim that we should be much more radical. They are doomsters and extremists; they make threats. Much more radical action is demanded by Extinction Rebellion movement. They demand zero emissions by 2025 and “honest” climate information from governments.[…]  
  
The IPCC reports have been read in a similar way to the Bible: you try to find certain pieces or sections from which you try to justify your extreme views. **This resembles religious extremism**.[…]  
  
We should consider critically, and with reservations, the thoughts of experts…” 



_The BFD_ is less than halfway through a [series](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-15/) on fake news that has been peddled by the climate reality denier media. **For 50 years the media have printed predicted doom scenarios** from the “97%” of climate scientists, and those predictions have failed every time. 



Surely the doomsayers should get at least one run on the board before we start worrying about their predictions?

At the launch of of the research vessel ~~Boaty McBoatface~~ _Sir David Attenborough_ , the man himself said:



We are only going to deal with it [climate change] if we know what the facts are.



The oracle himself, Sir David, says we don’t yet know the facts. Is it not a little strange that they are spending all that money on a research vessel to find out what the facts are when we all know that the ‘science is settled’?



One million steel parts. How were the steel parts made? Equal parts fairy dust, unicorn urine and dodo feathers? Probably not. Lots of heat from ‘fossil’ fuels and good quality coal. 



Naturally, the 60,000 litres of paint would all be organic, waterbased and eco-friendly. The pigments would have been hand-ground by the native women of Myanzibar from the bark of the eco-sourced sustainably grown muszbat tree. Or did they simply use the nice convenient petroleum based paints from the local marine supplier? 



Clearly they could not allow the wiring to short out so each of the 450,000 m were shielded in hand spun and manually woven fabric sheathing, an ancient traditional method used by the herdsmen of the Botsgrandy Plains. Or maybe they found that using cables with petroleum-based plastic insulation was just a tad more convenient?



Go and do Arctic and Antarctic research by all means – you may learn the truth that the world is not melting. But don’t use all the advantages of our modern, advanced, petroleum-based lifestyle whilst railing against it. Hypocrites.

"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe general public is realizing that the climate data are showing nothing to be alarmed about. Depending on data study one looks at, global temperatures have stagnated 18 years (have even fallen over the last 10 years), sea level rise is decelerating, and again we are beginning to experience winters like we saw in the 1960s. Climate is cyclic.
So if the data aren’t at all worrisome, then what can be done to convey the message of grave concern and worry to the public? The latest stunt concocted by the imaginative minds of climate hysterics is posing before a camera and to put on the most concerned look they could possibly muster. It’s a black-and-white photography series dubbed “Scared Scientists” by Nick Bowers. Read here.
Climate propaganda has reached Orwellian dimensions.
These scientists have cooperated with a professional photographer to handle this project. Lower the lights, turn your head bit to the right. Don’t blink! Be more tense…imagine your funding is about to be eliminated – yes, perfect! Exactly the photo we want!
Yes, this is exactly the kind of worry they wanted to capture on camera – to convey their fright and worry over man-made climate change.
Just like they are trying to do their best to feign a climate catastrophe with carefully selected and posed data, the climate-alarmism centerfold scientists are now doing their utmost to feign alarmism.

Even other alarmist science journalists are skeptical of the stunt. For example David Appell at his site writes:
It looks as fake as it is, and it also comes across as emotional manipulation. Probably we should be emotional about climate change, but come on, no one sits around all day looking worried, as if their checking account is low and the rent’s past due.”
Moreover he adds:
Look for this to be widely mocked. I can’t honestly blame anyone if they do.”
This is not something to mock. Rather it is something to be very concerned about. These scientists are no longer capable of doing objective scientific work. They’ve succumbed to their emotions and the results of their work will be potentially entirely contaminated and thus untrustworthy.

"**Canada's federal government will spend C$100bn ($77bn, Â£58bn) to kick-start the country's post-pandemic economy.**
It is ""the largest economic relief package for our country since the Second World War"", Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Monday.
The spending will bring the deficit to a historic C$381.6bn by March 2021.
The wide-ranging plan includes targeted relief for hard-hit business sectors, investments in long-term care homes and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine.
The announcement - the first full fiscal update from Canada's Liberal government since the onset of the pandemic - comes as the country battles a steep second wave of Covid-19 infections. The number of active cases in Canada has more than doubled in November alone, bringing the total number of infections to more than 376,000 - according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. So far, more than 12,000 Canadians have died.
""When the virus is under control and our economy is ready for new growth, we will employ an ambitious stimulus package,"" to be spent over the next three years, Ms Freeland said in the House of Commons on Monday. The spending will amount to 3-4% of Canada's GDP.
Monday's fiscal plan pledges C$1bn to help provinces and territories improve Covid-19 infection control in long-term care facilities. Industries that have been particularly vulnerable to economic shutdowns like tourism, travel and arts will be eligible for business loans up to C$1m, with a 10-year term. And for Canada's lower and middle income families, package promises up to C$1,200 for each child under 6.
An additional C$1bn will also be directed to vaccine agreements. ""Canada has secured the most diverse vaccine portfolio in the world,"" Ms Freeland said. Canada has secured seven different vaccine purchase contracts, she said, enough for each Canadian to receive 10 doses, free of charge.
And to pay for the expansive plan, Canada will see its largest budget shortfall since World War Two.
On Monday, Ms Freeland defended the record deficit as affordable - thanks to low interest rates - and necessary for Canada's economy. ""As we have learned from previous recessions, the risk of providing too little support now outweighs that of providing too much,"" she said. ""We will not repeat the mistakes of the years following the Great Recession of 2008.""
Speaking in the House of Commons, opposition leader Erin O'Toole dismissed the Liberal's proposal. ""Without a plan for vaccines, there can be no long-term plan for our economy,"" the Conservative leader said.
Despite Ms Freeland's assurances that each Canadian would have access to several doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, Canadians still ""don't know the first date vaccines will be received,"" Mr O'Toole said.
As infections climb, coronavirus shutdowns have battered the country's economy. Last month, Statistics Canada reported an unemployment rate of 8.9%, meaning there are 1.8 million Canadians unable to find a job.
Monday's announcement is among the first major challenges for Ms Freeland, who took over the role of finance minister in August, after her predecessor, Bill Morneau, suddenly stepped down from the post amid an ethics scandal. Ms Freeland, 52, is the first woman to hold the position in Canada. She also serves as the country's deputy prime minister."
"The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks, saying most were underreported. The Trump administration, under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies it says are designed to curb terrorism, has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat. But the list, which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016, includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media, including by The New York Times. (Examples are included in the list below.) Just as striking was what the list excluded: attacks targeting Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism. The list does not mention, for instance, two suicide bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed dozens in November 2015, or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria, which have been among the world’s deadliest terrorist assaults. Though there have been many attacks in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the list mentions only one: a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors. The list describes the target as “a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards,” which is correct but in keeping with the document’s emphasis on Western targets  —   a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow. Prominent attacks carried out by   are also conspicuously omitted. In June 2015, Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston, S. C. killing nine. That November, three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs. Robert L. Dear Jr. describing himself as a “warrior for the babies,” acknowledged that he had carried out the attack, but he was later declared mentally unfit to stand trial. And in at least one of the attacks on the list, terrorism has been ruled out. A knife attack that killed two British backpackers at a hostel in Queensland, Australia, was found to be a common crime, not one related to terrorism, the Queensland police have said.   violence has been rising in the United States, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation, and has in some years claimed more lives than Islamist attacks in the country. The White House’s list, by focusing on a significant but narrow slice of terrorism, feeds into perceptions that the administration is seeking to target Muslims with other policies, particularly its immigration restrictions against predominantly Muslim countries.

"**The health secretary Matt Hancock has pledged to re-evaluate North Somerset's Covid restriction tier in a fortnight after protests from two local MPs.**
John Penrose, MP for Weston-super-Mare, and Liam Fox, North Somerset's MP, said it was not ""right or fair"" that the district had been placed in tier three.
The decision was made because of its proximity to Bristol.
The city recorded 197 cases per 100,000 people over the last week, while North Somerset has 179.5 cases per 100,000.
But according to the latest figures North Somerset's rates are down from 203.7 cases per 100,000 in the previous week.
In a letter to Mr Penrose and Dr Fox, Mr Hancock said he ""very much hoped that North Somerset's case rates continue to improve"".
Mr Penrose said Mr Hancock's reply ""shows he's listening"" but he was left frustrated that the district is left in tier three until areas are reviewed on 16 December.
Mr Penrose and Dr Fox voted in favour of the new tier system in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
They said not doing so would have ""prevented the government from dealing with local flare-ups without imposing another national lockdown"".
But fellow Conservative MP David Warburton voted against the plan.
The Somerset and Frome MP said the tier system was ""ludicrous and laughable"".
""The trouble is that the government will lose the consent of the people because it doesn't make any sense and I understand that because it doesn't make any sense to me"", he said.
Last week, a North Somerset landlord unable to open his pub because of the district being placed in tier three said he felt ""sold down the river"".
John Hayes, who runs the Old Inn in Hutton, about 20 miles (32km) from Bristol, said he had been ""victimised by post code"".

Our energy and environment deserve better – in South Africa and Qatar
Guest post by Dr. Kelvin Kemm
A few weeks ago, perhaps as a prologue to the “global warming disaster” convention in Doha, Qatar, South Africa’s Department of Environment Affairs took out a full-page advertisement in our country’s newspapers, promoting National Marine Week.

The ad showed a map of the Antarctic continent, from above the pole, surrounded by the vast blue Southern Ocean. It also promoted South Africa’s new Antarctic research vessel, SA Agulhas II.
The advertisement’s text mentioned the massive Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which is responsible for distributing vital nutrients to the world’s oceans. It noted that the truly massive quantities of phytoplankton found in the ocean are vital marine building blocks in ocean processes. All that is true, and I certainly applaud efforts to protect the environment and promote National Marine Week and our country’s research efforts.
But then, sadly, the ad’s discussion of physics content went off the rails. Referring to phytoplankton, it said “these microscopic creatures also use carbon to create energy.” Wrong!  
The most basic law of thermodynamics says energy is neither created nor destroyed, but merely converted from one form to another. The only way to “create” energy is via a nuclear process, whereby matter is converted to energy in a nuclear reaction, as Einstein famously postulated over a century ago. Nuclear processes operate outside the laws of thermodynamics, but there is certainly no nuclear process going on in phytoplankton.
I could have lived with that slip up in the physics. But it got worse – much worse. The ad went on to blame global warming for upsetting the phytoplankton. In a declaration straight out of Alice in Wonderland, it asserted: “The increase in surface temperature over Antarctica from climate change is having a catastrophic knock-on effect, depleting phytoplankton stocks, melting the Antarctic ice sheet and causing an alarming reduction in all marine life.”
First, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no “alarming reduction in all marine life.” None of my colleagues are aware of it. Second, the surface temperature over Antarctica is not increasing.
In fact, a new record has just been attained. Antarctic sea ice has just reached an all-time record for total acreage. Day 265 of the year 2012 set an all time record, and then on day 266 that record was broken. The days 265 to 270 were the six highest Antarctic sea ice extent days of all time.
The environment department then compounded these errors by committing the unforgivable scientific sin of claiming a supposed increase in surface air temperature over Antarctica “is having a catastrophic knock-on effect” – then providing no evidence to back up its assertion and not telling readers what the alleged knock-on effect is.
I cannot even begin to imagine how this knock-on is supposed to alter the Circumpolar Current, which in turn is somehow supposed to affect the “energy creation” capabilities of phytoplankton. Come off it, folks.
There is so much good Antarctic science to be proud of – and, for that matter, really fine South African scientific achievements in the Antarctic to brag about. That the DEA would feel compelled to celebrate National Maritime Week by resorting to phytoplankton scares supposedly related to nonexistent Antarctic heating is beyond mystifying.
Meanwhile, over the last few months, newspaper stories have told of reduced sea ice extent at our planet’s other pole, the Arctic. Terms like “alarming rate” of ice depletion were bandied about casually. Yes, there were reductions in Arctic sea ice cover.
However, on September 18, a video posted by NASA on its website showed that a large and long lasting Arctic cyclone “wreaked havoc on the Arctic sea ice cover,” by “breaking up sea ice.” The unusual reduction in Arctic sea ice cover was due to high winds – not to any warming of the Arctic or global warming in general. NASA’s belated analysis demonstrated that a large section of ice north of the Chukchi Sea was cut off by the churning storm, broken up and pushed south into warmer waters, where it melted.
The storm also broke up other ice, accelerating drifting and melting elsewhere. Reuters finally reported that “NASA says a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of Alaska in early August and moved toward the centre of the Arctic Ocean, weakening the already thin sea ice as it went.”
NASA noted that this was an “uncommon event” and that there have been only about eight storms of similar strength during August in 34 yearsof satellite records. However, a major storm every four years is not all that “uncommon.” Paul A. Newman, Chief Scientist for Atmospheric Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, added that such wind disturbances produce many effects and can also lift warmer water from the depths of the Arctic Ocean up to the surface to accelerate melting.
For some reason – probably having to do with its regular promotion of “dangerous manmade global warming” claims – the storm story was barely mentioned in the mainstream popular media. By contrast, the “alarming ice cover reduction” narrative was covered extensively.
Now jump back in time five years, to December 12, 2007. On that date Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein distributed an article that stated: “An already relentless melting of the Arctic greatly accelerated this summer – a sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. One scientist even speculated that summer sea ice could be gone in five years.”
Well, five years have come and gone. Borenstein was dead wrong. Does anyone suppose the AP will now publish an apology, admitting that its “science writer” was on thin ice when he made this outlandish statement, and saying he should not have tried to scare thepublic like that?
Perhaps the answer can be found in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland.
“There’s no use trying,” Alice said. “One can’t believe impossible things.” “I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”
Especially with the Doha climate change confab in full swing, taxpayers, newspaper readers – and anyone dreaming of a better life through reliable, affordable energy – deserves more honest reporting and more science-based energy and environmental policies than they have been getting.

"If you need a distraction from fighting about “La La Land,” cheering at “Hidden Figures” or weeping about “Moonlight”  —   all of which might have been distracting you from other things  —   there are 15   movies quietly soliciting your attention, along with that of the academy voters. The   nominees are often unsung   highlights, too easily overlooked except for   balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch “Arrival” three times or “Toni Erdmann” twice, you could take a remarkably   tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as   charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful   material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Before it was a mighty fief within Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful   and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year’s, “Piper” (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like “Moana” in reverse.) The   relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou  ’s “Borrowed Time,” about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne’s “Pearl” (now on YouTube) about a rock ’n’ roll dad and his rock ’n’ roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual    cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. “Blind Vaysha,” a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator’s voice accompanying eerie,   images. “Pear Cider and Cigarettes,” the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses   narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a   childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It’s available on Vimeo for a fee.) If I were voting, I’d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I’d never bet against Pixar. The predicament of migrants and refugees in Europe figures in two of the nominees, “Ennemis Intérieurs” (“Internal Enemies”) from France, and “Silent Nights,” from Denmark. The first, directed by Sélim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of “La Republique,” issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election. “Silent Nights” confronts similar questions as it traces the relationship between a young Danish woman and a Ghanaian immigrant, whose mutual empathy (and romantic attraction) is tested by the drastically different circumstances they face. The humanism of this film, directed by Aske Bang and Kim Magnusson, is shadowed by an inescapable pessimism, an intimation that kindness, while essential, may not be enough when survival is at stake. There is nothing overtly topical or political in the other three nominees, which are also from Europe. “La Femme et le TGV” (“The Woman and the TGV,” available for a fee from iTunes) from Switzerland, is almost rescued from mawkish triviality by the affecting performance of the great Jane Birkin as the title character, and nearly ruined by a cloying, aggressive score. The Spanish film “Timecode,” about the clandestine activities of parking garage security guards, might seem equally slight, but it reveals itself to be a sly fable of creative resistance in the face of deadening routine. And Kristof Deak and Anna Udvardy’s “Sing,” my favorite in this batch, might be mistaken for a sweet story of the friendship between two Hungarian schoolgirls until the last scene, when it becomes a parable of defiance against unjust and corrupt authority. (Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!) Like the nominees in the   best documentary category, the five films in this group demonstrate a commitment to both relevance and experimentation. Only one of them, “Joe’s Violin” (now on YouTube) follows the conventional,   template, alternating interviews, archival footage and   events as it tells the touching story of a Holocaust survivor who donated his violin to a public school in the Bronx. The film, directed by Kahane Cooperman, proceeds though familiar beats, but its emotions are genuine and its characters are well worth knowing. Their lives are not easy, but “Joe’s Violin” feels downright soothing alongside its competition, which includes some of the most wrenching, unsparing images I have seen on film in the past year. The aptly named “Extremis,” by Dan Krauss (on Netflix now) plunges the viewer into the midst of gravely ill patients and the doctors who must help their families decide whether to continue life support. The reality of death is something we often avoid, and even for half an hour, this film is difficult to watch. But it is also gripping, suspenseful and moving  —   a hard look at a hard subject. Those words also describe the three short documentaries about the Syrian war and the European refugee crisis. Daphne Matziaraki’s “4. 1 Miles” (produced by The New York Times’s Opinion section and available on nytimes. com) plies the waters off the Greek island of Lesbos as coast guard officers try to rescue migrants crowded onto inflatable rafts. “The White Helmets,” by Orlando von Einsiedel and Joanna Natasegara (now on Netflix) and “Watani: My Homeland,” by Marcel Mettelsiefen and Stephen Ellis, both take place in Aleppo, and provide a glimpse of the horror that city has endured in recent years. Too rigorous to offer false hope, they nonetheless affirm the necessity of witness and an antidote to despair. I can’t choose between them, but I hope one of them wins."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBerlin-based leftist daily TAZ here reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel isn’t going to bother attending the Ban Ki-Moon initiated climate conference in New York this coming September. The TAZ adds this has been “confirmed by a government spokesman“.
Moon personally invited all world leaders, asking them to attend with “ambition and responsibility” in order to lay the groundwork for the Paris 2015 climate conference where world leaders are to sign onto a binding agreement requiring industrialized countries to drastically cut back CO2 emissions by 2050, and thus serving as the successor agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
The TAZ writes that even Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande will be attending.
Merkel’s decision to snub the event is likely another sign that efforts to forge a climate agreement are already dead in water. The TAZ writes:
Ultimately only Europe and very few other countries remain on board. Canada for example has opted out. Japan and Russia are also no longer taking part.”

Merkel “burying global climate agreement”
According to the TAZ, Merkel will not be attending because of “scheduling reasons“, but added that Germany will be represented by “high-ranking” officials.
Activists groups are howling in response to Merkel’s snub. Germany’s leading global warming hysterical blog klimaretter here accuses Merkel of “burying the global climate agreement”.
Klimaretter adds that Brazil is expected to play a key role in facilitating an agreement but that the prospects of making progress look dim since negotiations suffered a huge setback in March:
The representatives of 28 EU countries postponed to October the decision on their mutual climate targets for 2030. That means: The EU will decide their new climate targets first after the Ban-Ki-Moon conference [New York]. This is a hefty setback for climate diplomacy: Of course the Brazilians aren’t going to be putting any suitable climate targets on the table when they do not even know what the Europeans have in their pockets.”

In what can only be described as a hilarious troll of Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a woman urged her to adopt a new campaign slogan, **“we need to eat the babies”** in order to fight Climate change. A pro-Trump group called ‘LaRouchePAC’ have claimed credit for political stunt. 



To add to the fun Tucker Carlson later attacked Ocasio-Cortez for her completely inappropriate response to the “we need to eat babies” claim!



Tucker Carlson blasts AOC over how she handled her supporter saying people must “start eating babies!”:

"WASHINGTON  —   Senator Jeff Sessions was confirmed on Wednesday as President Trump’s attorney general, capping a bitter and racially charged nomination battle that crested with the procedural silencing of a leading Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, survived a    vote, 52 to 47, in the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Mr. Trump strains to install his cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation’s top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate. But the confirmation process  —   ferocious even by the standards of moldering decorum that have defined the body’s recent years  —   laid bare the Senate’s deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the treatment of Ms. Warren, who was forced to stop speaking late Tuesday after criticizing Mr. Sessions from the Senate floor, rekindled the   politics that animated the presidential election and the women’s march protesting Mr. Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Mr. Sessions cast his final vote as a senator to note that he was present for Wednesday’s tally. His confirmation was met by applause from his colleagues, including a few Democrats, on the Senate floor. “I can’t express how appreciative I am for those of you who stood by me during this difficult time,” Mr. Sessions said shortly after the vote. “By your vote tonight, I have been given a real challenge. I’ll do my best to be worthy of it. ” Democrats spent the hours before the vote on Wednesday seething over the rebuke of Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, who had been barred from speaking on the floor the previous night. Late Tuesday, Republicans voted to formally silence Ms. Warren after she read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Mr. Sessions for using “the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens” while serving as a United States attorney in Alabama. Since Mr. Trump announced his choice for attorney general, Mr. Sessions’s history with issues of race had assumed center stage. A committee hearing on his nomination included searing indictments from black Democratic lawmakers like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke with Senate tradition to testify against a peer. For weeks, Republicans rejected suggestions that Mr. Sessions could not be trusted on civil rights, arguing that he had been tarnished unfairly over accusations of racial insensitivity that have dogged him since the 1980s. “Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle,” Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon. The “twisting” of Mr. Sessions’s record offended him, he said, even as Democrats continued their attacks on the nominee. As the 84th attorney general, Mr. Sessions brings a sharply conservative bent to the Justice Department and its 113, 000 employees. A former prosecutor, he promises a focus aligned with Mr. Trump in pushing a “law and order” agenda that includes tougher enforcement of laws on immigration, drugs and gun trafficking. Civil rights advocates worry, however, that he will reverse steps taken by the Obama administration in the last eight years to bring more accountability to police departments, state and local governments, and employers. Advocates point to his history of votes against various civil rights measures, as well as the accusations of racial insensitivity. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said on Wednesday that on civil rights, immigration, abortion, criminal sentencing guidelines and a range of other issues, Mr. Sessions had been far outside the mainstream and had pushed “extreme policies” often targeting minorities. That criticism peaked with Tuesday night’s rebuke of Ms. Warren, based on an arcane Senate rule that prevents members from impugning the character of a fellow senator, as she read the letter from Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mrs. King wrote the letter in response to Mr. Sessions’s 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship, for which he was ultimately rejected in part because of accusations that he had been insensitive to minorities as a prosecutor. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, led the objection against Ms. Warren. His explanation afterward  —   “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted”  —   instantly became a liberal rallying cry,   Ms. Warren as a leading voice of Democratic resistance to Mr. Trump. “What hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,” Ms. Warren told a group of civil rights leaders on Wednesday at the Capitol. “It’s about trying to shut people up. It’s about saying: ‘No, no, no. Just go ahead and vote. ’” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday that the censure was “totally, totally  ” and that it reflected an “   attitude” emanating from the White House. He and other Democrats said it served to mute legitimate criticism of Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights and racial issues  —   one of their main avenues of attack at his contentious nomination hearing last month. The vote on Mr. Sessions came a day after Senate Republicans broke through a bottleneck in Mr. Trump’s nominees by approving Betsy DeVos, the embattled Republican donor, as education secretary with the help of a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. With Mr. Sessions’s confirmation, votes are expected in coming days on the nominations of Representative Tom Price of Georgia for secretary of health and human services and Steven T. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mr. Sessions’s path to confirmation hit another snag that riled Democrats and energized opponents of his nomination: Mr. Trump’s dramatic firing of the acting leader of the Justice Department. Last week, Mr. Trump abruptly dismissed Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, setting off a fierce backlash from Democrats against Mr. Sessions’s nomination to fill her job permanently. Ms. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, had refused to defend Mr. Trump’s controversial order barring travel by some foreigners, which is now tied up in litigation in federal courts. Democrats seized on her firing to say that Mr. Sessions is too close to the president to be independent or stand up to him. As the first senator to support Mr. Trump’s   bid for president last year, Mr. Sessions became an influential campaign adviser. While he pledged repeatedly not to be “a mere rubber stamp” for the White House, Democrats asserted that he would not be willing to challenge legally questionable policies like the travel ban or the president’s threats to reinstitute the use of torture on terrorism suspects. The arguments failed to sway any Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted, 11 to 9, along party lines last week to approve Mr. Sessions’s nomination. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed confidence that Mr. Sessions would be a “fair and evenhanded” attorney general and would make good on his pledges to enforce even the laws he voted against in the Senate. “There should be no question,” Mr. Grassley said, “that he is more than qualified to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer. ”"

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and other Democrat leaders nationwide announce that students can skip classes Friday (9/20/201) to join the global climate strike aimed at protesting man-made climate breakdown. Is this just a craven political move, at the expense of taxpayers and of student learning, or a great way to give young people an active role in the crucial work to save the planet?

Senator McCain, Senator Reed, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. It is an honor to be here.



This is a vital undertaking. There is an urgent need for the United States to clarify its national security goals, to craft a strategy that prioritizes those goals, and to consider the tools necessary to achieve them. Our military forces of the future should conform to that strategy.



I will focus first on how U.S. foreign policy has shaped the international system. Second, I will explain the flaws of our current grand strategy, and propose an alternative, with a particular focus on the role that U.S allies and partners should play in the future. Lastly, I will briefly touch on some of the capabilities that the U.S. military requires to carry out its vital missions.



 **Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy**  
U.S. foreign policy is crippled today by a dramatic disconnect between what Americans expect of it and what the nation’s leaders are giving them. If U.S. policymakers don’t address this gap, they risk pursuing a policy whose ends don’t match with the means the American people are willing to provide.



What is our foreign policy? To the extent that it can be summarized in a single word, that word is “primacy”: a foreign policy that hinges on a forward‐​deployed military geared to stopping prospective threats before they materialize. Primacy holds that it would be too dangerous to allow other countries to defend themselves and their interests. Some will botch the job, necessitating costly U.S. intervention later. Others will succeed too well, unleashing arms races that would alter the delicate balance of regional or international relations. Thus, primacy reassures; it discourages other countries from defending themselves and their interests.



For much of the past two decades, these underlying premises of U.S. foreign policy have not changed, although the preferred terms or phrases to describe it have. Other popular variations include “deep engagement,” “unipolarity,” “liberal hegemony,” or the particularly grandiose “benevolent global hegemony.”



President Obama favors “leadership.” That word appears 35 times in his latest National Security Strategy.



His predecessors have all had similar aspirations, although most managed to work in a few more synonyms. It all boils down to primacy.



For example, at the dawn of the post‐​Cold War era, officials in the George H.W. Bush administration aspired for the United States to be the sole global power. Now that the nation’s long‐​time rival was gone, the object of U.S. foreign policy, according to an early draft of the Defense Planning Guidance, was to “prevent the re‐​emergence of a new rival” capable of challenging U.S. power in any vital area, including Western Europe, Asia, or the territory of the former Soviet Union. To accomplish this task, the United States would retain preponderant military power, not merely to deter attacks against the United States, but also to deter “potential competitors” — including long‐​time U.S. allies such as Germany and Japan — “from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.“1



Leaving aside, for now, the question of whether the strategy is preventing rivals from challenging U.S. power, the costs have been considerable. Primacy, notes MIT’s Barry Posen, “encourages less‐​friendly states to compete with the United States more intensively, while encouraging friendly states to do less than they should in their own defense, or to be more adventurous than is wise.“2



For the most part, American taxpayers, and especially American troops, have borne the burdens of primacy, while U.S. allies have been content to focus on domestic spending, and allow their underfunded defenses to languish. Because U.S. security guarantees to wealthy allies have caused them to under‐​provide for their own defense, they also have less capacity to deal with common security challenges, from ethnic violence in the Balkans in the late 1990s, to combatting terrorism and piracy in the Middle East, South Asia, or the Horn or Africa in the 2000s, to averting state collapse in North Africa today.



But there is an even more dramatic problem underlying U.S. foreign policy today: it requires U.S. leaders to push, prod, and occasionally even hoodwink Americans into taking on unnecessary tasks. Even strong advocates of primacy concede that it might not be realistic to expect Americans to bear the burdens of global governance indefinitely, and admit to the need for misdirection and subterfuge.



“Americans,” Michael Mandelbaum grudgingly admitted in his book, _The Case for Goliath_ , “approach the world much as other people do….For the American public, foreign policy, like charity, begins at home.” For that reason, above all others, Mandelbaum predicted, “the American role in the world may depend in part on Americans not scrutinizing it too closely.“3



It is no longer appropriate to expect Americans to remain ignorant about our foreign policy. Primacy served us well immediately after the end of World War II, when the nations of Europe and East Asia were physically broken and fiscally broke, and we wanted to prevent the reemergence of Japan and Germany as rivals. Protecting our Asian and European allies continued to make sense during the Cold War, as long as our absence from those continents would have left an imbalance of power that the Red Army or Communist China could exploit.



But we should ask more of our allies and security partners today and in the future. We shouldn’t merely expect them to support us when we act militarily abroad. We shouldn’t merely demand that they allow us to use our facilities in their lands, often on their behalf. Rather, we should expect them to act first, to address urgent threats to their security, before they become threats to their wider region, or the world.



On the subject of threats, I do not believe that we are living in the most dangerous time in human history, or even in my lifetime. There are dangers in the world; there always have been, and there always will be. We are quite good at identifying a dizzying array of possible threats.4 An effective national security strategy will prioritize among them, and identify the best tools to mitigate them.



In that context, the key question is what Americans should be prepared to do to address which threats, and what will be expected of others. Whether you agree with me or not about today’s threats as compared to those a generation ago, or a century ago, the best approach would involve many countries who are willing and able to confront potential local or regional challenges.



Under the current model, the United States is expected to address all threats, in all regions, at all times. We need a new grand strategy, one that expects other countries to take primary responsibility for their protecting their security and preserving their interests. We need a resilient international order, one that is not overly dependent on the military power of a single country. We need capable, self‐​reliant partners. And we must restrain our impulse to use the U.S. military when our vital interests are not directly threatened.



 **A New Profile of Power**  
Such a grand strategy, built around a greater skepticism toward military intervention, leads logically toward a new profile of power: namely, a smaller military oriented around defending U.S. security and U.S. interests.



We should not reduce our military without first rethinking how those forces will be used. If a finite number of assets are stretched to the limit to cover excessive global commitments, there is a serious risk that we will damage morale and readiness, thus contributing to a “hollow force” — a military that appears capable on the surface, but that is, in actuality, crippled by inferior equipment, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate training.



We must work over the next decade to renegotiate or abrogate security relationships. Alliances for mutual defense, and to advance common interests, are acceptable; the current inequitable arrangement, whereby we agree to defend our allies, and they agree to let us, is not. It is unreasonable to expect U.S. taxpayers to foot the bill when U.S. interests are not at stake.



Put another way, the days of the U.S. military serving as the world’s global constabulary, responding to every 911 call, from every corner of the world, should end.



For the balance of my time, I’m going to focus on three aspects of the force structure consistent with a foreign policy of self reliance and restraint: a capable Navy, a credible nuclear deterrent, and a flexible, mobile Army.



 _A Focused Navy_



I’m proud to have served in the United States Navy. I spent about six months at Navy schools in Newport, Rhode Island, and then three years on the guided missile cruiser USS TICONDEROGA, mostly in Norfolk, Virginia, but also two deployments overseas. I have a great naval name. I grew up in Maine, as did about 10 generations of Prebles before me. They build ships at Bath just across the Kennebec River from where some of my ancestors first settled.



I am a Navy partisan. There is no point in trying to conceal that fact. But my support for a strong and capable Navy reflects more than just parochialism and ancestral pride. And my love of the institution, and the men and women who serve in it, informs my attitudes about the missions that our Navy should be expected to perform, and the ships that it will need to perform them.



The number of ships in the U.S. Navy has declined precipitously since the late‐​1980s. In those days, we were confronting a globe‐​straddling Soviet empire with a vast and capable blue‐​water navy. I remember it well. I was a young midshipman in the Navy ROTC program at George Washington University, and the SecNav back then, John Lehman, famously aspired to build a 600‐​ship navy.



But times have changed. The Soviet Union is where it belongs: on the ash heap of history. And the ships that we deploy today are vastly more capable than the Cold War‐​era ships, some of which were considerably older than the sailors who deployed on them. We shouldn’t, therefore, focus on numbers of ships in the fleet today, per se, but rather on the mix of vessels, and especially their costs and capabilities to perform key missions.



Those costs include opportunity costs. Choosing to invest a substantial share of the Navy’s total shipbuilding budget on just a few Ford‐​class aircraft carriers necessarily means that we will buy fewer small surface combatants, especially cruisers and destroyers. I also believe that we need a successor to the Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates, the last of which was decommissioned earlier this year. The costly and disappointing littoral combat ships may not be the answer. And where do submarines fit into the mix? The shipbuilding budget must also account for them, both ballistic missile submarines and fast attack boats. Understanding these tradeoffs is crucial. Are we prepared to say that a single platform costing $14 billion is worth more than six or seven DDGs? Can the United States build a small surface combatant for less than $500 million? Other countries can, so why can’t we?



We should not build our fleet around the supposition that it will be continuously engaged in offensive operations across the planet. Under a strategy of self‐​reliance and restraint, the U.S. Navy will be a surge force, capable of deploying if local actors prove incapable of addressing threats, not a permanent presence force, committed to preventing bad things from happening, all the time, and everywhere.



Safeguarding the flow of essential commodities and finished goods was a core mission for the U.S. military during the Cold War, when the Soviet Navy aspired to close vital sea lanes of communications (SLOCs), and they appeared to have the ability to do so, at least for a time. Today the situation is far different. Few international actors have an incentive to close major international waterways, and those that are so inclined — e.g pirates, bandits, and various non‐​state actors — lack the capacity to do so. They can disrupt. They can threaten. They cannot deny the use of these waterways to determined shippers backed by capable nation states.



Sea‐​lane control in the modern era aims to ensure the free flow of goods and is therefore primarily defensive in nature. Given that the sea‐​control mission will be shared with other countries, most of whom will be operating in close proximity to their home waters, our force planning can focus on our core obligations, principally in the Western Hemisphere. That mission could be supported by small surface combatants, including destroyers, and possibly a new class of frigates. In the unlikely event that a regional conflict threatened to close a distant strategic choke point, naval and air forces from many different countries would be able to respond, augmented by U.S. forces as necessary.



In this context, we should revisit the decision to build a number of very large and costly aircraft carriers. These vessels are not well suited to the sea control mission, and will become increasingly vulnerable to defensive weapons that force them to operate at greater and greater distances from shore. The investment in such exquisite technology — a single platform that consumes a substantial share of the total shipbuilding budget — raises serious questions about how such platforms will actually be deployed in an era of defensive dominance. Simply put, will any future president of the United States risk losing even a single such vessel? And what interests would justify taking such risks?5



 _A Small but Credible Nuclear Deterrent_



Maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent is a key component of U.S. national security policy, but U.S. security does not require nearly 1,600 nuclear weapons deployed on a triad of delivery vehicles — bombers, land‐​based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine‐​launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). A smaller nuclear deterrent based entirely on submarines would be sufficient to deter attacks against the United States. It might be more politically feasible to reduce to a dyad of delivery vehicles — SLBMs with either bombers or ICBMs — but that would signal the triumph of parochial interests over the needs of U.S. security.



The triad grew up during the 1950s as a result of competition between the military services. The rationales were thin at the time, and quickly were superseded by dramatic technological improvements that the services chose to downplay. As the competition for resources abated in the 1960s, the Navy and the Air Force stopped denigrating each others’ nuclear delivery systems and began arguing on behalf of the triad as an article of faith. It is not clear, in retrospect, that a triad was ever required to deter Soviet attacks against the United States or U.S. allies. Maintaining a guaranteed second‐​strike for deterrence was never the only goal, but today’s submarines are also capable of counterforce (i.e. first‐​strike) missions.



U.S. power today makes the case for the triad even more dubious. Survivability is no longer a feasible justification. No adversary has the capability to destroy all U.S. ballistic submarines, let alone all three types of delivery vehicles, and there would be time to adjust our nuclear force posture if that circumstance changed.



Overinvesting in nuclear weapons and nuclear delivery vehicles, even if such expenditures represent only a small share of the total military budget, nonetheless diverts resources that could be more effectively invested elsewhere. We should build and maintain only what we need.6



 _Flexible Ground Forces Postured for Defense, Not Nation Building_



What about our ground forces? Some argue that the Army and Marine Corps are well‐​suited for counterterrorism missions, because they rely on precision firepower and they are more adept at separating terrorists and terrorist‐​sympathizers from innocent bystanders.



But the belief that a larger military is necessary, or even effective, at reducing the threat of terrorism is mistaken. Counterterrorism is not an especially personnel‐​intensive endeavor, and, to the extent that it is, the people most heavily involved are not, and should not be, members of the military.7



And what of the supposed need for more troops to conduct Iraq and Afghanistan‐​style conflicts — regime‐​change operations followed by years of armed nation building? Some Americans believe that our failings in those countries, especially in Iraq, are a function of having too few “boots on the ground.” From that flows the logical conclusion that we need more people in boots.



The idea that our military is stretched too thin because our commitments exceed our means to achieve them is widespread. The best way to resolve this imbalance, however, is to rethink the ends, as opposed to merely increasing the means.



No one disputes that our troops have been overtaxed by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the problem of too few troops chasing too many missions predated 9/11. We have asked the members of our military — and especially those men and women in the Army and Marine Corps — to be the lead instrument of our foreign policies ever since the end of the Cold War. Our troops have responded honorably, but they cannot do everything, and they cannot be everywhere.



More troops are not the answer. A more judicious use of the troops that we already have is. Rather than increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps, we should reduce the number of active‐​duty personnel in both services, and transition to a smaller force augmented by a capable ready reserve.



We should also pause to consider the wisdom of armed nation building, what the military also calls counterinsurgency (COIN). When the United States chooses to shuffle the political deck in a weak or failing state, it needs men and women on the ground to do the work. Bombs can’t build schools or bridges, reform legal codes or root out corruption. They can’t convince the locals that we care about them enough to stick around for the long haul and will be there to protect them if the irreconcilables return to exact vengeance.



And that backlash is nearly inevitable; those driven out of power will fight to regain what they lost. FM 3–24, the military’s COIN manual, explains “Insurgencies are protracted by nature. Thus, COIN operations always demand considerable expenditures of time and resources.”



The United States is ill suited to such missions. This is not the fault of the U.S. military. The American people will support missions to strike our enemies with a vengeance, but solid majorities believe that the nation‐​building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan weren’t worth the effort. The widespread opposition to deeper involvement in the Syrian civil war demonstrates that the public’s skepticism hasn’t abated.



The public’s instincts are correct. If you understand the culture, if you avoid counterproductive violence, if you integrate civilians and make reconstruction operations a reward for cooperation, if you train the local forces well, if you pick your allies wisely, if you protect enough civilians and win their loyalty and more, you might succeed. But even avoiding a few of those ifs is too much competence to expect of any political and military leaders. Many of the crucial factors for success are simply beyond the capacity of outside forces to control. That is why insurgencies in the last century generally lasted for decades and why the track record of democratic powers pacifying uprisings in foreign lands is abysmal.8



Then again, Americans are accustomed to doing the impossible if the impossible is truly necessary. The ultimate reason why Americans will not master counterinsurgency and state‐​building is that it is not necessary. The supposed link between terrorism and state failure is weak to nonexistent. Terrorists operate in many perfectly healthy states (including Spain, the U.K. and, most recently, France), while many weak or failing states don’t serve as launching pads for violent extremism directed at Americans. We should deal with threats from Yemen or Somalia or Afghanistan as they arise and drop the pretense that we can or must construct a modern nation state in any of those places in order to defeat transnational terrorism.



If we are unlikely to embark on protracted nation‐​building missions for decades on end, and if the military, particularly our ground forces, are not the best tool for counterterrorism, we should revisit the other possible rationales for a large standing Army. The principal advantage of having that force, 20 to 30 percent of which is forward deployed in foreign bases, is that it is quite easy for it to become involved in foreign wars, without attracting too much attention by the American people, or their representatives here in Congress. The public is rarely engaged to the point of debating why we might be involved in such wars, let alone how to win them. This hardly seems like an advantage at all. If we reduce our permanent overseas presence and encourage other countries to defend themselves, we could rely more heavily on reservists serving stateside. And when there are calls for deploying U.S. forces abroad, and those reserves are mobilized into the active force, we can be sure that that will trigger a national debate.



Let me be clear: this isn’t just about saving money; it’s about spending money wisely. Ronald Reagan said, “Defense is not a budget issue. You spend what you need.” He was right, which is why it is crucial that we understand what we need. The misallocation of funds — whether for platforms the Pentagon doesn’t need, or bases it doesn’t want or personnel it won’t use — takes away from other priorities. We need a balanced force focused on defending vital U.S. interests, not a top‐​heavy force geared to fight the last decade’s wars or to defend others who can and should defend themselves.



 **Conclusion: Rethinking Ends and Means**  
In the debate over military spending that is now raging, it is generally assumed that our foreign policy, and thus the roles and missions that we assign to our military, will remain unchanged — or at least will not become less onerous. It is unreasonable to expect our military to do the same, or more, with less. It is unfair to the troops and their families. This noble sentiment explains the current push to increase the Pentagon’s budget above the spending caps imposed by the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. Many people believe that the only way to address the means/​end mismatch is to remove the fiscal constraints.



But the military’s roles and missions are not handed down from heaven. They are not carved on stone tablets. They are a function of the nation’s grand strategy and informed by the dominant intellectual paradigms at a given point in time.



That strategy must take account of the resources that can be made available to execute it. Under primacy, in the current domestic political context, increasing the means entails telling the American people to accept cuts in popular domestic programs, higher taxes, or both, so that our allies can maintain their bloated domestic spending and neglect their defenses.



It seems unlikely that Americans will embrace such an approach. “Defending our allies’ security” ranked near the bottom of Americans’ foreign policy priorities — tied with “Limiting Climate Change” — in the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ most recent report on American public opinion and U.S. foreign policy.9 The best recourse, therefore, is to reconsider our global policing role, encourage other countries to defend themselves and their interests, and bring the object of our foreign policy in line with the public’s wishes.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family’s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage  —   not his own family’s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump’s products  —   a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores  —   the president took to Twitter to complain that “Ivanka has been treated so unfairly” by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then   it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump’s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump’s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the president’s tweet was not about business but about “an attack on his daughter. ” “For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family,” Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven   countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer’s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump’s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the Nordstrom statement said. “We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. ” As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate. “It is a total misuse of presidential power,” said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. “He is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line  —   they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president. ” Mr. Trump’s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her “multiyear term” as “one of the most photographed women in the world”  —   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate’s wife and now first lady  —   as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump’s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family’s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. “He has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,” Mr. Weissman said. “That is obviously not the case. ” Ivanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington. She has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom’s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line. The Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump’s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores. Last week, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees  —   a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  —   telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into” the racks where most products hang, the note read. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded. ” The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise, “not to remove it from the sales floor,” said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers’ parent corporation. “We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,” she said. Ms. Thompson did not respond directly to questions about whether instructing stores to discard signs was unusual. But an employee at one of the company’s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there. Neiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump’s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy’s, the nation’s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale’s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale’s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating. “I think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka’s sales numbers and weighing whether they’re worth all the problems she’s brought them,” said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products."
"**Random border checks will be imposed to stop French holidaymakers going to ski in neighbouring Switzerland, Prime Minister Jean Castex has said.**
France, in common with Germany and Italy, is shutting its ski lifts over Christmas to stop the spread of Covid-19, but Swiss slopes are already open.
The ski season at Christmas and the New Year is a vital part of the economy for many European countries
Mr Castex said it was his duty to protect fellow citizens.
""The conclusion you need to make is that 'I'm not going to Switzerland',"" he told BFMTV on Wednesday, adding that anyone who did go would face quarantine on their return.
Several EU leaders have tried to co-ordinate plans ahead of Christmas.
However, Switzerland is not part of the European Union, and Austria and Spain are keen not to shut their slopes entirely.
That has left one French town hall on the Swiss border draping Swiss flags from its windows in protest at the French decision not to allow the ski lifts to run. ChÃ¢tel is among a number of resorts on both sides of the border that make up the Portes du Soleil ski area.
Mayor Nicolas Rubin accused French leaders of failing to listen and consult. ""We've got a problem with the French government which shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,"" he told French radio.
In Switzerland itself the situation is still unfolding. Alpine resorts want to minimise restrictions but the government will decide on Friday whether to impose a limit on visitors.
Austria on Wednesday announced that skiing would be allowed from 24 December.
However, Austrian hotels will stay closed until 7 January and quarantine requirements for people from countries with more than 100 cases per 100,000 - which include Germany and Italy - are likely to severely restrict visits from abroad.
Other EU countries are expected to set out their Covid plans for the coming weeks:
Germany seeks EU deal to close ski resorts
How Europeans are preparing to celebrate Christmas
Live updates: 'No corners cut in vaccine approval'
""I'm doing my utmost to appeal to every colleague,"" Jean Castex said. ""The Italian prime minister, the German chancellor and France are working together. The Spaniards and Swiss aren't going along with us, but diplomatic action is under way.""
He said his intention was to protect French resorts as well as French citizens from coronavirus, so not only would checks be put in place on the border, but prefects in areas along the border could impose seven-day isolation while Covid testing took place.
France is hoping to reopen its ski slopes from 20 January but the prime minister says the aim for the next few weeks is to prevent an influx of visitors over the festive season.
Among the most notorious outbreaks during the last ski season was at the Austrian resort of Ischgl, where visitors from as many as 45 countries said they caught coronavirus. Authorities are facing possible compensation claims from thousands of people for failing to act fast enough.
The World Health Organization says the problem lies not so much in the nature of skiing but in travelling to the ski slopes and in mixing with other skiers afterwards."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

graphic by Jo NovaThis must be personally satisfying for Steve McIntyre, though I doubt the folks at RealClimate will have the integrity to acknowledge that he was right, and they were wrong.
It seems that in the latest publication from CRU’s Keith Briffa, they decided to leave out those elements (The most influential tree in the world) Steve identified that led to the Yamal Superstick.
Have a look at this remarkable graph below.

McIntyre writes:
Unreported by CRU is that they’ve resiled from the Yamal superstick of Briffa 2000 and Briffa et al 2008 and now advocate a Yamal chronology, the modern portion of which is remarkably similar to the calculations in my posts of September 2009 here and May 2012 here, both of which were reviled by Real Climate at the time.
In today’s post, I’ll demonstrate the degree to which the new Briffa version has departed from the superstick of Briffa 2000 and Briffa et al 2008 and the surprising degree to which it approaches versions shown at CA.

Figure 3. Comparison of Briffa et al 2008 superstick to yamal_trw chronology of Briffa et al 2013. Both in z-scores.
[…]
…the next graphic shows the two CA calculations that had been so reviled by CRU and Real Climate (the green chronology of Sept 2009 and the May 2012 calculation with updated information from Hantemirov). I think that I’m entitled to observe that the B13 chronology is more similar to the two reviled CA calculations than it is to the Briffa et al 2008 superstick. Needless to say, this was not reported in CRU’s recent Real Climate article. 
Figure 4. Comparison of B13 Yamal chronology to CA (Climate Audit) calculations.
omnologos points out this missive from Gavin Schmidt on RealClimate:
The irony is of course that the demonstration that a regional reconstruction is valid takes effort, and needs to be properly documented. That requires a paper in the technical literature and the only way for Briffa et al to now defend themselves against McIntyre’s accusations is to publish that paper (which one can guarantee will have different results to what McIntyre has thrown together). 
Looks like that guarantee expired.

@Steve McIntyre
From Fig. 4 above:
it’s quite obvious that in 2009 and again in 2011, you shamelessly plagiarised Briffa 2013
Easily the worst sin in the academic book, run a close second only by disrupting the space-time continuum in order to perform the plagiarism
Too Funny! To prevent this from happening again, we need to establish a Pre-plagiarism Crimes unit, complete with a minority report. /sarc

The watermelon cultists of the Church of Gaia delude themselves that the wind turbines and solar panels they fetishise are going to save the planet from the evil sky-dragon, climate change. This is rubbish, of course. Wind and solar, despite decades of taxpayer-funded indulgence, still account for a bare 1% of global energy consumption. The idea that they will imminently replace fossil fuels is a delusion.



But just how environmentally friendly are they, really?



Not only do solar panels and wind turbines create massive amounts of pollution and environmental degradation during their manufacture, they don’t work for very long (about half the life-span, or less, of a traditional power source) – and when they do, they leave a shocking mess behind.



Researchers estimate the U.S. will have more than 720,000 tons of blade material to dispose of over the next 20 years, a figure that doesn’t include newer, taller higher-capacity versions.



The 20-year-old turbines are babies, compared to the 200-metre tall behemoths being built today. The disposal problem is only going to get worse.



There aren’t many options to recycle or trash turbine blades, and what options do exist are expensive, partly because the U.S. wind industry is so young. It’s a waste problem that runs counter to what the industry is held up to be […]



Ninety percent of a turbine’s parts can be recycled or sold, according to Van Vleet, but the blades, made of a tough but pliable mix of resin and fiberglass — similar to what spaceship parts are made from — are a different story.



“The blades are kind of a dud because they have no value,” he said.



That might be 90% of the **parts** , but it’s not necessarily 90% of the **mass**. The blades make up the bulk of a wind turbine.



Decommissioned blades are also notoriously difficult and expensive to transport. They can be anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long and need to be cut up onsite before getting trucked away on specialized equipment — which costs money — to the landfill.



So, that’s tons of fibreglass being cut up and buried. Then there’s the concrete – which generates huge amounts of carbon emissions in the first place.



[Turbine owners] will only remediate the site to a depth of four feet, leaving most of the massive concrete foundations, which go as deep as 15 feet, used to anchor the wind turbines , in the ground indefinitely.



Furthermore, according to the website Renewable Technology, Nobles Wind facility has an extensive underground collector cable system, laid at a depth of four feet, connecting the turbines to a central substation…the Palmer’s Wind Farm project explicitly states that cables deeper than 4 feet would not be removed.



  
It’s not enough that green scammers hoover up trillions of taxpayer dollars to build these inefficient, destructive eco-crucifixes. They’re going to stiff the taxpayer to get rid of the wretched things, too.



It looks like Minnesota will have a very expensive mess to clean up when the wind turbines currently operating in the state reach the end of their 20 year useful lifetimes […]it will cost approximately $445,000 (in 2009 dollars) per turbine to decommission the wind facility […]bringing the total cost of decommissioning the Nobles project to $71 million. Xcel also states that these cost estimates are conservative.



  
As is so often the case with “renewable” energy scams, wind turbines are useless boondoggles which suck up bucketloads of taxpayer dollars, wreak environmental havoc, slaughter millions of birds and bats, and leave behind a legacy of massive end-of-life costs and enduring environmental pollution.



They’re the perfect symbol for the green movement.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I keep reading these claims that we’re all going to starve because of global warming. People say it’s going to be the death of agriculture, that increasing temperatures will cause significant drops in crop yields. Here’s a typical bit of alarmism (emphasis mine):
A study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), indicates that climate change would hit developing countries the hardest, leading to massive decline in crop yields and production.
Whoa, a massive decline in crop yields due to increasing temperatures, sounds scary. So I thought I’d review the facts. Here is the global situation, showing the global yields of rice, corn, and wheat, along with the change in global temperature.
Figure 1. Changes in global grain yields and global temperatures 1961-2011. Data Sources: FAO, BEST, Photo 
Now call me crazy, but what I see going on there is not a global crisis. Nor is it “massive declines”. Notice that (according to BEST) the global temperature has gone up one full degree centigrade … anyone remember any thermal crises that have resulted from that one degree of warming? Since two degrees is supposed to bring untold sorrows, where are the sorrows of one degree? Where is the lethal sea level rise? Where are the disasters? ¿Où sont les neiges d’antan? And most of all, where are the decreases in yield from that one degree of warming?

Of course, you could say that this is just because it’s a global average, and not all countries produce wheat, so we wouldn’t expect good agreement between global temperature and global grain production. And you might be right. So … here’s the same chart, only this time just for the US;
Figure 2. As in FIgure 1, except for the US rather than for the whole globe. BEST US temperature data.
Again, there is no thermal related decline in yields. According to BEST the US, like the globe, has gone up about a degree since 1960 … where are the climate refugees? Where are the corpses? Where are the thermal catastrophes? And more to the current point, where are the declines in food production? I don’t see them.
Finally, I thought “Well, maybe if I detrend all of the US data and then see how well related the change in annual temperature is to the change in annual crop yields” … no joy there either. Below are the measurements for those relationships. The strength of a relationship between two variables  is measured by something called “R squared” (written “R2“), which varies from 0.0 for no relationship between the variables, up to 1.0 for perfectly related variables. Here’s the relationship of US temperature and US crop yields:
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Maize (corn) yield : 0.001
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Rice yield : 0.000
R2, US BEST Land Temperature and US Wheat yield : 0.022
In other words, no relationship at all. I gotta confess, I don’t see what folks are screaming about. If you believe the BEST data, we’ve seen a full degree of temperature rise in the last half century, and it hasn’t done us any harm—no atolls gone underwater, no millions of climate refugees, no increases in extreme weather. And through all of that temperature rise, the crop yields have kept going up. Will they reach a maximum? Assuredly they will … but it doesn’t seem like that maximum yield is going to be much affected by the temperature.
So I fear that once again we’ll have to postpone Paul Ehrlich’s celebration. He’s been predicting the global Malthusian food crisis for decades now, to no avail. Near as I can tell, according to the Malthusian philosophers like Ehrlich, the problem is that this continued increase in crop yields works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory …
w.
Further Reading: I put up a post a while ago called “Border Transgressions“, about wheat production and temperature in Mexico. I also discussed how much food people actually have to eat in “I am so tired of Malthus“.
[UPDATE] Some people seem to have understood me as saying that because temperatures were rising and crop yields were rising as well, that the rising temperatures were causing the rising yields. I am not saying that. It may indeed be true that in a warmer world, the general yield would be better, and I see no reason it would not be better … but that’s not what I’m saying.
Some people seem to have understood me as saying that crops are not affected by temperatures above their optimum range. I am not saying that. All crops have preferred temperatures, above or below which they do not produce as well.
People are over-thinking this. What I am saying is simple. It is the answer to the question in the subject of the post—do increasing temperatures lower crop yields? I say no.
Note that I am not saying that increasing temperatures increase crop yields, although they may do so. Instead, I am falsifying the alarmists forecasting things like “massive drops” in crop yields. I’m not saying yields will or won’t go up if it gets warmer … I’m saying they won’t go down.
Here’s what lowers crop yields. Bad weather forecasts lower crop yields. If the farmer knows it will be colder next year, don’t worry, she’ll make money, she’ll plant later, use a different variety, plant beans instead of corn, get a bumper crop, be the envy of her neighbors. Same thing in reverse if she knows it will be hotter, she’ll plant early and have her crop in while the neighbors’ crops are wilting in the field.
But a bad forecast, she puts in hot weather seed and it turns out to be a cold year, the yield will go down.
So increasing temperatures, particularly predicted increasing temperatures, particularly predicted gradual increases over a century, will be lost in the noise of the thousands of changes that farmers do each and every year to account for the much larger interannual variations and interdecadal variations. Every year, the farmers successfully deal with the fact that not next century but next year may be two or three degrees warmer or cooler than this year … do you really think a degree’s rise spread over decades will affect those farmers’ crops? It’s lost in the noise, they’ve got three degrees to think about. Here’s the part that I think many folks don’t understand.
At the end of the day, crop yield is a measure of the farmers, not of the temperature.
In evidence of this, I offer the fact that the above analysis of the detrended US temperature data and detrended US crop yield data showed only an insignificant relationship between the two.
w.
[UPDATE 2] Someone downthread asked about the yields in the poorest countries. Here is that data.

As you can see, progress has been much slower in the developing world. However, even in the worst off countries on the planet, even with the warming of the last 50 years, the yields are still rising. And it is worth noting that the worst countries are all at or above the global average yield rates in 1961. In my lifetime, the poor of the world have moved to where the global average was when I was a kid …
And obviously, of course, at this end of the spectrum even the simplest of improved methods and seeds would double the yield … which is why temperature is not the issue, and never was.

"Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, has been named a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, one of the top leadership positions at the newspaper. Ms. Blumenstein will become one of the   women in The Times’s newsroom. She will join three other deputy managing editors  —   Janet Elder Clifford Levy, who was promoted last week and Matthew Purdy. In a note to the staff announcing the appointment on Tuesday, Dean Baquet, the executive editor, and Joe Kahn, the managing editor, said that Ms. Blumenstein, 50, would help the newsroom “do all the big things we intend to do in 2017 and beyond. ” In particular, they said, Ms. Blumenstein “will focus on making sure we remain an essential destination for readers interested in business, finance, economics and technology. ” In recent months, the newsroom has had a dearth of female leaders. In September, Susan Chira stepped down as deputy executive editor to write about gender issues, and in December, Lydia Polgreen, an associate masthead editor, left to become the top editor at The Huffington Post. Ms. Blumenstein’s appointment will quite likely be seen as a positive step, though it is notable that The Times named an outsider rather than promoting a woman from within. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kahn said it was “absolutely not the case’’ that they could not find a woman within The Times to play a role in newsroom leadership. “This is about Rebecca, who I think has a skill set, a perspective and the experience running a big newsroom that Dean and I and the others at the top of the masthead felt that we needed, to make sure that we’re putting our best foot forward in terms of this digital transition,” Mr. Kahn said. He added that there would be other masthead announcements soon. Ms. Blumenstein was seen as a potential successor to Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Journal, and news of her departure was met with surprise and sadness in the Journal newsroom, where she is known for her passion for breaking news. Asked how it felt to lure someone of Ms. Blumenstein’s caliber from a highly respected competitor, Mr. Kahn was circumspect in his reply. “I can only say that I follow and deeply admire The Journal’s coverage, and they’re a fierce competitor and a constant source of concern for us,” Mr. Kahn said. “So of course it’s meaningful to have one of their top editors come and join us. ” In a note to employees, Mr. Baker called Ms. Blumenstein “a peerless exponent and advocate of the very highest quality journalism. ” “She has been a singularly principled and dignified leader and a great mentor and friend to so many colleagues here,” he wrote. The appointment comes as both news organizations work to determine a strategy for an increasingly digital world. Both have initiated sweeping newsroom strategy reviews that have left employees anxious and uncertain about their futures. Last month, The Times released the findings of its review in a report that called for rapid change. Ms. Blumenstein has worked at The Journal since 1995, where she has held numerous senior positions, including managing editor of WSJ. com and international editor. As the newspaper’s China bureau chief, she led her team to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. China was also where she and Mr. Kahn, who worked in the Beijing bureau for The Times, got to know each other, Mr. Kahn said. “She was unrelenting in pushing her team hard to beat us,” he said."

"Hours before the start of the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21, every Metro car leading to the National Mall was packed so tight that it could take on no more riders. At station after station, the train doors would open, and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters  —   women, men, children, babies, the occasional dog  —   waiting on the platform. As people emerged from underground into the morning air, it was hard to tell where to go, so they found their way by gauging the human density, moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all. There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there  —   activists and celebrities speaking into microphones  —   but much of the crowd couldn’t see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers. By the time they were meant to march, the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route, from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House. The signs they carried spoke to any number of issues: immigration, abortion, race, the environment, inequality, the new president. REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink “pussyhats” that many marchers wore  —   a reference to Donald Trump’s    boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals  —   had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image. It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters  —   estimates range from three to five million  —   took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla. Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N. D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump’s election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women. Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made   white voters “feel excluded,” according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn’t get their heartland relatives on their side. But a crew of   angry women was still aiming its ire at Trump. In the hours after his victory on Nov. 8, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted to Facebook, suggesting a march on Washington. Some women on the East Coast had the same idea. At first, these suggestions were so impulsive that they seemed almost metaphorical. But within days, tens of thousands of women had pledged to join in. Over the course of two months, the idea became something far bigger than initially imagined. Eventually, an entire organizing team would have permits,   fleets of buses, portable toilets, celebrity sponsors and support from Gloria Steinem. Men meekly asked their female family members and Twitter followers: “Are we allowed to join?” By the middle of January, with the event shaping up to be the   demonstration, the New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait worried that “Women’s March” was too niche an organizing principle  —   it was a “bad name,” he tweeted, a divisive “brand. ” The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump’s executive order halting travel from seven   countries, the march’s striking proof of concept  —   hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you  —   fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition’s first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that “women” was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump. Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women’s movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold. Clinton’s loss on Nov. 8 was a pivotal,   moment in the course of the American women’s movement. In an evening, the   first female president was shoved to the side by what a sizable chunk of the nation saw as that classic historical figure: the male chauvinist pig. In parts of the popular imagination, it wasn’t just a loss for Clinton or for the Democratic Party. It was a repudiation of feminism itself. But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn’t run for president as a “women’s candidate” if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. “They do not want someone who would be the first mama,” he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO’s “Veep” would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. “I can’t identify myself as a woman!” she tells her staff. “People can’t know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women. ” In the eight years between Clinton’s first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women’s blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women’s magazines did  —   fashion, movies, sex  —   but taking on the women’s magazines too. By Obama’s second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a   of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women’s site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to “manspreading. ” Pop stars  —   people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift  —   were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online. Feminism became increasingly popular, but in a very specific way  —   one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online. The feminist priorities of this new media landscape tended to involve topics that   women would experience firsthand: reproductive rights, catcalling, campus rape, professional opportunity,   representation. The writers setting its tone tended to be young women who were asked to produce large amounts of clickable copy, for not much money, in very little time, exploring feminist issues not through   reporting but through “takes” on the women already making news: the   balance of Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer the pay gap between Jennifer Lawrence and her male  . Some content chased sexist slights down to the most passing personal concerns, like an item from The Huffington Post that sighed: “There is no proper way for a woman to cut her hair, let alone do anything right in this world. ” It’s not that women’s activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women’s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J. Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women’s market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women’s rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered “freedom from household drudgery” Shredded Wheat promised a “declaration of independence” from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size. It’s telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as  . This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman’s frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists  —   they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting “the integrity of women who are ambitious. ” Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had “been taking a feminist stance without actually saying so. ” Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity. In 2013, “Lean In,” by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this   subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book “sort of a feminist manifesto,” but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on “internal obstacles” and “dismantle the hurdles in ourselves. ” This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the   feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: “We’re committed to solving problems. If we can’t find a solution, we’ll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag). ” By the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn’t just permitted to run as a feminist  —   she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women’s debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female   candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be “safe, legal and rare  —   and by rare I mean rare. ” In last year’s debates, she stopped qualifying her support. “I will defend Planned Parenthood,” she said in one. “I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions. ” Meanwhile, her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the   feminist mode. The candidate affirmed her feminism in a video interview with Lena Dunham, posed in a Kim Kardashian selfie and made a cameo on “Broad City. ” Her campaign posted a   listicle informing Latinos that Clinton was “just like your abuela. ” (With the Twitter hashtag #NotMyAbuela, those voters begged to differ.) Her site sold embroidered pillows that said “A Woman’s Place Is in the White House” and a   with a big “YAAAS, HILLARY!” printed over her senior portrait from high school. After Trump accused her of playing “the woman’s card,” her campaign introduced a free   “Official Hillary for America Woman Card” that drove more than $2 million in donations within days. One young woman earnestly prodded her at an Iowa campaign event: “If you could choose, would you rather be the president or Beyoncé?” Pop feminism, having been washed of its political urgency, was now being integrated back into politics at the highest level. The candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement. Her image became closely aligned with two metaphors  —   the pantsuit and the glass ceiling  —   that speak to a particular kind of woman: a corporate careerist at the top of her field. A “secret” Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, popped up to encourage Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits to the polls. When she clinched the Democratic nomination for president last June  —   the one she would formally accept the following month, dressed in suffragist white  —   Clinton called back to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, where “a small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights. ” The feminist project started there, she implied  —   and she was going to finish it. When Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the   fractures between different groups of women exploded into view.   percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton’s campaign. Despite Trump’s palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women  —   and that infamous tape  —   he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity. In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group’s founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn’t exactly a call to activism  —   it was a   book. “You are a force, Pantsuit Nation,” she wrote. “Let’s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world. ” The idea brought on a revolt. “The N. R. A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,” one commenter wrote. “Pantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is ‘storytelling’ and now, selling books. What a colossal waste. ” But for some outside observers, this was a productive comeuppance. Rhon   an associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts, published “An Open Letter to White Liberal Feminists,” on the website Black Perspectives, expressing her disappointment that it had taken Donald Trump to shake them into her reality. “I am delighted that you have received the potential awakening of a lifetime, and that now you might actually get what so many of us have been describing all along,” she wrote. “Welcome to that deep perpetual angst. Embrace it, and allow it to motivate you to a deeper form of action. ” In those same November weeks, the nascent    project was navigating its own identity crisis. Some of the early organizers had    jobs  —   pastry chef, yoga instructor. One of the women, Bob Bland, a fashion designer, had amassed a small online following by designing “NASTY WOMAN” and “BAD HOMBRE”   and selling them online. “I had this whole network of ‘nasty women’ and ‘bad hombres,’’u2009” she told me. “After the election, they were looking to me like, ‘What are we going to do next? ’’u2009” Disparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides. The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women’s organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women’s movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women’s rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: “The leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps. ” A “buzz of disapprobation” spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman’s testimony would distract from the convention’s focus. “Don’t let her speak, Mrs. Gage  —   it will ruin us,” one said. “Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced. ” Throughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women’s suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because “there were very few women in those days who dared to ‘speak in meeting,’’u2009” as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth’s very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,” she said. “Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!” She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. “I have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain’t I a woman?” In that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth’s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her “with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. ” But two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women’s meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists’ signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or   ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an “asylum for the trash of all nations,” arguing that women’s suffrage ought to be restricted. “Think what it means to give it to all women,” she said. “Our criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals. ” One curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to “stand aside to see ‘Sambo’ walk into the kingdom first,” as she put it in The National   Standard. Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women’s social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged.   clubs leveraged   women’s leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women’s Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, “it is not a fad. ” Black women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn’t just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too. This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism’s second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the   author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting’s host  —   Muriel Fox, the   female executive at the world’s largest   agency  —   were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they “went bonkers. ” Friedan’s 1963 book, “The Feminine Mystique,” had been an awakening for a class of white, married,   women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a “mainstream” feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program. Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and “focus her attention on matters of Black Power. ” As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women’s Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn’t account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism  —   it was “merely female  . ” There has never been one women’s movement. It’s difficult, for example, to say that the American feminist project started in Seneca Falls, N. Y. in 1848, because black women were not invited to that convention. It’s hard to say that electing a woman as president would have been feminism’s crowning achievement, because the success of one woman does not naturally trickle down to all. The history of the women’s movement is one of warring factions and sharp  . But its 150 years of navigating internal disputes put it in a position to lead what seemed, at the end of last fall, like a highly divided left. “It’s embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn’t know the term ‘intersectionality’ when we started,” Bob Bland, the Women’s March   told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working “in so many different intersectionalities” and hoped to reach a “a wide intersectionality of people” in a march that reflected “all of the different intersections of human rights. ” That magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be “compound discrimination”  —   both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as   or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides. That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw’s paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until “intersectionality” became a rallying cry  —   the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of   feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of   pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of   its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a     feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It’s hard to “lean in” to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People. com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton. Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: “This is not the place for divisiveness. ”) Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism’s mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions  —   all in the space of two months. Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble  —   a white producer and   of the media company OkayAfrica  —   made a pivotal intervention in its planning. “I thought the stakes were so high,” she told me. “It needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country. ” At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists  —   Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory  —   got on board. These women hadn’t necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn’t necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march’s Facebook page: “Can you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?” The three women  —   one Chicana Latina, one   one black  —   met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a   initiative. In 2015, they organized a   march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was “How do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?” Meanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. “I don’t have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,” Sarsour told me. “I’ve been learning a lot,” she said, and working toward becoming “more comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn’t particularly include Muslim women. ” The organizers appeared on the   radio morning show “The Breakfast Club” and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women’s club with a $2, 250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson. When I called Kimberlé Crenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn’t hear the rally, and “I’m kind of glad about it,” she told me. “We were in this sea of humanity. ” Wading through the crowd, she said, “I saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women’s March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time. ” The women’s movement’s tendency toward a singular perspective is “not an exceptional problem for feminism,” Crenshaw told me. “Patriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn’t always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing. ” “The   question is: Can these feminisms live together under an   banner?” Crenshaw said. “It happened for 24 hours all across the world. ” When I made my way back to my hotel after the march, the cheers of the crowd fading into the distance, I opened my laptop and saw a different version of what I had just seen in person. Now it was all filtered through my own   bubble  —   that of a   white woman who lives in Brooklyn. Facebook’s trending topics, tailored to fulfill each user’s particular online habits, served me up a   version of the day’s events. It pointed me toward the speeches of Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, and nobody else. As scenes of the march traveled through the media and across the web, the story spun out in even more directions. Twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march: DON’T FORGET: WHITE WOMEN VOTED FOR TRUMP and BLACK WOMEN TRIED TO SAVE Y’ALL and I’LL SEE YOU NICE WHITE LADIES AT THE NEXT #BLACKLIVESMATTER MARCH, RIGHT? But for the moment, at least, Trump appears to be the great uniter. In the days and weeks since the march, its energy spilled into spontaneous actions across the country, with protesters coming together on behalf of Muslims and immigrants. Donations poured into Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Congressional switchboards were inundated with calls. When The Washington Post polled Americans   it registered a huge shift in energy among Democrats, especially Democratic women, 40 percent of whom said they planned to get more involved in activism. But liberals are not the only ones drawing inspiration from the protests. Flip to Fox News, click around conservative blogs or browse   Twitter, and you can watch the demonstrations fuel a different kind of opposition narrative. After the march, Fox News set clips of rally speeches to foreboding music. Breitbart published photos with the headline “See what a massive, Hillary shaped bullet America just dodged?” The   Media Research Center aggregated the most “vile and ridiculous signs. ” Twitter exploded with   attacks on Linda Sarsour, who was called a “terrorist” who “loves ISIS. ” When the annual March for Life hit the Mall to demonstrate against abortion rights, The Blaze called it “the real women’s march. ” (The Women’s March did, at one point, remove the name of an   group from its list of partners, after an uproar.) According to Public Policy Polling, 48 percent of Trump voters think the protesters who convened at airports to protest the travel ban were paid by George Soros. Trump tweeted recently: “Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves “the silent majority,” while his critics identify as the “popular vote. ” When I called Eleanor Smeal, a   of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. “We don’t really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,” she told me. “I think they’re with us. ” For now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too  —   including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they’re quick to tell you that they’re of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. “I know of no other time when it would be more important,” Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. “That’s not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it. ”"
"The main reason for the gender gaps at work  —   why women are paid less, why they’re less likely to reach the top levels of companies, and why they’re more likely to stop working after having children  —   is employers’ expectation that people spend long hours at their desks, research has shown. It’s especially difficult for women because they have disproportionate responsibility for caregiving. Flexibility regarding the time and place that work gets done would go a long way toward closing the gaps, economists say. Yet when people ask for it, especially parents, they can be penalized in pay and promotions. Social scientists call it the flexibility stigma, and it’s the reason that even when companies offer such policies, they’re not widely used. A new job search company, Werk, is trying to address the problem by negotiating for flexibility with employers before posting jobs, so employees don’t have to. All the positions listed on the Werk site, including some from Facebook, Uber and Samsung, are highly skilled jobs that offer some sort of control over the time and place of work. People can apply to jobs that let them work away from the office all the time or some of the time, and at hours other than    part time or with minimal travel. Another option gives workers the freedom to adjust their schedules, no questions asked, because of unpredictable obligations, like a sleepless night with a toddler or a trip to the emergency room with an older parent. “Nobody wants to be the female in the department who says, ‘My kid threw up on me this morning I can’t come in,’ ” said Annie Dean, who worked as a lawyer before starting Werk with Anna Auerbach, a former consultant. “Eighty percent of companies say they offer flexibility, but it’s a black market topic. You raise it and you’re not taken seriously. ” For now, Werk is a limited experiment. Most of the employers are small companies, and it is aimed at an elite group of women  —   highly educated and on a leadership track. But it could provide lessons for how to improve work and make it more equal for a broader group. Women who have less education or are paid hourly wages have significantly less flexibility than professional women to begin with. It makes working and caregiving that much harder. Motherhood presents a different challenge for the elite women that Werk was made for. The careers that pay the most and require the most education, like business and law, also have the most gender inequality. Why? Economists have found it’s a result of the long hours and limited flexibility. When educated mothers leave their jobs, it’s often because they feel pushed out by inflexible employers, according to sociologists. It’s a big reason the top of corporate America is still so male 4 percent of the chief executives of companies in the S. P. 500 are women. “They want top leadership roles,” said Ms. Dean, who thought of the idea for Werk with Ms. Auerbach after they each had children. “The only reason they’re not getting there is they’re going through this phase in their life where working 16 hours at a single desk is incompatible with their life. ” Seventy percent of working mothers say having a flexible work schedule is extremely important to them, according to a Pew survey. So do 48 percent of working fathers. Workplace flexibility reduces turnover and   conflict, according to much of the research, including a study by 10 researchers from seven universities published in December. Yet when people get flexible work arrangements, they’re generally isolated cases  —   for longtime employees whom companies trust and don’t want to lose. The employers using Werk say they get access to highly skilled employees who might not otherwise apply. Gerard Masci, founder and chief executive of Lowercase, a   eyeglass maker in Brooklyn, just hired a vice president for communications on Werk. She works   and remotely, except for monthly   meetings. “I don’t care if this week you work less if in a month you work more, and whether they work in the space or not is irrelevant,” Mr. Masci said. “All I care about is the productivity in the end. ” “The happier she is in her flexibility,” he said, “the more engaged she’s going to be in her work. ” Erin Fahs turned to Werk after her husband was transferred to Fort Myers, Fla. and she needed to find a new job. She wanted to work part time and from home because she was pregnant and the primary caregiver for their    daughter. She found three jobs on Werk that would let her do that, and took one as the business manager for the Collective Good, which does consulting for nonprofits. “Getting to have those direct conversations with the C. E. O. about what matters made it so much different from when I was applying for jobs earlier in my career,” Ms. Fahs, 33, said. She has a baby sitter 10 hours a week and works the other 10 hours when her daughter is sleeping. She has a few set meetings, which she attends via Google Hangouts  —   and gives her daughter an iPad for a diversion if there is a work emergency. She plans to expand to   work after maternity leave. This type of flexibility, while valuable, would not magically solve workplace problems. For one, any solution would need to be for both women and men. Some jobs have to be done at a certain time and place, like teaching and food service. And even at companies where it’s possible to let employees work at the time and place of their choosing, a different type of manager is required. Best Buy tried it for corporate employees, then revoked it. “There are a vast number of jobs that could be handled in an    way, but it’s just easier to measure performance by presence,” said   Slaughter, the chief executive of the think tank New America, who has written about gender and work and advises Werk. “So it is a real adjustment for managers. ”"

Dr. Ryan Maue posted one of his WeatherBell analysis maps on Twitter today, and the result is no Headline maker, it is simply “normal”.
He writes (image follows): 
February 2013 global temperature anomaly compared to 1981-2010 mean: -0.001°C or 1/1000th of a degree below avg.

It will be interesting to see what the other climate data sources show for February.

Paul Eaton, who runs the Royal Inn at Horsebridge, near Tavistock, just inside the Devon border, said: ""Some of my regulars are already planning where they can go in Cornwall.
""It's a long border, with pubs scattered both sides.""
Kim Conchie, chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said it had been ""a difficult year"" but this marked ""the first stage of securing jobs and companies for our future"".
Holiday homes letting agent Lin Wallis in Cornwall tweeted she had five inquiries in 10 minutes after the announcement.
In the seven days to last Saturday the rate of infections in Cornwall was 59 per 100,000 people, the England average was 169.
In the same period there were 337 new cases, down by 176 on the previous week.
Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, said Cornwall returning to tier one restrictions was ""particularly good news for the thousands of hospitality businesses"".
He added: ""However whilst we can welcome this news it should be no grounds for complacency.""
Tier one means people can meet indoors and out up to a maximum group of six, pubs and restaurants can re-open, closing at 23:00 GMT but people will still be encouraged to work from home.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December."
"**A director of public heath said care home residents may not get the newly-approved Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.**
Care home residents and staff are top of the government's provisional priority list for any vaccine.
But Northamptonshire's health chief, Lucy Wightman, said the Pfizer vaccine's storage and transportation requirements made that a ""challenge"".
She said care home residents may have to wait for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine.
The UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was safe for roll-out next week.
The vaccine is made in Belgium, must be stored at around -70C (-94F) and, once delivered, can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
However, speaking during a BBC East live stream on Tuesday, Ms Wightman said: ""It can only be transported four times and once it's been delivered to a local area that is its fourth transportation, so it then can't be sent out to anywhere else.""
She said this meant its delivery would have to be straight to mass vaccination centres or hospitals.
""But obviously what the government wanted to do was vaccinate care home residents first, and the challenge is you can't do that as you can't break up that delivery to a county,"" she said.
Ms Wightman said she would wait for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine for care home residents.
That vaccine, which is yet to be approved, can be kept at regular fridge temperature making distribution easier.
Prof Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said whether vaccines could be delivered to care homes was ""dependent on deployment and implementation.""
Prof Lim said there would be ""flexibility"" in roll-out of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine and more than one type of vaccine would be needed to reach all vulnerable groups.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the first load of the Pfizer vaccine would be delivered next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.

By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court recently stayed implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan, a set of regulations that would have required the states to come up with plans designed to drastically reduce the use of coal as a source of energy for electric power generation.



Since first proposed in the summer of 2014, many and perhaps most lawyers looking at the issue have concluded that the Clean Power Plan would likely never survive judicial review on the substantive question of whether it was a reasonable interpretation of an ancient and seldom‐​used provision of the Clean Air Act (Section 111(d)).



Why would the EPA have ever taken the time and trouble to promulgate a regulation with such a low chance of ever being upheld by the courts? In persuading the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit not to stay the Clean Power Plan, the EPA itself provided the answer. The agency proclaimed proudly that even though its earlier 2013 regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal‐​burning power plants had been struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, the mere threat that those regulations might be upheld had shut down many coal‐​burning facilities and caused others to spend up to $10 billion on compliance. Thus, the EPA argued, since unlawful regulations terrorize regulatory targets into compliance, there is no need to hurry in declaring those regulations officially unlawful when the targets have already suffered irreparable loss.





The EPA’s attempt to coerce decarbonization by promulgating regulations without regard to their legality is not only a cynical use of regulatory power, but an attempt to override a Congress that is not dysfunctional, but representative.



The cynical and strategic attitude underlying this argument is that the legality of regulation doesn’t matter. What matters instead is that by threatening regulation, the EPA can accomplish its ultimate goal of putting coal‐​burning electric‐​generating facilities out of business.



Climate change legal activists would likely argue that such use of regulatory power is far from cynical, but a heroic attempt to “stop” or “fix” global warming in the face of congressional failure to pass comprehensive climate change legislation. Indeed, after returning to Harvard Law School, former Obama administration climate change czarina Jody Freeman argued in some detail that when Congress fails to act to address pressing problems, regulatory agencies such as EPAshould be free to creatively interpret old statutes, such as the Clean Air Act, to address new problems like climate change.



This argument rests on the explicit assumption that congressional failure to enact comprehensive climate change legislation represents another failure by a dysfunctional Congress. Less explicitly, it assumes that most intelligent people must agree that climate change is a problem demanding federal legislation designed to decarbonize the American economy, and that climate change is a bad problem requiring a fix, however costly and disruptive it might be.



The economics of climate change are much more complicated than this. The EPA has used Obama administration estimates of the total harm from future climate change (the so‐​called social cost of carbon) to justify its regulations under the Clean Air Act. However, buried in the technical support document used to generate those estimates (and a recent National Academies of Science review), one finds clearly that the EPA’s estimated harm from future climate change depends on a whole series of, at best, questionable assumptions. For example, the economic models used to estimate harm assume that even developed countries have very limited ability to adapt to changing climate, an assumption that if true would mean the Netherlands would not be a country, but a shoal in the North Atlantic. And Arizona would not be home to millions of people nor California’s San Joaquin Valley the most productive agricultural area on earth. Instead, they would be uninhabited deserts.



Another big part of the estimated harm from future climate change is the potentially catastrophic type depicted in the movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” in which the North Atlantic Ocean’s meridional circulation shuts down, causing an almost instantaneous Ice Age over the entire Northern Hemisphere.



As laughable as that scenario may be, no less laughable is the way that climate economists have come up with their estimates for the cost of such future climate change: asking other climate economists for their best guesses. And all estimates of future potential harm from climate change rest on estimates of future temperature change, even as University of Alabama’s John Christy has repeatedly testified before Congress that the warming forecast by the computer models is breathtakingly high.



A body of recent economic work (which I survey in an article forthcoming in the Cato journal Regulation) shows that whether one considers agricultural productivity, human health, or virtually any other determinant of human well‐​being, climate became less and less important over the course of the 20th century. It is poorer societies that suffer differentially from the vagaries of weather and climate. If the future will be different and people will lose their ability to cope with climate, it will be primarily due to populations becoming poorer and devoid of the capital required for investment in technological innovation.



In this light, it is hardly astounding that many people, including members of Congress, would decide against incurring now the enormous economic costs of decarbonizing the American economy in order to prevent highly uncertain and indisputably distant harm from climate change. Others are of the opposite view and believe that now is the time for ending the use of fossil fuels to generate power.



Those holding this view tend to be from states such as California, Washington and Oregon, which get very large fractions of their electricity from hydropower or nuclear. Members of Congress from such states know full well that the EPA’s Clean Power Plan and other steps to decarbonize electricity supply would confer a sizable competitive benefit on their constituents by forcing fossil fuel‐​reliant states to adopt more expensive energy sources.



Congressional failure to enact comprehensive climate change legislation is not a manifestation of a dysfunctional Congress, but of a Congress that is representative, in which the views of those who would lose a lot from immediate steps to decarbonize the American economy have prevailed over the views of those who would be net winners.



The EPA’s attempt to coerce decarbonization by promulgating regulations without regard to their legality is not only a cynical use of regulatory power, but an attempt to override a Congress that is not dysfunctional, but representative.

"WASHINGTON  —   In his first days as President Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai’s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. “With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,” said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. “The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,” he added. “Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ” Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency’s legal authority. “These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,” Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. “Accordingly, they are being revoked. ” The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. “The speed of the ruling and the chairman’s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ” Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. “The key here is that it’s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said."

Seventy-five years ago authoritarian bullies determined to ‘unite’ Europe under the banners of collectivism and identity politics were, thankfully, defeated. The cost was horrendous, but so were the stakes. When the forces of tyranny were defeated, “Never again” was the watch-cry.



 **Except…**



20 years ago, genocide again reared its ugly head on European soil. For all its self-proclaimed moral superiority, the EU did nothing to stop it. Now, 75 years after V.E. Day, an authoritarian “United States of Europe” ideology is once again turning out the lights of freedom on the continent – and its bigger, uglier sibling seeks to impose the same dictatorial stamp on the entire globe.



In the West today, there are no obvious Hitlers or Stalins. Rather, **faceless globalists** work the corridors of the multiple United ­Nations agencies and the Euro­pean Commission to project and **amplify their socialist ideology.** They promote an ever-growing list of evils that is uncritically ­embraced by Western teaching ­institutions, the mainstream media and the courts […]



Testament to the influence of the corridor ideologues is the spectacle of Western children parading fear, self-loathing and guilt. “Capitalism kills”, “Revolution is our only hope”, they protest. Socialism is their utopia.



It’s not as if these ignorant children can claim to have forgotten the lessons of the past record of dismal socialist failures: socialism is spectacularly failing once again in Venezuela.



But, it’s no surprise that children are being so rigorously indoctrinated: education has been easily the most successful victory for the [Long March through the Institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_march_through_the_institutions).



There is a pattern here that suggests central planning. **After all, is it likely the simultaneous denigration of white men, the deprivation of free speech, the politics of climate change, the push for open borders, the sharp rise in anti-Semitism and the demonisation of Christianity could be random?** Call it guided ideological collaboration but it is imported from somewhere and is anything but spontaneous.



Trump is not the first president to see the suffocating hand of unelected elites stifling freedom. What Eisenhower called the “military-industrial complex” is what today is called, variously, the “Deep State” and “the Swamp”.



When Trump won in 2016, commentator Scott Adams warned that, when you set out to drain a swamp, the snakes and alligators get angry and you get swamp water on your pants. The nomenklatura jealously guards its privileges, as the vicious resistance to Brexit shows.



Trump’s “America first” policies have invigorated globalists within the US establishment. As the presidential election draws nearer and fears of his re-election grow, an unprecedented three-year crusade to impeach him has stepped up a gear. In their eagerness to topple this legitimately elected president, the Democrats, the intelligence ser­vices and the mainstream media have colluded to form what is ­effectively a partisan, hostile branch of government within the governing administration.



Yet, despite having their heads firmly wedged up each others’ arses, singing their own praises into their empty vessels, globalists are too often everything they purport to decry.



Globalists argue their mission is noble because it has a higher purpose. Only a common multilateral approach can achieve true diversity, inclusiveness, social justice and wealth and income equality. Yet, their claims are not supported by evidence. In Europe, indeed across the Western world, political polarisation has intensified.



Instances of identity politics, social division and censorship are on the rise. And […] **globalists are architects of much inequality.** It is their ­seductive cocktail of corporate welfare, regulatory protection and co-ordinated monetary policies that has created extensive wealth and privilege opportunities that crony capitalists fiercely defend.



As [Mark Steyn has said](https://www.steynonline.com/7789/the-midnight-train), globalists “don’t see it because they get the full deal: an increasing share of the wealth, with the cultural benefits of great restaurants and cheap nannies…these people do not live in the world they have built for their subjects”. They really think “socialism will work this time,” because it’s worked so well for **them**. Just as it did for the tiny elite of Soviet nomenklatura.



The tendency is always to hope this time it’s different.



Or to feel powerless, or deluded into believing it’s not what it seems. Like a slow-growing cancer, it’s easy to dismiss the first suspicious signs. Nevertheless, the existence of Western civilisation is not preordained and its survival requires more courage, confidence and determination than is presently in evidence. The longer ­apathy prevails, the nearer the road to serfdom becomes. As Churchill warned, for every day’s delay, how much harder the toil?

"Picking the pain reliever that’s best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address. While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks. Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that    pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves. Sales of    medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics. Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only   of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever. A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness. Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients. Those who take any kind of    pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added. Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them: Common brand name: Tylenol Recommended to treat: Headaches, pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4, 000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3, 000 if it is taken for an extended period. What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other    medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen. For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and    cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said. “You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are,” he said. Common brand names: Advil, Motrin Recommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headaches Potential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said. What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an   that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body. Common brand names: Bayer and St. Joseph. It is also found in Excedrin. Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health. Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction children up to their   years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, “Don’t be fooled by packaging. ” In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don’t think that if some is good, more is better. If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking    pain relievers, you can be at risk of a “rebound headache” caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache. Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day) or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said. Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor. “A simple    in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does,” Dr. Duarte said. “A lot of the patients don’t take these medications seriously. ”"
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) More than 1, 300 lives are cut short each year in the Los Angeles area because of air pollution, scientists say. Now, after years of work, regulators are getting ready to adopt their most substantial plan in more than a decade to do something about it. The proposal is outlined in   pages from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, whose jurisdiction extends across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Not surprisingly, it has set off debate, as critics have called the plan too lenient on industry. “California has made clear that it intends to be a leader on environmental issues,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros, a staff attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. “And here we’ve got the Los Angeles air agency not doing all that it can. ” All sides recognize that industries under the agency’s regulatory power  —   including refineries, ports and warehouses  —   must adopt cleaner technologies. The agreement breaks down over how to get there. The draft blueprint would adopt some tougher emissions rules. But it also calls for a carrot approach: roughly $15 billion in handouts over the next 15 years to encourage polluters to clean up. Some community leaders have portrayed the incentives  —   which would surely involve tax increases  —   as a form of corporate welfare at the expense of   families. But supporters of the plan have argued that they are needed to avoid stifling business. Smaller operators, for example, may not be able to afford a new, cleaner truck. “Obviously you can’t make everybody happy,” said Philip M. Fine, deputy executive officer for the air district. “But we think we’ve developed a sensible, comprehensive and regulatory approach. ” At a public meeting last Friday, the air agency’s board was supposed to vote on a final version of the plan. Hundreds of people showed up, filling overflow rooms. Testimony included stories of the personal toll that asthma is taking on young Californians. Business leaders warned of job losses if the plan were amended to add new rules. In the end, the board postponed the vote, citing the unexpected absence of a member. They’ll try again next month.

In an era of misinformation overload, it is disheartening to see the _Washington Post_ perpetuating the ignorance surrounding the issue of outsourcing. To be sure, in addressing the topic in Tuesday's paper, writers Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig, and Zachary A. Goldfarb were merely presenting the case of Obama’s critics ""primarily on the political left,"" who claim the president has failed to make good on his promises to curtail the ""shipping of jobs overseas."" That conclusion may be accurate. But the article’s regurgitation of myths about outsourcing and trade, peddled by those who benefit from restricting it, gives readers a parochial perspective that leaves them confused and uninformed about the manifestations, causes, consequences, benefits, and costs of outsourcing.   
  
Outsourcing is a politically-charged term for U.S. direct investment abroad. Although the large majority of that investment goes to rich countries, the _Post_ article claims that ""American jobs have been shifting to low-wage countries for years, and the trend has continued during Obama’s presidency."" While that may be factually true, the numbers are likely fairly small. Many more jobs have been lost to the adoption of more productive manufacturing techniques and new technologies that require less labor. And we, overall, are much wealthier for it.   
  
The article attributes 450,000 U.S. job losses to imports from China between 2008 and 2010 – a figure plucked from an ""economic model"" at the Economic Policy Institute that has been criticized by everyone in Washington but Chuck Schumer and Sherrod Brown. That estimate is the product of simplistic, inaccurate assumptions equating the value of exports and imports to set numbers of jobs created and destroyed, respectively, as if there were a linear relationship between the variables and as if imports didn’t create any U.S. jobs in, say, port operations, logistics, warehousing, retailing, designing, engineering, manufacturing, lawyering, accounting, etc. But imports do support jobs up and down the supply chain. Yet, so blindly committed are EPI’s stalwarts to the proposition that imports kill U.S. jobs that they even suggest that the number of job losses would have been greater than 450,000 had the U.S. economic slowdown not reduced demand for imports. In that tortured logic, the economic slowdown _saved or created_ U.S. jobs. But I digress.   
  
Contrary to the misconceptions so often reinforced in the media, outsourcing is not the product of U.S. businesses chasing low wages or weak environmental and labor standards abroad. Businesses are concerned about the entire cost of production, from product conception to consumption. Foreign wages and standards are but a few of the numerous considerations that factor into the ultimate investment and production decision. Those critical considerations include: the quality and skills of the work force; access to ports, rail, and other infrastructure; proximity of production location to the next phase in the supply chain or to the final market; time-to-market; the size of nearby markets; the overall economic environment in the host country or region; the political climate; the risk of asset expropriation; the regulatory environment; taxes; and the dependability of the rule of law, to name some.   




The imperative of business is not to maximize national employment, but to maximize profits. Business is thus concerned with minimizing total costs, not wages, and that is why those several factors are all among the crucial determinants of investment and production decisions. Locales with low wages and lax standards tend to be expensive places to produce all but the most rudimentary goods because, typically, those environments are associated with low labor productivity and other economic, political, and structural impediments to operating smooth, cost-effective supply chains. Most of those crucial considerations favor investment in rich countries over poor.   
  
Indeed, if low wages and lax standards were the real draw, then U.S. investment outflows wouldn’t be so heavily concentrated in rich countries. According to statistics published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 75 percent of the $4.1 trillion stock of U.S. direct investment abroad at the end of 2011 was in Europe, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong (i.e., rich countries). In contrast, only 1.3 percent of total U.S. foreign direct investment stock is in China.   
  
Likewise, if wages and lax standards were magnets for investment, we wouldn’t see the vast sums of foreign direct investment in the United States that we do, and the United States wouldn’t be the world’s most prolific manufacturing nation. At the end of 2010, foreign direct investment in the United States totaled over $2.3 trillion, one third of which was invested in U.S. manufacturing facilities. As the president and his critics (including candidate Romney) drone on about the ravages of ""shipping jobs overseas,"" they should take a moment to note that 5.3 million Americans work for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies (jobs ""outsourced"" from other countries). And they should note that Europe’s Airbus announced last week that it is making a $600 million investment in a 1000-worker aircraft assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, just down the road from the $5 billion, 1800-worker steel production facility belonging to Germany's Thyssen-Krupp, which is located within a few hours’ drive of a dozen mostly foreign nameplate auto producers, who employ tens of thousands more U.S. workers and generate economic activity supporting thousands more. These investments, jobs, and related activity are the products of foreign companies outsourcing.   
  
Why do these foreign companies come to American shores to produce instead of producing at home and exporting? Because each company has determined that it makes sense from an aggregate comparative cost perspective. They’re not here because of low wages or lax enforcement of labor and environmental standards, but because all of the factors affecting cost that each company uniquely considers, weigh – in the aggregate – in favor of investing here. One very important factor for a growing number of companies is proximity to market. Shipping products long distances can be costly, particularly for time-sensitive products and parts. And having a productive presence in your largest or fastest growing market is a factor that carries significant weight. Exporting is not always the best way to serve foreign demand.   
  
But outsourcing has been stigmatized as a process whereby U.S. factories are disassembled rafter-by-rafter, machine-by-machine, bolt-by-bolt and then reassembled in some foreign location for the purpose of producing goods for sale back in the United States. There may be a few instances where that accurately depicts what took place, but it is simply inaccurate to generalize from those cases. According to the BEA research described in these two papers (Griswold and Slaughter), between 90 and 93 percent of U.S. outsourcing – investment abroad – is for the purpose of serving foreign demand. Only between 7 and 10 percent of that investment is for the purpose of making sales back to the United States.   
  
In 2009, U.S. multinationals sold over $6 trillion worth of goods and services in the foreign countries in which they operate, which was nearly quadruple the value of all U.S. exports that year. Outsourcing helps make U.S. multinational corporations more competitive, and the profits they earn abroad (even if they’re not repatriated) underwrite investment and hiring by the parent companies in the United States. Typically, the U.S. companies that are investing abroad are the same companies that are investing in the United States for reasons that include the fact that U.S. MNC investment abroad tends to spur complementary investment and hiring in the U.S. parent operations.   
  
The capacity to outsource also serves another crucial, underappreciated function: to safeguard against bad U.S. policy. Like tax competition, outsourcing provides alternatives for businesses, which help discipline sub-optimal or punitive government policy. Because of globalization and outsourcing, businesses can choose to produce and operate in other countries, where the economic and political environments may be more favorable. As more and more companies undertake these comparative aggregate cost-of-doing-business assessments, governments will have to think long and hard about their policies.   
  
Governments are now competing with each other to attract the financial, physical, and human capital necessary to nourish high value-added, innovation-driven, 21st century economies. Restricting or taxing outsourcing as a means of trapping that investment wouldn’t be prudent. It would render U.S.businesses less competitive, and ultimately reduce employment, compensation, and economic activity. In this globalized economy, policymakers cannot compel investment, production, and hiring through threat or mandate without killing the golden goose. But they can incentive U.S.companies to return some operations stateside and foreign firms to invest more here by adopting and maintaining favorable policies.   
  
According to the results of a survey of over 13,000 business executives worldwide published in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2011/12, there are 57 countries with less burdensome regulations than the United States. That same survey found that business executives are increasingly concerned about crony capitalism in the United States, ranking the U.S. 50th out of 142 economies in terms of the government's ability to keep an arms-length relationship with the private sector. Then consider the fact that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate among all OECD countries. Add to that the prevalence of frivolous lawsuits, political uncertainty, out-of-control government spending, the dearth of skilled workers, uncertainty about the tax burden come 2013, and it starts to become clear why U.S. companies might consider investing and producing abroad. But policymakers can improve policy -- in theory, at least.   
  
It boils down to this. About 95 percent of the world’s consumers and workers live outside the United States. We live in a world where U.S. companies have much more competition on the supply side, much greater opportunity on the demand side, and far greater potential for tapping into a global division of labor (i.e., collaborating across borders in production) than 50, 20, even 5 years ago. After a very long slumber, the rest of the world has come on-line. We should embrace, not curse, that development.   
  
In a globalized economy, outsourcing is a natural consequence of competition. And policy competition is the natural consequence of outsourcing. Let's encourage this process.

 _A climate skeptic answers the fiery rhetoric of the Left’s star propagandist_



[Note: Greta’s speech is reprinted below. My responses are in italics. If it turns out there were errors in transcription—as seems likely—I’ll try to update with corrections. I apologise for the snarky tone, but if a 17-year-old can dish it out, I think she can take it.]



“My message is that we’ll be watching you. This is all wrong, I shouldn’t be up here, I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.”



 _So in your first paragraph you confess that what you’re doing is wrong, and you shouldn’t be doing it. You note you should be back home and in school. OK, so far we’re 100% in agreement. Next?_



“Yet, you all come to us young people for hope, how dare you?”



 _Not sure where you’re getting your information. No sentient adult goes to young people “for hope” whether they’ve been “dared” to or otherwise. Normally, when adults consider young people like yourself, the operative word is “despair”. And if you’re unfamiliar with that word, it means “absence of hope”_.



“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words…”



 _Wow, you must have had very fragile dreams, and an even more precarious childhood, if mere empty words could steal them. Even words loaded with meaning shouldn’t be able to take down someone’s dreams that easily, if the dreams are even a little bit deeply held. But empty words? Greta, you need to find better dreams and cling to them with more determination. As for your stolen childhood, this makes me suspect you didn’t exactly win the lottery when it comes to parents, did you? Just sayin’._



“…and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering, people are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.”



 _OK, sounds like someone’s been playing too much of the computer video game Civilization. Yes, in Sid Meier’s Civilization VI people are suffering, people are dying, and entire ecosystems are collapsing._



 _Meanwhile, back in reality, none of that is occurring. Well, none of it that is caused by human emissions of carbon dioxide at least. Greta, try to spend a few hours each day actually off your computer, so you can experience the world as it really is, not as your scary online world, and your handlers, are convincing you it must be._



“We are in the beginning of a mass extinction…”



 _Now it seems you’ve fallen into a time machine which has transported you back to the Yucatan Peninsula, sixty-five million years ago, when the comet was about to annihilate the dinosaurs. Either that or someone is doing a very good job of filling your head with utter nonsense. Shame on them, for scaring the socks off you. There is no evidence that we’re at the beginning of a mass extinction—certainly not of any life forms we care about._



“…and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?”



 _Um, did your speechwriter not know the audience you’d be addressing today? You’re speaking to diplomats in the United Nations General Assembly. There is probably no group of people on Earth less interested in economic growth than these folks. They don’t really care about money either, as they’re all on generous expense accounts and—thanks to diplomatic immunity—can park anywhere they want in Manhattan without worrying about being ticketed or towed. First rule of public speaking: Know your audience._



“For more than 30 years the science has been crystal-clear.”



 _Did you bother to look at any of that science? Thirty years ago they were saying Manhattan would be under water by now. Almost every prediction so called “climate scientists” have made during the past thirty years has failed to come true. This is not science being crystal-clear. It is shamanism being crystal-clear. You need to learn the difference. A science that is not able to make what are called “useful, non-obvious predictions” is not science. It’s religion. And I’m sorry, but you’ve become ensnared in the climate cult’s terrible clutches._



“How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.”



 _Another rule of effective speaking: don’t contradict yourself, especially within a single sentence. If the “politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight”, what exactly are you expecting these UN diplomats to do, beyond what they’re already doing? If the solutions are truly nowhere in sight, you’re certainly not going to get them from this crowd._



“You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.”



 _Greta, on this one, best go with “evil”. Again, you’re addressing the core members of the United Nations, arguably the most worthless organisation on the planet today. Even if they did believe something was an urgent problem, they’d not have the collective will to do anything about it. Actually, a better description than evil in this case would be “utterly f…..g worthless”. Remember, these are the very folks who commissioned the IPCC itself, and told it to make reports…every six years. You’d think if the world were about to end, reports of it happening could be slightly more frequent._



“The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. 50% may be acceptable to you but those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution, or the aspects of equity and climate justice, they also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So, a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences.”



 _Are you aware that you’re quoting alarmist predictions from the very scientists who’ve yet to be right about any of their predictions? Does that not concern you?_



“How dare you pretend that this can be sold with just business as usual and some technical solutions with today’s emissions levels that remaining CO2 budgets will be entirely gone within less than 8 and a half years.”



 _Well, ignoring that the sentence itself is gibberish, what exactly are you wanting anyone to do? You just told us that there are no solutions anywhere in sight. You’re very good at saying what you’re angry about. But we haven’t yet heard the grand plan that will solve everything. If you don’t have it, do you really think these diplomats sitting in front of you do?_



“There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.”



 _Your rhetoric is slipping into the category of deranged, verbal nonsense, but I do find it interesting that you—a seventeen year old—“dare” (if we can borrow your favorite word) to tell an audience of people over twice your age, that they are insufficiently mature. Rarely does insulting your audience achieve desired results, in public speaking. Might be time to consider firing your speech writer._



“You are failing us but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now, is where we draw the line. The world is waking up and change is coming whether you like it or not.”



 _Well, if change is coming whether they like it or not, why are you even bothering to give this speech? And by the way, what change is coming? You’ve already confessed there are no solutions in sight. This would seem to suggest change is not coming, at least anytime soon. And as for the eyes of all future generations being on the UN General Assembly, good luck with that. Even the eyes of today’s generation aren’t on anything the UN General Assembly does—much less will be the eyes of all generations unto the end of time. But I’m sure the people you’re addressing right now wish they were that important._



 _Anyway, Greta, a word of advice. You’re clearly a very upset and angry young lady, with endless dedication to your goals. Rather than hurling hate-filled rhetoric at a room of old folks whom you rightly predict won’t do what you want them to do, why don’t you roll up your sleeves and try to make a difference yourself? I think we can all agree that public speaking is probably not your best contribution to the Cause. Go back to school, take some atmospheric physics, basic chemistry, and geology classes. Maybe dabble with the design of that machine that’s going to suck all the CO 2 out of the atmosphere. Trust me, it’s not yet on anyone’s drawing board. You can be the first!_



 _And a bonus. If you truly study this issue that has so captured your attention, pretty soon you’re going to learn that the whole thing is one gigantic hoax, the greatest hoax in human history, being perpetrated by the government-educational-industrial complex. You’re going to learn that pretty much everything that’s been indoctrinated into your head is false. You’re going to learn that real scientists, tens of thousands of them, have already learned this and have gone_[ _on record_](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.petitionproject.org%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3UsCFXJTsqvj5gzruNYbqqB6-p1xt5Rzrgaw1mEeDxHhnr2vChWE4GKQA&h=AT1e72pu-bE2B8JgVqG90Zt8GxpNHJdc4wwgFMhKe7ws-hbXTE8K2n4hdkqpLtWC7lkUhxe_ikXgPsJRNQYaZR4hbq3omw40J4MPWuBlyOw_w71kWD-cNlwZKWtFnkYAOsETUM0PVXRMo8vf3dI) _as acknowledging it. You’re going to learn you’re being used by adults to turn you into a propagandist for shamanistic alarmism, and you’re going to realise that, because of it, you’ve been the victim of massive child abuse._



 _When you learn all this, I predict that your present anger is going to look like a calm, tranquil lake compared to how you will feel then. I predict at that point you’ll decide to write your own speech. And no matter who’s in the audience when you give it, I predict it will be scathing._

From  Brian Sussman
As a guy who has dedicated a significant part of his life to uncovering environmental scams, naming this year’s Truth Teller is a no-brainer for me.  
The winner is the man who just brought down the head of Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency: Christopher Horner.
Chris is a skilled lawyer and senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. About a decade ago he wrote, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming, which caused liberal heads to explode. This year he penned, The Liberal War on Transparancy, a book detailing how the Obama administration’s claim of being “the most transparaent” in history is pure hog washed propaganda.

I offer my sincere congratulations to Chris, he’s risked a lot. – Anthony

Bishop Hill reports that Doug Keenan’s article about statistical significance in the temperature records seems to have had a response from the Met Office.
WUWT readers may recall our story here: Uh oh, the Met Office has set the cat amongst the pigeons:
===========================================
The Parliamentary Question that started this was put by Lord Donoughue on 8 November 2012. The Question is as follows.
To ask Her Majesty’s Government … whether they consider a rise in global temperature of 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1880 to be significant. [HL3050]
The Answer claimed that “the temperature rise since about 1880 is statistically significant”. This means that the temperature rise could not be reasonably attributed to natural random variation — i.e. global warming is real.  
…
The issue here is the claim that “the temperature rise since about 1880 is statistically significant”, which was made by the Met Office in response to the original Question (HL3050). The basis for that claim has now been effectively acknowledged to be untenable. Possibly there is some other basis for the claim, but that seems extremely implausible: the claim does not seem to have any valid basis.
=============================================
The Met office website text is here and there is a blog post here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week the 6th Klimawoche (Climate Week) has been taking place in the German northern port city of Hamburg. The aim of the Climate Week Conference is to urge Germans to accelerate the implementation of green energies in order to curb the rapidly approaching dangerous climate warming. It is viewed as a “communication” event.
Hat-tip: The alarmist klimaretter.de. 
For those organizing and participating in the conference, the science has long been settled and the planet is certainly on a dangerous, accelerated path to destruction by the end of the century, that is unless man drastically alters his way of life.
The conference was opened at a Christian mass last Sunday by renowned journalist Franz Alt. In his opening remarks Alt made the shrill declaration:
We are in the middle of a Third World War against nature.”
Alt: The sun and wind don’t send bills

Earlier this year in an interview Alt aimed sharp criticism at the German government for dragging its feet with the implementation of renewable energies. In the interview Alt appeared completely unaware of extreme renewable energy costs that German consumers have had to endure so far, even reiterating the slogan: “Wind and sun don’t send bills“.
He also asked why Germany’s Economics Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, kept talking about the problems and costs involved with renewable energy: “Why doesn’t he speak about the advantages?”
Alt also said he cannot understand why Germany imports 100 billion euros worth of oil and gas from the Middles East and from Putin’s Russia instead of investing that money in renewable energy at home, once again reiterating, “The sun and wind don’t send electric bills“.
Sun’s always shining, wind always blowing!
Alt is also convinced fossil fuel energies are dinosaurs that are right on the verge of running out, and that the future is wind and sun: “The sun is always shining! The wind is always blowing!”
The week-long Hamburg Climate Week event features education events for schoolchildren, and workshops on sustainable living and climate friendly nutrition. Also scheduled to appear at the conference were climate scientists Mojib Latif, Hartmut Graßl and Claudia Schmitt.

Could the U.S.-Japan alliance founder as a result of alcohol? Apparently. At least, that’s the implication of the U.S. Navy’s ban on drinking by personnel stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa.



It would be far better to phase out America’s military presence on Okinawa, turning U.S. bases back to the Japanese government. More than seven decades after the end of World War II, Japan’s defense should be the responsibility of Tokyo, not Washington.



The independent Ryukyu Islands were conquered by Imperial Japan in the late 19th century. Residents were never considered fully Japanese by the rest of the country, but they suffered disproportionately when the allies invaded the island of Okinawa in April 1945. Nearly 100,000 civilians died in the bitter three‐​month battle. Afterward the U.S. government loaded Okinawa with bases, returning the island to Japan only in 1972.



America retained its facilities, however. Despite Japan’s dramatic recovery, the U.S. remained responsible for that country’s defense. In return, Japan’s duty only was to be defended by America. At the time the status quo satisfied most everyone, including Tokyo’s neighbors. Marine Corps Gen. Henry Stackpole famously explained that U.S. troops were the “cap in the bottle” to stop Japanese remilitarization. Decades later this arrangement has lost its raison d’etre.



Washington currently maintains 85 military bases and some 53,000 troops in Japan (plus 43,000 dependents and 5,000 civilian workers). Roughly 40 percent of those facilities, half the people, and three‐​quarters of the base area are located on Okinawa, with just .6 percent of Japan’s land mass, in the southernmost and poorest prefecture. About a fifth of the island is under U.S. control: Homes abut runways, prime beaches are off‐​limits to Okinawans, and island life is dramatically inconvenienced.



Nevertheless, there is little political will for change. U.S. officials desire that America remain the region’s “essential power,” despite Japan’s ability to take over its own defense, and retain advanced bases in the Asia‐​Pacific. Tokyo wants to rely on America’s security guarantee, despite Japan’s great military potential, while incurring the least political inconvenience from hosting U.S. forces. Both governments benefit from ignoring Okinawa’s complaints and filling the island with American military facilities and largely young, male service personnel.



What could possibly go wrong?





More than seven decades after the end of World War II, Japan’s defense should be the responsibility of Tokyo, not Washington.



Local anger exploded in 1995 after three American service members raped a 12‐​year‐​old girl, followed by insensitive comments from military brass. Protests raged and the Japanese government sought to placate islanders with financial transfers and plans to move Futenma airbase and relocate U.S. Marines to Guam. These schemes failed to satisfy, however. In 2009 the Democratic Party of Japan took power with proposals for a more independent, Asia‐​centric foreign policy and promises to address Okinawans’ concerns. However, the ineffectual DPJ government failed to achieve its objectives. Far from helping, the Obama administration actively thwarted Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama’s efforts to address Okinawans’ plight.



His successors cared less about achieving justice for their countrymen and more about expanding support from U.S. officials. Fear of North Korea, which continued to develop nuclear weapons and missiles, and China, which adopted increasingly confrontational tactics to advance its territorial claims in surrounding waters, encouraged a tighter Japanese embrace of Washington. Taking a more independent approach to its defense was not considered.



But base opponents, bolstered by the 2014 gubernatorial victory of Takeshi Onaga, continued to resist. Declared Onaga: “The new military base will not be built.” Although the national government pushed ahead, the new governor attempted to revoke the necessary building permits. In elections last weekend his allies took firm control of the Prefectural Assembly, bolstering his efforts to delay construction of new facilities.



Fueling popular anger has been a seeming spate of high‐​profile offenses committed by U.S. military personnel (who, in fact, have a lower crime rate than locals). Last month a sailor pled guilty to rape. Also last month a contractor and former Marine was detained in a murder case. The latter prompted the military to set a curfew and prohibit drinking off‐​base.



Then last weekend an apparently intoxicated sailor crashed, injuring two Okinawans. The navy confined all personnel to base except for essential travel and banned drinking on or off U.S. facilities. Explained Rear Adm. Matthew Carter: “For decades, we have enjoyed a strong relationship with the people of Japan. It is imperative that each sailor understand how our actions affect that relationship, and the U.S.–Japan alliance as a whole.”



Prime Minister Shinzo Abe largely ignored the Okinawa question as he sought to bolster Tokyo’s military capabilities. He pushed to revise the so‐​called “peace constitution,” Article 9 of which technically forbids Tokyo from maintaining any military; update the so‐​called Self‐​Defense Force’s 1997 “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Cooperation,” which barred the SDF aiding U.S. forces even if the latter were coming to Japan’s aid; and increase military outlays, which never got much above one percent of GDP. The U.S. has applauded his efforts, but progress has been minimal.



Observed Emma Chanlett‐​Avery and Ian Rinehart of the Congressional Research Service, “constitutional, legal, fiscal, and political barriers exist to significantly expanded defense cooperation. Many of Abe’s initiatives have faced opposition from the public and from political parties.” Less than a quarter of Japanese said they wanted their government to do more militarily. Last year large demonstrations targeted even modest legislative measures which would have received barely a second glance in the U.S.



Although Chanlett‐​Avery and Rinehart spoke of Abe’s efforts resulting in “momentum [which] has created new energy in the alliance,” that is true only measured against decades of Tokyo doing little at home and nothing abroad. First, the constitution remains unchanged, so Abe has adopted the U.S. tactic of elastic construction: like his predecessors he simply interpreted the nation’s fundamental law as he wished it had been written.



Military outlays have risen only modestly since Abe took power in 2012. They went up just two percent in 2015, when Japan devoted about $41 billion to defense (actually down in dollars due to a falling yen). Although expenditures have been enough for Japan to assemble a capable military, the amount falls far short of the roughly $180 billion China, Tokyo’s main potential nemesis, spends annually. Indeed, between 2004 and 2013 Chinese defense spending rose 270 percent—compared to _falling_ five percent in Japan.



Moreover, Japan’s expenditures remains an anemic one percent of GDP, compared to around three percent for Beijing and about 3.5 percent for the U.S., which Japan expects to make up its deficiencies. Critics may see Abe as a dangerous nationalist, but his government’s military budget doesn’t reflect such ambitions.



Last year Tokyo adjusted the defense guidelines so that its forces could join collective security operations and assist the U.S. when the latter aided Japan. But the changes were marginal. Tokyo’s previous participation in international non‐​combat activities had been quite limited. In Iraq, for instance, Japanese personnel were forbidden to defend themselves; other nations’ soldiers had to act as de facto bodyguards.



Thus, it won’t be hard for Tokyo to do more in the future. In speaking to the U.S. Congress last year Abe cited his nation’s “proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation.” Japan, he said, would confront “terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and climate change.” However worthy such endeavors, they are largely irrelevant to the U.S.-Japan alliance. Even the “security” activities cited by the guidelines remain resolutely non‐​combat: cyber warfare, logistics, mine‐​sweeping, reconnaissance. Thus, Tokyo’s new role will do little to reduce America’s military duties.



Moreover, the revised standards merely allow Japan to better defend Japan, not assist the U.S. For instance, the guidelines highlight “emerging threats to Japan’s peace and security” and “an armed attack against Japan.” American interests are an afterthought, subsumed in a short section on “cooperation for regional and global peace and security.”



Most Americans probably never realized that until last year—under a supposedly bilateral military alliance—a Japanese ship on patrol with an American vessel could not assist if the latter was attacked. Now the Japanese vessel can act, _but only if it too is threatened_. And Japanese analysts warn against expecting Tokyo to allow such situations to occur. Explained Japanese scholar Jun Okumura, “We will wait a long time before a destroyer is conveniently nearby when the Chinese [navy] attacks the U.S. 7th Fleet.” Some alliance.



Of course, Prime Minister Abe told the Congress that he wanted to “make the cooperation between the U.S. military and Japan’s Self‐​Defense forces even stronger, and the alliance still more solid.” By that he meant tying Washington even more tightly to Japan’s interests, including territorial disputes with China. The U.S. remains responsible for Japan’s defense including, as before, all the heavy lifting—meaning anything really dangerous and expensive.



In fact, the new guidelines appear to envision an even stronger U.S. guarantee for Tokyo. Said President Barack Obama: “I want to reiterate that our treaty commitment to Japan’s security is absolute, and that Article 5 covers all territories under Japan’s administration, including Senkakus Islands.” Which means, in theory, that the U.S. is prepared to risk Los Angeles to safeguard Japan’s disputed title to a few worthless, unpopulated pieces of rock.



There’s more. The Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee reported that officials from both governments “confirmed the strategic importance of deploying the most modern and advanced U.S. capabilities to Japan”; “welcomed the deployment” of American aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ships; and “stressed the importance of sustained cooperation in enhancing Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities” with additional U.S. weapons deployments. Under the “bilateral” treaty Washington’s obligations apparently only increase.



How can this be to America’s benefit? The U.S. has an obvious interest in Japan’s continued independence, but Japan’s interest in its own security is even greater. If Tokyo believes it faces serious threats, it should do more, much more to defend itself.



In fact, no one expects a Chinese armada to show up in Tokyo Bay. Nor the Chinese navy to interdict Japanese commerce. If conflict erupts, it likely will be over disputed Senkaku/​Diaoyu Islands. Only Tokyo can decide how much it is prepared to spend and risk defending its claims. But nothing at stake is worth war, at least for America.



Of course, Beijing is not justified in using force there or elsewhere. But the Abe government refuses to even acknowledge an issue, despite legitimate Chinese territorial claims. A seeming blank check from the world’s superpower apparently has discouraged Tokyo from considering negotiation and compromise.



A serious Japanese military build‐​up is opposed by some of its neighbors, especially those needlessly antagonized by Tokyo over the years. But other countries, most notably the Philippines, now welcome a larger Japanese role in the region. In any case, no one seriously suggests that Japan is about to embark upon a new round of imperial conquests, especially against nuclear‐​armed China. More than seven decades after World War II Japan should finally act like a normal country—defending itself, guarding its region, and ending its dependence on America for its security.



The U.S. should turn its security guarantee to Japan into a framework for future cooperation. That should include potential assistance if a genuine hegemonic threat arises in Asia. But Beijing does not pose such a danger today and hopefully never will. In the meantime Tokyo should take the lead in confronting day‐​to‐​day security challenges in its region.



Which means the U.S. should leave Japan to decide on its own defense and foreign policies, without hectoring or pressure. No doubt the debate in Tokyo would be sharp. Some Japanese are pressing their government to do more because they worry about foreign threats and recognize that the U.S. might back down from a confrontation with China. Other Japanese dismiss such fears and uphold the country’s post‐​war pacifist heritage. The decision is up to Japan.



As American forces returned home Okinawa’s bases would empty. What came next—use by the SDF, turnover to the Okinawa government, return to private owners—would be up to the Japanese, especially those living on the island. The latter above all deserve to enjoy the peace that the bases long were supposed to help guarantee. And American military personnel could continue to enjoy a drink … back home in their own country.

From the University of Waterloo, an extraordinary claim. While plausible, due to the fact that CFC’s have very high GWP numbers, their atmospheric concentrations compared to CO2 are quite low, and the radiative forcings they add are small by comparison to CO2. This may be nothing more than coincidental correlation. But, I have to admit, the graph is visually compelling. But to determine if his proposed cosmic-ray-driven electron-reaction mechanism is valid, I’d say it is a case of “further study is needed”, and worth funding. – Anthony

WATERLOO, Ont. (Thursday, May 30, 2013) – Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are to blame for global warming since the 1970s and not carbon dioxide, according to new research from the University of Waterloo published in the International Journal of Modern Physics B this week.
CFCs are already known to deplete ozone, but in-depth statistical analysis now shows that CFCs are also the key driver in global climate change, rather than carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
“Conventional thinking says that the emission of human-made non-CFC gases such as carbon dioxide has mainly contributed to global warming. But we have observed data going back to the Industrial Revolution that convincingly shows that conventional understanding is wrong,” said Qing-Bin Lu, a professor of physics and astronomy, biology and chemistry in Waterloo’s Faculty of Science. “In fact, the data shows that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays caused both the polar ozone hole and global warming.”

“Most conventional theories expect that global temperatures will continue to increase as CO2 levels continue to rise, as they have done since 1850. What’s striking is that since 2002, global temperatures have actually declined – matching a decline in CFCs in the atmosphere,” Professor Lu said. “My calculations of CFC greenhouse effect show that there was global warming by about 0.6 °C from 1950 to 2002, but the earth has actually cooled  since 2002. The cooling trend is set to continue for the next 50-70 years as the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere continues to decline.”
The findings are based on in-depth statistical analyses of observed data from 1850 up to the present time, Professor Lu’s cosmic-ray-driven electron-reaction (CRE) theory of ozone depletion and his previous research into Antarctic ozone depletion and global surface temperatures.
“It was generally accepted for more than two decades that the Earth’s ozone layer was depleted by the sun’s ultraviolet light-induced destruction of CFCs in the atmosphere,” he said. “But in contrast, CRE theory says cosmic rays – energy particles originating in space – play the dominant role in breaking down ozone-depleting molecules and then ozone.”
Lu’s theory has been confirmed by ongoing observations of cosmic ray, CFC, ozone and stratospheric temperature data over several 11-year solar cycles. “CRE is the only theory that provides us with an excellent reproduction of 11-year cyclic variations of both polar ozone loss and stratospheric cooling,” said Professor Lu. “After removing the natural cosmic-ray effect, my new paper shows a pronounced recovery by ~20% of the Antarctic ozone hole, consistent with the decline of CFCs in the polar stratosphere.”
By proving the link between CFCs, ozone depletion and temperature changes in the Antarctic, Professor Lu was able to draw almost perfect correlation between rising global surface temperatures and CFCs in the atmosphere.
“The climate in the Antarctic stratosphere has been completely controlled by CFCs and cosmic rays, with no CO2 impact. The change in global surface temperature after the removal of the solar effect has shown zero correlation with CO2 but a nearly perfect linear correlation with CFCs – a correlation coefficient as high as 0.97.”

Data recorded from 1850 to 1970, before any significant CFC emissions, show that CO2 levels increased significantly as a result of the Industrial Revolution, but the global temperature, excluding the solar effect, kept nearly constant. The conventional warming model of CO2, suggests the temperatures should have risen by 0.6°C over the same period, similar to the period of 1970-2002.
The analyses indicate the dominance of Lu’s CRE theory and the success of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
“We’ve known for some time that CFCs have a really damaging effect on our atmosphere and we’ve taken measures to reduce their emissions,” Professor Lu said. “We now know that international efforts such as the Montreal Protocol have also had a profound effect on global warming but they must be placed on firmer scientific ground.”
“This study underlines the importance of understanding the basic science underlying ozone depletion and global climate change,” said Terry McMahon, dean of the faculty of science. “This research is of particular importance not only to the research community, but to policy makers and the public alike as we look to the future of our climate.”
Professor Lu’s paper, Cosmic-Ray-Driven Reaction and Greenhouse Effect of Halogenated Molecules: Culprits for Atmospheric Ozone Depletion and Global Climate Change, also predicts that the global sea level will continue to rise for some years as the hole in the ozone recovers increasing ice melting in the polar regions.
“Only when the effect of the global temperature recovery dominates over that of the polar ozone hole recovery, will both temperature and polar ice melting drop concurrently,” says Lu.
The peer-reviewed paper published this week not only provides new fundamental understanding of the ozone hole and global climate change but has superior predictive capabilities, compared with the conventional sunlight-driven ozone-depleting and CO2-warming models.

 **Introduction** 1  
Too many U.S. policymakers, from Capitol Hill to the various executive branch agencies in Washington, tend to focus on foreign policies and foreign barriers when considering how best to improve the competitive prospects for U.S. firms. The presumption is that the major impediments to the success of U.S. firms are foreign born. Closed foreign markets, complex laws and regulations, overt flaunting of the trade rules, subtle protectionism, and unfair trade are the primary culprits that subvert the success of U.S. firms, discourage investment and hiring, and encourage offshoring of production. Indeed, that is the premise of today’s hearing, as inferred from its description on the Committee’s website.



But that premise is myopic and, frankly, irresponsible. It reinforces arguments for nonsensical policies, such as preserving our own barriers to trade and investment, which are nothing more than costs to U.S. businesses and families. Policies that raise the cost of doing business in the United States — such as our tariff regime and the trade remedies duties that the U.S. government imposes on broad swaths of industrial inputs — encourage manufacturers to at least consider moving operations abroad, where those materials are available at better prices.



Governments are competing for business investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions. This global competition in policy is a positive development. But we are kidding ourselves if we think that the United States is somehow immune from this dynamic and does not have to compete and earn its share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to our policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



 **Policymakers and Media Mislead the Public about Trade and its Benefits**  
We live in a globalized economy where more and more U.S. jobs depend upon transnational collaboration — through integrated supply chains and cross‐​border investment. Most Americans enjoy the fruits of international trade and globalization every day: driving to work in vehicles containing at least some foreign content; communicating, shopping, navigating, and recreating on foreign‐​assembled smart phones; having higher disposable incomes because retailers like Wal‐​Mart, Best Buy, and Home Depot are able to pass on cost savings made possible by their own access to thousands of foreign producers; earning paychecks on account of their companies’ growing sales to customers abroad; and enjoying salaries and benefits provided by employers that happens to be foreign‐​owned companies. Nearly 6 million Americans work for foreign subsidiaries in the United States.



Still, too many Americans are of the view that exports are good, imports are bad, the trade account is the scoreboard, the trade deficit means the United States is losing at trade, and it is losing because our trade partners cheat. Many point to the trade deficit as the obvious explanation for the much exaggerated death of U.S. manufacturing. According to polling data, Americans are generally skeptical about trade and its impact on jobs, manufacturing, and the U.S. economy. And come to think of it: why shouldn’t they be? After all, the public is barraged routinely with misleading or simplistic coverage of trade issues by a media that is too often heavy on cliché, innuendo, and regurgitated conventional wisdom, and lacking in analytical substance or balance. And demagogic politicians only fan the flames of misconception and misgiving.



The Obama administration has not been particularly helpful about correcting these misperceptions. In fact, the president is prone to using these scoreboard metaphors to describe trade, exhorting U.S. exporters to “win the future” or to secure foreign market share before other countries’ firms get there or to beat the Chinese in developing this technology or that. This encouragement, with its incessant emphasis on exports as the benefits of trade and imports as its incidental costs, only reinforces the misconception that trade is a zero‐​sum game with distinct winners and losers. But trade does not lend itself to scoreboard metaphors because both parties to a trade are made better off. There are no losers, else the transaction wouldn’t occur.



 **Policy Myopia**  
The centerpiece of the administration’s almost indiscernible trade policy is the National Export Initiative, with its goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years (to $3.12 trillion by the end of 2014). That would be fine, except that nowhere in the administration’s 68‐​page plan to double exports is the word “import” mentioned, except with respect to the section that speaks about strengthening the trade remedies laws to better discipline “unfair” imports. Some of the components of the NEI — such as streamlining U.S. export control procedures and concluding and signing trade agreements — are laudable ideas. But the plan is simply not good enough.



As currently executed, the NEI systemically neglects a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export‐​oriented activities of exporters. It presumes that U.S. exporters are born as exporters. But they are not. Before those companies are exporters, they are producers. And as producers, they are subject to a host of domestic laws, regulations, taxes, and other policies that handicap them in their competition for sales in the U.S. market and abroad.



According to a World Economic Forum survey of 13,000 business executives worldwide, there are 52 countries with less burdensome government regulations than those of the United States. Those regulations impose additional costs on U.S. businesses that sell domestically and abroad. As put by Andrew Liveris, chairman and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, “How we operate within our own borders, what we require of business here, often puts us at a competitive disadvantage internationally.” By neglecting these domestic impediments, the administration pretends that the obstacles to U.S. competitiveness and export success are all foreign‐​born.



The policy reform focus must be broadened to include consideration of the full range of home grown policies — such as taxes, regulations, tariff policy, and contingent protectionism — that affect U.S. producers and put them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign competitors.



As producers first, most U.S. exporters are consumers of capital equipment, raw materials, and other industrial inputs and components. Many of the inputs consumed by U.S. producers in their operations are imported or the costs of the inputs are affected by the availability and prices of imports. Indeed, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for more than 55 percent of the value of all U.S. imports last year — and 57 percent through the first half of 2011. That fact alone indicates that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of U.S. producers and their capacity to compete at home and abroad. Yet the NEI commits not a single word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs.



The president exhorts U.S. exporters to “win” a global race, yet he ignores the fact that the government’s hodgepodge of rules and regulations has tied their shoes together.



If the administration were serious about helping U.S. companies become more competitive and making the NEI a long‐​lasting institution committed to U.S. international competitiveness, it would compile an exhaustive list of laws, regulations, policies, and practices that are undermining the stated objectives of increased competitiveness, economic growth, investment, and job creation through expanded trade opportunities.



Near the top of that list would be America’s self‐​flagellating treatment of imported intermediate goods and other industrial inputs required by U.S. producers to make their final products. Last year, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol collected $32 billion in duties on $2 trillion of imports, over $1 trillion of which were ingredients for U.S. production — such as chemicals, minerals and machine parts. Normal tariffs and special trade remedies duties (i.e., antidumping and countervailing duties) added roughly $15–20 billion to the overall price tag, which would have been even higher had companies not been compelled to shutter domestic operations and, in some cases, relocate abroad on account of the higher input costs.



President Obama understands this dynamic. Last year, when signing into law the Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 (a bill to temporarily reduce or eliminate duties on certain imported raw materials) the president said:



The Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 will create jobs, help American companies compete, and strengthen manufacturing as a key driver of our economic recovery. And here’s how it works. To make their products, manufacturers — some of whom are represented here today — often have to import certain materials from other countries and pay tariffs on those materials. This legislation will reduce or eliminate some of those tariffs, which will significantly lower costs for American companies across the manufacturing landscape — from cars to chemicals; medical devices to sporting goods. And that will boost output, support good jobs here at home, and lower prices for American consumers.



Yet, the president’s National Export Initiative contains provisions to “strengthen” the antidumping law, which will further frustrate domestic producers’ access to imported inputs. 



**Antidumping Reform Would Encourage Domestic Investment and Hiring**  
The U.S. antidumping law still enjoys support in Congress and within pockets of the executive branch. Although some of that support can be chalked up to politicians representing the narrow interests of influential constituencies that have mastered the use of the antidumping and its highly misleading rhetoric, much more support stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose, history, mechanics, and consequences of the law.



Too many policymakers passively accept the anachronistic rationalizations proffered by the steel industry, labor unions, other big antidumping users, and their hired guns in Washington. Too many buy into the idealized imagery of a patriotic, upstanding American producer working tirelessly to ensure the preservation of well‐​paying jobs for hard‐​working Americans, but is suffering the ravages of unscrupulous, predatory foreign traders intent on destroying U.S. firms and monopolizing the U.S. market.



What politician could oppose a law presumed to protect that kind of a company against that kind of a scourge? But that is really a caricature, a myth. When the curtain is peeled back to expose the operation of the antidumping law, one can see a very different reality. Antidumping measures always raise the costs of firms in downstream industries that rely on the affected imports, and always claim domestic firms as victims. The law is often used as a tool by domestic firms waging battle for supremacy over other domestic firms, completely defying the foundational “us vs. them” premise upon which the AD status quo has come to rest. Sometimes foreign‐​owned firms are the petitioners and U.S-owned firms are the respondents. Rarely do antidumping restrictions lead to job creation or job restoration in the domestic industry, which is the most common claim of those seeking protection. And never is the allegation of “unfair trade” substantiated, or even investigated. Myth and misinformation explains the persistence of the U.S. antidumping regime.



In recent years, as U.S. producers of hot‐​rolled steel, saccharin, polyvinyl alcohol, nonmalleable cast iron pipe fittings, and silicon metal were “winning antidumping relief” from import competition and being liberated to raise prices, their U.S. customers — producers of appliances, auto parts, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, buildings, and solar panel components — were bracing for disruptions to their supply chains and inevitable increases in their costs of production.



In the period from January 2000 through December 2009, the U.S. government initiated 304 antidumping cases. Of those 304 initiations, final antidumping measures were imposed in 164 cases. Intermediate goods — inputs consumed by U.S. producers in the process of adding value to make their own downstream products — accounted for 130, or 79.3 percent of the decade’s antidumping orders. Yet, in none of those cases were firms in downstream consuming industries given a seat at the table. Under the statute, the authorities are required to ignore any potential impact of AD measures on downstream industries — and on the economy at large.



The 130 antidumping measures on intermediate goods can be broken out further to distinguish the 99 cases involving inputs used by manufacturers of goods and the 31 cases involving inputs used by non–goods-manufacturing producers, such as construction firms, utilities, and mining and drilling operations. Both sets of import‐​consuming producers suffer the costs and consequences of antidumping restrictions. Both pass some of those costs down the supply chain to the next level of consuming firms or end users in the form of higher energy costs, higher food prices, higher apartment and office lease rates, and higher input prices.



But the industries that rely on the inputs in the 99 manufacturing cases are those that are most likely to export. It is the companies in those industries which the president exhorts to “win the future.” It is those firms who are competitively disadvantaged at home and abroad on account of the wayward U.S. antidumping regime.



What is most striking about these cases is the asymmetry between the size and economic importance of the petitioning industry and the adversely affected downstream industries. For 35 of the 99 AD orders imposed on manufacturing inputs, the entire petitioning industry consisted of just one firm. Yet the ensuing trade restrictions affected dozens or hundreds of downstream firms in numerous industries. For example, in 2005, on behalf of a single producer, the U.S. government imposed antidumping measures on imports of a widely used industrial ingredient called purified carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) from Finland, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Sweden. CMC is an input for production processes in 17 downstream industries (according to USITC descriptions). Those combined industries accounted for $172 billion of exports and 2.6 million employees in 2010. In stark contrast, U.S. exports of CMC in 2010 amounted to only $35 million. Yet the tail wags the dog.



In 2003, on behalf of a sole domestic producer, antidumping duties were imposed on imports of the artificial sweetener saccharin from China. Saccharin has widespread uses in the production of various food and beverage products, pharmaceuticals and medicines, as well as cleaning compounds. U.S. producers in these downstream industries accounted for $249 billion in U.S. exports in 2010 and employed 1.9 million workers. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of saccharin in 2010 came to slightly more than $7 million.



The fact that a single U.S. producer of a crucial manufacturing input can prevail in its efforts to limit its customers’ access to alternative sources of supply should raise some eyebrows among policymakers. The fact that it is routinely the case that the antidumping law affords suppliers the ability to assert market power over their customers without any consideration of the economic consequences should be a wake‐​up call for those who fancy themselves stewards of sensible economic policy.



 **U.S. Foreign Trade Zones Encourage U.S. Production — Stop Undermining Their Appeal**  
Under the U.S. Foreign Trade Zones program, some of the costs inflicted on downstream, import‐​consuming firms can be mitigated. (Of course, the program wouldn’t be necessary if U.S. duties were recognized as just another cost of production and set, optimally, at zero.) Among the aims of the FTZ program is to encourage manufacturing activity in the United States (and to discourage manufacturers from shuttering domestic operations and moving offshore as a result of the burden of paying U.S. customs duties).



FTZs are usually manufacturing plants or facilities physically located within the United States, but considered outside U.S. territory for the purpose of customs duty payment. Goods that enter FTZs are not subject to customs duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties) until they leave the zone and are formally entered into the commerce of the United States. If those goods are used as inputs to a further manufacturing process, the rate of duty applicable to the final product is assessed. If the goods are exported from a FTZ, with or without further processing, no duties are imposed because the product never officially “entered” the United States.



With respect to products made from materials and components subject to AD or CVD duties, the standing regulations require FTZ operators to get advance approval from the Foreign Trade Zones Board if the intention is to sell those final products in the United States. That requirement _does not apply_ when the final product is going to be exported from the FTZ, which provides some incentive to downstream U.S. firms to keep production in the United States by operating as a FTZ.



But now the Obama administration — at the behest of the antidumping petitioners’ bar and organized labor, and despite its own exhortations to U.S. companies to double exports, invest in America, and put Americans back to work — is proposing to seal off that channel of sanity and compromise. New regulations would require advance approval even if the final product was going to be exported.



The requirement of advance approval from the FTZ Board, which is administered within the Import Administration — the same agency at the Commerce Department that simultaneously assists protection‐​seekers in crafting their AD/CVD petitions, while gleefully implementing and administratively adjudicating the antidumping and countervailing duty laws — will tip the balance in favor of outsourcing production for many firms in many industries. Any benefits of continuing to produce in the United States will be diminish next to the rising costs and uncertainty of doing so.



Thus, companies like Dow Corning, which uses silicon metal to produce silicone components for solar panels, will have that much more incentive to shutter operations in Kentucky and set up shop in Canada or elsewhere, where silicon metal is available at lower world market prices, so that it can compete in foreign solar panel markets with Chinese, Japanese, Canadian, and European rivals.



Asking American firms to invest and hire, while simultaneously pushing policies to raise the cost of those activities, reflects either profound cynicism or incompetence.



 **Conclusion**  
At a time of growing concern over the competitiveness of U.S. firms, when even this administration claims to be looking for ways to streamline regulations and reduce other burdens on businesses so that they will invest and hire, it is hard to believe that reform of the U.S. tariff schedule, with its $20 billion burden on U.S. producers has been ignored. It is utterly absurd that antidumping reform has not only been overlooked, but that Commerce has proposed to strengthen the law as part of the NEI. Likewise, it makes no economic sense to subvert the purpose of the U.S. foreign trade zones program, which is intended to encourage domestic economic activity and to dissuade offshoring of production.



The fact is that antidumping measures, as well our normal MFN tariffs, represent a huge drag on the competitiveness of downstream, value‐​added U.S. producers and a subsidy to foreign downstream, valued‐​added producers. None other than U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk made that point in the U.S. WTO case against Chinese raw material export restrictions earlier this year. He said:



China maintains a number of measures that restrain exports of raw material inputs for which it is the top, or near top, world producer. These measures skew the playing field against the United States and other countries by creating substantial competitive benefits for downstream Chinese producers that use the inputs in the production and export of numerous processed steel, aluminum and chemical products and a wide range of further processed products.  
  
These raw material inputs are used to make many processed products in a number of primary manufacturing industries…These products , in turn become essential components in even more numerous downstream products.



How can President Obama be serious about improving U.S. competitiveness when his Commerce Department is seeking to strengthen antidumping rules and the Foreign Trade Zones Board is moving to foreclose, or at least complicate, zone activities that use inputs subject to AD/CVD to make final products that are exported? How can we allow the president to throw nearly $100 billion in subsidies to solar, windmill, and lithium ion battery technology, while his policies make it more difficult to secure the necessary ingredients to produce and compete in those industries?



Let me conclude with an observation from the astute, mid‐​19th century French economics writer Frederic Bastiat. In 1850, he wrote:



Between Paris and Brussels obstacles of many kinds exist. First of all, there is distance, which entails loss of time, and we must either submit to this ourselves, or pay another to submit to it. Then come rivers, marshes, accidents, bad roads, which are so many difficulties to be surmounted. We succeed in building bridges, in forming roads, and making them smoother by pavements, iron rails, etc. But all this is costly, and the commodity must be made to bear the cost. Then there are robbers who infest the roads, and a body of police must be kept up, etc.  
  
Now, among these obstacles there is one which we have ourselves set up, and at no little cost, too, between Brussels and Paris. There are men who lie in ambuscade along the frontier, armed to the teeth, and whose business it is to throw difficulties in the way of transporting merchandise from one country to the other. They are called Customhouse officers, and they act in precisely the same way as ruts and bad roads.



With no intended disrespect to CBP officers or employees — it’s only a personification of bad policy — this is what we have done. We have overcome the physical barriers — the bad roads, the swamps, the oceans, and shallow harbors — only to erect our own barriers. In a perfect world there would be no duties at all. The costs of imports, including duties, are production costs for firms and living expenses for families. Policies that portend to improve prospects for U.S.-based production and U.S. families should aim to reduce those costs, not increase them.

"**Surgeons from across Northern Ireland are to carry out operations at the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen to reduce a backlog of surgery as a result of coronavirus.**
The Belfast Trust, which operates the Nightingale facility at Belfast City Hospital, is the first to relocate surgery to Enniskillen.
Priority gynaecology and renal cases are being scheduled first.
Urgent general surgery cases are being planned for December.
The potential for urgent paediatric orthopaedic cases is also being explored.
Health Minister Robin Swann said while the initiative was initially focussed on ""high priority"" patients, officials were also looking at making the most of the available capacity at the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in the long term.
The Health and Social Care Board said work was ongoing to identify further high-priority elective work from across Northern Ireland that could be delivered at SWAH.
Mark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons, said the additional capacity was ""urgently needed"" to reduce the backlog of surgical patients on waiting lists.
""It is important that Northern Ireland 'COVID-light' sites are delivered on a regional basis so that surgical capacity can be rebuilt and can keep going during this time,"" he said.
""We also need a longer-term strategy to look at how elective and emergency surgery are carried out in Northern Ireland's hospitals and how these sites are staffed.""
Chief executive of the Western Trust, Dr Anne Kilgallen, welcomed the move.
""This initial phase of regional collaborative working in respect of elective in-patient surgery at South West Acute Hospital has very much highlighted the excellent facilities and opportunities which are available there,"" she said.
""This development work will continue and other specialties will be explored.""
The Western Trust, which has struggled in the past to recruit staff to work in the south-west, also confirmed it had made offers to fill three permanent consultant surgeon vacancies.
Jill Weir, from Unison, said it was an opportunity for the hospital to showcase its ""fantastic"" facilities, and medical and nursing staff, in order to attract people to work here in the future.
""We would welcome anything that is NHS work locally as well, but our concerns would be we've already overstretched staff here and as long as this isn't taking away from local services and not stressing out our nursing staff we would welcome it,"" she said.
Fermanagh GP Dr John Porteous said it was an example of how services will have to be delivered in the future.
""Our national health service has shown itself to be extremely flexible and adaptable in the face of this pandemic so this is just another example of how we are going to need to think creatively about how to maximise the use of the resources available,"" he said.
""This is a fine building with excellent accommodation and facilities so I think it's only right that the health minister and the department are looking at maximising the potential of this building and these facilities."""

 **Beth Houlbrooke**  
Act Party Deputy Leader / Vice President 



When thinking about this week’s Ad Lib, all the immediate topics that came to mind caused me to roll my eyes involuntarily, so I’ll skip over them quickly:



 **Lowering the voting age**



Using the argument that 16 is the age of consent or conscription or to obtain other rights is irrelevant. What is relevant in this debate is the maxim “no taxation without representation”. That’s the only justification I can think of for under 18s to be given the vote, but then perhaps it should be based on minimum taxable earnings in a year before it becomes a right. That could be processed through the IRD. I reject the argument that it should only be available to net taxpayers – that would exclude superannuitants and those unable to work through sickness or disability.



 **Children protesting Climate Change**



Oh puh-leeze. What is this materially meant to achieve? When will the protestors have achieved their aims? When the sea has rolled back?



 **Wearing black-face nearly 20 years ago**



What Justin Trudeau dressed up as at a school benefit nearly 20 years ago does not interest me one bit. Times have changed and attitudes are thankfully more enlightened where true offence might be caused. But where does cultural appropriation begin and end now, and where is it moving towards? No more dressing up on St Patrick’s Day? I’m of both Irish and Scottish extraction, should I be concerned when people don red-haired wigs and tartan kilts for fun? What happens if you’re in the costume hire business?



 **[Protests by vegans](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/faces-of-the-day-12/) against meat eaters**



A blatant disregard for private property rights means whatever point they were trying to make was immediately lost on me, and I imagine many others.



 **CHEERS DAVID**



Saturday 21 September 2019 marked five years since David was elected to Parliament. In that five years he became ACT Party Leader; saw more partnership schools open to give more families more choice and access to better education; introduced probably the most significant bill for social change to be debated this decade – End of Life Choice; voted or spoke out consistently against non-core government spending such as corporate welfare, burdensome regulations, and additional taxes; has been the sole voice for freedom of speech and proper democratic process; and – who could forget – passed legislation allowing bars to open early in the morning for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.



Now the 2019 Rugby World Cup is upon us and occasional punters like me will be heading to the nearest friendly bar to watch the big matches, some of which aren’t starting till after 10 pm NZ time. That means without a special licence or change in legislation, there would be fewer options and many businesses would be put through a whole lot of red tape to be able to open. Once again thanks to David, we can find an open bar with a big screen, enjoy a beverage, or simply find some company with whom to watch the games. Please remind your friends, when you’re at the next late evening match, to raise a glass to David.



 **FLAVOURS UP IN SMOKE**



This is not new, ACT spoke about it [nearly a year ago,](https://www.act.org.nz/vaping_red_tape_protects_tobacco_revenue?utm_campaign=beth_ad_lib_44&utm_medium=email&utm_source=actnz) but the legislative changes to vaping products are now imminent.



You may have noticed the ads on TV in the evenings recently. Turns out my good friend Cameron Brewer’s [PR Agency is behind them,](https://www.mad-daily.com/vapes-target-big-tobacco/) and they make some very good points around the effects of the legislation.



Changes to advertising rules around vaping products may mean that the availability of a safer alternative to smoking remains a mysterious, almost underground scene to anyone curious about making the switch.



 _“Going forward we believe it’s critical to keep informing Kiwis that vaping is an effective tool for smokers to quit and is 95% less harmful than cigarettes. That’s the only way New Zealand will ever get close to achieving its ambition of being a smoke-free country.”_



The ban on flavours of nicotine liquids will also likely be counter-productive to meeting any smoke-free targets.



I have a good number of friends who have been able to quit smoking by transitioning to vaping products. Flavour is an important part of their new enjoyment. To allow only flavours that taste like the thing they’re quitting may make it tempting to return to cigarettes as soon as the opportunity presents itself. The old taste needs to be forgotten and replaced with a preferred taste.



Genuine ex-smokers are posting on-line images like the following:



As with all things that aren’t good for us, it is not for us to moralise over another’s choice unless that choice materially impacts on us or takes away our own choice, e.g. not to inhale second-hand smoke. Most general practitioners now recommend that smokers who are having trouble giving up the highly addictive, combustion and carcinogenic form of inhaling nicotine, try replacing it with the smokeless option.



On behalf of my many friends who have successfully quit smoking this way, and then some of them vaping, I’m promoting this [petition.](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/petitions/document/PET_91278/petition-of-nancy-loucas-sutthoff-for-aotearoa-vapers-community)

UPDATE: Hockey stick achieved, see below.
Guess what? WUWT readers make up the majority of viewers of this farce video. Mostly curiosity I suppose. Watch the video, then see the numbers below.

Yesterday, Tom Nelson asked this question, and it got me to digging.
It’s now been two weeks: Does anybody know what happened to Al Gore’s “Reality Drop” campaign?


“Reality Drop” Brings Social Gaming (And Facts) To Dispelling Climate Change Misinformation 
Looking for an innovative way to dispel myths and spread science about climate change, Gore, Fox and their colleagues at The Climate Reality Project turned to agency Arnold Worldwide. Pete Favat, Arnold Worldwide’s chief creative officer, had attracted Gore’s attention because of his cause-related work for the Truth Campaign, the hugely successful national anti-tobacco program.
…
The product, “Reality Drop,” relies on sophisticated algorithms to highlight “hot” climate change stories and provide simple rebuttals to the most common climate change myths.
…
Users win points for sharing facts and eventually climb up the ranks of the game and earn Foursquare-like badges such as “Carbon Crusher,” “Shining Beacon,” and “Order of the Green Circle.”
Initial information on the game will be officially unveiled on November 14th during “24 Hours of Reality: The Dirty Weather Report,” a 24-hour event broadcast live on the Internet, culminating in a presentation by Gore on November 15th at 7 p.m. EST.
Without any advertising budget, Reality Drop will rely strictly on word-of-mouth to gain traction and influence the climate change discussion. “Success will be measured by the amount of people who are posting and the number of people involved,” says Favat. “People inherently want to be on the right side here.”
Reality Drop (RealityDrop) on Twitter
[Seven total tweets, none since Nov. 15]
Here’s the Twitter page, captured on 11/30/2012, showing all 7 Tweets

Now here comes the fun part, the “stats” section of the Vimeo video page for the propaganda movie at the top shows this:

Wow, 155 views in a week, and trending down, down, down. Some might call that interest “cooling”. When you click on the “Top URL embeds” (highlighted in yellow) you get this fun table showing that WUWT is the main external contributor to views of Al Gore’s ‘Reality Drop’ video. Heh.

What is really interesting is the comparison to the top “loads” leader, which has only 6 views compared to WUWT’s 999. More people from WUWT viewed Al’s video than anywhere else in the world. That’s gotta sting.
So what should we do to help Al get more views?
Well obviously WUWT’ers need to help. Simply click on the video “play” button above, and we’ll give him a hockey stick graph for views. If you have a website/Twitter feed/Facebook page, direct people here and ask them to help. To register a view from WUWT, you simply need to play the video above in the open WUWT browser window. It’s just that easy to give Al a hockey stick of traffic from those he seeks to destroy. I’ll post an update when the success is robust, er, graphically clear.
In the meantime, you might want to take this survey Al has prepared to help gauge the success of his video. I’m sure he’d love to hear your opinion!
==============================================================
UPDATE: We’ve presented a hockeystick, and WUWT is well in the lead. Thanks everybody!

Guest essay by Jim Steele, Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University.
On July 29, 2013 the BBC’s Hardtalk journalist Stephen Sackur wrote “The Alaskan village set to disappear under water in a decade.” He opened the story with “within a decade Kivalina is likely to be under water. Gone, forever. Remembered – if at all – as the birthplace of America’s first climate change refugees.” He then quotes a local who laments, “The US government imposed this Western lifestyle on us, gave us their burdens and now they expect us to pick everything up and move it ourselves. What kind of government does that?”


Given the context, such a statement sounds like the locals were feeling abandoned by global warming. But the tone also reminded me of the complaints by many native Arctic people who were relocated by the US, Canadian and Russian governments in a 20th century battle to secure claims to Arctic territory. Such a vulnerable location seemed odd for a permanent settlement.. Sure enough Wikipedia supported my suspicions Kitvalina. The original village was located at the north end of the Kivalina Lagoon but was relocated to its present location in about 1900. Reindeer were brought to the area and some people were trained as reindeer herders, suggesting there as a government attempt to force a permanent settlement. From the history I can glean on the internet “the people of Kivalina, like the Ipiutak before them, utilized the barrier reef only as seasonal hunting grounds, making camp there in warm-weather months.” Their recent plans to relocate due to erosion and an expanding population are opportunistically blamed on global warming.
The Arctic people have long been victimized by “southern people’s” politics. Relocation of indigenous families became a tactic employed by all the “polar bear countries” in an international chess match to stake claims on Arctic resources. In 1925, Denmark relocated families in Greenland to counter any Norwegian claims to the island. The following year the Soviet government moved a small Eskimo community to Wrangel Island in order to replace an occupation of Alaskan Eskimos that had been established there by American interests. The relocation of families was also a crucial cold-war tactic by Canada to insure their claims on the Arctic, but not just against any Russian threats, but more so from perceived encroachments by the United States.631
In 1944, Henry Larsen, a staff sergeant in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, became the first to navigate the Northwest Passage from the west to east and back again. This celebrated feat greatly strengthened Canada’s claims to Arctic lands, and offset any potential Scandinavian claims based on Norway’s Roald Amundsen’s successful crossing of Canada’s Northwest Passage in 1903-06. However the US military bases built during World War II were now perceived as a threatening foothold. So in the 1950s Larsen was put in charge of relocating several Inuit families to Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay in the far northern reaches of the Canadian Arctic. Grise Fiord is known by its Inuit name that means “the place that never thaws.” Although these were strategic places in ongoing international maneuverings, it was a region long abandoned by the Inuit’s ancestors. Government stories of an unspoiled land where hunting was more bountiful enticed Inuit families to leave the milder climates of their villages along the central Hudson Bay. Government officials sealed the deal by suggesting there was absolutely no risk and promised a swift return passage if the families found their new settlement unsatisfactory.
But it was a promise that Canadian officials never intended to keep. Ironically, the woman who played Nanook’s wife in the popular 1930s documentary “Nanook of the North” and her son (who was fathered by the documentary’s producer) were among the families relocated to Grise Ford. Although “Nanook of the North” had enthralled Americans and Europeans with a glamorized depiction of Inuit resilience and adaptability, their new settlements doled out such incredible hardships their resilience was severely tested. The struggles of those families have now been well documented in the book, The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival. It was the film producer’s granddaughter, daughter of his half-Inuit, half-Caucasian son, who finally forced the Canadian government to own up to their betrayal. The Canadian government finally made a public apology in 2008 and paid reparations to the offended families.
Sackur’s article continues the long tradition of half-truths. To indict climate change he wrote:

“Kivalina’s story is not unique. Temperature records show the Arctic region of Alaska is warming twice as fast as the rest of the United States.”
“Retreating ice, slowly rising sea levels and increased coastal erosion have left three Inuit settlements facing imminent destruction, and at least eight more at serious risk.”
“No longer does thick ice protect their shoreline from the destructive power of autumn and winter storms.”

However his story relies on zombie data. It was indeed true that Alaska had been warming twice as fast as elsewhere. In a 2012 paper climate scientists from Alaska Climate Research Center, University of Alaska reported, “a sudden temperature increase in Alaska was recorded starting in 1977, seemingly driven by the change in polarity of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) Index, which went from dominantly negative before 1977 to dominantly positive values after that year” However unlike Sackur they also reported for the 21st century ” The mean cooling of the average of all stations was 1.3°C for the decade”1 Alaska is now one the most rapidly cooling areas on earth.
Sackur’s reference to “slowly rising sea levels” are also questionable. Go to the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level website and view the 2 stations nearest to Kitvalina. At Nome Alaska the sea level is rising so slow it appears to be dropping over the last decade.
http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.plots/1800_high.png

Or look at Prudhoe Bay .

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.plots/1857_high.png
Except for a brief surge for a few months in late 2013, Prudhoe Bay sea level has been dropping there as well. The shifting PDO is also known to change sea level across the Pacific Ocean.
Finally it is hard to understand Sackur’s claim, “No longer does thick ice protect their shoreline.” In 2012 the National Snow and Ice Data Center reported “ice extent in the Bering Sea was much greater than average, reaching the second-highest levels for January in the satellite record.” NASA’s Earth Observatory wrote, “For most of the winter of 2011–2012, the Bering Sea has been choking with sea ice… NSIDC data indicate that ice extent in the Bering Sea for most of this winter has been between 20 to 30 percent above the 1979 to 2000 average. February 2012 had the highest ice extent for the area since satellite records started.” And in 2013 Bering Sea ice was again above normal as seen in National Snow and Ice Data Center picture.

So why has the BBC published this story filled with references to zombie data and half-truths? The region’s temperatures are cooling, sea level is dropping and sea ice is above average. The story about Kivalina has been published many times before and residents sued Exxon six years ago. Are they trying to rekindle global fear in a time of paused global warming? Are they now tools of the IPCC? Climategate emails revealed Michael Mann’s distress at a BBC’s story that the PDO could delay global warming, and he told his fellow advocates he would have a talk with their “science” writers. Did Michael Mann and the fellow IPCC warming advocates successfully pressure the BBC to present such a biased and unsupported story that does not educate the public about the complexities of climate change but instead attempts to instill gloom and climate fear? I once saw the BBC as a trusted source, but count me as a climate war casualty. I will never again trust another BBC climate article.

"The New York Times Magazine won three National Magazine Awards on Tuesday, tying New York Magazine for the most awards for any publication this year. The winning stories showcased a wide range of reporting and storytelling, at home and abroad: • In the Public Interest category, “Worlds Apart,” by our staff writer Nikole   tells the story of  ’s own process of finding a school for her daughter in New York City, among the most segregated public school systems in the country. Expertly weaving together the personal and the historical, supported by a wealth of research and data,   made the case that  —   more than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education  —   the majority of poor black and Latino children received a separate and unequal education. • The winning story in the Feature Writing category, “I Have No Choice but to Keep Looking,” by our contributing writer Jennifer Percy, visits the coast of Japan, where more than five years after the tsunami that killed tens of thousands, the families of the dead still search the sea for their loved ones  —   a heartbreaking testament to love and devotion in the face of unimaginable loss. • In the   category, “David’s Ankles,” by our staff writer Sam Anderson, explores Anderson’s obsession with the history of Michelangelo’s David statue and its flaws while unspooling a meditation on the nature of imperfection itself."

In Australia we find a true warrior of free speech in Queensland Senator George Brandis, who has come out blasting what he sees as the “sheer authoritarianism” rampant in the global climate change movement, where anyone who challenges the science is labeled a despicable “denier”.
He calls the extremely intolerant approach of the global warming alarmists approach “ignorant” and “medieval” and adds that they suffer from “The Debate Is Over” syndrome and that the movement represents “a new and illiberal climate of anti-intellectualism.”

Website Spiked Online here presents a portrayal of the Australian Senator, who once was a believer in man-made global warming and thought something had to be done about it quickly.
Brandis believes that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA) is and authoritarian attempt by the state to curb free speech and thus should be repealed and that there needs to be greater freedom of expression. Accordng to the Spiked Online report:
…there were two recent, specific things that made him realise just what a mortal threat freedom of speech faces in the modern era and that he would have to dust down his Mill, reread his Voltaire, and up the ante in his war of words against, as he puts it, the transformation of the state into ‘the arbiter of what might be thought’. The first thing was the climate-change debate; and the second is what is known down here as The Andrew Bolt Case.”
He views climate change as a cult religion that “has become a gospel truth that you deny or mock at your peril” and that it attempts to “delegitimise the views of those who disagree rather than engaging with them intellectually and showing them why they are wrong“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE…read here: populartechnology.net/skeptics-smeared-as-holocaust-deniers.html
—————————————————-
Many of us were shocked at hearing the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) had sharply criticized University of Alabama climate scientist Dr. Roy Spencer because he finally decided to defend himself against the constant stream of Holocaust-laced slurs and abuse that had been thrown his way by rabid global warming activists over years. The reason for the continuous string of slurs and insults? The leading climatologist disagreed with alarmist climate science. His scientific opinions were different.
So why is the ADL focusing only on Spencer’s harsh choice of words and totally ignoring the years of Holocaust-laden “denier” slurs and analogies that have been fired regularly at skeptic scientists and journalists? We can only speculate that they have been sleeping on the job.
What follows are just a few examples of the hate and defamation that skeptics (people with a different opinion) have been the target of.
In 2006 Grist Magazine’s David Roberts called for Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” of the global warming “denial industry.” Professor Roger Pielke Jr. responded on October 9, 2006: “Let’s be blunt. This allusion is an affront to those who suffered and died in the Holocaust. This allusion has no place in the discourse on climate change.” He’s right and surely the ADL agrees.
How can anyone equate disagreement on climate science to denying the Holocaust? Roberts thinks that denying the Holocaust is equal to denying his climate science? To me this is a diminishment of the Holocaust of the nastiest sort.
Former NASA GISS director and global warming activist James Hansen accused skeptics of global warming scientists of committing “a crime against humanity”, a label used to describe atrocities like genocide or the Nazi Holocaust. Hansen even equated coal wagons to rail cars that transported Jews to concentration camps. How sickening can you get? Why was there not a peep from the ADL?
Yet another extremely deplorable example of intolerance and intellectual arrogance occurred just 15 months ago when University of Graz music professor Robert Parncutt openly called for the death penalty for climate skeptics, a clear defamation of people who simply have a different view of climate science. Parncutt portrayed skeptics as criminals so heinous that they deserved to die. Where was the ADL?
Yesterday Marc Morano at his Climate Depot reminded us of the disturbingly twisted final-solution-type fantasies greenshirt zealots have for climate science skeptics. NYU bioethicist S. Matthew Liao, who thinks skepticism in climate science is a mental illness. ‘If you can give something like oxytocin to people, then maybe they’ll be more willing to cooperate, to care more about the environment’. This reminds of how Alan Turing‘s homosexuality was viewed in a similarly appalling way. For his “deviance”, Turing was chemically castrated by the British government and became so depressed that he was driven to suicide. At the time 97% of experts said homosexuality was deviant.
Morano offers other examples of systematic defamation and criminalization of alternative scientific thought.
Far worse and disturbing, however, is that global warming zealots openly express their violent fantasies of dehumanizing, criminalizing and blowing skeptics into bloody bits and pieces. Where is the ADL? From which regimes have we seen such a level of arrogance and intolerance in the past?

Image cropped from 10:10 – No Pressure clip.
Last spring, the German government even went so far as to issue a 123-page brochure that singled out and named US and German skeptic scientists and journalists, and warned the German public not to listen to them. German journalist Henryk Broder, who himself is Jewish, found the German policy so shocking that it reminded him of the Reichskulturkammer, a Nazi agency charged with making sure German art remained “pure”. Even Jewish intellectuals like Broder are ringing the alarm bells. Where’s the ADL?
So precisely what ingredients are needed to cook up an atrocity, like those fantasized in the 10:10 No Pressure video? In the 1973 Ascent of Man series scientist Jacob Bronowski provides the answer: arrogance and dogma.
That deliberate deafness to suffering has become the monster in the war machine. […] The assertion of dogma that closes the mind and turns a nation, a civilization into a regiment of ghosts, of obedient ghosts, or of tortured ghosts. […]
This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some 4 million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods […] Every judgement in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.”
It is the belief of having absolute knowledge and being the keeper of the truth that turns one into a dangerous menace. Bronowski aptly quotes Oliver Cromwell:
I beseech you from the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.”
This is what skeptics are pleading – and for this they are being criminalized and defamed.
Ironically many of the skeptics being attacked and labeled deniers are Jews themselves: Fred Singer (who actually fled the Nazis), Richard Lindzen, Nir Shaviv, Benny Peiser, to name four off the top of my head. I wonder what they think of the ADL’s one-sided attack on Dr Spencer. My guess is that they are appalled by the ADL’s blindness and poorly judged move.
Bronowski ends with the moving images of him scooping the remains from a pond, where he pleads:
We have to touch people.”
Touch people…and not blow them up to bits and pieces.

=======================
Hopefully this will be my last word on this matter.
Christopher Monckton, 3. Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, has responded to the PRP journal cancellation affair, which has created quite a stir within the skeptic climate science community. In it he has some deservedly harsh comments, which I steeply tend to agree with.
He calls the PRP shutdown a “21st century equivalent of Nazi-era book-burning“, led by “a vicious campaign sedulously waged by the canting profiteers of doom“. He calls the publisher’s director Rasmussen “a formless lump of lard“.
And unfortunately it seems a few skeptics played into the hands of the campaign or, for selfish reasons, even played along with the shenanigans, so some have claimed.
In his forceful piece, Christopher Monckton offers a persuasive defence of Niklas Mörner, the distiunguished Swedish scientist and PRP editor who has more than 500 publications to his credit. Mockton writes (my emphasis):
Unlike Galileo, who also got into trouble over the theological implications of the interaction between the Sun and the planets, professor Mörner did not even get a trial in front of the Holy Inquisition. For the Thermageddon Cult is, to its very roots, instinctually Communist. Fair trial, Tovarishch? No way, Josevich.”
And kudos to Anthony Watts, who hardly emerges unscathed in this matter, for featuring Monckton’s response at his blog. Anthony still appears to maintain a hardline against the science floated by the special PRP issue and its authors, which is fine. But I think he should not slam the door entirely on them. From a reader comment he wrote, I got the feeling he belittles the journal in calling it “a repository for way out there ideas“. A premature dismissal on his part? Time will tell. But let’s keep in mind that Galilieo’s and Wegener’s ideas also were also once called “way out”. In the end, it turned out that it was the mainstream itself who were way out. Anthony also called Monckton’s piece “emotional”.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that a certain WUWT contributor is having perhaps too much influence at the number one skeptic blog, a blog to which we owe so much to. As talented as that person may be, it seems odd he would take it upon himself, given his relatively scant scientific credentials, to tell the rest of us which science is to be believed. One paper or two doesn’t make a person the authority. There were other self-anointed climate science quality czars who came out of the woodwork and over-extended. I was particularly disappointed with Poptech, from whom we found plenty of childish comments, like here.
At NTZ my first reaction to the PRP shutdown, I admit, was on the overly harsh side. I also unwisely allowed myself to be spurred on in part by emotion, i.e. my frustration arising from the systematic and institutionalized attempts here in Germany to marginalize and silence legitimate skeptic voices. With PRP I thought: Here we go again.
But then Anthony came out with his strong critique of the scientists behind PRP group and that really got me to rethink my original position. On the surface Anthony made a very convincing case, and many of his points had merit, and still do. Maybe the journal is bogus, I wondered.
But since then background details and responses from the other side have emerged and indicate that, under the bottom line, the original NTZ position was not far off after all. And some of the “nepotism” allegations leveled at WUWT remain just that: allegations that still have to be looked into. Christopher Monckton’s essay confirms my original position that this was for the most part a sloppy and mean-spirited attempt by Copernicus to silence one side.
Everyone hopes that the dust will settle soon. As far as I’m concerned, the whole thing for me is a bygone. Hopefully this will be my last word on it. We are all going to make mistakes at one time or another. I urge readers here not to hold anything against anyone: forgive and forget.
In the future we have to work to ensure that other opinions and positions get heard without unnecessary attacks. Getting views on the table unhindered and leaving egos aside is what climate science needs more than ever today.
I really do hope the PRP journal sees success and I look forward to writing about it in the future.

My greener friends are increasingly troubled by the lack of a rise in recent global surface temperatures. Using monthly data measured as the departure from long‐​term averages, there’s been no significant warming trend since the fall of 1996. In other words, we are now in our 17th year of flat temperatures.



Since 1900, the world has seen one other period of similar temperature stagnation (actually a slight cooling) that lasted for 30 years and ended around 1976. The current one is happening with much more putative warming “pressure,” because the atmosphere’s carbon‐​dioxide content is much higher than it was in mid‐​century.



From the Industrial Revolution to 1950, atmospheric carbon‐​dioxide concentrations rose by about 15 percent. Today, the increase is up to 41 percent, making long periods without warming either 1) increasingly unlikely, or 2) the natural result of simply overestimating how “sensitive” surface temperature is to carbon dioxide. My money is on the latter.



Now, just for fun, let’s assume that on Jan. 1, another warming trend began, at the same rate that was observed in the last such period, from 1977 through 1998, or 0.17 C per decade.





People are beginning, cautiously, to dial back 21st century warming because there has been none. 



Running a large experimental sample reveals that, on average, the rate of warming will have to continue through 2020 before a statistically significant trend emerges in the post‐​1996 data. (Remember that a “trend” that does not meet the normal grounds for significance is one that cannot scientifically be distinguished from “no trend.”)



In other words, it’s a pretty good bet that we are going to go nearly a quarter of a century without warming.



In response, the climate establishment is becoming increasingly polarized, with a growing number of researchers calculating less warming this century, while the apocalyptics, such as NASA’s James Hansen, simply edge out further on increasingly thin limbs.



This is quite a change. In 2002, I published a paper, “Revised 21st Century Temperature Projections,” which used a variety of independent sources and generally predicted a range of 21st century warming of 1.0 to 3.0 C. In response, the 2009 “Climategate” emails revealed a number of surreptitious attempts and schemes to either get the paper removed, get the esteemed geographer who was the relevant editor of the journal Climate Research fired from his University of Auckland professorship, or, if all else failed, destroy the journal itself.



Formally, the “climate sensitivity” is the total amount of warming projected for a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide. In their last climate compendium, published in 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gave a “likely” range for the sensitivity of “2 C to 4.5 C with a best estimate of about 3.0 C.” Since then, it appears that a new “consensus” is lowering the forecast. The reason I’m betting that the sensitivity of temperature to dreaded carbon dioxide has been overestimated is the number of recent publications saying just that. Here’s a partial list:



Richard Lindzen gives a range of 0.6 to 1.0 C (Asia‐​Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 2011); Andreas Schmittner, 1.4 to 2.8 C (Science, 2011); James Annan, using two techniques, 1.2 to 3.6 C and 1.3 to 4.2 C (Climatic Change, 2011); J.H. van Hateren, 1.5 to 2.5 C (Climate Dynamics, 2012); Michael Ring, 1.5 to 2.0 C (Atmospheric and Climate Sciences, 2012); and Julia Hargreaves, including cooling from dust, 0.2 to 4.0 C and 0.8 to 3.6 C (Geophysical Research Letters, 2012). Each of these has lower and higher limits below those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.



What commonly occurs when weather forecasts begin to go bad? As every child knows, if the forecast starts out calling for a foot of snow, and then is cut to six inches, that usually results in about three.



Similarly, as projections for warming are lowered, don’t be surprised if planetary temperature finally settles in the bottom half of the newly predicted ranges.



Science historians have repeatedly documented that we are particularly reluctant to abandon widely held views, or scientific paradigms. When professional advancement (i.e., research money) is particularly dependent upon a certain view (we wouldn’t spend billions on climate research unless it was important, right?), it’s even harder to let go, but that is what we may be seeing.



People are beginning, cautiously, to dial back 21st century warming because there has been none. Because dreaded sea‐​level rise is also proportional, those estimates are going to have to come down, too.



One of these years, the upcoming end of the world from global warming is going to be officially canceled, to be replaced by a new apocalypse, which I predict will be called “acid oceans,” or something like that.

When climate scold Greta Thunberg screeched at the UN that “people are dying!”, she was barely half-right.



Yes, people are dying, and they are dying because of climate change. But they are not dying because of global warming, and they are not dying because governments are refusing to act.



 **People are dying because of the very policies that Greta Thunberg wants to force on the world.**



As many commentators have pointed out to the ignorant, megalomaniac brat, climate-related deaths have plummeted. People are [far more likely to die from cold than heat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/05/20/cold-weather-deaths/27657269/). **People are dying because of the climate-change panic.**



Staggering energy prices are taking a toll on those unable to pay their bills, a UK regulator has admitted, confirming that **thousands of people may have died because of fuel poverty** and lack of heating during winter.



Climate change is an obsession for the elite. The sort of elites who fly their private jets or sail luxury yachts to “climate change summits” in swanky resorts, and vote for government subsidies for wind farms that will never be built in their leafy inner-city enclaves. The costs, in money and lives, are borne by the poor.



The most vulnerable households spend more on their energy bills than wealthier ones, and “can therefore be at greater risk of fuel poverty,” according to a comprehensive new study by the Office of Gas and Energy Markets (Ofgem) on Thursday.



Fuel poverty, a common UK term for customers who cannot afford to keep adequately warm at an affordable cost, “increases the risk that people [will] develop ill health,” it acknowledged.



Over winter 2017-18, we estimate that fuel poverty may have contributed to 5,500 excess winter deaths and that 16,500 excess winter deaths may have been linked to people living in cold homes.



The shocking death toll occurred despite the government trying to make energy more “cost reflective”.



Lest this all be dismissed as mere propaganda from RT, [the report itself](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2019/10/2019_state_of_the_energy_market_0.pdf) makes for eye-opening reading. Ofgem (a suitably Orwellian moniker) trumpets its goals as “driv[ing] down prices” and “protect[ing] consumers, especially the vulnerable”. Hard as the report tries to gloss over the inconvenient truths, it’s obvious that it’s failed those goals badly.



In England and Wales, around one in five privately rented households live in fuel poverty, compared to around a tenth of other households […]fuel poverty may have contributed to 5,500 excess winter deaths in winter 2017-18. From 2013 to 2018, more than 64,000 fuel poor customers have been connected to the mains gas grid, providing access to cheaper energy.”



In other parts of the UK, the situation is even more: one in four Scottish homes is fuel poor.



Meanwhile, the goal of all this suffering, “decarbonisation” is failing badly:



UK carbon emissions fell by only 12 million tonnes in 2018, the slowest rate of decline since 2012.



As George Orwell rebutted the foolish argument about needing to break eggs to make an omelette: “Where’s the omelette?”



People are indeed dying, Greta, you ignorant, arrogant brat: They’re dying because of people like you.

"A Florida man who admitted that he had  burned a mosque attended by Omar Mateen, the gunman behind the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla.  last year, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison. The man, Joseph Schreiber, 32, pleaded no contest  —   effectively a guilty plea  —   during a hearing on Monday in St. Lucie County. Mr. Schreiber, who had a previous criminal record and who had posted   views on social media, told detectives he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which in 2016 also fell on Eid   an important Muslim holiday, Assistant State Attorney Steve Gosnell said. The mosque was so badly damaged  —   photos published online show a gaping hole in the roof and an interior burned to a crisp  —   that it is expected to be relocated. The mosque, about an hour’s drive north of Palm Beach, was occasionally attended by Mr.  Mateen, the Islamic State supporter who shot and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others on June 12 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Mr. Mateen was killed by police officers responding to the mass shooting. Before Mr. Schreiber was sentenced, he read aloud a lengthy statement in which he said the arson had been driven by anxiety, not hate. Florida, he said, could be targeted in another terrorist attack. “My message is this to all the Muslim communities on the face of the Earth: Make peace with America and make peace with Israel and stop the killings, stop the attacks,” he said. Mr. Gosnell, the prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Schreiber had told detectives that he believed Muslims were “trying to infiltrate our government” and that “the teaching of Islam should be completely illegal. ” Mr. Schreiber’s sentence was based on his previous criminal record and on arson evidencing prejudice, essentially a hate crime in Florida, the prosecutor said. The Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, but it has drawn scrutiny in recent years as a place of worship for young men who staged terror attacks. In addition to the connection with Mr. Mateen, the Islamic Center had been a frequent stop for Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who carried out a suicide bombing in 2014 in Syria. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the men had known each other casually."
"**NHS staff at a Welsh health board faced 61 incidents of violence and aggression in a month, the health board has said.**
Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers large parts of west Wales, said staff had been abused on hospital wards and in the community.
Community health practitioners were ""confronted, challenged and abused"" for wearing PPE, it added.
Director of nursing Mandy Rayani said staff were feeling ""increasingly upset"" as a result of the abuse.
Staff at Hywel Dda experienced 61 incidents of violence and aggression in September, an average of just over two every day.
The health board provides services to about 384,000 people in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, which includes some of the most rural areas of Wales.
It has the lowest number of coronavirus deaths out of any Welsh health board area which contains a general hospital, with 116 since the start of the pandemic, according to Public Health Wales figures.
Powys has a lower figure, but does not count deaths of residents in hospitals outside of the county.
Ms Rayani said: ""Staff who are working very hard to deliver care and treatment are feeling increasingly upset due to verbal abuse, and sometimes threatening and intimidating behaviour by patients and relatives, particularly when being asked to leave a department whilst their relative is being assessed.
""While the majority of the public treat NHS staff with respect, and appreciate the very difficult work they are doing in challenging circumstances, there are sadly a number of people who behave in a way which causes staff to feel at risk.""
She added healthcare workers wearing PPE was now standard practice and did not necessarily mean workers were treating Covid-19 cases."

Todd Muller has posted some thoughts on Friday’s School Strike for Climate on his Facebook page. As he predicted, there has been a bit of a ‘pile on’ in the comments because he wasn’t alarmist enough. The climate reality deniers cannot handle anything but complete subservience to the ’cause’. 



I admire the passion of the students who marched. 



I would admire their passion had they given up a day of their holidays.



I agree with their demands that those in political and economic influence around the world must initiate faster global action on climate change. 



And that is where the wheels fall off the National Party position on this debate. The climate has always changed and will continue to change and it is utter hubris for mankind to think that they can stop the climate changing.



First of all, we would need to agree on what exactly is the ideal climate that we should not change from. 



I accept that civil demonstrations can mould the political and business will for investment in technologies that will support transition to a low emission future.



We do not need to worry about the emissions of CO2; it is the food our environment needs for plant growth. By all means, reduce the emissions of harmful exhaust gases and make engines more efficient, thus saving money, but demonising a harmless trace gas is a nonsense. 



But when I see messages, repeated on signs held by our vulnerable, determined, anxious, youth saying “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change!”, I feel deeply uneasy.



I quite agree. This is an extremely harmful message that is being pumped into the minds of children not old enough to understand.



I do not agree that our young New Zealanders lives are at risk if global efforts to reduce emissions don’t happen at the pace that keeps global warming below 1.5 to 2 degrees.



Absolutely correct. There is no evidence that doom arrives at 2°C



Our young New Zealanders are right to be concerned about climate change. However, I do not believe their futures are hopeless, and we should not be allowing this message to take hold.



No, they are not. They are right to be concerned about the pollution of the rivers, lakes and seas. They are right to be concerned about the disappearance of the orangutan habitat and so on. But worrying their young heads about the climate is futile.



Doomsday predictions framed to challenge the perceived inherent inertia of the status quo, to make a political point, are reckless. For our young people, already feeling a sense of anxiety and lack of certainty around their futures, it can add to their sense of hopelessness.



Quite so. So **why is the National Party agreeing with the whole climate change shemozzle** that is totally built on doomsday predictions?



I appreciate that calling out such alarmist and catastrophising language will see many on the extremes of this debate pile in and say ‘hey, there’s the Nats Ag guy acting as a denier again’.



And, as predicted – they did.



I am not. I am, however someone who believes perspective is important in this debate, especially in how we articulate the opportunities, challenges and impacts of climate change to our youth and children.



Climate change is the most complex issue facing our planet.



Not it is not.



If we are to address climate change, it requires global adversaries, such as the United States, China and Russia, to cooperate together to transform their economies. Even if we work at breakneck pace, we still expect the world to warm 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. With this will come changes to agriculture, oceans and cities around the world, and we need to focus on how we adapt to these changes.



 **Why do we need to ruin our economies to fix a non-problem?**



But it is misplaced to state our society will collapse under these changes.



No, it is not. Please explain to us how society can continue without petroleum products and all the derivatives. The removal of all ‘fossil’ fuels is the end game of the climate strikers.



We need our young people to view climate change as a challenge they have a positive role in solving. Today’s youth will be the innovators of the next decade. There are opportunities to develop solutions to the challenges climate change presents to us, particularly in agriculture if given time to be invented.



Don’t waste their creative efforts on climate change. Channel them into something useful like reducing water pollution or predator control or anything else that improves our environment. 



A balanced sense of both challenge and opportunity must be outlined to our youth precisely because of their talent, curiosity and determination.



Let’s not dampen that collective capacity by scaring their self-belief with talk of extinction lingering just around the corner.



Fear paralyses, Hope enables. Let’s demonstrate that.



Hear, hear!



 _I have met and talked to Todd on many occasions. Todd is a thoroughly decent bloke who genuinely seems to be trying to rein in some of the excesses of Shaw et al. However until the National Party completely opposes this climate change nonsense they will continue to alienate possible supporters and voters._

 **Howick**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



In 2016, Sharon Stewart and Dick Quax were re-elected to represent this two councillor ward. Following Quax’s death in May 2018, Paul Young won the resulting by-election.  




[ **David Collings**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9917f043-2f01-446b-9381-b20828b6ad1c&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Collings for Council **$$$**



The electoral officers are getting pretty loose in terms of what they accept to be an affiliation these days. In the information booklet supplied to all candidates it states:



 _The nomination paper provides for a candidate to have an affiliation. An affiliation is described in section 57(3) of the Local Electoral Act 2001 as ‘an endorsement by any organisation or group (whether incorporated or unincorporated).’_



 _A candidate claiming a specific affiliation should supply with their nomination paper an authority to adopt the affiliation for the organisation or group concerned (i.e. letter of consent to use the affiliation from the organisation or group). This is a safety measure to avoid any illegal adoption of affiliations._



 _Affiliations that will not be accepted are ones:_



 _that might cause offence or_



 _are likely to confuse or mislead electors or_



 _are election slogans rather than the name of an organisation or group._



Is there truly an organisation called **‘Collings for Council’** that has given a written authorisation to David Collings to use that affiliation and has he supplied that with his nomination form? If that is the case, why is the [website advertised](http://collingsforcouncil.nz/) in his candidate profile empty? How is it that he is affiliated to C&R for his Local Board and DHB candidacies? There will be plenty more of these suspect affiliations as we get through all the candidates.  




That put aside, Collings has been in local body politics a loooooong time, having spent 3 years on Pakuranga Community Board, 9 years on Manukau City Council and a further 9 years on Howick Local Board. He has been the Chair since 2013, surviving a challenge, temper tantrum and resignation from Lucy Schwaner, wife of infamous Botany MP Jamie Lee Ross in 2016.



While clearly on the centre-right side of the political spectrum, he also holds typically NIMBY views when it comes to development in Howick, saying the ward “needs to protect its’ heritage.”



Stockade Hill, with a ‘viewshaft’ to the Hauraki Gulf continues to be an issue that ignites great passions amongst the locals, even inspiring a [protest song](https://youtu.be/8I-D0YD1ptw). While the ‘viewshaft’ is now protected, a battle continues in the Environment Court to secure the protection of 360-degree views from the top, mandating maximum building heights around the hill. Collings pledges to continue fighting to secure that 360-degree planning restriction.



Collings is on the saner side of transport planning, sceptical of AT plans to implement T2/Bus lanes on major arterial roads, and says he will see the Reeves Road Flyover completed.



Collings also inadvertently elbowed his way into the 2018 controversy over [whether a woman could be hired to play Santa](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/christmas/108841714/santa-stoush-auckland-politician-says-he-prefers-a-santa-with-boobies) in the annual Farmer’s Christmas parade:



 _Howick Local Board chairman David Collings waded into the debate on Saturday morning, saying in a public Facebook post that Farmers was “getting a bit too PC for my liking”._



 _“I don’t think [Baker’s] comments meant any harm. Cripes I would have loved as a kid a Santa with boobies, just like mummy,” he wrote._



 _“Boobies are very important when you’re a young child, they provide comfort. I to this day still remember that comfort.”_



 _He later admitted he was being “a bit silly” over Baker’s “boob” comment._



[ **Damien Light**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=8446fff4-1f7e-4340-9084-a7197d09fb36&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$**  




I’ve had several interactions with the former United Future Leader. He’s a genuinely nice guy (probably too bloody nice), with an authentic desire to work for the community, somewhat naively viewing politics as a community service rather than the nasty, petty shit fight for table scraps it really is. Since United Future closed shop, Light has essentially been an unelected, unpaid and very active advocate for Howick, even live-tweeting at local board meetings (which is a bit bloody weird, I think).



Unfortunately for Light, and maybe mankind as a whole, he stands absolutely no chance of being elected to Council in Howick. The area votes solidly blue in local and parliamentary elections, while Light is anything but.



His [website](https://www.damianlight.co.nz/en/my-priorities) contains a respectably detailed outline of his policies; something many other half-arsed troughers standing for election could learn from. For starters, unlike David Collings’, it actually works. Damien wants to stop endless rates rises, challenge reckless spending and drive cost efficiencies. However, just about every candidate uses that sort of language including Phil Goff. Light’s mention of using bonds as an alternative form of funding hints at his liberal-left leanings, though I don’t dispute the current funding model for local government is broken.



On transport, Light is a public transport fanatic, advocating just about every form of communal vehicle and network known to man (plus bikes) and I would put money on him inventing some we haven’t thought of in the near future. 



His green views, including the belief Council needs to achieve a plan to make Auckland carbon neutral before 2050 and support for Council declaring a ‘climate emergency,’ guarantee Damian will not be Howick’s next councillor.



[ **Tofik Mamedov**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e69e9278-78b8-4a94-abd5-aaac0d64cedd&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– East Vision **$**



Being a left-wing immigrant from Azerbaijan running on a ticket called East Vision is a little bit funny. Apparently East isn’t just a coincidental name for a ticket in East Auckland but is also an anagram for Environment, Arts & Culture, Safer Community, Transport.



Tofik’s candidate profile is not particularly informative, but his candidacies for Labour in 2017 and 2014 hint at his politics. Another candidate on the ticket standing for Howick Local Board, Morgan Xiao, is a rabid supporter of the Chinese Communist Party and even [nutty City Vision have spoken out to ](https://tewahanui.nz/politics/city-vision-distances-itself-from-similar-sounding-party-with-chinese-nationalist-candidate)disassociate East Vision with their brand.



[ **Sharon Stewart**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a0818d43-3ddf-4961-af20-a7423160d8ba&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$$$$**  




Stewart is a legend in East Auckland, having served on Manukau City Council since 1998 then topping the polls in the first Supercity election in 2010. As Citizens and Ratepayers (now known as Communities & Residents) collapsed around Albert-Eden councillor Christine Fletcher’s ears, Howick Councillors Stewart and Dick Quax ditched the mouldy brand to stand as Independents, being re-elected unopposed in 2013. ****



Sharon Stewart is a woman of strong political principle, unyielding in her fight to oppose rates increases, stupid spending and the centre-left council majority. There has always been a small and stubborn bloc of councillors opposing first Brown, then Goff on Council and Stewart has always been on its vanguard.



Stewart absolutely deserves to stay on as the Councillor for Howick, but the voters in her ward know that already.



[ **Paul Young**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b4e67313-d263-4728-80f1-e8e6f79d4ad4&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Howick%20Ward)– Independent **$$$**  




I’m a bit ‘meh’ on the other incumbent councillor for Howick. He has only held the seat for about a year, since winning the by-election resulting from the death of the legendary Dick Quax, so maybe I just need to see a bit more.



His candidate profile has just two “priorities.” The first; a public transport system featuring trackless trams running on roads with rubber wheels looks loony but it is clear Young hasn’t sought the help of a marketing guru to sell this idea. His other priority, law and order is a predictable offering that will go down well with his constituency, but I’m not sure how many “ever more CCTV cameras” actually is and it creeps me out a bit. 



Young was the wildcard in the 2011 Botany by-election, finishing third as the New Citizen Party candidate and then later stood for the Conservative Party. Before being elected, he has had a successful business career, running Paul Young International, something few around the Council table can claim.

National Public Radio published a story last week on biomedical scientists “cutting corners” in pursuit of funding. It was about the search for a cure for that horrendous ailment, Amyotrophyic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Repeatedly, drugs that seemed to work in animal tests didn’t pan out when tried on humans.



NPR spoke with Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who said that “part of the explanation relates to a growing issue in biomedical science: the mad scramble for scarce research dollars.” So, she said, “scientists are tempted to oversell weak results.”



She went on: “Getting a grant requires that you have an exciting story to tell, that you have preliminary data, and you have published. In the rush, to be perfectly honest, to get a wonderful story out on the street in a journal, and preferably with some publicity to match, scientists can cut corners.”





There’s strong evidence that the prevalence of bad science and ‘cut corners’ is increasing.



What’s happening is that scientists aren’t replicating the work of others. That’s viewed as a waste of time because it’s not flashy enough to attract money. And given that oodles of funding are required to publish the reams of papers required to get promotion and tenure at a tier‐​one research university, doing that kind of work is likely to endanger your career.



“Scarce research dollars” aren’t the problem. The number of practitioners of a given science is directly proportional to how much money floods the field. There’s no scientist struggling for promotion in high‐​end academia who thinks he or she is adequately funded. Dollars, by their very nature, are scarce. That’s why money has value.



The problem, instead, is the “American model” for professional advancement, which can be stated simply: “get funded, get published or get out.”



Take my specialty, climate change. Back when I started at this, in 1976, no one wanted to be a climatologist, in no small part because there was very little funding to go around. But as global warming became a political cause, the dollar flow increased from a few million a year to a current federal outlay of $2.3 billion.



And so everyone doing anything that could be vaguely related to climate change got into the act. On came the ecologists, the plant physiologists and even the psychologists.



You can see the results in the “national assessments” of the effects of climate change that are put out every few years by the federal climate bureaucracy. The 2014 version has been heavily cited by President Obama in support of his global warming policies, despite the fact that it simply ignores the growing disparity between the government’s climate models and reality.



According to Ross McKitrick, from Canada’s University of Guelph (and a Cato Institute scholar), we are now approaching two decades without any warming.



As a wonderful example of how money dilutes science, the 2014 report also says that global warming will increase the prevalence of mental illness in our cities. Are people really saner in the winters of Washington than they are in sunny Miami? Does moving there from New York threaten your stability?



Rest assured that if this research had shown no link between climate and mental health, there would also be no renewal of the associated research grant. Negative results get neither published nor funded.



There’s strong evidence that the prevalence of bad science and “cut corners” is increasing.



University of Montreal’s Daniele Fanelli examined over 5,000 published papers from around the world, and over many disciplines. His stunning 2012 finding was titled “Negative Results are Disappearing from Most Disciplines and Countries,” and it documented a systematic increase in the frequency of “positive” findings being published.



All the incentives push science in the direction of positive results, and there is every disincentive (such as loss of funding and therefore your job) to not report when your research hypothesis isn’t borne out by the data.



Fanelli also found, in separate work, that the addition of a single American author to a multi‐​authored international paper greatly raises the probability that it will report a positive result.



All of this is tragic. In biomedicine, people suffer and die because of falsely promised cures. In climate change, we get poisonous policies emanating from absurd results generated by climate models that can’t even get the last two decades right.



And around the world, the quality of science is in decline as nations increasingly adopt our model for professional advancement.

"HAMBURG, Germany  —   Workplaces often display a particular type of signage: “This Department Has Worked __ Days Without An Accident. ” These notices, with their hopefully ascending numbers, are meant to remind employees of institutional standards, of individual responsibilities, of the importance of mindfulness and consistency. The Hamburger S. V. clock is sort of like that. Displayed prominently in the northwest corner of Hamburg’s cavernous home, the Volksparkstadion, the clock marks the total time, down to the second, that the team has spent in the Bundesliga, the top tier of German soccer. Last Friday, the digital numbers, glowing in white, ticked relentlessly upward when the club hosted Bayer Leverkusen: 53 years, 163 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes, 28 seconds at kickoff, all without an accident. As you read this sentence, they continue to mark the days, the hours, the seconds. In Hamburg, the simple act of keeping time commemorates an essential fact of the club’s identity. A founding member, it has played continuously in the Bundesliga since the league’s first competitive moments, on Aug. 24, 1963, at 5 p. m. It is a distinction no other German club can boast. Not the former European champion Borussia Dortmund. Not Hamburg’s Nordderby rival, and fellow founding member, Werder Bremen. Not even mighty Bayern Munich. All this helps explain the complicated angst once again shadowing this city’s biggest team. Pride outstripped performance here long ago. After decades of producing quality soccer  —   Hamburg has three Bundesliga titles on its résumé, and it reigned as the champion of Europe at the end of the   season  —   the club is currently mired in a yearslong rut. Hamburg narrowly avoided its first relegation in 2012, and has survived two even closer calls since then. Now, a stream of losses this season has once again plunged the club toward the bottom of the standings. And the clock, a    reminder of the club’s venerated past, has in effect become a scale measuring in real time the incessantly mounting weight of history. “I don’t know if it’s a blessing or a curse right now,” said Toben Baumgarten, 24, a fan of the team since childhood. “This can be a point of pressure on the team. They have to keep the clock running. ” Hamburg moved up one place last weekend to 16th in the   league, with 15 games remaining. In the Bundesliga, the bottom two teams at the end of the season are automatically relegated. The    team must play a   playoff series against the   team from the second division, with the winner awarded the final spot in the upper tier. Hamburg grabbed that lifeline in 2014 and 2015, pulling itself to safety and keeping its clock ticking. The club’s poor play, for now, has not much dampened its support. There were 45, 653 fans at the game on Friday, many of them eager to diagnose the team’s ills, to offer variations on similar themes: The players are afraid to lose history has handcuffed the club moves geared toward     have suppressed big, fresh ideas. According to Bobby Wood, an American striker who joined the club last May on a   contract, it does not take long for new players to grasp the depth of the club’s history, to absorb its pride  —   or to inherit its emotional baggage. It’s hard to avoid: In 2014, a small, digital version of the clock was mounted in the front window of the team bus. “You don’t want to be a guy on the team that gets relegated after all these years,” Wood said. “Just because we never got relegated doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen, so you can’t think it’s not going to happen. If we continue this way, we will get relegated. We have to get out of that mentality, start realizing we’re in a bad situation, and do something different to get out of it. ” Things have not always been this dire. Hamburg, which has played in Germany’s top tier since the modern incarnation of the club was formed in 1919, has captured six domestic league titles over all, and three German Cups. It won the European Cup in 1983, in the midst of a golden era that ran from the   to the  . When the first clock was installed in 2001, the team was mired in a spell of mediocrity that has extended to the present day. Back then it was a marker of pride as well as time. “We weren’t winning trophies at that point, so you look for the one thing everyone was proud about,” said Alexander Iwan, who was 7 years old when he watched Hamburg win the 1987 German Cup, the club’s last significant trophy. He still stands on the terraces every weekend, just below the clock, to sing alongside the team’s other   fans. Twelve years ago, his university studies and sports loyalties fortuitously merged when he began working as a historian for the team. Sometimes, while giving tours of the stadium, Iwan will direct his guests’ attention to the clock and mention Bayern Munich, the biggest club in Germany. Bayern has never been relegated either, but, crucially, it was not a founding member of the Bundesliga, and only played its way in in 1965. “They win two trophies a year,” Iwan tells them about Munich. “But we have this. ” Iwan said the clock serves as a reminder of the club’s pedigree, regardless of its current state. No matter what, he added, it is loaded with meaning. “It shows everything  —   all the history, all the problems  —   at once,” he said. Hamburg won its game on Friday at the Volksparkstadion,   with a workmanlike performance against visiting Leverkusen. The players launched themselves into tackles, skidding around the damp field, earning appreciative applause from the crowd. Around the 28th minute, and for the next several minutes, fans belted out a popular club song, which borrows the melody of “We’re Not Gonna Take It” by Twisted Sister: Sechs mal Deutscher meister,   German champion, Drei mal pokalsieger,   cup winner, Immer erste liga, H. S. V.! Always first division, H. S. V.! What would happen if the team got sent down? The song, for one thing, would disappear with the last tick of the clock. Patrik Voss, 31, predicted frustrations would boil over in vivid ways. “I think many people would be aggressive, angry,” he said. “Some riots, protests, might go on. ” The clock, Voss presumed, would be removed, never to be seen again. But others on Friday suggested it should be saved, perhaps used to count down to some predetermined deadline for promotion. And some said relegation might even serve as an overdue notice for the organization. Such thought exercises have been more common over the last five years, mental gymnastics amid the   and the relegation playoff escapes. The clock, in the process, has sometimes become an object of jokes and scorn. Iwan said local newspapers often use headline puns playing on timepiece imagery. Sometimes, they have replaced text headlines altogether with images of the clock. Many fans have grown more cynical. “I think if we were not successful right now, we wouldn’t be so proud about always being in the league,” said Baumgarten, the young fan. “It’s more like there’s nothing else to be proud about, so you talk about the history a lot. ” Sipping a beer before Friday’s game, Baumgarten recalled going to a Hamburg game as a child and listening to his father explain the clock’s meaning. He was impressed, and the feeling stuck with him through the years as his devotion to the club grew. “I hope if I come here with my own son one day, I can show him the clock,” he said, smiling at his sudden sentimentality. “We’ll see. ”"

Hey, if you can’t win the scientific debate, then just have the US federal government declare it over and to go after anyone who doesn’t agree.

Obviously the alarmists are tired of losing and seeing support slip away. They just want to be declared the winner, and anyone who can’t accept that should learn to do so using the threat of RICO-style prosecution.
Much of the panel discussion has the participants trying to re-convince themselves there is a scientific consensus and that anyone who disagrees is just stupid anyway. They also talk about what the media can do to control the message, and they praise the LA Times for censoring skeptic views.
After watching parts of the above discussion, you’ll agree that the best thing to do is to just keep on doing what they hate the most: Focus on the data and the charts, and getting people to look out the window (that is if it isn’t buried in snow).

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) A couple of months ago, then   Kamala Harris appointed Julie Chavez Rodriguez to be her state director, overseeing operations in California. Ms. Rodriguez, 38, would “give voice to our vulnerable communities,” Ms. Harris said at the time. Ms. Rodriguez had experience. Her most recent job was in the White House serving as senior deputy director of public engagement and special assistant to President Barack Obama. But she also brought a personal connection to politics  —   she is the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, the great labor leader for farmworkers. Raised in the Central Valley, Ms. Rodriguez was surrounded by activism. Once, at age 9, she was arrested during a protest outside a supermarket while distributing fliers about pesticide risks. Ever since, those battles have shaped her path, she said. We caught up with Ms. Rodriguez by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: • Tell me about your gig. What have you been up to? • What are you hearing from unauthorized immigrants in the state? And what are you telling them? • What do you think your grandfather would make of all this? • You were in Washington for more than seven years. How is it coming back to California?

In November, a coalition of education leaders in the San Joaquin Valley introduced an initiative that would provide a free semester of community college to students who meet certain academic goals. City College of San Francisco, founded in 1935, serves about 60, 000 students. Until now, course costs for city residents have run $46 a unit, or roughly $1, 100 a year.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German daily Bild, the world’s sixth largest daily in print by circulation, reported on the climate demonstration in New York and on the stars who appeared, foremost Leonardo DiCaprio.
At first Bild describes the event as the “largest climate demonstration of all time” and how the event drew more than 300,000 in New York, making it sound impressive.
But then Bild pours cold water on the noble planet rescue attempt and made it look like one hijacked by big Hollywood publicity seekers, and making star Di Caprio look like a hypocrite for demanding climate action while living a lavish life of luxury, mega-yachts, private jets and limousines.
Bild writes:

DiCaprio’s dedication however drew derisive comments. US news site “The Daily Caller“ accused the actor of hypocrisy.
At Twitter critics ridiculed how the star flew over to New York for the demonstration with his private jet. Others pointed out with outrage that the actor was a guest on the giant yacht of an Arabian multi-billionaire earlier this summer.”

Reactions/comments by Bild readers are practically unanimous, with the underlying message: Climate science is a farce and DiCaprio is behaving like a hypocrite. What follows are just a random few I’ve translated:
Reader Liliia Lilianenko comments:

Leonardo di Caprio should refrain from his luxury yacht if he doesn’t want climate change.”

"**Wales is ready and waiting to roll out a Covid vaccination programme within days, say officials in Wales.**
It follows mounting speculation that UK regulators are ready to approve at least one of the vaccines being reviewed.
They have been reviewing data on three vaccines for emergency approval for use.
A decision could come as early as Wednesday and First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales was prepared.
Speaking at a Covid briefing, Mr Drakeford said: ""Last week, the NHS in Wales carried out a large and successful test of all the practical things, which will need to be in place once a vaccine is given the go-ahead.""
He added that this ""could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it"".
On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited a laboratory in Wrexham, which is gearing up to produce the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it is approved.
The Wockhardt UK lab has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks.
Mr Johnson said it could provide ""salvation for humanity"" when it starts producing coronavirus vaccines.
Trials have shown the Wrexham vaccine to be between 62% and 90% effective in protecting against Covid-19.
It is the cheapest of the vaccines being considered, and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures.
But the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech is also being scrutinised by regulators, and could also get early approval.
Moderna are also hoping to get the go-ahead in the US and Europe for its vaccine.
The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines:
Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be amongst the first to receive the vaccines when they are approved.
The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority:
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19."
"**A council is challenging the government's decision to put it into tier three after the current lockdown restrictions end.**
Stratford-on-Avon District Council said it had sent a judicial review pre-action letter to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
Tony Jefferson, leader of the Conservative-run council, said it was not ""an action we take lightly"".
He said the data did not ""warrant"" the area being place in tier three.
According to official figures, in the week to 27 November the rate of infection for Stratford-upon-Avon was 74.6.
The area was in tier one before before England's second lockdown was introduced.
Mr Jefferson said the decision to put the Stratford district in tier three ""therefore appears arbitrary and irrational"".
""It is very disappointing that the government did not use much greater granularity in deciding on tiers,"" he said.
""I know that they have looked at a number of factors including the rates in all age groups, particularly older people who are more vulnerable to the virus; and we have to take into consideration the pressure on our local hospitals and NHS services.
""However, none of the metrics for our district warrant it being placed in tier three.""
Mr Jefferson said hospitality businesses were ""devastated"" at being placed into the highest tier and the prospect of a review by 16 December was ""no consolation"".
The district forms part of a sub-regional group for the purposes of being placed into tier three, which includes the rest of the county, together with Coventry and Solihull.
Infection rates for Nuneaton and Bedworth, in the county's north, was 207, the North Warwickshire district was 205.3, Solihull 159, Coventry 177.9, Rugby 152.4 and Warwick 105.
It has previously been reported Stratford had the lowest average case rate of any area in the country being placed into tier three.

When the wizened wizard of woke-ness, Bob Brown, led his ill-fated clown parade of anti-coal activists last May, it was the standard motley collective of greybeards in sandals (and that was just the women) and dreadlocked ferals. The nosey-nannas at least have the poor excuse that they’re too clapped out to perform any useful function in society, but the smelly unemployables are supposedly of working age.



Except that “work” is as foreign a concept as personal hygiene. Indeed, one of the dreadlocked delusionals actually boasted that protesting was his job.



Australia’s Employment Minister begs to differ.



Employment Minister Michaelia Cash has **threatened to suspend the welfare payments of activists who spend their time protesting instead of looking for jobs.**



Senator Cash told The Australian the government would ­always be focused on getting “people off welfare and into work” after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton urged the community to push back against disruptive protesters.



“Taxpayers should not be ­expected to subsidise the protests of others.”



As rock band TISM once said of Australia’s arts elite, these publicly-funded grifters line up to hurl abuse at taxpayers while deftly picking their pockets.



Ever the government’s head kicker, Peter Dutton is backing Senator Cash, and going the biff on indulgent lefty beaks who treat these tax-scrounging pests with indulgence.



In an interview on Sydney radio 2GB on Thursday, Mr Dutton took aim at magistrates who imposed “slap on the wrist” penalties for protesters, declaring Queensland should introduce mandatory sentences for those who regularly disrupt the community.



It comes after six people were charged with obstruction offences on Wednesday after a road-blocking protest by climate activist group Extinction Rebellion disrupted the Brisbane CBD during peak hour.



Two days earlier, four people involved in the same group were charged over a protest in which a woman climbed up a large tripod on a high-traffic CBD bridge at a similar time…Radio host Ray Hadley said three of the protesters who ­attached themselves to the Brisbane streets were welfare recipients, and argued that the benefit should be removed […]



Mr Dutton said the community needed to “push back” against the “unacceptable” behaviour seen by those in the recent protest action.



“People should take these names and the photos of these people and distribute them as far and wide as they can so that we shame these people,” he said. “Let their families know what you think of their behaviour.”



As Chris Delforce, loon-in-chief for anti-farming nutters “Aussie Farms” – notorious for publishing the home addresses of Australian farmers – has found, it’s not so nice when the boot is on the other foot.

At all the ‘Meet the Candidates” evenings for the Local Body elections in Tauranga and the Western Bay of Plenty the earnest folk at the ‘Carbon Reduction Group’ have been handing out these flyers:



They did not even bother to claim that it was printed with non-petroleum based inks or printed on paper sourced from sustainable forests or anything.



They simply wasted the earth’s resources in order to ‘reduce carbon’.



And another curious thing … At the Meet the Candidates evenings a Councillor who was behind her Council declaring a ‘Climate Emergency’ and another one who would like his Council to do so, were the only ones bombarding the place with flyers that had a very short life-span before hitting the bin. Also guilty of using coreflute plastic signs.

One doesn’t need Superman’s X‐​ray vision or have to look far to see various tensions building in the Asia‐​Pacific region, aside from those long‐​standing ones between North and South Korea, or China and Taiwan.



Recent rhetoric over a chain of uninhabited islands in a potentially energy‐​rich area of the East China Sea, which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, and which the Chinese call the Diaoyu Islands, makes it appear that the Japanese government is taking a tougher approach on foreign policy and military affairs.



Its decision to purchase the disputed islands in September has only served to increase irritation among the Chinese. Ironically, the Japanese government was trying to keep things from getting worse, since the decision was a response to the hawkish plans of Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who sought to purchase the islands by collecting public donations. Given Ishihara’s nationalistic views, such a purchase would have certainly have further escalated the dispute.



Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda vowed that he would “never compromise” on the territorial dispute with China. And even his rival, Shinzo Abe, former prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has similarly pledged to defend Japan’s territorial assets.



Those hoping the United States can mediate this are likely hoping in vain. The United States maintains that it has no position on the dispute, while acknowledging that the islands nonetheless fall under a United States‐​Japan defense treaty.



Meanwhile, China continues its military and political standoff with the Philippines over control of parts of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.



And the United States has conceptualized a new concept of American overseas military operations known as “Air‐​Sea Battle,” which some in Asia — as well as back home — see as a way for the United States to challenge a rising China.



Aside from its longstanding military presence in Japan and South Korea, the U.S. military, as part of the Obama Administration’s “pivot to Asia,” is building up its relationships with other Asian nations, especially those in and around Southeast Asia.



Last November, President Obama and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced plans for enhanced U.S.-Australian military cooperation, sending up to 2,500 U.S. Marines to Australia for joint training and exercises, increasing visits by U.S. aircraft to northern Australian airfields, and conducting more calls by U.S. ships to various Australian ports.



On Tuesday, Lieut. General Francis J. Wiercinski, commanding general of U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC), said at a panel at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference that “seven of the 10 largest armies in the world are in the Pacific.”



Usually when there are geopolitical tensions there are also rising military expenditures. Such seems to be the case, as least in East Asia, although the start of the rise predates the incident described above. A study released this month by the independent Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington examines defense spending in Asia for the five countries with the largest defense budgets in Asia—China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—for the years 2000 to 2011.



Among its findings was that defense spending increased in all five countries between 2000 and 2011. They spent a combined $224 billion last year. In constant 2011 U.S. dollars, this is almost twice the amount they spent in 2000.



But there have been changes among those countries, according to the CSIS study. Until 2005, Japan had the largest defense budget in Asia. Since 2005, China has been the biggest spender on defense, having previously replaced India as the second‐​biggest spender in 2001. China’s share of the group’s combined defense spending, more than doubled from 19.9% in 2000 to 40.2% in 2011.



Accounting for inflation, from 2000 to 2011 China’s defense spending increased the fastest, with an 11‐​year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4%. South Korea was second, with a 4.8% CAGR. India and Japan were on a very similar growth trajectory, with 3.6 and 3.5% CAGRs, respectively. Taiwan experienced the lowest increase in defense spending among the group with a CAGR of 1.8%.



Bur military spending is only an indication — not a prediction — of what might happen in the future.



The study concludes, among other things:



 _Overall, continued or increasing tensions in the Asia‐​Pacific region could drive further increases in defense spending by Asian countries. Should the economic climate of the Asia‐​Pacific region concurrently show positive growth, many countries will also have increased means to respond to security concerns. On the other hand, if the financial situation in the coming years proves to be more austere, pressure on defense spending may also mount._

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
Atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4)—a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide (at least over shorter time scales)—have begun rising after a hiatus from 1999-2006 that defied all expectations. No one knows for sure why—why they stood still, or why they started up again.   
  
There is a lot of research underway looking into the causes of the observed methane behavior and at least three new studies have reported results in the scientific literature in the past couple of months.   
  
The findings are somewhat at odds with each other.   
  
In February, a study led by Alex Turner, from Harvard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, was published that examined methane emissions from the US over the past 10 years or so. The researchers compared observations taken from orbiting satellites to observations made from several sites on the earth’s surface. They reported over the past decade “an increase of more than 30% in US methane emissions.” And this increase was so large as to “suggest that increasing US anthropogenic methane emissions could account for up to 30-60% of [the] global increase.”   
  
However, the methodologies employed by Turner et al. were insufficient for determining the _source_ of the enhanced emissions. While the authors wrote that “[t]he US has seen a 20% increase in oil and gas production and a 9-fold increase in shale gas production from 2002 to 2014” they were quick to point out that “the spatial pattern of the methane increase seen by [satellite] does not clearly point to these sources” and added that “[m]ore work is needed to attribute the observed increase to specific sources.”   
  
Perhaps most interestingly, Turner and colleagues note that “national inventory estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicate no significant trend in US anthropogenic methane emissions from 2002 to present”—a stark contrast to their findings, and a potential embarrassing problem for the EPA. But, never fear, the EPA is on it. The EPA is now actively re-examining its methane inventory and seems to be in the process of revising it upwards, perhaps even so much as to change its previous reported decline in methane emissions to an increase. Such a change would have large implications for the US’s ability to keep the pledge made at the U.S. 2015 Climate Conference in Paris.   
  
However, the Turner et al. results have been called into question by a prominently-placed study in _Science_ magazine just a couple of weeks later. The _Science_ study was produced by a large team led by Hinrich Schaefer of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.   
  
Schaefer and colleagues analyzed the changes in the isotopic ratios of carbon in the methane contained in samples of air within ice cores, archived air samples, and more recent measurement systems. Different sources of methane contain different mixtures of methane isotopes, related to how long ago the methane was formed. Using this information, the authors developed a model for trying to back out the methane sources from the well-mixed atmospheric samples. Although such a procedure is somewhat tunable (i.e., you can get pretty much any answer you want (kind of like climate models!)), the authors are pretty confident in their final results.   




What they determined was that prior to the 1999-2006 hiatus, methane emissions largely bore a chemical signature of fossil fuels. This signal diminished during the hiatus, and has not shown much of an increase since, despite the post-2006 renewed growth in global methane emissions. Instead, Schaefer’s team found a strong chemical signal pointing to biogenic sources of methane being behind the current rise—most pointedly, emissions from agriculture (including both rice paddies and animal husbandry).   
  
Despite the rather surprising nature of this conclusion, the authors are resolute:   




The finding of a predominantly biogenic post-2006 increase is robust. Further, it seems likely that fossil-fuel emissions stagnated or diminished in the 1990s. Importantly, they are a minor contributor to the renewed [CH4]-rise. This contradicts emission inventories reporting increases of all source types between 2005 and 2010 with a major (~60%) thermogenic [fossil fuels] contribution… The finding is unexpected, given the recent boom in unconventional gas production and reported resurgence in coal mining and the Asian economy. Our isotope-based analysis suggests that the [CH4]-plateau marks not a temporary suppression of a particular source but a reconfiguration of the CH4-budget. Either food production or climate-sensitive natural emissions are the most probable causes of the current [CH4]-increase. These scenarios may require different mitigation measures in the future.



It is very hard to reconcile the results of Schaefer et al. with those of Turner et al.   
  
Also disturbing is the glib statement on “climate-sensitive natural emissions.” Attention, Schaefer et al.: Your study covers from 2007 through 2014. The figure below shows annual global surface temperature departures from an arbitrary mean. _There is no climate change to be “sensitive” to during this period_. Further, the statement is at odds with much of the text of the article, which largely points to an anthropogenic biogenic source for the change. One can’t help but wonder if some crusading reviewer insisted on the climate statement as the price for publication. Such a thing happened to one of us (Michaels) as a condition for publication in the prestigious “EOS—Transactions of the American Geophysical Union” many moons ago, despite the fact that the paper in question specifically determined such a link was not the case.    






And, to keep things interesting, a paper was published just days after the Schaefer et al. _Science_ piece, by a team of researchers led by Petra Hausmann of Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. These researchers investigated the growth in atmospheric methane concentrations alongside the growth in atmospheric ethane concentrations –a tracer for methane emission from fossil fuels. By analyzing the increase in ethane, Hausmann et al. concluded that about half of the growth in methane emissions between 2007 and 2014 came from fossil fuel sources correlated to the oil and natural gas fracking boom in the U.S. In their press release, they note that their result fits with the Turner et al. results of a significant increase in US methane emissions and contrasts with the US EPA estimates. The authors also note the discrepancy with the Schaefer et al. findings.   
  
Pretty clearly, no one knows quite what is going on.   
  
And into this confusion, the EPA has decided (no doubt from the President’s urging) to issue regulations pertaining to the allowable amount of methane emissions from US oil and gas recovery and delivery operations—in the name of mitigating future climate change.   
  
As we pointed out when the regulations were first announced, the impact on future climate change is so tiny as to be immaterial. And now, with the great uncertainty as to what exactly is behind the recent rise in atmospheric methane concentrations, the EPA’s regulations may not only be insignificant, but wrong-headed as well.   
  
What is certain, is that if you don’t understand the cause of a situation, taking steps to “fix” it is probably a bad idea. The Obama Administration’s “While under debate, regulate!” mantra is a poor operating protocol destined to fail. Or worse.

The storm was captured by a special “day-night band,” which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as auroras, airglow, gas flares, city lights, fires and reflected moonlight. City lights in the south and mid-section of the United States are visible in the image.
William Straka, associate researcher at Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, explains that since there was a full moon there was the maximum illumination of the clouds.
“You can see that Sandy is pulling energy both from Canada as well as off in the eastern part of the Atlantic,” Straka said. “Typically forecasters use only the infrared bands at night to look at the structure of the storm. However, using images from the new day/night band sensor in addition to the thermal channels can provide a more complete and unique view of hurricanes at night.”
VIIRS is one of five instruments onboard Suomi NPP. The mission is the result of a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Department of Defense.
On Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. EDT, Hurricane Sandy made landfall 5 miles (10 km) south of Atlantic City, N.J., near 39 degrees 24 minutes north latitude and 74 degrees 30 minutes west longitude. At the time of landfall, Sandy’s maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph (130 kph) and it was moving to the west-northwest at 23 mph (37 kph). According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds extended outward to 175 miles (280 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended 485 miles (780 km). Sandy’s minimum central pressure at the time of landfall was 946 millibars or 27.93 inches.
Suomi NPP was launched on Oct. 28, 2011, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. One year later, Suomi NPP has orbited Earth more than 5,000 times and begun returning images and data that provide critical weather and climate measurements of complex Earth systems.
Suomi NPP observes Earth’s surface twice every 24-hour day, once in daylight and once at night. NPP flies 512 miles (824 kilometers) above the surface in a polar orbit, circling the planet about 14 times a day. NPP sends its data once an orbit to the ground station in Svalbard, Norway, and continuously to local direct broadcast users.

A scheming cabal of green bureaucrats, academics and corporate speculators is trying to scare us into a mess of energy taxes, subsidies and rationing in order to combat what they call “catastrophic man-made global warming”.
Climate alarmists speculate that if the level of harmless carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is doubled (which may or may not happen in a century or so), world temperature may be one or two degrees warmer than it would have otherwise been.

The proposition that this mild warming, if it occurs, would be “catastrophic” is so laughable that they had to invent “positive feedbacks” to multiply this scare to maybe six degrees in a century. However the emerging evidence, and Earth’s past history, show that feedbacks are negative – the vast oceans tend to stabilise warming temperatures so that even the two degree forecast is probably excessive.
In many places in Australia, temperature rises about sixteen degrees from dawn to mid-afternoon – over say eight hours, or two degrees per hour. So people who can cope with a daily warming of 16 degrees over 8 hours are supposed to panic about a fudged forecast of two degrees over a century – about the warming we feel in just one hour every morning. Even less “frightening” is the less than one degree of warming that has occurred over the last 200 years.
Why worry about warming anyhow?
The world has never suffered “runaway global warming” even when carbon dioxide levels were far above those of today. But it does suffer regular ice ages. It is not warmth that causes hardship and mass extinctions – it is the deathly grip of ice. The Little Ice Age that ended just 150 years ago was a time of failed crops, abandoned farms, advancing glaciers and famines. Even in modern times, there are more deaths caused by winter cold snaps than by summer heat waves. And those people free to move (tourists and retirees) always flock to warm places like Florida, Bali and the Riviera, not to frigid climes like Siberia, Alaska or Antarctica.
Moreover, more warmth always causes extra evaporation from lakes and oceans. What goes up, must form clouds and come down somewhere as extra precipitation. And if there is more carbon dioxide and water in the atmosphere, plants will grow better. Why do we need carbon taxes and ration cards to protect us from a warm moist climate with more luxuriant plant life?
The whole climate scam is just a smoke screen to hide the UN inspired grab for more taxes and more power.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate scientists on both sides of the debate agree on one thing: the earth’s surface and atmosphere have (unexpectedly) stopped warming; there’s been no temperature increase in over 17 years and counting.
While global warming scientists insist the pause is only temporary and that warming will resume in earnest sometime in the future (once the missing heat comes out of hiding), other scientists are very skeptical. Today a growing number of distinguished scientists all over the globe believe the earth will be cooling due to the forces of natural cycles that have recently come into play.
Yet as many scientists are making forecasts of cooling, there’s one fact that seems to have escaped them: the datasets of the world’s leading climate data institutes clearly show that planetary cooling is already taking place and has been happening for over a decade.

Chart source: www.woodfortrees.org. 
Danish solar scientist Henrik Svensmark recently declared: “Global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning.” The cold reality, however, is that the cooling actually started 12 years ago!
There are more signs other than temperature readings that show global cooling is in full swing. Antarctica has just set a new record positive sea ice anomaly. Global sea ice has been mostly above average for a year and half, flying in the face of stunned scientists who warned just 5 years ago that the Arctic could soon be ice-free in the summertime. Moreover Asia, Europe and North America have been hard hit by a string of unexpectedly harsh winters.

So how cold is it going to get and for how long?
Although a large number of scientists agree on cooling, they differ widely on how much and for how long.
Geologist and climate researcher Sebastian Lüning of Germany in a just released video forecasts a global cooling of 0.2° by 2030, before it starts to warm up again. However, many scientists see this as too mild of a forecast. Russian solar physicist Habibullo Abdussamatov, for example, predicts another Little Ice Age by 2055. Also Russia’s Pulkovo Observatory claims we “could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200-250 years.”
Long list of experts
At his Climate Depot website, Marc Morano has a list of a number of renowned scientists who believe the data are clear on what’s ahead.
Prominent geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook warns that “global cooling is almost a slam dunk” for up to 30 years or more. The Australian Astronomical Society warns of global cooling as the sun’s activity “significantly diminishes”.
The reason for the cooling? Scientists agree that it’s natural solar and oceanic cycles overpowering the overhyped effects of greenhouse trace-gas CO2.

Responding to the worldwide refugee crisis—which the United Nations has called “the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era”—President Obama vowed last September that the United States would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and 85,000 refugees total over the following 12 months. With much fanfare, the State Department hit its Syrian refugee quota this week. But with just one month left, it is still 15,000 short of its overall target, and if it continues at its current pace, it will come up 3,000 short.   
  
But here are seven reasons why hitting the target would be a major accomplishment.   
  
**1) A slow start** : The biggest reason that the State Department is cutting it close is that it suffered one of its slowest starts in recent years. In the prior three fiscal years (FYs), the refugee target was 70,000, and yet even with a higher goal this year, the United States had accepted fewer refugees at the midpoint of this year than at the same time in any of those years (the purple bolded line in the chart below). While the United States has usually ramped up slightly during the second half of prior years, it has taken an historic effort to catch up this year.   
  
_Figure: Monthly Refugee Admissions to the United States (FY 2013-FY 2016)_   
  
  




_Source:State Department _   
  
**2) Most refugees in a month ever:** If the United States is to reach its goal this year, it will need to accept nearly 15,000 refugees in September. This is more than any month that the State Department has made available since 2001 and possibly the most ever. Although month-by-month statistics are unavailable for the record year of FY 1992 when the United States admitted 132,000 refugees, the average monthly intake was only 11,000, making it possible that this September will be the most ambitious month in history.   
  
**3) Late planning** : A major reason for the slow start is that the agencies had planned throughout FY 2015 to accept only 75,000 in FY 2016. It was not until two weeks before the start of the year that Secretary of State John Kerry changed course and decided to increase the number by 10,000. The agencies scrambled to adjust, but it took time to ramp up. “As an operational person and for planning purposes, I had anticipated an increase from 70,000 to 75,000,” Barbara Strack, Refugee Affairs Division Chief of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), told Congress on October 1st last year. In order to meet the goal, the agency needed to “surge” hundreds of refugee officers into Jordan from February to April to conduct enough interviews to meet the goal.



 **4) No new money** : The agencies are already on pace to admit 12,000 more refugees this year than last year, despite receiving no new funding to do so. The agencies actually did not ask for new money. The State Department’s representative Larry Bartlett told Congress in October that the department was “looking for efficiencies across its programs.” Ms. Strack told Congress that USCIS believed that there was “sufficient funding… to cover the 85,000 anticipated admissions in FY ‘16 by reprioritizing between programs.” But again, reprioritizations and efficiencies take time, and the lack of new money likely delayed their ability to ramp up, making the accomplishment all the more impressive.   
  
**5) Humanitarian emergencies everywhere** : On top of these 85,000 refugees, the Office of Refugee Resettlement will also have to deal with the most Cuban arrivals since 1980, the most asylum-seekers at the border claiming a credible fear of persecution in their home countries ever, and a massive influx of unaccompanied immigrant children. The administration warned Congress as early as December that it may fall short of the money needed to handle the number of unaccompanied children, and that has in the past resulted in money being taken from the refugee program.   
  
**6) The most difficult cases** : Assuming that it takes in as many as it did last month, the United States is on pace to accept roughly 13,000 Syrian refugees this year, which is more than 5 times the amount it admitted last year. These cases require the highest level of security review. USCIS’s Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate conducts enhanced reviews of Syrian refugee cases that require more manpower than the typical refugee case. They employ surveillance to check any factually verifiable claim that the refugee makes during the process. This leads to higher rejection rates, which also makes these cases much more difficult to process.   
  
**7) Hostile political climate** : Maybe this goes without saying, but it has taken political determination to effectuate a 21 percent increase in the number of refugees in the face of congressional opposition and, at times, even public opposition. In 1980, Congress entrusted the president with the responsibility, after hearings with Congress, to raise the refugee goal precisely in order to insulate the decision-making from such political whims. The fact that the president has exercised the authority deserves credit.   




This achievement, however, should be seen in context: 85,000 refugees is 0.13 percent of the total number of forcibly displaced persons around the world this year who have fled their homes to escape violence and persecution. The president’s current goal for FY 2017 is 100,000, which is still lower than the share of refugees worldwide that the country has taken historically. I have argued that this number could be increased through exempting refugees from the normal immigration quotas and admitting refugees with private sponsors, neither of which would require more money from Congress.

As more Australian states succumb to the lobbying of euthanasia advocates, objections are continually hand-waved away by sneering elites. As always happens with these social justice fads, not only is contrary evidence ignored, advocates insist that there is absolutely no slippery slope.



Then this happens…



A 74-year-old Dutch woman with dementia was euthanized by a doctor who drugged the patient’s coffee without her knowledge and then had family members physically restrain her for the final lethal injection.



At the same time, Swedish scientists are urging [cannibalism as a solution to climate change](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/newsweek-a-swedish-scientist-and-the-cannibalism-apologists). We are officially living in a science-fiction dystopia: _Logan’s Run_ , meet _Soylent Green_.



The Netherlands is the poster-child for the creeping death-cult of “assisted dying”. Their “safeguards” have been steadily eroded to the point that children, depressed teenagers (a tautology?), are being put down like so many unwanted kittens. Now they’re holding down grandma and shooting poison into her veins.



 **All absolutely legally.**



The doctor, who has not been publicly named, was cleared of all wrongdoing by a court in the Netherlands on Wednesday, “clarifying” the country’s euthanasia law enacted in 2002 […]Patients with dementia can now be killed by their doctors even if they strongly object to euthanasia at the time, so long as they have previously given consent for the fatal procedure. In other words, if a patient were to change their mind about the assisted suicide, a doctor could still legally kill them against their will.



Now, it might fairly be argued that people with dementia can express a will to die while they’re still “of sound mind”, and be unable to do so as their disease progresses. Chillingly, though, that’s not at all what happened here.



In the case of this specific Dutch woman with dementia, she never once gave an express request to be euthanized. In her will, which was renewed about a year before her death, the woman said she would like to be euthanized “whenever I think the time is right.” And when she was asked if she wanted to be euthanized, she reiterated multiple times that her suffering was not bad enough to where she wanted to be killed:



“The 74-year-old woman had renewed her living will about a year before she died, writing that she wanted to be euthanized ‘whenever I think the time is right.’ Later, the patient said several times in response to being asked if she wanted to die: ‘But not just now, it’s not so bad yet!’ according to a report from the Dutch regional euthanasia review committee.”



She was killed, anyway.



Like the Dutch state, the doctor has something of a track record.



“A panel had previously cleared the doctor of ethical violations by saying she ‘acted in good faith,'” but that decision was overturned by the Regional Euthanasia Review Committees. On Wednesday, the doctor was again cleared of wrongdoing.



  
The Netherlands is fast becoming a killing factory for unwanted humans. In 2017, 15 human beings a day were legally killed by doctors. Psychiatrists are rushing to catch up, too. Just 12 mentally ill patients were killed in 2012. Two years later, the number was 43. By 2017, that had nearly doubled again, to 83.

What Stuff is doing is classic gas lighting. **Implying that people are mentally ill for disagreeing** with them. Unpleasant narcissistic behaviour. They are a disgrace as a Newspaper.



After reading SonovaMin and [Phil View’s ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/general-debate-76/#comment-4645065758)comments yesterday in General debate I just had to check out the offending _Stuff_ article for myself. **Just how bad was it?**



I was amused to see Stuff’s choice of photo to depict us **“Climate deniers.”** Apparently questioning man-made climate change means that we are ignoring the scientific consensus. (You know, the one that doesn’t actually exist – but I digress).



People are more likely t **o deny climate change** if they’re inclined toward hierarchy, have lower levels of education or are more religious. But the strongest predictor of denial is a person’s politics. 



In this opening salvo, they are attacking a straw man. So-called “Climate deniers” **do not deny that the climate changes.** They believe that Climate change is a completely normal and natural phenomenon. What they question is mankind’s ability to influence or change it in any meaningful way.



So the premise of their argument is completely meaningless even before they insult us by claiming that we do as we are told (hierarchy), are stupid and believe in a sky fairy.



**Why do people still think climate change isn’t real?**



At its heart, climate change denial is **a conflict between facts and values.** People deny the climate crisis because, to them, it just feels wrong.



[…] It could be that the idea of climate change is **a threat to**[ **our worldview**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40984603) **.** Or it could be that we fear society’s response to climate change, the disruption created by the [transition to a low-emissions economy](https://www.bwb.co.nz/books/careful-revolution). Either way, climate change becomes such an “[inconvenient truth](https://grist.org/feature/an-inconvenient-truth-oral-history)” that, instead of living with and acting upon our worries, **we suppress the truth instead.**[ **** ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news)



The writer is actually describing their own belief system not ours. _Stuff_ has publicly stated that they refuse to publish any facts that do not match **their world view** and values. They believe that only facts that support their values/belief system should be allowed airtime. **All other facts are to be suppressed** because it **feels wrong** to publish facts that don’t fit their values. They are the ones with the closed mind and the religious fervour for pushing only one point of view. 



The writer then goes on quite disgracefully to suggest that “Climate Deniers” are mentally ill as they are “negating reality.”



[…] In Western societies, political affiliation is the key factor, with conservative voters more likely to discount climate change. Globally, a person’s commitment to [**democratic values**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2018.1512261) **** – or not in the case of deniers – is more significant. 



My goodness, the cognitive dissonance of this writer is huge! Which political affiliation believes in man-made climate change regardless of evidence to the contrary? That’s right, the belief in man-made climate change is left-wing doctrine. Conservatives are the ones that believe in freedom of speech for all and allowing all viewpoints to be heard and debated. **Conservatives therefore, are the ones most committed to democratic values.** They don’t want other viewpoints suppressed, they want them heard.



The article ends with the unproven claim that climate deniers are in the minority, as if that proves that they are wrong. The majority used to believe that the earth was flat but their believing that did not make it so. The **natural climate change deniers** should consider that for one minute – before they point the finger at those of us who see things differently to them.

"WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department on Monday evening urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. The administration’s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump’s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court. The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump’s order. The administration’s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump’s order  —   appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government’s case might not be successful. “At most,” the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to “previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future. ” That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States. On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. “Once we win the case, it will go right back into action,” he said. Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats “from radical Islamic terrorism is very real. ” “Courts must act fast!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation’s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the   rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump. The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p. m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be   on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual. The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. At issue is the earlier ruling, by Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, that blocked the key parts of Mr. Trump’s executive order. Judge Robart’s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred from entry to come to the United States, and it inspired a harsh attack from Mr. Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security. On Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Judge Robart’s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs, the States of Washington and Minnesota. The court declined, instead asking for more briefs. Opponents of Mr. Trump’s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad   policy, and that it is a threat to the nation’s economy. A brief from Washington and Minnesota, filed early Monday morning, said that “President Trump unleashed chaos by signing the executive order. ” Fifteen states and the District of Columbia  —   including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia  —   filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would “cause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents. ” In a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart’s order would cause irreparable harm to national security. In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering “some unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. ” “That makes no sense,” the brief said. “As this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties. ” On Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts “to take the extraordinary step of   a formal   judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority. ” In its earlier brief, the Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president’s motives, the administration’s brief said, would violate the separation of powers. The states responded that “courts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants’ true motives. ” They added that the administration had taken “a dizzying number of positions” on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order. Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states’ brief said, as the administration could again change positions. Several former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration making a second kind of argument. “We view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,” it said. “In our professional opinion, this order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds. ” The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C. I. A. under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have “a devastating humanitarian impact. ” “And apart from all of these concerns,” the former officials said, “the order offends our nation’s laws and values. ” The third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump’s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses. Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it “harms the competitiveness of U. S. companies. ” The “instability and uncertainty” created by the order, the brief said, “will make it far more difficult and expensive for U. S. companies to hire some of the world’s best talent  —   and impede them from competing in the global marketplace. ”"
"**We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code.**
The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media.
The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA.
Some of the newly created vaccines, including the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA.
""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University.
It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus.
The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein.
This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. We investigated a popular video spreading the theory back in May.
Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"".
It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.
Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use.
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose.
In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use.
Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe.
It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.
There is no vaccine ""microchip"" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"".
Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.
This led to one widely shared article headlined: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.""
The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.
However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.
The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic.
He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development.
Despite the lack of evidence, in May a YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.
We've seen claims that vaccines contains the lung tissue of a an aborted fetus. This is false.
""There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,"" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton.
One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab.
Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The technique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research.
Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine ""to exceptionally high standards"".
The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells ""are not themselves the cells of aborted babies"".
The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine.
But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine.
We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.
A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine.
To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct.
About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the University of Oxford.
So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.
However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"".
It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.
This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.
Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.
""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".

It is said that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold.



Let us hope that the American left’s recent publication of its “Green New Deal” (GND) won’t be contagious enough to infect Labour here.



Just over a week ago, Jeremy Corbyn had an in‐​depth phone conversation with Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez, the rising socialist congresswoman. The aim, it was said, was to “build a movement to take on the billionaires, polluters, and migrant baiters”.



US politics is generally considered to sit to the right of the UK landscape. But Ocasio-Cortez’s GND makes the 2017 Labour manifesto look like Thatcherism on steroids.





Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting.



Consider how radical Labour’s proposed policies seemed just two years’ ago. The party pledged rail, energy and water sector nationalisation, and to reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail.



It would have reintroduced or strengthened price controls, with an energy price cap, a £10 minimum wage by 2020, and private sector rent regulation. In energy, it would have banned fracking, but invested in nuclear and supported renewables to hit existing carbon emissions targets.



Now consider the GND, endorsed — unbelievably — by declared Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand. It would put the US on a national war footing to collectively achieve a net zero emissions society within one decade.



That requires gargantuan public investment to ensure that power demand is met 100 per cent by renewables within 10 years. The domestic transport system would be completely electrified, new high‐​speed rail built, flight availability curbed, and research programmes into sustainability and renewable technology funded.



Not content with this energy transformation to a near carbon‐​free utopia, the GND pledges a social transformation too. Vital in the fight against climate change, apparently, is free healthcare and higher education, a jobs guarantee for all who want to work, economic security for those who don’t, family leave, extra resources for pensioners, and a family living wage.



One could well think of the GND’s emissions‐​reducing veneer as a Trojan Horse for a progressive social policy wet dream.



The document is, for want of a better term, bonkers. But it is being treated as a serious proposal that must be assessed on its merits. The branding helps to insulate it from well‐​deserved criticism: if you’re opposed to the “Green New Deal”, then you want to kill the planet.



The truth though is that the GND goes far beyond reasonable carbon mitigation, completely denying the existence of trade‐​offs or the costs of programmes that it recommends.



While Labour’s 2017 election manifesto would be supremely damaging to the UK economy, at least there was some economic reasoning in justifying Corbyn’s ideas. With this radical new breed of Democrat, there is no acknowledgement that nationalising vast swathes of the economy could adversely affect growth by crowding out private activity. In fact, we are told the opposite, that it would make the economy stronger as well as greener.



Could such a programme ever gain traction here? One would hope not, but the lock on this radical worldview is currently being picked at by the British left.



Ocasio‐​Cortez and her cohorts are disciples of a new macroeconomic worldview called “Modern Monetary Theory” (MMT).



This postulates that governments with sovereign currencies face no financing constraints, and can spend as much as they like through new printed money. The only real constraint on spending levels is the capacity of the economy.



Even academic MMT‐​ers admit that if you pump in too much money when the economy is at full employment, inflation will rise, and will need to be choked off by higher taxes or spending cuts.



But political proponents of this kooky theory downplay this implication. In fact, they circumvent it, by claiming that, despite low unemployment, our economies are running significantly below their potential. This allows them to say that huge new spending could be financed by money printing without requiring higher taxes or resulting in rising inflation.



Labour hasn’t succumbed to the allure of this model just yet. But the mood is shifting. Last week, John McDonnell’s more mainstream fiscal rule — which would require a future Labour government to balance day‐​to‐​day spending over time — was sharply criticised by British leftists.



If Labour becomes starry‐​eyed about a GND‐​type agenda, there may well be a scramble to subscribe to a theory that promises to allow much more government spending without unpopular tax hikes.



For now, though, count your blessings. Unlike Ocasio‐​Cortez, Labour is not invoking climate change as the new Hitler to be defeated, nor promising to print money for social policy on a hunch that the economy is below capacity.



While reading the Democrats’ Green New Deal, an alien emotion swept over me. For once, I was grateful for Corbyn and McDonnell’s relative moderation.

"**With the UK granting approval to a Covid-19 vaccine that is currently being reviewed in the US, 330 million Americans are left wondering when they will be able to get the potentially life-saving jab.**
There are two vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer, that are both seeking emergency approval in the US. Pfizer's treatment was approved for the British public on Wednesday.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to meet on 10 December to discuss approval for the UK-approved vaccine, which was created through a partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech. They will meet again on 17 December to discuss Moderna's request.
On Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence told US governors in a conference call that rollout of the vaccine could begin ""as soon as the week of December 14"".
It comes as coronavirus cases continue to balloon across the US, with an average of over 150,000 new cases reported per day. The US has recorded a total of 13.6 million cases and some 270,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
On Wednesday, the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine, meaning that mass injections could start next week.
The elderly, as well as medical workers, will be given top priority, following by those with medical issues, then by age.
The UK's approval is expected to place extra pressure on FDA regulators to swiftly approve the vaccine - the CNN's chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, said it was encouraging that there were no red flags in the UK over the vaccine's safety. American regulators will examine the same data.
The CDC's Covid-incident manager, Dr Henry Walke, said on Wednesday that they had seen the news, and ""we are still evaluating that approval in the UK"".
""The US has a process in place for approval and we are continuing that process,"" he added.
The British experience in distribution can also help guide US authorities.
This vaccine must be stored at around -70C (-94 F) and will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) agree that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes.
But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups.
The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Will postal workers and meat-processing factory workers be included, for example?
Moncef Slaoui,Â who leads the federal government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine distribution programme, said he does not ""expect the states to make uniform decisions"".
""Some may prefer long-term care facilities or the elderly, while others may prioritise their health care workers. It would be wrong to immunise 18-year-olds first. I hope no one does that. But otherwise it's shades of grey.""
Officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021.
There are also ongoing concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. A recent Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans say they would be willing to get the jab, up from a low of 50% in September.
It also remains to be seen how racial minorities - who are at a higher risk of catching the virus and dying from it - will be prioritised.
Last month, New York's governor decried the federal government's immunisation plan as ""discriminatory,"" saying that distribution infrastructure such as pharmacies and hospitals are less prevalent in black and Latino communities.
None of the vaccines currently under review have been tested on pregnant or nursing women, meaning they will be unlikely to be advised by the government to be vaccinated.
8 Dec - White House summit with vaccine firms
10 Dec - FDA could approve Pfizer
14 Dec - rollout of Pfizer vaccine could begin this week
17 Dec - FDA could approve Moderna
President Trump will host the ""Covid-19 Vaccine Summit"" at the White House on 8 December.
The event is expected to bring together vaccine manufacturers, drug distributors and government officials and is being seen by experts as an opportunity for the White House to apply pressure on all involved to swiftly make vaccines available in the US.
On Monday, Vice-President Mike Pence told US governors in a conference call that rollout of the vaccine could begin ""as soon as the week of December 14"".
Some 40 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be available by the end of December.
On Monday, Kentucky's governor said the state's first vaccine shipment would mostly go to the elderly, with a smaller amount being given to hospital workers.
Colorado has said they would prioritise ski industry workers living in shared housing. Other states may choose to prioritise meat industry workers, who have been hit hard by the virus.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said priority will be given to the state's 2.4 million healthcare workers, who are being divided into smaller sub-groups in case of early shortages.
""Mass vaccination is unlikely to occur anytime soon,"" he said. California has already appointed some 65 different labour and advocacy organisations to help ensure an equitable distribution of the vaccine.
In July, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced a $1.95bn (Â£1.45bn) deal to secure 100 million vaccine doses from Pfizer. The agreement also allows the US government to purchase an additional 500 million doses.
Moderna received nearly $1bn from the US government for coronavirus research. They are set to receive an additional $1.5bn for 100 million doses, according to a deal signed in August.
Billions of dollars have also been promised to other drug companies in the event that they are able to bring additional vaccines to market.
The CDC says that vaccines purchased with taxpayer money will free, but providers may still charge for administering the jab. That fee may be reimbursed by health insurance companies or the Medicaid and Medicare programmes - social safety nets for low income and elderly Americans.
States are also racing to acquire ultra-cold refrigerators that are capable of storing the Pfizer vaccine, which much be kept at temperatures of -70C.
Each refrigerator costs tens of thousands of dollars, and have been harder to find in recent days as hospitals race to purchase them."

Jung is quoted and featured regularly by Germany’s mainstream media.
This summer Germany and much of Central Europe have seen a spate of severe thunderstorm activity, and as a result many are asking if this might not be an ominous sign of global climate change.
Again Dominik Jung reminds us that the recent weather is nothing new, and even implies that the prognoses made by “climate experts” seem to change as quickly as the weather itself (translated with permission):
Weather: Storms in Germany: Is that the climate change?

Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 30 July 2014 – Storms in the summer are nothing unusual. The same is so with variable weather during Central European summers. This is entirely typical.
In 2003 scientists announced droughts for summers
There is also no data confirming that the number of storms has increased over the past years. However we have been able to determine that the single storms have become a little more severe with regards to their strength.
That there have been storms so often this July is pure coincidence. July 2013 was the exact opposite; it was too dry and rarely were there thunderstorms. Now after having seen the thunderstorms of the past few days, we are already once again hearing the first climate prognoses announcing that extreme downpours will continue to rise over the next years.
That’s weird: After the driest and hottest summer of all time in 2003, the climate experts all assumed summers would become drier and drier – the talk was even about drought.
Slowly we have to start asking ourselves what follows what: The climate follows the prognoses, or the prognoses the climate? The current stormy weather appears to be a welcome opportunity for some climate experts to shift the focus back to climate change – with the aim of acquiring more research money.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCO2 or Ocean Cycles?
By Ed Caryl
We are all aware (or should be) of the warming that took place from the 1970’s to the 1990’s. The calamitologists are firmly convinced that this rise in temperature was due to rising CO2 in the same period. The lukewarmists think it was a combination of factors that perhaps contain some warming due to CO2. Then there is another group who think it was all due to the sun or ocean cycles.
This article will compare an ocean cycle, the Atlantic Multi-decadel Oscillation (AMO), and CO2 as temperature drivers over the last 133 years, since 1880. The annual temperature data is from GISS. The plots are scatter diagrams with temperature on the vertical axis and AMO index or CO2 atmospheric concentration on the horizontal axis.

Figures 1a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (1a) and temperature vs. CO2 (1b).
The period of 1880 to 1910 was a period of cooling. Unless CO2 was driving that cooling, it seems clear that ocean cycles (or some third forcing, such as solar) were responsible.

Figures 2a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (2a) and temperature vs. CO2 (2b).
The period from 1911 to 1936 was one of warming, on a similar scale to the recent warming. The amount of CO2 increase has been thought not to be responsible for the warming, and attributed to ocean cycles. Climate sensitivity is easy to calculate from the slope of the trend lines in the temperature versus CO2 plots. Simply multiply the “x” value by the minimum CO2 concentration. If the warming in this period was totally due to CO2, the associated climate sensitivity would be 8.3°C for CO2 doubling from 300 ppm, a value that all will agree is much too large. Again, CO2 isn’t providing the warming.

Figures 3a is a plot of temperature vs AMO and 3b a polot of temperature vs CO2.

Figure 3c below is a zoom in on 1937 to 1950, the near vertical line at the left in figure 3b where CO2 actually reversed slightly for a time:

This was a period of cooling, and it is obvious that CO2 had nothing to do with it. Climate sensitivity would have been a negative 0.465°C for CO2 doubling from 310 ppm. During the cooling 1937 to 1950 period, sensitivity would have to have been an astounding negative 82°C for CO2 doubling. Again, ocean cycles or some other forcing were responsible.

Figures 4a and b are XY plots of temperature vs AMO (4a) and temperature vs. CO2 (4b).
The years from 1970 to 2000 were warming years as can be seen on both plots. Note the R2 values for both plots. Was the warming due to CO2? Or was it ocean cycles? The R2 values are voting for ocean cycles, but it isn’t definitive. Remember that Salby and myself have made cases for temperature driving CO2, and not the other way around. The slope of the CO2 trend in this period (climate sensitivity) is 3.64°C for CO2 doubling. This is the only time period where the putative climate sensitivity is reasonable, and close to the theoretical IPCC approved number.

Figures 5a and b are XY plots of temperature vs. AMO (5a) and temperature vs. CO2 (5b).
Above is the recent past; the pause period. Not much is happening. The warming is so slight, that the computed climate sensitivity is 0.33°C for CO2 doubling from 370 ppm. The R2 value for CO2 is so low that it should be clear that something else besides CO2 is in charge. The slope on this AMO plot is positive, as it has been for all of the AMO vs temperature plots, but the points are clustered tightly and the R2 value is only 0.19.
In the 133 years since 1880, all the “CO2 is causing catastrophe” furor is based on one 30 year period in that long span. The remaining 103 years, where CO2 was obviously having no effect, are ignored, …are unexplained. Is this justified? Shouldn’t some effort be made to determine what has really happened? If CO2 is the driver of warming periods, and ocean cycles are driving cooling periods, then climate sensitivity was 8.3°C in the early 20th Century, 3.64°C in the late 20th Century, and 0.33°C now. If CO2 is assumed responsible for half the warming, as the IPCC suggests, and other greenhouse gases are responsible for the rest, the numbers then are: 4.15°C for the early 20th Century, 1.82°C for the late 20th Century, and 0.165°C for the last decade. This may be another indication that climate sensitivity has hit a low limit.
The numbers for CO2 become even lower if changes in solar radiation, solar magnetic effects, cosmic rays, aerosols, volcanic sulfate, soot, dust, water vapor, and changing cloud cover are thrown into the forcing mix. The problem is lack of data. We have good data from satellites only for the last 34 years for temperature, and less than that for many of these other factors. On this paucity of data we are betting our economic future on all kinds of ill-thought out “renewable solutions” that in the long run we will regret.

"**Teachers, pupils and parents are waiting to find out if next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams are going to be held next May.**
The Scottish government has already cancelled National 5s, the more junior exams, and originally said it planned to hold Highers in as normal a way as possible.
However, the government has now said it is looking at the issue of disruption to education around self-isolation periods for Covid-19 and some key meetings are taking place this week that could help ministers make their decision.
John Swinney announced the cancellation of the National 5s in October.
The education secretary made a statement to parliament in which he said holding a full exam diet in 2021 was ""too big a risk"" due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
National 5s will now be decided by ""teacher judgement supported by assessment"". Schools are still waiting for the full guidance on how to carry this out.
The Scottish Qualifications Authority said plans were currently continuing in preparation for Higher and Advanced Higher exams starting on 10 May 2021.
A spokesman added: ""A clear contingency plan is being developed as part of the work being undertaken by the National Qualifications Group 2021, including key checkpoints up to the February break to assess public health advice and its impact on the plans for exams.""
The education secretary said he would make a final decision on what was happening with Highers and Advanced Highers by the February break and a ""contingency plan"" was in place should they need to be called off, which would see the grades awarded on teacher judgement.
As the BBC has been reporting, Covid-19 has meant tens of thousands of pupils have had to isolate at home since schools returned full time in August and particularly since they came back after the October break. The year groups most affected by these absences tend to be S3-S5.
The worst hit areas are in the central belt, where we have heard from several students who have had multiple periods of isolation through being identified as a contact of someone with Covid-19.
Scotland's exams were cancelled in 2020 - for the first time in history - due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Results were initially decided using teacher estimated grades which the Scottish Qualifications Authority then moderated based on different schools' past performances.
There was an outcry and protests were held when it emerged that 125,000 of those teacher estimates were downgraded, with claims the system was unfair to children at schools with worse records in exams.
The Scottish government then agreed to accept just the teacher estimates. It also commissioned a review into the issue.
Prof Mark Priestly's report subsequently recommended cancelling the final exams for National 5s next year.
Wales has cancelled all GCSE and A-level exams in 2021. Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for pupils due to the Covid pandemic. Grades will be decided using classroom assessments.
In England, A-levels and GCSEs are due to go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week.
Northern Ireland is planning to hold all exams in 2021, with its education minister, Peter Weir, saying they represented the ""fairest way of judging students"".
This week, John Swinney told MSPs at Holyrood that he appreciated ""the necessity for early decision making"".
He said the evidence suggested that about 75% of S4-S6 pupils ""have experienced no disruption to their learning in sense of having to self-isolate"".
He added: ""I am very acutely focused on the issue of equityâ¦it's material to my decision making around the Highers and Advanced Highers.
""I have to be satisfied that every young person, no matter their experience of Covid, is able to have the full opportunities for learning and teaching and therefore position themselves to be in the best place to be able to perform in any exam diet in the spring.""
The Scottish government's education recovery group, made up of education bodies, teaching unions, college and university representatives, will meet on Wednesday and is expected to discuss exams.
On Friday, there is a planned meeting of the qualifications contingency group, which the government's website states is ""invoked in circumstances where there is a system-wide risk to the delivery of the exam diet and the awarding of qualifications."" It last met on 5 October.
Neither of these groups are decision-making bodies. They are used to gather information and opinions across education. Ultimately the decision on Highers will be made by Mr Swinney and it is likely that he will inform parliament first if a decision is reached.
It would be very difficult politically for the government to cancel exams five months in advance - the amount of disruption nationally to schooling is broadly in line with the amount that could have been anticipated.
However, there is the very real question of fairness to candidates whose courses have been disrupted.
Would changing the format of exams to allow a greater choice of questions be sufficient? An appeals system could be used to support candidates who had to self-isolate or any candidates who lost out because their teachers had to stay off work.
Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, is calling for a decision to be made sooner rather than later.
General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Given the growing inequities in teaching time and the ongoing threat to an exam diet, the EIS believes it is prudent to make an early decision to switch to an alternative assessment model, although there are clear workload implications which would require to be addressed."""
"**The government hopes to start distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine imminently.**
However, the vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work?
In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan.
The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium.
It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given.
Pfizer has developed a special transport box the size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened.
Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose.
The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times.
His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice.
The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has said it is committed to meeting demand.
The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time.
In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details.
As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it.
Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators.
The situation in developing countries is even more tenuous.
Burkina Faso, in central Africa, reported last month that it was already short of about 1,000 clinical fridges.
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with UN children's agency Unicef, has an ongoing project mapping cold storage facilities in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Unicef wants to have 65,000 solar-powered cold fridges installed in low-income countries by the end of 2021."

Guest Post by Steve Goreham
Originally published in The Washington Times.
Last week I received a “Home Energy Report” flyer from Commonwealth Edison, my electricity provider in northern Illinois. The leaflet compared my energy usage to neighbors over the last two months and declared, “You used 41% MORE electricity than your efficient neighbors.” Should I be concerned about this?
My wife and I use energy, but don’t waste it. For years I’ve driven my family batty, turning off lights in vacated rooms. During the summer, my wife dries laundry in the sunshine, rather than in the dryer. We also have many of the compact fluorescent bulbs. We take these measures to lower our energy bills, not for other motives.
Isn’t it odd that ComEd, a company in the energy business, is encouraging their customers not to use it? Imagine a mailer from Coca-Cola pointing out that you drank 41% MORE soft drinks than your neighbor. Or a letter sent from Apple telling you that you needed to reduce your iPhone and iPad purchases.

A visit to the ComEd website provides some answers. First, the company is required to use part of customer payments to urge Illinois customers to reduce electricity consumption by the Illinois Public Act 95-0481. But second, the website is filled with ideological nonsense. In the Saving Energy section of the website, we find a yellow “Power Bandit” and the statement, “Saving Energy was never so much fun! Beat the Power Bandit and learn lots of ways to save energy, save money and help save the planet!” Does ComEd really believe that we can save the planet by changing light bulbs?
For decades, environmental groups have waged war on energy. They warn that increased energy usage will pollute the Earth, destroy the climate, and rapidly exhaust natural resources. They demand substitution of dilute, intermittent, and expensive wind, solar, and biofuel energy for traditional hydrocarbon or nuclear power, which is an excellent way to reduce energy usage. They tell us that nations which use the most energy do the most environmental damage.
National and state governments have swallowed the “energy usage is bad” ideology hook, line, and sinker. Twenty-nine states have enacted Renewable Portfolio Standards laws, requiring utilities to use an increasing percentage of renewable energy or be fined. Hundreds of federal and state policies subsidize and mandate renewable or reduced energy usage, including light bulb bans, vehicle mileage mandates, wind and solar subsidies, ethanol fuel mandates, and energy efficiency programs. These policies collect additional taxes from citizens and boost the cost of electricity.
But, actual trends and empirical data show that our planet is not in imminent danger. Air and water pollution in the United States is at a fifty-year low. According to Environmental Protection Agency data, airborne levels of six major pollutants declined 57 percent from 1980 to 2009 even though energy usage was up 21 percent and vehicle miles traveled were up 93 percent. International data shows that pollution is lowest in high-income nations that use high levels of energy, such as Canada and Sweden, but highest in developing nations, such as India and Indonesia. The best way reduce pollution in developing nations is to increase per capita incomes, not to restrict energy usage.
Similarly, there is no empirical evidence to show that mankind is destroying Earth’s climate. Mankind’s comparatively tiny emissions of carbon dioxide, a trace gas in our atmosphere, cause only an insignificant part of the greenhouse effect. Global surface temperatures have been flat for more than ten years despite rising atmospheric CO2. Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies report warmer temperatures 1,000 years ago than temperatures of today. A review of history shows that today’s storms, droughts, and floods are neither more frequent nor more severe than past events.
Nor are we rapidly exhausting Earth’s energy resources. We’re at the dawn of a hydrocarbon revolution, triggered by the new techniques of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Mankind now has access to centuries of petroleum and natural gas from shale fields, which can be accessed with cost-effective and environmentally-safe methods.
Yet, the “energy is bad” ideology continues. Grade school students are taught that renewable energy is good and that hydrocarbon energy is bad. The EPA is waging a war on the U.S. coal industry. Demonstrators urge President Obama to stop the Keystone pipeline. And utilities tell us how we can “save the planet.”
By the way, reports state that the 20-room Tennessee house of former Vice President Al Gore devours more than 20 times the national average electricity usage. I wonder what rating Mr. Gore would get in a ComEd “Home Energy Report?”

"**A nurse in Oregon has been placed on administrative leave after claiming she does not follow pandemic restrictions outside of her job.**
In a TikTok video which appeared to be filmed in her hospital, the nurse said she does not wear a mask away from work and lets her children have play dates.
It caused a stir on social media, with many calling for her firing.
Her employer, Salem Health, said she was under investigation and condemned her behaviour.
Reacting to the video, posted on 27 November, the hospital said the nurse had ""displayed cavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic"".
In a statement released on Facebook, it added: ""We want to thank those of you who brought this to our attention and assure you that we are taking this very seriously. We also want to assure you that this one careless statement does not reflect the position of Salem Health or the hardworking and dedicated caregivers who work here.""
Initially identified in news reports only by her TikTok handle, she has since been named by hospital officials as Ashley Grames, who works in the oncology department at Salem Health.
Ms Grames has deleted the video, her TikTok profile and her Facebook account.
In the video, she is seen wearing hospital scrubs and a stethoscope around her neck, standing in what appears to be her workplace break room.
She lip-syncs to a scene from the movie How the Grinch Stole Christmas, in which the Grinch reveals his true identity.
A caption overlaid on her video reads: ""When my co-workers find out I still travel, don't wear a mask when I'm out and let my kids have play dates.""
The video sparked a swift backlash, prompting Ms Grames to take down the post, but a re-shared version of the original video with comment from another user - known as a ""duet"" on the platform - has amassed over one million views.
Hundreds of people took to the hospital's Facebook page to report the employee.
Hospital officials said the investigation into her conduct was aimed at protecting staff members and patients she may have come into contact with.
In addition, Oregon has experienced a surge of the virus over the past few weeks, setting records in daily caseloads and hospital admissions.
Several public figures have been castigated in recent weeks for their failure to observe pandemic restrictions. This week, British popstar Rita Ora apologised after she broke Covid rules in London to celebrate her birthday."

I fight to preserve tax competition, fiscal sovereignty, and financial privacy for the simple reason that politicians are less likely to impose destructive tax policy if they know that labor and capital can escape to jurisdictions with more responsible fiscal climates.   
  
My opponents in this battle are high-tax governments, statist international bureaucracies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and left-wing pressure groups, all of which want to impose some sort of global tax cartel---sort of an ""OPEC for politicians.""   
  
In my years of fighting this battle, I've has some strange experiences, most notably in 2008 when the OECD threatened to have me thrown in a Mexican jail for the supposed crime of standing in a public area of a hotel and advising representatives of low-tax jurisdictions on how best to resist fiscal imperialism.   
  
A few other bizarre episodes occurred in Barbados, back when I was first getting involved in the issue. Here's a summary of that adventure. 



As part of its ""harmful tax competition"" project, the OECD had called a meeting in 2001 and invited officials from the so-called tax havens to attend in hopes of getting them to surrender their fiscal sovereignty and agree to become deputy tax collectors for uncompetitive welfare states.



Realizing that the small, relatively powerless low-tax nations and territories would be out-gunned and out-manned in such a setting, I organized a delegation of liberty-minded Americans to travel to Barbados and help fight back (as regular readers know, I'm willing to make big sacrifices and go to the Caribbean when it's winter in Washington).



One of the low-tax nations asked me to provide technical assistance, so they made me part of their delegation. But when I got to the OECD conference, the bureaucrats refused to let me participate. That initial obstacle was overcome, though, when representatives from the low-tax country arrived and they created a stink.



So I got my credentials and went into the conference. But this obviously caused some consternation. Bureaucrats from the OECD and representatives from the Clinton Treasury Department (this was before Bush's inauguration) began whispering to each other, followed by some OECD flunky coming over to demand my credentials. I showed my badge, which temporarily stymied the bad guys.



But then a break was called and the OECD announced that the conference couldn't continue if I was in the room. The fact that the OECD and some of the high-tax nations had technical consultants of their own was immaterial. The conference was supposed to be rigged to generate a certain outcome, and my presence was viewed as a threat.



Given the way things were going, with the OECD on the defensive and low-tax jurisdictions unwilling to capitulate, we decided to let the bureaucrats have a symbolic victory---especially since all that really happened is that I sat outside the conference room and representatives from the low-tax jurisdictions would come out every few minutes and brief me on what was happening. And everything ended well, with the high-tax nations failing in their goal of getting low-tax jurisdictions to surrender by signing ""commitment letters"" drafted by the OECD.



While the controversy over my participation in the meeting was indicative of the OECD's unethical and biased behavior, the weirdest part of the Barbados trip occurred at the post-conference reception at the prime minister's residence.



I was feeling rather happy about the OECD's failure, so I was enjoying the evening. But not everybody was pleased with the outcome. One of the Clinton Treasury Department officials came up and basically accused me of being disloyal to the United States because I opposed the administration's policy while on foreign soil.



As you can probably imagine, that was not an effective argument. As this t-shirt indicates, my patriotism is to the ideals of the Founding Fathers, not to the statist actions of the U.S. government. And I also thought it was rather silly for the Treasury Department bureaucrat to make that argument when there was only a week or so left before Clinton was leaving office.



I'm reminded of this bit of personal history because of some recent developments in the area of international taxation.   
  
The federal government recently declared that a Swiss bank is a ""fugitive"" because it refuses to acquiesce to American tax law and instead is obeying Switzerland's admirable human rights policy of protecting financial privacy. Here are some details from a report by Reuters. 



Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss private bank, was declared a fugitive after failing to show up in a U.S. court to answer a criminal charge that it conspired to help wealthy Americans evade taxes. ...The indictment of Wegelin, which was founded in 1741, was the first in which the United States accused a foreign bank, rather than individuals, of helping Americans commit tax fraud. ...Wegelin issued a statement from Switzerland saying it has not been served with a criminal summons and therefore was not required to appear in court. ""The circumstances create a clear dilemma for Wegelin & Co,"" it said. ""If it were to adhere to current U.S. legal practice aimed at Swiss banks, it would have to breach Swiss law."" ...Wegelin has no branches outside Switzerland.



It's time for me to again be unpatriotic because I'm on the side of the ""fugitive."" To be blunt, a Swiss bank operating on Swiss soil has no obligation to enforce bad U.S. tax law.   
  
To understand the principles at stake, let's turn the tables. What if the Iranian government demanded that the American government extradite Iranian exiles who write articles critical of that country's leadership? Would the Justice Department agree that the Iranian government had the right to persecute and prosecute people who didn't break U.S. law? Of course not (at least I hope not!).   
  
Or what if the Chinese government requested the extradition of Tiananmen Square protesters who fled to the United States? Again, I would hope the federal government would say to go jump in a lake because it's not a crime in America to believe in free speech.   
  
I could provide dozens of additional examples, but I assume you get the point. Nations only cooperate with each other when they share the same laws (and the same values, including due process legal protections).   
  
This is why Wegelin is not cooperating with the United States government, and this is why genuine patriots who believe in the rule of law should be on the side of the ""fugitive.""   
  
For further information, here's a video I narrated on tax competition.   




The moral of the story is that ""tough on crime"" is the right approach, but only when laws are just. At the risk of stating the obvious, the Internal Revenue Code does not meet that test\---especially when the IRS is trying to enforce it in a grossly improper extraterritorial fashion.

Radio host and psychologist Kyle MacDonald [opines](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12273354) in a paper that the reason Greta Thunberg is given a hard time is because Greta is a girl.



Bad things happen when we don’t listen to children. It wasn’t that long ago we sent them up chimneys, and worked them to death in work houses. In some parts of the world they still do.



Much of my working life I’ve sat and listened to people explore and understand the impact that various experiences in their childhood had on them. Of not being listened to, of being treated with disdain, told to get over it, to stop crying. Experiences of being beaten, abused and neglected.



[…]Authority over women and children is of course one of the corner stones of much that is wrong with traditional, right wing, conservative orthodoxy. That somehow adult men are the only ones truly allowed a voice. That children should be seen and not heard.



[…]And it’s the same thinking that denies we are killing our planet.



Wait, what?



Turns out, people’s responses to Greta Thunberg provide a pretty clear litmus test of how much one still clings to the orthodoxy of misogyny.



Because she is both young, and a woman. She also – thankfully – refuses to be silenced.



Actually it’s because at 16 she knows nothing about history, economics or science, let alone the world’s climate and how it works.



So she stands defiant, and seems to show little disregard for the vitriolic rants that tell her to sit down and shut up. Instead, she carries on. She tells world leaders they’re not doing enough (because they’re not) and that it’s not up to her to be the beacon of hope: it’s up to them.



[…]It’s up to all of us to tolerate the guilt, the panic and anxiety and take action. As adults it’s our role to tolerate the feelings, and act to protect our rangitahi.



Not attack them, and leave them to flounder in their own distress. But so much of what unconsciously drives mysogyny, patriarchy and abuses of power over the vulnerable is an inability in the attacker to feel vulnerable. Instead that fear and inability to tolerate vulnerability it is projected out, and attacked in others: children of course being the very personification of vulnerability.



Hear that, [WH](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/wh/)? Stop attacking climate alarmists and denying your [vulnerability](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-12/)!



So if you feel affronted by Greta Thurnberg’s words, good. Deal with it. In her words:



“I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.”



I feel affronted. I feel affronted that a child with obvious psychological problems should be so used and exploited by others. Politics is a brutal game and climate change is deeply political. What is at stake is literally our way of life and capitalism itself. 



And if you believe that Greta Thunberg writes her own speeches I have a bridge to Venezuela to sell you.

In his history of **1970s leftist terrorism** , _Days of Rage_ , Bryan Burroughs writes that, “the most startling thing…is how thoroughly it has been forgotten”. **There were nearly 2000 bombings in the U.S. in 1972 alone.** This is not a history taught in schools or ever mentioned by a media too busy hunting down imaginary “racism” like OK signs.



Although global terrorist attacks have declined slightly in the past few years, they remain at record highs not seen in the last 40 years. Not that you’d know, from reading the legacy media. Any more than you’d have known, from police or social workers, about a decades-long campaign of sexual terror waged in Britain.



The following is just a sample of this week in jihad. Take note of how, when they can’t avoid reporting terrorism, the legacy media and authorities reflexively resort to spin.



A truck drove through a traffic light in Limburg in Hesse into several vehicles […]



Astonishing: a truck drove **itself**? Well, of course there was a driver. Just don’t ask the police to tell you why he did it.



The man was said to have hijacked the truck and deliberately rammed the cars […]“with the driver saying ‘Allah’ on several occasions”[…]



The police of Westhessen wrote on Twitter: “Please note: The suspect has been arrested, our investigations are underway – please hold back with guesswork, no one needs trolls or wild speculation.”



[Translation by Jihad Watch]



The usual spin is at work in this report, too.



A 54-year-old Manhattan man has pleaded guilty to assault as a hate crime for shoving and hurling homophobic slurs at a woman as she road [sic] a subway last year.



What? Just any old, random “Manhattan man”?



 **Allasheed Allah** […]started to argue with a 20-year-old woman […][who] had been with a friend who kissed her on the cheek. Allah, seeing the smooch, yelling out, “Kiss her again, you […]” and incorporated profanity. He followed the pair when they got off the train, then walked behind the victim and hit her once in the head and chest, shoving her into a nearby pole. 



Obviously a Methodist.



When Omar Mateen murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, he explicitly stated that his motive was revenge for U.S. operations against ISIS. His father also reported that the sight of gay men kissing enraged the young Muslim extremist. **The legacy media and activists chose to blame Republicans and the NRA instead.**



Police in France are similarly determined not to see the (literally) bleeding obvious.



The investigation is today continuing into the [stabbing] attack at the Préfecture de Police in Paris on Thursday that left four people dead and fifth critically injured before the attacker himself was shot dead…A police source told The Local that the suspect, who was deaf, **converted to Islam in recent months,** […]however there was **nothing to suggest he had become radicalised.**



Apart from, y’know, **the terrorist attack**. Or is it that Islamic terrorism isn’t “radicalised”?



The killer […]had tried to justify to a colleague the killings in January 2015 at the magazine Charlie Hebdo and had done the same for other radical Islamist killings.



[…]other potential clues — including a video the killer posted on Facebook that imitated throat-cutting — were missed by the police administration that surrounded him, at the heart of an organization dedicated to fighting terrorism […]The killer also had contacts with “several individuals suspected of being part of the Salafist movement,” Mr. Ricard said.



Nope, nothing to suggest radicalisation here, folks.



Meanwhile, Boko Haram is continuing [its campaign of murderous terrorism against Christians](https://www.christianpost.com/news/boko-haram-militants-execute-two-christian-aid-workers-release-video-footage.html) in Nigeria, and in Sweden, [one in four women now report being afraid to leave their homes](https://summit.news/2019/10/07/sweden-one-in-four-women-are-afraid-to-leave-their-homes/), as that country’s imported rape crisis continues.



And that’s the week in jihad. As you see, nothing to worry about. Go back to your climate strikes and ignore that bearded fellow shouting from the cab of that rental truck.

Some years ago, I watched a series called “ [Mataku](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?&keywords=mataku) “. The episodes enthralled and entertained me. They frightened me and I learnt NOT to watch them at night.



Much like Gremlins… never ever feed them at night. Yet I could not stop watching this magnificent series of Maori television whereby I was entertained and also learnt about Maori Culture at the same time.



One thing I learnt from watching Mataku was that if I was a “ foreigner “, I would think that that I was watching a horror movie. But, to me, as a Kiwi, I just accepted that this was part of who I was and where I was and what I was.



So many episodes reminded me of how deeply our cultural past is part of our present and our future. They tapped into our sense of self as a Nation: Maori and Pakeha.



Our deep-rooted and kindred spirit of SELF: We, as Kiwis, draw spiritual and WHOLEsomeself from the Land we call HOME.



We embrace others to join us on our voyage through life and do it in the Kiwi way.



Maori spirituality has always been expected and respected in our land. The Taniwha, the concepts of the fight between the North Island and the South Island; the hook, the fish, the legends… WE, as a Nation grew up on these wonderful and long-held TRADITIONS.



Why are we now changing our country and turning it into a foreign place? A place of global idealism and imported doctrines?



New Zealand is a young country in the scheme of things. A baby who was born a few seconds ago in terms of the planet time clock.



Our fledgeling country is still in nappies in the GLOBAL sense, so why are we being thrust forward on to the global stage as a world leader in the United Nations? When, in actual fact, we are a toddler and still finding our feet – historically.



My daughter is currently in Prague, attending a conference. A city that oozes history, culture and more culture (in the current definition of culture), than we can ever dream of – or, more importantly, catch up on.



We, as a Nation, will never and can never catch up on Europe or other Nations for historic culture.



Neither should we.



We are a small Nation, a new Nation and a proud Nation.



We can only compete in a NEW World.



Is this what Jacinda Ardern is trying to do? Propel New Zealand onto the world stage with speeches about climate change, diversity, love and kindness?



Well, I feel that New Zealand was not a Nation founded on love, climate change, kindness and sympathy.



We were founded on hard work, mud, respect, rain, cold.. reality.



Yes, Reality.



And part of our Reality was Mataku – Fear.



Fear of failure. Fear of death. Fear.



Right now, I FEAR.



For our Aotearoa, our New Zealand.



There is nothing worse than the death of a loved one.



In this case, it is the death of our Nation.



Mataku.

Greta Thunberg’s diatribe at the UN was religious fervour on steroids. Her dedication to warning that we are on the brink of annihilation, and governments are to blame for man-made climate change, is totally nuts, but even crazier is the adoration poured on this errant 16-year-old who is as far from a normal 16-year-old as you could get. 



“This week, [in April this year] she was named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time Magazine. She has briefly met the Pope, who encouraged her to “Keep doing what you’re doing.” She has received numerous awards, including, most recently, the German Golden Camera award. She has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.”



Well this is backwards. The Nobel _Peace_ Prize for encouraging rebellious children to skip school. But Greta Thunberg is a product of progressive parenting. After Greta’s appearance at the UN this week, Emily Brooke, writing for _Stuff_ , is sipping the same progressive parenting Koolaid.



“How would you feel if your teenager skipped school? Disagreed openly with her elders? Tried to persuade you to change your lifestyle? Led other children to copy her rebellious behaviour? 



**If my daughter was Greta Thunberg, I’d be proud as hell.”**



  
Brooke is nuts too, and before sending her own child over the cliff with the rest of the lemmings, she should think about the dysfunctional Thunberg family, which is a case study in how not to raise your kids. Brooke admits she already elevates her three-year-old daughter to parent status. 



**“The time for unquestioningly obeying your elders is done.**



 **We don’t need a generation of polite rule-keepers.** We need a generation of critical thinkers, of agitators, of dissidents. Young people who throw paint at the status quo and aren’t afraid to fight for what they believe in. We need a generation of activists, or we’re all doomed.”



Brooke has child raising completely backwards. Future generations are not doomed by a lack of activists, they are doomed by a lack of good parenting.



Kids should be allowed to be kids and taught to trust their parents with the decision making. Progressive parenting absolves the adult from parental responsibility including refusing to say “no” to their child and foisting on them life choices which they are ill-equipped to make. Little wonder the Thunberg children are self-destructing.



Greta’s mother, Marlena Ernman, in her 2018 book “Scenes From the Heart”, gives heartbreaking insights into her tragic family.



“We are offered a story of “a family in crisis and a planet in crisis”—two phenomena that are presented as inextricably linked. 



The book posits that oppression of women, minorities, and people with disabilities stem from the same overarching root problem as climate change: **an unsustainable way of life.**



 **The family’s private crisis and the global climate crisis, the authors argue, are simply symptoms of the same systemic disorder**.”



Their family life is certainly unsustainable because this is a family in crisis. The children are living through hell on earth simply because the parents refused to establish parental authority in the home as soon as the child started questioning it. 



“Greta is eleven years old and has gone two months without eating. Her heart rate and blood pressure show clear signs of starvation. She has stopped speaking to anyone but her parents and younger sister, Beata. 



**After years of depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks** , she finally receives a medical diagnosis: Asperger’s syndrome, high-functioning autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism—which explains why she sometimes can’t speak to anyone outside her closest family. When she wants to tell a climate researcher that she plans a school strike on behalf of the environment, she speaks through her father.” 



At eleven years old Greta was struggling with basic life skills and showing permanent physical effects of her poor choices, and her sister is exactly the same.



“Her sister Beata, who was 12 when the book was written, lives with ADHD, Asperger’s syndrome, and OCD. She is prone to sudden outbursts of anger, during which she screams obscenities at her mother.



What would normally be a 10-minute walk to dance class takes almost an hour because Beata insists on walking with her left foot in front, refuses to step on certain parts of the sidewalk, and **demands that her mother** walk the same way. 



She also **insists that her mother** wait outside during class—she isn’t allowed to move, even to go to the bathroom. The child still ends up weeping in her mother’s arms.” 



This mother is a progressive parent letting her errant children call the shots to the detriment of their long term health and well being.



“In Scenes from the Heart, when Greta eventually starts eating again, she only allows herself certain foods. 



**Her mother has to** prepare the same food every day for Greta to bring to school and keep in the school refrigerator: pancakes filled with rice. 



Greta will eat them only if there is no sticker with her name on the container: stickers, paper and newspapers trigger Greta’s OCD against eating.”



This crazy role reversal in child-raising exonerates the parents and destroys the kids. Sadly, it is a tragedy so easily avoided. 



Authority is confused with destructive authoritarianism when they are not the same thing at all. Traditional child raising clearly defines the role of the parent and the child and establishes boundaries that, far from hindering a child, enable learning and development in a safe environment. Which is something the Thunberg children desperately need.

"The   mogul Russell Simmons is teaming up with Universal Music Group to produce “The Scenario,” a musical set to three decades of  . The show, originally announced in 2015, is to premiere in New York during the   season before embarking on a   tour of “traditional and nontraditional venues,” according to the Universal Music Group. “I want everyone to see it,” Mr. Simmons said in a phone interview on Saturday. “I want kids in the ’hood in Detroit to see it. I want sophisticated theatergoers in New York to see it. And they’re going love it whether they’re 50 or 14. ” Mr. Simmons, 59, emphasized the intended   appeal of “The Scenario,” which he said would include songs from Universal’s catalog that cover rap’s ascension as a dominant   force. “The difference between Rakim and Kendrick Lamar is minimal,” Mr. Simmons said, referring to two   artists whose rises occurred nearly three decades apart. Tracks by Drake, Mr. Lamar, Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang are among those being strongly considered for the production, Mr. Simmons said. Universal owns Def Jam Recordings, which Mr. Simmons founded in 1984 with the producer Rick Rubin. The label, whose artists have included Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Kanye West, is credited with helping to bring   to the mainstream. Named for a song by A Tribe Called Quest, “The Scenario” will follow a few artists as they “struggle and evolve,” according to Mr. Simmons, and he said the production would more closely resemble a concert than a Broadway musical. The audience will have a sizable role, playing on a    tactic often used in  . “There’s a lot of technology that we’ll be using to connect the audience and the stage in a way that Broadway hasn’t done,” Mr. Simmons said. “The Scenario” will pair Mr. Simmons with Universal’s Scott Landis, Def Pictures’ Jake Stein and the “Rock of Ages” producers Scott Prisand and Jamie Bendell. The author and   historian Dan Charnas (“The Big Payback”) is writing the show’s book. “The Scenario” follows the breakout success of “Hamilton,” the   musical that set a record for the most money ever made in a single week by a Broadway show. On Saturday, Mr. Simmons said that he loved that show and was thrilled about its success, but he bristled at the idea that its popularity has been surprising given the omnipresence of   in American life. “There’s a lack of insight on the part of the gatekeepers and the producers of content,” he said. “I can go anywhere and hear  . I think ‘Hamilton’ does help them buy in, but it’s overdue. It’s long overdue, and I’m excited that I’m part of it. ”"

Winston is the longest survivor in the gladiatorial palace we call parliament, but the last week has shown that he is not invincible. Although clearly not done for yet, questions are now being asked about how much longer he is likely to survive, and also what will happen to NZ First when he does finally hang up his hat.



Peters has still not managed to build a party that would confidently survive without him, although Shane Jones remains the only potential successor who could come within cooee of getting there.



Monday marks two years since the last election, which gave New Zealand First the balance of power.



It has one more year to enhance its chances of survival and it seems likely to do that by targeting three groups: drawing farmer support away from National, blue collar and male support away from Labour and maintaining a reasonable level of the seniors’ vote from the baby boomers.



Peters has returned with a sharper focus on his party’s survival and growth.



In spite of him defending Labour’s handling of the sex scandal, Winston knows what damage such things can do. He will be well aware that Labour’s polling is falling, and might want to take the opportunity to rebuild his own numbers to benefit from it.



There have been many Labour MPs who have quietly applauded Peters piling into the issue this week, even though it can be seen as undue interference in another party’s business.



There are probably even more people in National’s wider support base whose views have not been reflected by deputy leader Paula Bennett, a confidant of the complainants, and who will also have been applauding Peters this week.



For the seniors, Peters has already signalled a SuperGold card enhancement next week while he is Acting Prime Minister.



That will please some of his voters, but I wonder if Winston has simply broken too many electoral promises for anyone to ever believe him again?



He has a more complex relationship with the rural sector. 



There is growing disquiet over the plans, first to get agriculture into the Emissions Trading Scheme; set methane reduction targets in the Zero Carbon Bill; and to improve freshwater standard five years faster than before and to a higher standard.  
The sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by hints from the Australian banks to slow down rural lending if greater capital requirement are imposed by the Reserve Bank. 



With capital gains tax, Winston showed that he can flex his muscles and call anything he wants. That is the beauty of being kingmaker. Exactly why he is allowing the onslaught against the rural sector to continue is beyond me.



National has not had to try hard to paint New Zealand First as part of the problem, not the solution. After all the proposals have come from the Coalition Government.



But blaming New Zealand First may be a harder position to maintain as each of the issues is settled – the first of which may come as early as next week when Peters is still acting Prime Minister.



Announcements are expected soon on how and when agriculture will join the emissions trading scheme.



Under the terms of New Zealand First’s coalition agreement with Labour, it would have to accept pollution charges on 5 per cent of agricultural emissions – and it could have been enacted this term.



The final outcome is likely to be less onerous – and more along the lines of the plan for a farm-based levy for methane and nitrous oxide emissions from 2025, proposed by the industry itself in the Primary Sector Climate Change Commitment. 



If he is to survive politically, Winston simply cannot send farmers entirely into the arms of National; it would be political suicide for him. But how exactly can he separate himself from a government with a strong Green arm that seems to want to do permanent damage to our primary industries? He put this government in place after all.



The Zero Carbon Bill is more trouble for the Green Party than any other party and it has got itself into a pickle over it by its failure to count.



Having worked with National from the early development of the bill, Green Party co-leader and Climate Change Minister James Shaw ditched the Nats at the behest of New Zealand First.



With New Zealand First now putting its foot down, National is again being sounded out for a compromise.



The bill proposes ridiculous targets to reduce biogenic methane by 24 to 47 per cent 2050 but it requires the support of either New Zealand First or National to get them through.  
It may keep the near-term target to lower biogenic methane by 10 per cent on 2017 levels by 2030.  
But Shaw will be forced to refine and lower the 2050 target to 24 per cent or, more likely, drop it altogether. 



It won’t get support from National, but Audrey Young is suggesting it won’t get support from NZ First either. 



If the 24 to 47 per cent target was put there to appease the Green Party’s constituency, it was dumb because it will have raised false expectations in its members who will end up being more disappointed.



  
Shane Jones was heralded as a champion of the regions and has plenty of money to splash around with no projects to spend it on. So far, NZ First has not exactly been a champion of the rural sector, but I expect that to change. Winston will either water down or completely destroy the Zero Carbon Bill because his own political future depends on it. While I feel only relief at the prospect, it may not be enough to save Winston. But one thing is for sure. He has absolutely no chance of making it back into parliament if the Zero Carbon Bill goes ahead. 



Watch this space.

A bag of charcoal briquettes is worth more than a ton of EU carbon right now.
UPDATE: it’s worse than we thought, see below.
Carbon has closed below $4 a ton in a new record low while Deutsche Bank bails
From Reuters:
Deutsche Bank quits carbon market: board member
31 Jan 2013 12:42 Last updated: 31 Jan 2013 15:04
LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters Point Carbon) – Deutsche Bank has shut its global carbon trading operations, a member of the investment bank’s board of directors said on Thursday.  Source: http://www.pointcarbon.com/news/1.2162216
In addition to the price dropping to below the price of a bag of charcoal briquettes, it may have something to do with this investigation: 
Deutsche Bank co-chief named in carbon tax investigation
Two board members at Deutsche Bank, including the lender’s co-chief executive, have been drawn into a police investigation into tax evasion related to the group’s carbon trading business.

Meanwhile, carbon closed yesterday at a new record low, losing about 8% of its value yesterday.

It looks like that by the close of trading today, EUA carbon will have lost about half its value since the peak in early January.
New Zealand’s experiment in carbon trading isn’t looking good either:
NZ carbon finds new record lows amid stable supply
31 Jan 2013 09:59
BEIJING, Jan 31 (Reuters Point Carbon) – Spot permits in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) fell 6.5 percent week-on-week to close Thursday at NZ$2.45 ($2.05), the lowest weekly closing price ever recorded as fresh supply continued to find its way to the market.

UPDATE: the market has closed today, with another record loss, for a nearly 50% drop in value in January 2013.

"Driving down a tight mountain road in Jarabacoa, a town in the middle of the Dominican Republic, Oscar Pedro Duran Abreu saw the oncoming Jeep weaving in the other lane before it hit him. He remembers trying to swerve. He remembers the Jeep slamming into his side door, pushing his car into the safety blocks on the side of the road, saving him from a steep fall down the mountainside. “And I don’t remember anything else,” he said of that day in September 2010. Mr. Duran learned later that the other driver had been drunk and that his Jeep had flipped. The four passengers in the Jeep were injured, but the driver, unharmed, pushed his way out of the vehicle and fled. “Leaving me for dead,” Mr. Duran said. Unconscious, Mr. Duran was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in a coma for 29 days. Six years later, seated at a table with his children, Jose and Karina Duran, and speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Duran leaned back in a chair at his son’s school and recalled emerging from the coma with his jaw wired shut. He looked around and thought, “What happened?” The accident left him with injuries to his neck, spinal cord and knee, as well as a broken jaw, extensive memory loss and nerve damage causing numbness in his face. The crash also knocked out eight teeth, which he has not been able to afford to replace. He spent the next 92 days on bed rest. Doctors placed metal plates in his neck and left knee, but he is still unable to bend the knee or kneel and has trouble walking. “Since the accident, my closest friend has been pain,” he said. The sixth of 11 children, Mr. Duran grew up on a farm in Jarabacoa, where his family grew yucca and sweet potatoes, among other crops, until he was 18. With only a   education, he left for Santo Domingo, the capital, working as a shoe shiner and a waiter, and held various jobs in a supermarket, a casino and a hospital. He later began a   career in the national police force, working as a homicide investigator in Jarabacoa until his accident. But his extensive injuries kept him from returning to the national police. Then, in 2012, the   relationship with the mother of his children fell apart. She took the children to live with her, but Mr. Duran eventually had them come live with him. To get them out of the Dominican Republic, his mother, a permanent resident of the United States who often stayed with her children in New York, referred him for a residential visa. He joined the family in New York in July 2013, fulfilling his mother’s wish to have all of her children together in the United States. She returned to the Dominican Republic after settling him in America, and died six months later. Unable to work because of his injuries, Mr. Duran struggled to find his way in a new country. He lived with siblings in Brooklyn for a year but was unable to contribute to the family’s income. So in spring 2014, he found himself homeless with his children in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. “It was cold,” Jose, now 12, recalled of the two nights they spent sleeping on a park bench. Mr. Duran added: “Life has kicked me down. But I have to go forward  —   for them. ” He smiled at his children, who sat quietly on each side of him. Mr. Duran found them a studio at a city shelter on East 178th Street in the Bronx. His request for two rooms  —   one for his daughter, 10, for privacy  —   was later granted. The family does not pay rent, but with Mr. Duran unable to work, it struggles to make ends meet. In March 2016, Mr. Duran briefly worked as a cabdriver. However, the car payments and maintenance, coupled with the pain from his knee injury, soon became too much, and he quit the service. Now the family receives $205 a month in food stamps. Jose, a seventh grader at C. S. 211, a bilingual magnet school in the Bronx, is working to become fluent in English. His sister is already fluent. The   program is run by the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In April,   program staff members noticed that Jose was wearing the same   clothes every day. The Children’s Aid Society provided the family with $375 in gift cards to Payless, Old Navy and Modell’s Sporting Goods to buy new school clothes and shoes for the children. Despite the family’s struggles, Mr. Duran said he did not let poverty bother him. He spoke reverently of his father, Pedro Lucia Duran, a forest ranger and village confidant, whom he called “a simple man, an honorable man. ” He added: “There’s no man like my father. He raised 11 children to be serious and honest, and he did it as a poor man. ” For that reason, he also does not seek out riches. “My father always said, ‘In America, the president eats lobster,’” he recalled with a laugh. “‘But in the Dominican Republic, the poor eat lobster. ’” Mr. Duran said he wanted only to raise his own children in the same manner as his father. While in the United States, he hopes his children can work toward their own dreams. Karina, a fifth grader, enjoys painting and drawing and would like to become a pop star, she said with a shy smile. Jose  —   who “really can draw,” according to his sister  —   is fascinated by space, but has no interest in becoming an astronaut. He wants to build the spaceships instead. “And my American dream?” Mr. Duran said. “My dream is that if I die today, my children will be able to do what they want and to remain humble and polite. ” As for Mr. Duran, 52, he worries that he is a burden on a social assistance system that, after a career in the Dominican Republic, he is unable to contribute to here. He would like to return to his country one day, he said, adding that he was happy there. But he fears that politics, drugs and guns have broken an otherwise beautiful nation. “America is the best there is,” he said. “I’m thankful to this country for taking me and my children in. But despite all these problems in my country, if I could, I’d still go back. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s becoming very clear that the real thrust behind the anthropogenic global warming movement is the systematic denial of cheap, efficient energy for the poor world so that they never attain a standard of living that developed countries have long been enjoying. Bill Nye confirms it in a debate with Marc Morano on FOX.

Image cropped from www.mrctv.org/videos.
In a FOX News debate here Bill Nye keeps repeating that the big problem today is that the planet is inhabited by more than 7 billion people. Yes it’s a grave problem that so many people are living, he would like us to think.
At the 9:30 mark he says the problem is that poor people “are using more energy than they ever used to use“. Yet Bill Nye has no qualms whatsoever about his comfortable and prosperous life, which is in large part due to the exploitation and amazing use of the energy he now says has to be denied to the poor.

Marc Morano’s shocked reaction is palpable: “Who is Bill Nye to tell them they cannot have more carbon-based energy?“.
If the global warming fraudsters ever got their way with energy policy, the chances are high we’d see a mass die-off and extremely violent uprising. People with nothing to lose usually react like they’ve got nothing to lose. Thankfully, the poor aren’t listening: India, China and many developing countries are building fossil fuel power plants faster than ever.
Even in rich Germany the government is scaling back on green energies because the population here is so angered over the high energy prices and the false promises made.
Moderator John Stossel at the end adds: “This idea that politicians can fix the climate strikes me as arrogant.”
It is. No one has that kind of power. Anyone claiming they do is either totally ignorant or just a plain fraudster.

"BOSTON  —   During a men’s hockey game between Boston University and Providence College in early December, Brittany Miller sat in the press box near center ice. She tracked statistics and typed notes in her laptop. Across the rink, Theresa Feaster kept a close eye on the game, logging video of the action. They could have been mistaken for reporters or merely diligent fans. But Miller and Feaster are much more than devoted followers of their beloved teams. They are    trailblazers. Last fall, Miller and Feaster became the first women to serve as   members of an N. C. A. A. Division I men’s hockey coaching staff when they were hired by their alma maters. But Miller, Boston University’s director of hockey operations, and Feaster, the coordinator of hockey operations at Providence College, say their gender rarely comes up in conversations with coaches or players. “I’m just on the staff and come to work every day and work hard,” Feaster said. “That’s all there is to it. It’s not really something that crosses my mind. ” Miller and Feaster had noticed each other during games when they both worked as student managers, first as undergraduates and then as graduate students. But they did not formally meet until a meeting of the Hockey East Association, the teams’ conference, after both had been hired full time. “It’s nice to have someone else who worked hard as a manager and proved herself to her coaching staff,” Miller said. “It shows that Hockey East is really moving forward in hiring females. ” Each has been around hockey for as long as she can remember, though they came to their new jobs from opposite directions. Miller grew up on the ice, learning to skate at age 3 and playing competitive hockey through her high school years at Boston Latin School. Feaster did not play, but she began learning the game while bouncing around the minors with her father, Jay, and gained a newfound interest when his job as general manager of the Calgary Flames led to a connection to Providence while she was studying there. Miller, who had followed her older brother into the game and was coached by her father, started working as a manager at B. U. during the first semester of her freshman year, attending all of the Terriers’ practices and games while still managing a full class load. She was finishing up her master’s degree and working as an intern for a sports marketing research company in London last summer when she received calls from Coach David Quinn and the athletic director, Drew Marrochello. The Terriers had an opening on their coaching staff, and both men thought Miller was the perfect candidate. Now she is in charge of all of the teams’ travel logistics, ensures players handle their academic work and helps track statistics. Miller said Quinn and the rest of the staff had treated her as an equal since she accepted the job in September. “They trust me to do a good job, and they know that I can do this job just as good if not better than any guy,” she said. Marrochello said he had known early on that Miller would be successful in any endeavor she chose. “I’m frankly glad it is in hockey, in college sports,” he said. “I know she’s got a high ceiling. ” While Miller’s love for hockey has burned since her youth, Feaster’s was more like rekindling an old flame. As a young child in the   Feaster was a regular at the rink and aboard the team bus when her father was the general manager of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. Jay Feaster remembered his    daughter sitting on the training table talking hockey with Mitch Lamoureux, a center who had played parts of three seasons in the N. H. L. but was by then a   lifer on the wrong side of 30. “I’ll see that in my mind until the day I die,” Jay Feaster said. “It was like two players just sitting there having a conversation. ” As Theresa Feaster grew older, she would pepper her father, who helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Stanley Cup as their general manager in 2004, with questions about the game. But she did not think seriously about getting involved in the sport until she attended the 2012 N. H. L. draft. Jay Feaster was Calgary’s general manager at the time, and the Flames selected two players who ended up at Providence. Theresa Feaster introduced herself to Friars Coach Nate Leaman, told him that she was entering her junior year and asked if she could volunteer with the team. She was soon attending coaches’ meetings and helping the program with anything it needed. She made such a good impression that Leaman hired her full time in October. Her new role is similar to the one she had as a student. She works on video and statistics projects, makes travel arrangements and helps with administrative tasks. “I feel like every day I’m learning more,” Feaster said. “One of the rewarding parts of this job is you come to the rink every day and you know that you’re going to learn and you’re going to get better. I find that incredibly rewarding. ” Although Miller and Feaster are technically members of their programs’ coaching staffs, N. C. A. A. rules prohibit anyone in their position from working with players on the ice or sitting on the bench during practices or games. Still, they are interacting with the coaches and players daily and gaining valuable experience. Both women aspire to management roles and, possibly, the N. H. L. They would again be an anomaly: Few women have worked in   roles in an N. H. L. front office, and none have been a general manager. Jay Feaster has spoken with his daughter about the grueling nature of hockey: the scarcity of   positions, the long hours and the lack of job security. It is not an easy road, but if it is the one she chooses, she is off to a good start. “I give her a hard time about, ‘You’re too smart to be in this racket. Do you want to be in the hockey business? You’re too smart for that,’” Jay Feaster said. “But I’m very, very proud. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Spiegel here has a piece by science journalist Axel Bojanowski about Richard Tol quitting the IPCC in protest: “Alleged panic-making: Leading scientist leaves the head of the IPCC. The dispute surrounding the UN IPCC escalates.”
Spiegel writes how Tol complains that the IPCC has “wiped away decisive formulations” from the final version and that the language of the report has been written by the “horsemen of the Apocalypse“.
Spiegel writes:
A ‘stupid statement’ in the report is the claim that people in war areas are especially vulnerable to climate change.”
Tol thinks that the people in Syria “are far more afraid of chemical weapons“.
Spiegel adds that Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change aimed criticism at Tol” resignation, claiming his criticism came too late. Tol rejects Ward’s assertion: “Material was not submitted too late, rather it was moved from one chapter to another.”
Spiegel then writes that Ward subscribes to the more pessimistic view when it comes to the economic impacts that climate change may have, a view that Tol outright dismisses.
SPIEGEL ONLINE claims to have a draft of the “secret report” and writes that in it assumptions have been “significantly corrected downwards” and that the IPCC expects an economic loss that is only “a tenth of that claimed by the Stern Report“.
Although Spiegel does not take a side in the article, Bojanowski’s report shows just how discordant, contentious and disharmonious the IPCC has become.

As a public service, _The BFD_ is highlighting some of the consequences of ‘clean’, ‘green’ energy. We have looked at [EV batteries](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/troy-runs-the-jag-off-the-road/) and [wind turbine blades](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/disposal-problem-number-two). Today let’s look at solar panels or photovoltaic panels (PV).



In May 2018, Michael Shellenberger, a Time Magazine “Hero of the Environment” and Green Book Award Winner, wrote in Forbes that the problem of solar panel disposal will explode with full force in two or three decades **and wreck the environment** because it is a huge amount of waste which is not easy to recycle.



We have known for years about the production process that results in tonnes of polluted sludge and contaminated water.



Before going bankrupt the US company Solyndra generated, in just four years, some 12.5 million pounds of hazardous waste, much of which was contaminated with carcinogenic cadmium.



Solar energy is clean and green. James said so!



The truth, however, does not care much about ideological blindness. 



The average lifespan of a solar panel is about 20 years, but high temperatures can accelerate the aging process for solar cells, and snow, dust, and other natural events (tornadoes, earthquakes), can cause material fatigue on the surface and in the internal electric circuits – gradually reducing the panel’s power output.



Solar panels generate **300 times more toxic waste per unit of energy than nuclear power plants.** They also contain lead, cadmium, and other toxic (even carcinogenic) chemicals that cannot be removed without breaking apart the entire panel. Worse, rainwater can wash many of these toxics out of the fragments of solar modules over time.



Another real concern is the vast increase in the use of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) in the construction of solar panels – up 1,057 percent over the past 25 years. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deems NF3 to be 17,200 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas – meaning that even relatively minor quantities can have major impacts.



  
Oh dear. For all those who believe the doom and gloom about greenhouse gases going to fry us all, this is a tad inconvenient.



Japan is also facing a growing solar waste problem. In a November 2016 article, Osamu Tomioka stated that Japanese solar panel waste will likely grow from the current 10,000 tons a year to 800,000 tons a year – and that just to recycle all of the waste produced through 2020 will take 19 years. How long will it take, and at what cost, to recycle 80 times that amount?



The simple truth is that it is past time for a real accounting of the overall costs to the public and to the environment of a massive increase in the use of solar panels as compared, for example, of increased reliance on non-intermittent technologies like nuclear energy and natural gas.

"JERUSALEM  —   Israel’s Parliament passed a provocative law late Monday that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land, pressing ahead with a statement of   assertiveness despite the likelihood that the country’s high court will nullify the legislation. It was a defining  —   opponents said frightening  —   moment in Israel’s    relations with Palestinians and amid fading hopes of ending decades of conflict through a   solution. While polls consistently show that most Israelis still support two states, their leaders and the reality of what is happening on the ground are consistently heading in the opposite direction: Fifty years after Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, many   politicians say that now  —   with negotiations with the Palestinians frozen  —   is the moment Israel must decide what it wants and act decisively on it. The new law is “deteriorating Israel’s democracy, making stealing an official policy and bringing us one step closer to annexation” of more land Palestinians claim for a future state, said Anat Ben Nun, the director of external relations for Peace Now, an   group. Only a few months ago, the law was believed to have little chance of coming up for a vote. Even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was flying back from a meeting with Britain’s leaders as the law was being debated, seemed to oppose its passage for fear of further international censure. The bill had been so contentious that the nation’s attorney general, who described it as unconstitutional and in contravention of international law, said he would not defend it in the high court, which seemed in any case likely to nullify it. That is partly because the law applies to Palestinians and their property rights. Since Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote for candidates for Israel’s Parliament, or Knesset, critics of the legislation say it is inherently  . Under the law, Palestinian landowners will be offered compensation for the   use of their property but will not be able to reclaim it. But the bill gained internal momentum through several forces: Mr. Netanyahu is determined to show his support to the powerful settler movement, and is under pressure from   on the right and from corruption investigations that even his supporters say appear serious. That pressure intensified last week after Mr. Netanyahu’s government carried out a court order to evacuate about 40 settler families at the Amona outpost, declared illegal a decade ago. “Today Israel decreed that developing settlement in Judea and Samaria is an Israeli interest,” said Bezalel Smotrich, a   lawmaker, using the biblical names for the West Bank. “From here we move on to expanding Israeli sovereignty and continuing to build and develop settlements across the land. ” At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu and the right  —   some allies, some opponents  —   have taken into account that they have more leeway under President Trump than under President Barack Obama, who regularly condemned settlement building. It is uncertain, however, just how firm the support from the new administration in Washington is: Last week, the White House issued a statement, amid announcements here about thousands of units of housing for settlers, saying that further expansion “may not be helpful” in achieving a deal with the Palestinians, which Mr. Trump has said he wants. A clearer sense of how Mr. Trump differs from Mr. Obama and from nearly 50 years of American opposition to settlement building is expected to emerge from a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu on Feb. 15 in Washington. The vote on Monday, which passed, 60 to 52, retroactively legalized several thousand housing units in 16 settlements on about 2, 000 acres of   land. The law provides for compensation to Palestinian landowners. Opponents said the law would encourage more settlements on Palestinian land, with the expectation that they, too, would be legalized. “Looting is illegal,” Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement after the vote. “The Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the   solution. ” Yair Lapid, the opposition politician seeking to succeed Mr. Netanyahu, said before the vote: “It’s unjust, it’s not smart, and it’s a law which damages the state of Israel, the security of Israel, governance in Israel and our ability to fight back against those who hate Israel. ” He added, “They are passing a law which endangers our soldiers, will undermine our international standing and undermine us as a country of law and order. ” Israel’s settlement activity has come under intense international criticism. In December, the United Nations  —   with the tacit support of the outgoing Obama administration  —   condemned Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as an impediment to a   solution. Settlers and   Israelis say the West Bank and East Jerusalem, captured from Jordan in the   War of 1967, belong to the Jewish people. The international significance of the vote on Monday was underscored during Mr. Netanyahu’s quick trip to visit Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. On one hand, she noted that her first meeting with Mr. Netanyahu came 100 years after the Balfour Declaration, in which the British government governing the area supported the creation of Jewish state. She said, however, that Britain remained “committed to a   solution,” adding, “It’s the best way of building stability, peace and prosperity in the future. ” Appearing before reporters with Mrs. May in London, Mr. Netanyahu, who has in the past tepidly supported a   solution, did not do so on Monday. As voting neared, tensions rose in the divided Knesset. “You are only passing this law so that the Supreme Court will later overturn it, and then you’ll be in the position to blame the judges,” Revital Swid, a member of the Zionist Union Party, told the governing Likud Party’s science minister, Ofir Akunis. “The land of Israel is ours, and this cannot be disputed or be divided,” Mr. Akunis responded. “The concept of settlement blocs is no longer relevant because there are no Arabs to negotiate with anymore. ” The vote came on the same day as a rocket fired from Gaza landed near the Israeli city of Ashkelon. No one was hurt. The Israeli military responded with artillery fire and airstrikes in northern Gaza. It was unclear if the rocket attack was related to Monday’s vote."
"**As England's national coronavirus lockdown comes to an end, non-essential businesses are able to reopen in a final rush to make money before Christmas.**
**However, confusion over government information about the rules means some businesses are keeping their doors closed for another 24 hours.**
**Becky Dewar** , who owns the Hare and Hounds in Levens, Cumbria, started furiously working towards a 3 December reopening date as soon as the four-week lockdown was announced, because ""it takes two weeks to shut a pub and two weeks to open a pub"".
After almost three weeks of cleaning up, filling out furlough paperwork for her 30 staff, managing the pub's finances and saving what stock she could, Becky realised that government guidance said she would in fact be able to reopen when England's new tiered system of coronavirus restrictions came into effect on Wednesday 2 December - a day earlier than she had been expecting.
With only nine days to go, it was too late for Becky, 40, to bring the reopening date forward - her staff rota was finalised and everything else had been geared towards opening on Thursday. The pub's takings on a normal Wednesday in December would be up to Â£2,000, but Becky is matter-of-fact about losing out on a day's trading. ""When you've been shut for 130 days in a year, 131 is... [just] one day,"" she said.
""If we'd mucked up the date by a week we would have crossed mountains to correct our mistake and sort it out, but a day in the whole scheme of how this year's worked outâ¦ these things are drops in the ocean,"" she said.
Becky said the mix-up was probably her own oversight, adding that pubs do not get any direct communication from the government about what Covid rules mean. ""You just go online and Google around, you read through the government website like everyone else does,"" she said.
However, Becky is not the only one to be reopening a day later than she needs to - and it may be because of inconsistent information from the government, rather than because people have misread the rules.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has not yet responded to a request to explain why a Cabinet Office document said lockdown measures would apply ""up to and including 2 December"" - suggesting they would end at some point on 3 December - whereas a DHSC document said the new tiered system would come into effect ""from the beginning of Wednesday 2 December"".
The DHSC told the BBC that the new tiered system coming into effect from 00:01 on 2 December would supersede lockdown regulations, and that it had always been the intention of the government to introduce new rules ""on 2 December"".
If **Phil Pinder** doesn't manage to reopen his drinks business in York tomorrow he could lose up Â£1,000 in potential sales.
Phil, 43, who owns a ""magical drinks emporium"" called The Potions Cauldron, will work through the night to try to get stock ready to open on Wednesday, instead of Thursday as he had initially arranged.
He said his small team's last-minute dash to avoid losing a day's trade is a result of contradictory information from the government.
""When they changed the new tier system, the [government] website said these rules come into force from the start of play on 2 December, but that the national lockdown restrictions will still play out in full.
""Then it linked to the previous lockdown rules, which said the lockdown will end at midnight on 2 December. That still exists on the government website. I think they messed up,"" Phil said.
Phil, whose shop's popular items include bottled ""serpent's venom"" and ""unicorn essence"", said his rushed reopening is down to the government ""messing about"" with lockdown end dates.
""We've got orders going out for wholesale, people now want their stock a day early and things like that - so it's having real consequences,"" he added.
If Phil's courier can deliver stock to him earlier than planned, the seven-strong team of shop workers will work ""really long"" hours to try to get the shop open on Wednesday. ""It's a very important time of year - we don't want to miss out,"" he said.
Moving on to another business owner called Phil, **Phil Townend** is hastily preparing to reopen his barbers in Leeds because lockdown is ending a day earlier than he had been expecting.
He only brought forward his reopening date a few days ago and hasn't managed to fill half of the available appointments yet - so is ""relying on last-minute people"" booking a haircut on Wednesday.
""We're not going to lose thousands of pounds on haircuts in one day - there's only two of us,"" Phil said - adding that he had to cut a third staff member's job at the end of the first national lockdown.
But Phil, 48, added he has generally been happy with the way the government has set out rules for businesses. ""It's been confusing at times but by and large I've understood what's going on.""
Another business person, who wanted to remain anonymous, runs a bowling alley in south-east England and said it was ""mentally exhausting"" to have to keep up with what he felt were last-minute changes to the rules set out by the government.
His business will lose a day of trading as a result of having to open on Thursday, not Wednesday.
""The leisure industry isn't a tap you can turn on and off at a moment's notice,"" he said.
""Stock goes out of date. Customers are scared to book because we keep having to open and close all the time, seemingly at a whim.
""The short term-ism does nobody any favours and whilst I completely agree and understand that the virus needs containing, we have been left out to dry and treated like second-class citizens.""
However, some businesses have had time to bring forward their opening times - and are celebrating the extra day of trading.
""Christmas has truly come early,"" the restaurant chain Pizza Express said in a tweet as it announced that it would be moving its reopening date from 3 December to 2 December.
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said there had been some confusion among the trade association's members about when their businesses could reopen but the government had since clarified it to would be from 00:01 GMT on 2 December.
""Over the past nine months, the flow of information from the government has been slow and lacking in clarity,"" she added.
""Businesses have had to react to announcements regarding opening, closures and changing of restrictions at short notice.
""It has been a theme of this year that businesses have not been given adequate warning about changes that impact their operation.""
Mike Cherry, national chair at the Federation for Small Businesses, added that the frequent changes to lockdown rules meant it was ""no surprise"" that there was ""frustration, anxiety and confusion in the business community""."

It is always tricky to traverse the minefield of Middle East politics, and Mitt Romney appears to have stirred up more than a little controversy with his recent remarks about Israeli and Palestinian economies.



Romney pointed out that GDP per capita in Israel is $21,000, compared with $10,000 in the Palestinian Authority, and suggested that a difference in “culture” between the two countries might be partially responsible for the disparity. The Palestinians were predictably upset, and much of the media said Romney had committed a damaging gaffe. Yet, considered apart from concerns over offending Middle Eastern sensibilities, Romney’s remarks are not only accurate, they reflect a much larger truth that matters not just in the Middle East but in this upcoming election.



First, it should be noted that Romney actually got the numbers wrong: Israel’s per capita GDP is much higher, $31,282, and the Palestinian Authority’s much lower, just $1,600. No doubt the Palestinian economy has suffered as a result of Israeli security policies. Limitations on Palestinian property rights, continued Israeli control over land and water, and restrictions on both imports and exports have harmed Palestinian economic development. By some estimates, as much as 60 percent of Palestinian territory is off limits to economic development. Romney should have taken this into account.





Romney’s ‘gaffe’ revealed an important truth.



Yet, how then to account for Jordan, where GDP per capita is just $5,900, or Egypt, where it is only $6,500? Israel can hardly be blamed for a lack of economic growth in those countries. In fact, no Arab nation without substantial oil wealth has a GDP per capita greater than half that of Israel.



Perhaps Romney could have used a better term than “culture” to describe the combination of attitudes toward markets, the role of government, the welfare state, inequality, and institutions that underpin a nation’s economy, but nit‐​picking about terminology shouldn’t eclipse the larger truth: If a nation hopes to prosper, it must foster a culture conducive to prosperity.



In fact, Israel itself had to change in order to spur economic growth, abandoning the old socialist solidarity of the kibbutz for a political culture that encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and risk‐​taking. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cut taxes, reduced government spending, reformed pensions, and begun privatizing state‐​owned companies, including El Al (Israel’s national airline) parts of its electric company, and its major banks. The “new Israel,” Netanyahu has said, is based on “free enterprise, privatization, open capital markets, an end to cartels, lower taxes, [and] deregulation.”



The result has been the transformation of Israel into a hub for technological entrepreneurship. From 1993 to today, real GDP has increased fourfold, and real GDP per capita has risen 250 percent.



The Palestinian Authority has not undertaken similar reforms. Government spending continues to consume an inordinate amount of GDP. Taxes, while widely evaded, are high. Both foreign investment and domestic business remain subject to a byzantine and often corrupt regulatory regime. The Authority’s old‐​fashioned pay‐​as‐​you‐​go public pension program is accumulating enormous future liabilities. Crony capitalism is the norm rather than the exception. As a result, the Palestinian Authority’s economic growth has been nearly nonexistent.



If the Palestinians want to follow the Israeli model for economic growth, then they too will have to reduce taxes, regulations, and the burden of government. They will have to foster a culture of entrepreneurship and success. They will have to realize that the politics and policies of resentment and envy do not create a single job, start a single business, or add a single dinar of wealth.



This is true outside of the Middle East, as well. Is there any doubt that Europe’s welfare‐​state culture and the entitlement attitude that drive the high taxes and bloated governments of countries such as Greece and Spain are at least partially responsible for their problems?



Governor Romney hardly needed to go halfway around the world to demonstrate this. He could just have looked at two neighboring U.S. states, Virginia and Maryland, to see a similar dynamic. Maryland has one of the most aggressively tax‐​and‐​spend legislatures in the country. The state ranks 42nd out of 50 in terms of business environment. Its tax burden is the nation’s twelfth‐​highest. Virginia, ranked 26th for business climate, is far from the most pro‐​business state, but it is much better than Maryland. Thirty‐​three states have higher taxes than Virginia does.



As a result, Virginia’s unemployment rate is just 5.7 percent, while Maryland’s is 6.9 percent. Virginia just announced a state‐​budget surplus. Maryland continues to wrestle with a massive budget deficit. And, after Maryland passed a new “millionaires’ tax,” 31,000 residents moved out of the state, many of them to Virginia. One might consider Virginia to be Israel and Maryland to be Palestine (without the border checkpoints). That is why President Obama’s view of America’s culture, at least when it comes to economics, is so troubling. His recent remarks concerning whether business owners built their businesses on their own, even when taken in context, reflect a belief that individual initiative, intelligence, and hard work have far less to do with success than good luck. The successful are simply winners of “life’s lottery.” It is, therefore, government’s job to rectify the inequity of capricious fortune by redistributing the wealth.



President Obama would make our culture more like the cultures of Europe. If that were to happen, we wouldn’t just be a “fundamentally transformed” nation, we would be a far less prosperous one.



Don’t call it a gaffe. Governor Romney was right. Political and economic culture really does matter.

Sometimes, science does things just to see if it is possible. This seems to be one of those times. While I really wanted to have my long promised flying car by now, this is pretty cool too.

Controlled clockwise and anticlockwise rotational switching of a molecular motor

Abstract
The design of artificial molecular machines1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 often takes inspiration from macroscopic machines13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. However, the parallels between the two systems are often only superficial, because most molecular machines are governed by quantum processes. 
Previously, rotary molecular motors3 powered by light4, 5, 6 and chemical7, 8, 9, 10, 11 energy have been developed. In electrically driven motors, tunnelling electrons from the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope have been used to drive the rotation of a simple rotor12 in a single direction and to move a four-wheeled molecule across a surface13. Here, we show that a stand-alone molecular motor adsorbed on a gold surface can be made to rotate in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction by selective inelastic electron tunnelling through different subunits of the motor. Our motor is composed of a tripodal stator for vertical positioning, a five-arm rotor for controlled rotations, and a ruthenium atomic ball bearing connecting the static and rotational parts. The directional rotation arises from sawtooth-like rotational potentials, which are solely determined by the internal molecular structure and are independent of the surface adsorption site.

Earth, covered in ice. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
It makes you wonder what created all that CO2 millions of years ago.
From Louisiana State University
LSU researchers find new information about ‘Snowball Earth’ period
It is rather difficult to imagine, but approximately 635 million years ago, ice may have covered a vast portion of our planet in an event called “Snowball Earth.” According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, the massive ice age that occurred before animal life appeared, when Earth’s landmasses were most likely clustered near the equator, precipitated relatively rapid changes in atmospheric conditions and a subsequent greenhouse heat wave. This particular period of extensive glaciation and subsequent climate changes might have supplied the cataclysmic event that gave rise to modern levels of atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the rise of animals and the diversification of life during the later Cambrian explosion.
But if ice covered the earth all the way to the tropics during what is known as the Marinoan glaciation, how did the planet spring back from the brink of an ice apocalypse? Huiming Bao, Charles L. Jones Professor in Geology & Geophysics at LSU, might have some of the answers. 
Bao and LSU graduate students Bryan Killingsworth and Justin Hayles, together with Chuanming Zhou, a colleague at Chinese Academy of Sciences, had an article published on Feb. 5 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS, that provides new clues on the duration of what was a significant change in atmospheric conditions following the Marinoan glaciation.
“The story is to put a time limit on how fast our Earth system can recover from a total frozen state,” Bao said. “It is about a unique and rapidly changing post-glacial world, but is also about the incredible resilience of life and life’s remarkable ability to restore a new balance between atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere after a global glaciation.”
Bao’s group went about investigating the post-glaciation period of Snowball Earth by looking at unique occurrences of “crystal fans” of a common mineral known as barite (BaSO4), deposited in rocks following the Marinoan glaciation. Out of the three stable isotopes of oxygen, O-16, O-17 and O-18, Bao’s group pays close attention to the relatively scarce isotope O-17. According to Killingsworth, there aren’t many phenomena on earth that can change the normally expected ratio of the scare isotope O-17 to more abundant isotope O-18. However, in sulfate minerals such as barite in rock samples from around 635 million years ago, Bao’s group finds large deviations in the normal ratio of O-17 to O-18 with respect to O-16 isotopes.
“If something unusual happens with the composition of the atmosphere, the oxygen isotope ratios can change,” Killingsworth said. “We see a large deviation in this ratio in minerals deposited around 635 million years ago. This occurred during an extremely odd time in atmospheric history.”
According to Bao’s group, the odd oxygen isotope ratios they find in barite samples from 635 million years ago could have occurred if, following the extensive Snowball Earth glaciation, Earth’s atmosphere had very high levels of carbon dioxide, or CO2. An ultra-high carbon dioxide atmosphere, Killingsworth explains, where CO2 levels match levels of atmospheric oxygen, would grab more O-17 from oxygen. This would cause a depletion of the O-17 isotope in air and subsequently in barite minerals, which incorporate oxygen as they grow. Bao’s group has found worldwide deposits of this O-17 depleted sulfate mineral in rocks dating from the global glaciation event 635 million years ago, indicating an episode of an ultra-high carbon dioxide atmosphere following the Marinoan glaciation.
“Something significant happened in the atmosphere,” Killingsworth said. “This kind of an atmospheric shift in carbon dioxide is not observed during any other period of Earth’s history. And now we have sedimentary rock evidence for how long this ultra-high carbon dioxide period lasted.”
By using available radiometric dates from areas near layers of barite deposits, Bao’s group has been able to come up with an estimate for the duration of what is now called the Marinoan Oxygen-17 Depletion, or MOSD, event. Bao’s group estimates the MOSD duration at 0 – 1 million years.
“This is, so far, really the best estimate we could get from geological records, in line with previous models of how long an ultra-high carbon dioxide event could last before the carbon dioxide in the air would get drawn back into the oceans and sediments,” Killingsworth said.
Normally, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are in balance with levels of carbon dioxide in the ocean. However, if water and air were cut off by a thick layer of ice during Snowball Earth, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could have increased drastically. In a phenomenon similar to the climate change Earth is witnessing in modern times, high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide would have created a greenhouse gas warming effect, trapping heat inside the planet’s atmosphere and melting the Marinoan ice. Essentially, the Marinoan glaciation created the potential for extreme changes in atmospheric chemistry that in turn lead to the end of Snowball Earth and the beginning of a new explosion of animal life on Earth.
While previous work by Bao’s group had advanced the interpretation of the strange occurrence of O-17 depleted barite just after the Marinoan glaciation, there was still much uncertainty on the duration of ultra-high CO2 levels after meltdown of Snowball Earth. Bao’s discovery of a field site with many barite layers gave the opportunity to track how oxygen isotope ratios changed through a thickness of sedimentary rock. As the pages in a novel can be thought of as representing time, so layers of sedimentary rock represent geological history. However, these rock “pages” represented an unknown duration of time for the MOSD event. By using characteristic features of the Marinoan rock sequence occurring regionally in South China, Bao’s group linked the barite layer site to other sites in the region that did have precise dates from volcanic ash beds. Bao’s group has succeeded in estimating the duration of the MOSD event, and thus the time it took for Earth to restore “normal” CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
“To some extent, our findings demonstrate that whatever happens to Earth, she will recover, and recover at a rapid pace,” Bao said. “Mother Earth lived and life carried on even in the most devastating situation. The only difference is the life composition afterwards. In other words, whatever humans do to the Earth, life will go on. The only uncertainty is whether humans will still remain part of the life composition.”
Bao says that he had been interested in this most intriguing episode of Earth’s history since Paul Hoffman, Dan Schrag and colleagues revived the Snowball Earth hypothesis in 1998.
“I was a casual ‘non-believer’ of this hypothesis because of the mere improbability of such an Earth state,” Bao said. “There was nothing rational or logic in that belief for me, of course. I remember I even told my job interviewers back in 2000 that one of my future research plans was to prove that the Snowball Earth hypothesis was wrong.”
However, during a winter break in 2006, Bao obtained some unusual data from barite, a sulfate mineral dating from the Snowball Earth period that he received from a colleague in China.
“I started to develop my own method to explore this utterly strange world,” Bao said. “Now, it seems that our LSU group is the one offering the strongest supporting evidence for a ‘Snowball Earth’ back 635 million years ago. I certainly did not see this coming. The finding we published in 2008 demonstrates, again, that new scientific breakthroughs are often brought in by outsiders.”
Bao credits his research ideas, analytical work and pleasure of working on this project to his two graduate students, Killingsworth and Hayles, as well as his long-time Chinese collaborators. Bao brought Killingsworth and Hayles to an interior mountainous region in South China in December 2011, where the group succeeded in finding multiple barite layers in a section of rocks dating to 635 million years ago. This discovery formed a large part of their analysis and subsequent publication in PNAS.
“Nothing can beat the intellectual excitement and satisfaction you get from research in the field and in the laboratory,” Bao said.

A Fox News guest called 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg a ‘mentally ill Swedish child’ on air.

The Founding Fathers intended for impeachment to serve as Congress’s “essential check” on executive overreach.



Rather than checking the president’s power, this impeachment is all about winning the White House. Getting two‐​thirds of the Senate to go along with removing President Trump was never going to happen, so instead House Democrats are using the impeachment inquiry to sway next November’s vote. For their part, Senate Republicans are embracing a trial, reportedly in the hope that a drawn‐​out process will keep Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate off the campaign trail during the crucial first primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.



What’s going on here? Why have the House and Senate, through the impeachment process, become willing cogs in the oily machinery of the 2020 presidential contest?



The first step back to a healthy separation of powers is for lawmakers to recognize that the presidency—and not just the office-holder—is Congress’s constitutional rival.



The answer involves a tectonic shift in American government, from a functioning separation of powers to one that is out of whack. To appreciate today’s perverted impeachment process, one must understand how the president supplanted Congress as policymaker‐​in‐​chief.



Over the last century, Congress has given away, or “delegated,” much of its policymaking initiative to the executive branch. In part, Congress delegates out of necessity—there isn’t enough time in the day for lawmakers to execute the laws they pass. And in part, Congress delegates to pass the buck by having agencies make tough choices.



Through these grants of authority, Congress created an alphabet soup’s worth of regulatory agencies collectively known as the administrative state. At first, Congress took pains to oversee its delegations through a system of strong committees in the House and Senate. From the New Deal to the Reagan era, powerful committee chairs vied with presidential appointees for influence at regulatory agencies.



During the last 40 years, however, Congress changed. Demographic shifts led to the end of blocs of southern Democrats and northeastern Republicans, which rendered the parties more uniform. While hive‐​mentalities were taking hold in Congress, opportunistic leaders, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R‐​Ga.) and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D‐​Maine), consolidated power with rules changes, procedural maneuvering, and the distribution of party resources.



As power shifted from committees to party leadership, Congress lost the capacity to oversee its delegations. In the power vacuum left behind, modern presidents have seized undisputed supremacy over the administrative state by increasing control over agency budgets and regulatory management.



Policy now flows from the White House.



Congress couldn’t pass immigration reform, but President Obama achieved the same results with DACA. Congress denied President Trump funding to build a border wall, but then he exercised his delegated authority to declare an “emergency” and funded the wall unilaterally.



In this context—where the president calls the shots and Congress is beholden to party leadership—half the legislature always is unbothered with unbound executive authority whenever “their guy” occupies the White House.



It’s a vicious feedback loop. The more powerful the president becomes, the more our party‐​centric Congress rationally believes that the Oval Office is the most efficient means to implement the planks of a given party’s platform.



Of course, the parties whine about executive overreach, but only when they don’t occupy the White House. Neither party seeks to claw back power from the presidency, because each side wants its respective team to exercise executive authority.



So, congressional Republicans cried foul about executive power when President Obama resorted to his “phone and pen,” but then rallied to the support of President Trump when he disregarded Congress’s “power of the purse” in funding the border wall. And Democratic lawmakers now complain about presidential power, even though they gave President Obama an ovation when he threatened to bypass Congress on climate change during the 2013 State of the Union address.



Today’s supine Congress would be unrecognizable to the Founding Fathers. They understood that a concentration of power threatens individual liberty, so they designed a government with three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—and gave each the means to check the other. By dispersing power into competing institutions, the Founders’ constitutional design serves as a bulwark for freedom.



At present, this constitutional design is buckling under the weight of partisanship. The impeachment brouhaha is the latest conspicuous example. Rather than competing _with_ the president, both chambers in Congress are leveraging the proceedings to conduct partisan political campaigns _for_ the presidency.



For as long as love of party trumps institutional pride in Congress, lawmakers will undermine crucial safeguards for “We the People.” The first step back to a healthy separation of powers is for lawmakers to recognize that the presidency—and not just the office-holder—is Congress’s constitutional rival.

It’s been said, in relation to President Trump, that sometimes you need a bully on your side against an even bigger bully. The same can be said for assholes. Mark Steyn once said, “You can’t out-asshole Donald Trump”, but Jeremy Clarkson would give him a run for his money. And that’s why we love him.



In a world of PC capons, Clarkson is exactly the kind of blunt-spoken asshole we need in the fight against the self-righteous assholes of the left.



Former “Top Gear” host Jeremy Clarkson in a Friday column called teen climate activist Greta Thunberg a “spoilt brat” and blamed her supporters and parents for encouraging her behavior. 



Thunberg is one of the most privileged humans to ever walk the earth. Like most of her generation, she lives in the sort of coddled luxury that would make the Sun King gasp with envy – and all she can do is scowl and screech at my generation and the generation before – which would be the generation who saved the world from Nazism. **How dare she?**



Clarkson suggested Thunberg remember that she owes a debt to adults, starting with those who sponsored her much-hyped trans-Atlantic voyage last month.



“How dare we? No,” he said. “How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £15million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.”



Clarkson went on to point out that adults also gave Thunberg and her generation countless scientific and cultural innovations, from headache medicine to movies to fighter jets to iPhones.



“Pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden’s fighter planes. To keep you safe,” he said. “We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.”



Clarkson added: “So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.”



Clarkson also rightly pointed out that the fault lies with the parents and unscrupulous activists who have enabled this brat’s ignorant temper-tantrums.



Clarkson agreed with Thunberg that “the world is heating up” and something should be done to prevent climate change from fueling an “unimaginable refugee crisis.”



However, he said that “science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes.”



“So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it,” he concluded. “And no. You cannot stay out past ten. And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.”



Naturally, the unprincipled left are hypocritically cowering behind their infant human shield.



The column by Clarkson, who has long courted controversy, provoked indignation by Thunberg’s many supporters.



However…in an essay published Saturday, National Review editor Rich Lowry argued that Thunberg is a “pawn being used by adults for their own interests.”



“Kids are powerful pawns,” he said. “The catchphrase ‘for the children’ has a seductive political appeal, while kids offer their adult supporters a handy two-step. The same people who say, ‘The world must heed this 16-year-old girl’ will turn around and say to anyone who pushes back, ‘How dare you criticize a 16-year-old girl?’”

"Some are disarmingly named, like the cutesy Chinese mitten crab. Others have names more indicative of their undesirable nature, like rock snot, an algae that slimes up cool forest streams. They are some of more than 100 invasive species that conservationists must battle in New York State, which teems with a growing number of plants, birds, fish, insects, mosses, molds and fungi that actually belong somewhere else. With some of the busiest airports and ports in the United States, New York has far more invasive species of certain types than any other state, federal officials say. Carried inside airplane wheels or in the ballast water of large boats, many creatures and spores show up in New York first, making it a laboratory of sorts where scientists and others strive to devise methods to banish the outsiders or risk losing native flora and fauna to invading hordes. Underscoring the increasing menace posed by persistent pest species, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recently announced a $2 million grant challenging groups and institutions to come up with fresh strategies to fight living things like   zebra mussels and a catastrophic fungus that causes even the most ancient oaks to wilt away. Last year, the state budget for invasive species control was nearly doubled from 2015, to $12 million. “New York State is a real epicenter for everything invasive, whether it’s aquatic, forest or terrestrial, because of where we sit in terms of international and interstate commerce,” said Robert Davies, director of the division lands and forests for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation. “The world is getting smaller and one of the downsides of the world getting smaller is this. ” Invasive species have long been a threat unwanted visitors, once they arrive, sometimes stay forever. The Asian   beetle was first discovered in New York in 1996 and has been devouring hardwood trees nationwide ever since. In the last century, chestnut blight, a fungus, wiped out nearly all of New York’s American chestnuts, once the most populous tree in the state. And gypsy moths, introduced from France in the 1860s, are still here, decimating leafy trees. Despite strict rules about what can be brought into the United States and the screening of goods and packages by federal authorities at entry points, the sheer volume of traffic makes it virtually impossible to erect a foolproof barrier. “As a global hub for international trade and travel, New York is on the front lines of protecting our nation,’’ Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. The state mobilized in December after the discovery that oak trees in Brooklyn and in Suffolk County on Long Island were infected with oak wilt, a deadly fungus that chokes off trees’ internal water supply. There is no known cure contaminated trees must be cut down and their root systems killed to prevent the fungus from spreading. The state issued an order forbidding the transporting of oak wood out of the affected counties. In Brooklyn, the outbreak was detected in a northern red oak tree  —   just one so far  —   inside the   Cemetery, the final resting place for many luminaries. Now, only a stump is left of a   shade tree that was over 50 years old. It was cut down last month to prevent the wilt’s spread. The stump will get a coat of herbicide that will kill the root system, which is still infected. “The potential for the devastation here is immediately impactful, but it’s also the significance for the oaks throughout the city,” said Joseph Charap, the director of horticulture for the cemetery, who first noticed the diseased oak. He stood among the graves on a recent morning, while in the bare canopy of an uninfected oak tree above him, teams of   men tethered to the upper branches sawed off limbs. The discovery had set off a race to prune all 664 of the cemetery’s oak trees while they are dormant for the winter as a barricade against the spread of disease. The branches that are trimmed are treated with a special paint to guard against the fungus entering the trees. “The potential to lose our oak collection is unthinkable,” Mr. Charap said. Across the country, invasive species cause over $100 billion in damage every year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, from blighted crops to boats covered with sharp zebra mussels. New York State does not keep a total for damage caused, but the annual bill just to control one species  —   the sea lamprey, a parasitic fish  —   is $500, 000. The overall budget for invasive species control is about $5. 5 million. While the state is at the epicenter of the problem, there are hot spots, including other parts of the East Coast, California and Texas. Sitting at the intersection of so many streams of commerce, New York has had to innovate under the pressures of invasive species. In 2009 it introduced a novel law forbidding the transporting of any firewood more than 50 miles from its source to prevent the spread of disease. (The oak at   Cemetery, Mr. Charap believes, was probably infected by firewood improperly brought to the city.) Inside a laboratory at Cornell University, tiny,   Galerucella birmanica beetles from China are kept under quarantine as their appetite for water chestnut is tested. An invasive aquatic species most likely introduced to New York in the 1880s, the water chestnut continues to clog the state’s fresh waterways. Someday, the bugs may be released as a biological means to control the plant. The state Conservation Department has also created an app that allows people to log sightings of plants and animals they suspect might not belong in their yards or any natural areas. Last year, over 300 people reported more than 12, 000 such sightings. On the ground, the battle is fought with teams of forestry experts going    inoculating root systems against fungus. In the air, the Conservation Department uses State Police helicopters to conduct seasonal patrols to spot shriveled trees on mountainsides or to search for animals that do not belong here, such as the Eurasian  boar. Such efforts do pay off. It’s been several years since the last boar sighting for Bill Burns, 75, a farmer who grows corn and other crops on over 600 acres in Spafford, N. Y. on the eastern edge of the Finger Lakes. Mr. Burns estimates that the animals, which are native to Russia and are believed to have been introduced here by game farmers who were careless with their fences, have caused more than $100, 000 in damages to his crops over the years. “They will go right down the corn planter tracks and suck the seed right out of the ground,” Mr. Burns said. He shot and killed several of them  —   “they taste rewarding,’’ he said  —   but it took a concerted effort by the state and federal authorities, which sent in specially trained trappers and dogs to round up the animals, to achieve true relief. The pigs have been eradicated from the state, according to the Conservation Department. Still, from his kitchen window, Mr. Burns can look across Skaneateles Lake and see stands of dead ash trees. He believes they have been killed by swarms of emerald ash borers, a   Asian beetle first confirmed to have colonized New York State in 2009, according to Cornell University. The insects are one of the state’s top priorities. Mr. Burns fears it is too late. “I am irritated and disappointed in just about everybody in the world that is careless,” he said."
"**A 10-year-old boy has gone back to school for the first time since March after his family won the right for him to wear a facemask in lessons.**
Kieron said he wanted to wear the mask when at school to protect his father, who has diabetes.
But the headteacher at All Saints Primary School in Friskney, Lincolnshire, said he should not wear a mask in school.
A panel of independent school governors has backed the family's case.
Kieron's full name and those of his parents are not being disclosed by the BBC, in order to help protect the family's identity.
The youngster's parents had their son at home since the first lockdown was announced in March.
The couple did not feel safe sending Kieron back when schools initially reopened, and undertook to continue home education.
In early October the school contacted the family to make a plan for his return, but in a letter dated 8 October said: ""We do hope Kieron returns tomorrow but it must be without a face covering in accordance to the guidance provided.""
The school's head, Charles Daniels, told the family in his letter: ""School is following the advice and guidance from the Department for Education, Lincolnshire County Council, Public Health England and Lincolnshire.
""Until the school receives different advice from those organisations then the school policy remains that primary aged pupils do not wear face coverings on school premises.""
But after an appeal to the independent governors Kieron returned to the school wearing a mask on Tuesday.
His father said: ""We think it's utter madness, at a time when everyone is screaming, 'wear a mask, wear a mask', the school says 'don't wear a mask, you can't come in'.
""Every child that wears a mask in the classroom is helping to keep Covid away.""
The school governors said: ""We believe the best place for our pupils is in the classroom.
""Having met with Kieron's parents to discuss the matter, we are pleased to report that he has returned to school.
""It has been agreed that Kieron can wear a mask in class as long as he meets the school's expectations for managing its use.""

OPEN CLIMATE LETTER TO UN SECRETARY GENERAL: Current scientific knowledge does not substantiate Ban Ki-Moon assertions on weather and climate, say 125 scientists.
Open Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
H.E. Ban Ki-Moon, Secretary-General, United Nations
First Avenue and East 44th Street, New York, New York, U.S.A.
November 29, 2012
Mr. Secretary-General:
On November 9 this year you told the General Assembly: “Extreme weather due to climate change is the new normal … Our challenge remains, clear and urgent: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to strengthen adaptation to … even larger climate shocks … and to reach a legally binding climate agreement by 2015 … This should be one of the main lessons of Hurricane Sandy.”
On November 13 you said at Yale: “The science is clear; we should waste no more time on that debate.”  
The following day, in Al Gore’s “Dirty Weather” Webcast, you spoke of “more severe storms, harsher droughts, greater floods”, concluding: “Two weeks ago, Hurricane Sandy struck the eastern seaboard of the United States. A nation saw the reality of climate change. The recovery will cost tens of billions of dollars. The cost of inaction will be even higher. We must reduce our dependence on carbon emissions.”
We the undersigned, qualified in climate-related matters, wish to state that current scientific knowledge does not substantiate your assertions.

"WASHINGTON  —   Republicans seized her microphone. And gave her a megaphone. Silenced on the Senate floor for condemning a peer, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, emerged on Wednesday in a coveted role: the avatar of liberal resistance in the age of President Trump. Late on Tuesday, Senate Republicans voted to halt the remarks of Ms. Warren, already a lodestar of the left, after she criticized a colleague, Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, by reading a letter from Coretta Scott King. Instantly, the decision  —   led by Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who invoked a rarely enforced rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives and conduct of a peer  —   amplified Ms. Warren’s message and further inflamed the angry Senate debate over Mr. Sessions’ nomination. He was confirmed on Wednesday. For Ms. Warren’s supporters, it was the latest and most visceral example of a woman muzzled by men who seemed unwilling to listen. Critics saw something else: a senator who has rankled members of both parties with her nose for the spotlight lobbing a    salvo in the next presidential race. “A lot of that’s about 2020 politics,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, grumbled on MSNBC. Mr. McConnell’s subsequent explanation for his maneuver seemed destined for a future Warren campaign ad: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted. ” After an unsuccessful effort to draft her for the 2016 presidential race, Ms. Warren is considered a very early   for 2020, should she run. Mr. McConnell’s coda has already been repurposed as a sort of rallying cry. Across social media, Ms. Warren’s allies and supporters posted with the hashtag #shepersisted, calling to mind some Democrats’ embrace of the term “nasty woman” after Mr. Trump deployed it to describe Hillary Clinton during a debate. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire in October, Ms. Warren reminded Mr. Trump that “nasty women vote. ” After the vote to bar Ms. Warren from speaking further about Mr. Sessions, other senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Tom Udall of New Mexico, read Mrs. King’s letter without facing any objection, prompting some activists to raise charges of sexism. Ms. Warren has long displayed an instinct for capitalizing on highly visible fights. After she was barred from speaking on the Senate floor, she began reading the 1986 letter from Mrs. King on Facebook. By Wednesday evening, the video had attracted more than nine million views. In the letter, Mrs. King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. took aim at Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights as a United States attorney in Alabama, saying he had used “the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. ” She called on the Senate not to confirm Mr. Sessions to a federal judgeship, and his nomination to that post was ultimately rejected. On Wednesday morning, in a conference room in the Capitol  —   the vote prohibited Ms. Warren from speaking about the nomination only from the Senate floor  —   Ms. Warren addressed civil rights leaders, recounting her long night. “What hit me the hardest was, it is about silence,” she said. “It’s about trying to shut people up. It’s about saying, ‘No, no, no, just go ahead and vote. ’” She went on. “This is going to be hard,” she said. “We don’t have the tools. There’s going to be a lot that we will lose. But I guarantee, the one thing we will not lose, we will not lose our voices. ” As Democrats strain to navigate the early days of the Trump presidency, weighing the merits of the blanket opposition that many in their base seem to crave, the latest rancor appeared to raise the likelihood of further confrontation in the Senate chamber. Some   groups seemed comfortable with that. “What the public needs to see from Democrats right now is more backbone and more standing on principle,” said Adam Green, a   of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “Elizabeth Warren continues to be the model for good behavior. ” The timing is fortunate for Ms. Warren, whose fiery denunciations of corporate greed have long made her a Democratic celebrity. Her new book deal was announced this week. Its title: “This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class. ” Shortly after Mr. McConnell’s objection on Tuesday, Ms. Warren called a favorite TV anchor, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, and spoke live on the air. On Wednesday, Republicans betrayed no regret for their move, accusing Ms. Warren of ignoring repeated warnings to avoid violating the Senate rule, known as Rule XIX. She had also read a letter from Edward M. Kennedy, who represented Massachusetts in the Senate, disparaging Mr. Sessions. “You don’t insult  —   whether it be from a letter, or from a message from God, or on golden tablets,” said Senator John McCain of Arizona. “That’s the rules of the Senate. They want to complain about it, complain about it. ” Democrats and their allies resumed their protest against Mr. Sessions on Wednesday with renewed swagger, despite their long odds of blocking his confirmation. “If Mr. McConnell or anybody else wants to deny me the right to debate Jeff Sessions’s qualifications, go for it,” Mr. Sanders said from the Senate floor hours before the vote. Since the election, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been among the lawmakers jockeying to be leading messengers for Democratic politics under the Trump administration. There have been bumps. Last month, Ms. Warren faced rare criticism from liberals after voting in a Senate committee to approve Ben Carson as Mr. Trump’s secretary of housing and urban development, infuriating voters who had hoped for uniform opposition to Mr. Trump’s cabinet. Defending herself on Facebook at the time, Ms. Warren wrote that she appreciated the feedback. “Unlike the new administration,” she said, “I don’t believe in ignoring or silencing people who disagree with the choices I make or the votes I take. ” This week, it seemed, all had been forgiven. MoveOn. org, the liberal political group, said it had collected about $300, 000 in contributions for Ms. Warren since Tuesday night. And by midafternoon, a   email from Ms. Warren had arrived in the inboxes of her supporters. “I’m still banned from speaking on the Senate floor  —   but there’s still time for you to make your voice heard,” the email read, with a link to a page for contributions. She signed off with a familiar message: “Keep fighting. ”"

From Stanford University , the first carbon sequestration project that makes energy. I wonder, will Al Gore say the electricity produced by a carbon solar cell is “dirty energy”? Somewhere, off in the distance, I hear Joe Romm’s head exploding.
Stanford scientists build the first all-carbon solar cell

Stanford University scientists have built the first solar cell made entirely of carbon, a promising alternative to the expensive materials used in photovoltaic devices today.
The results are published in the Oct. 31 online edition of the journal ACS Nano.
“Carbon has the potential to deliver high performance at a low cost,” said study senior author Zhenan Bao, a professor of chemical engineering at Stanford. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a working solar cell that has all of the components made of carbon. This study builds on previous work done in our lab.”

Unlike rigid silicon solar panels that adorn many rooftops, Stanford’s thin film prototype is made of carbon materials that can be coated from solution. “Perhaps in the future we can look at alternative markets where flexible carbon solar cells are coated on the surface of buildings, on windows or on cars to generate electricity,” Bao said.
The coating technique also has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, said Stanford graduate student Michael Vosgueritchian, co-lead author of the study with postdoctoral researcher Marc Ramuz.
“Processing silicon-based solar cells requires a lot of steps,” Vosgueritchian explained. “But our entire device can be built using simple coating methods that don’t require expensive tools and machines.”
Carbon nanomaterials
The Bao group’s experimental solar cell consists of a photoactive layer, which absorbs sunlight, sandwiched between two electrodes. In a typical thin film solar cell, the electrodes are made of conductive metals and indium tin oxide (ITO). “Materials like indium are scarce and becoming more expensive as the demand for solar cells, touchscreen panels and other electronic devices grows,” Bao said. “Carbon, on the other hand, is low cost and Earth-abundant.”
For the study, Bao and her colleagues replaced the silver and ITO used in conventional electrodes with graphene – sheets of carbon that are one atom thick –and single-walled carbon nanotubes that are 10,000 times narrower than a human hair. “Carbon nanotubes have extraordinary electrical conductivity and light-absorption properties,” Bao said.
For the active layer, the scientists used material made of carbon nanotubes and “buckyballs” – soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules just one nanometer in diameter. The research team recently filed a patent for the entire device.
“Every component in our solar cell, from top to bottom, is made of carbon materials,” Vosgueritchian said. “Other groups have reported making all-carbon solar cells, but they were referring to just the active layer in the middle, not the electrodes.”
One drawback of the all-carbon prototype is that it primarily absorbs near-infrared wavelengths of light, contributing to a laboratory efficiency of less than 1 percent – much lower than commercially available solar cells. “We clearly have a long way to go on efficiency,” Bao said. “But with better materials and better processing techniques, we expect that the efficiency will go up quite dramatically.”
Improving efficiency
The Stanford team is looking at a variety of ways to improve efficiency. “Roughness can short-circuit the device and make it hard to collect the current,” Bao said. “We have to figure out how to make each layer very smooth by stacking the nanomaterials really well.”
The researchers are also experimenting with carbon nanomaterials that can absorb more light in a broader range of wavelengths, including the visible spectrum.
“Materials made of carbon are very robust,” Bao said. “They remain stable in air temperatures of nearly 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.”
The ability of carbon solar cells to out-perform conventional devices under extreme conditions could overcome the need for greater efficiency, according to Vosgueritchian. “We believe that all-carbon solar cells could be used in extreme environments, such as at high temperatures or at high physical stress,” he said. “But obviously we want the highest efficiency possible and are working on ways to improve our device.”
“Photovoltaics will definitely be a very important source of power that we will tap into in the future,” Bao said. “We have a lot of available sunlight. We’ve got to figure out some way to use this natural resource that is given to us.”

"There were so many instant internet spoofs making fun of Kellyanne Conway’s   “Bowling Green Massacre” that it’s hard to pick a favorite. Gun to my head, I’d say mine was the Twitter meme that showed a brass plaque dedicated to the names of the poor souls left for dead on Bowling Green’s grassy killing field. It was blank. That’s because there was no massacre there. No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there’s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky. that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump’s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its   as Ms. Conway alleged.) The very fact that you probably know all this means that the “Bowling Green Massacre” may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the “fake news” clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic. The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway’s “alternate facts” with “true facts” (a redundant term that I guess we’re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on   joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth. The Massacre That Wasn’t showed that while Facebook, Google and Twitter take steps to combat nefarious hoaxes, they are already playing host to an organic correction movement led by ordinary users who are crowdsourcing reality. It’s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the “massacre” could be the start of something new. Ms. Conway’s mention of the supposed attack  —   she was trying to justify Mr. Trump’s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries  —   slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar. In this case, the guy was Joe Sonka, a staff writer for the Insider Louisville website. He was having a beer at a bar called the Backdoor when “someone texted me that Conway said something insane,” Mr. Sonka told me. As a reporter  —   and onetime liberal blogger  —   in Kentucky for several years, Mr. Sonka knew what Ms. Conway seemed to be referring to when he went home to check it out. In 2011, the federal authorities arrested two Iraqi refugees who were later given prison sentences  —   one for life and one for 40 years  —   for plotting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq from their new homes in Bowling Green. The episode led to a slowdown in Iraqi immigration as the Obama administration reworked vetting procedures. The authorities never charged the men  —   one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq  —   with planning an attack on American soil. So at 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, Mr. Sonka wrote on Twitter: “@KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees ‘were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.’ (There was no such massacre. )” It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere. “That tweet got 2. 4 million impressions,” Mr. Sonka said. “Pretty crazy. ” There was fast   by Vox, The Washington Post, CNN and Fox News (among many others) on conservative websites including Newsmax and Breitbart and, finally, in multiple references on “Saturday Night Live”  —   the ultimate sign that something has truly broken through. In the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false “facts” might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming. To understand how deep those fears go, just look at how “1984,” by George Orwell, has climbed up the   lists nearly 70 years after its debut. A “1984” stage adaptation is even heading to Broadway. (How about a Hamiltonesque musical: “2 and 2 make 5? Don’t give me that jive! ”) As the New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani put it recently, Orwell’s classic seems “all too familiar,” capturing “a world in which the government insists that reality is not ‘something objective, external, existing in its own right. ’” Mr. Trump renews those fears every time he taps out social media messages like one he posted on Facebook on Thursday complimenting an article about a “ ” travel ban Kuwait was imposing on five nearby countries. As it happens, this was untrue, as even Sputnik International, the Russian   news service that  helped promote the story, acknowledged. Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times “fake news. ” The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as “dishonest” all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods. But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the   work of government. All the accusations of “fake news” and “dishonest media” couldn’t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports  —   or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump’s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it. No one in the administration could disappear the readouts from the president’s tense call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia leaked to The Washington Post. Nor could they reverse the effects of the reporting, some of it in The Times, about the potential business conflicts of his Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, who withdrew his name Friday night because of them. Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because “I misspoke one word. ” (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said “Bowling Green terrorists” rather than “Bowling Green massacre. ”) And Ms. Conway was right when she wrote that “honest mistakes abound. ” After all, The Washington Post admitted over the weekend that several details in a column about internal White House strife over the president’s executive order on immigration were in dispute. A few days before that,   of Detroit walked back a report about a woman who died in Iraq supposedly after Mr. Trump’s new policy blocked her entry to the United States. Yet by the end of the weekend, it was Ms. Conway’s credibility that was receiving the most scrutiny (which she described as unfair and coming from “a lot of the haters” in her interview with Mr. Kurtz). Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday  —   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were “serious questions about her credibility. ” It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term “honest mistakes” can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody  —   including journalists  —   doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic? Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn’t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate    —   and fun. Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like “Never Remember. ” They had made it IRL, or “In Real Life,” which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you."

Tim Flannery is a Professorial Fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, University of Melbourne, and a climate change true believer. According to him “climate changer deniers” are a [threat to our children](https://theconversation.com/the-gloves-are-off-predatory-climate-deniers-are-a-threat-to-our-children-123594).



In this age of rapidly melting glaciers, terrifying megafires and ever more puissant hurricanes, of acidifying and rising oceans, it is hard to believe that any further prod to climate action is needed.



Hurricane activity, as just one example, is currently at an historic low. But don’t let me highlighting some fact less scaremongering stop you. Please continue..



[…] Prime Minister Scott Morrison continues to sing the praises of coal, while members of the government call for subsidies for coal-fired power plants. A few days ago, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor urged that the nation’s old and polluting coal-fired power plants be allowed to run “at full tilt”.



Morrison sounds to me like a good Aussie bloke who wants to see kids warm, well-fed and at school.



In the past, many of us have tolerated such pronouncements as the utterings of idiots – in the true, original Greek meaning of the word as one interested only in their own business. But the climate crisis has now grown so severe that the actions of the denialists have turned predatory: they are now an immediate threat to our children.



Uh, oh. Shit just got real. We “climate deniers” are, drum roll please, a “threat to our children”.



Each year the situation becomes more critical. In 2018, global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 1.7% while the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped by 3.5 parts per million – the largest ever observed increase.



Carbon dioxide is a beneficial trace gas and not a pollutant. Further, there is no evidence that anthropogenic CO2 is significantly warming the planet.



How should Australia’s parents deal with those who labour so joyously to create a world in which a large portion of humanity will perish? As I have become ever more furious at the polluters and denialists, I have come to understand they are threatening my children’s well-being as much as anyone who might seek to harm a child.



Hear that you climate change denialists? You’re as bad as kiddy fiddlers.



On September 20 in Australia and elsewhere, school principals must decide whether they will allow their students to march in the global climate strike in an effort to save themselves from the climate predators in our midst, or force them to stay and study for a future that will not, on current trends, eventuate.



No. School principals must decide whether they are going to teach their students to think critically or allow them to be brainwashed. 



It’s obvious the real threat to our children are climate alarmists. As the brilliant [James Delingpole says](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/09/18/delingpole-fact-checking-alarmist-kids-false-claims-at-climate-crisis-hearing/), if governments did what climate activists are calling for it would cost upwards of $1.5 trillion per year. Yes, that’s per year. In comparison, the War on Drugs costs a paltry $51 billion per year. In other words, climate alarmists are willing to bankrupt our kids’ future to get their way.

"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • A   federal appeals panel voiced skepticism at the U. S. Justice Department’s broad defense of President Trump’s targeted travel ban. While the case seems destined for the Supreme Court, the appeals court may decide to lift a stay that has offered days of reprieve for refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. _____ • Spearheading the battle over the travel ban are the top legal officials in more than a dozen states  —   all Democratic attorneys general. And the fight unexpectedly drew in a voice from China’s judiciary, which in some quarters aspires to the kind of independence Mr. Trump has at times appeared to undercut. “Even if you control the armed forces and have nuclear weapons,” Judge He Fan of the Supreme People’s Court wrote in a blog post, “your dignity has been swept away and you are no different than a villain. ” Above, Mr. Trump meeting with county sheriffs at the White House. _____ • In Washington, the Senate confirmed Mr. Trump’s choice for education secretary, approving the embattled billionaire Betsy DeVos after a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. Today’s episode of our new podcast, The Daily, looks at why she was so controversial and also gauges the level of confusion inside an evolving White House. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ • The Syrian government has systematically executed 5, 000 to 13, 000 people in mass hangings at just one military prison since the start of the uprising against President Bashar   Amnesty International contends. The accounts of torture, deprivation, sham trials and executions that the rights group gathered corroborate numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across the country. _____ • A long crack in Antarctica’s   ice shelf grew 17 miles in two months, according to a research team. In 20 more miles, the crack will reach all the way across the ice shelf in a full break that will create one of the largest icebergs ever recorded  —   and, even more troubling, imperil the buttressing that keeps glaciers from flowing into the ocean. _____ • In Hong Kong, a group of urban explorers uses stealth and drones as they peel back layers of history to forge video archives of the city’s   buildings before they are razed. One admirer, an architecture professor, said the work was “about forcing us to confront the aesthetic of loss. ” •  Offshore wind farms, buoyed by improved technology and protected from complaints by distance, have moved from a fringe investment into the mainstream. • A Syrian refugee who took a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is suing Facebook after the image after showed up in fake news reports linking him to terrorism. • China’s foreign exchange reserves dropped below $3 trillion for the first time since 2011. • The pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi report earnings, as does Japan’s Softbank, which owns Sprint. • Wall Street was higher. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • In Afghanistan, more than a dozen people were killed and many others injured in a suicide bombing near the country’s Supreme Court in Kabul. [The New York Times] • President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines berated more than 200 police officers on national television, calling them “rotten to the core” and ordering them to resign or be shipped off to a terrorist hotbed known for beheadings and police attacks. [The New York Times] • South Korea indicted a former culture minister and a former presidential aide for their roles in drafting a blacklist of dissenting artists. [Reuters] • China’s participation in a Vatican conference on organ trafficking is being criticized. Some doubt that the Chinese government is abiding by its announcement two years ago that it had stopped harvesting organs from executed prisoners. [The New York Times] • Steve Bannon, the chief adviser to President Trump, has cultivated alliances with traditionalists in the Vatican who share his low opinion of Pope Francis. [The New York Times] • Cambodia’s prime minister banned the flag of Taiwan in support of Beijing’s “One China” policy while simultaneously inviting Taiwanese investment. [The Cambodia Daily] • Airline employees are being trained to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking by a nonprofit organization founded by a flight attendant. [The New York Times] • Members of the Irula people of India, renowned for   skills, are helping to stop the spread of Burmese pythons in the Florida Everglades. [BBC] • Slow down for just a moment with your morning coffee or tea and try to be a little more mindful. • After an unplanned pregnancy, this    struggled to be the mother she wanted to be. After going back to school, she’s well on her way. • Recipe of the day: For a meatless midweek dinner, try risotto with smoked mozzarella. • A frog’s saliva, normally 50, 000 times stickier than human saliva, loosens as it speeds toward an insect and then firms back up after it hits  —   a   behavior that explains the frog’s hunting success. • “Dog freaks out on pot” may sound like a stoner comedy or a viral video, but New York veterinarians are treating more and more canines sickened by ingesting marijuana. Gambia’s former President Yahya Jammeh once pledged that he would reign for a billion years. But last month he fled into exile, 22 years after taking power in a coup. His democratically elected successor has since accused Mr. Jammeh, above, of plundering the treasury and fleeing with millions of dollars. A   source of income for Mr. Jammeh, though, had been a   scheme. For years, his government sold residence permits  —   sometimes costing up to $15, 000 apiece  —   to thousands of Chinese millionaires. Why? A special program meant to encourage investment in Hong Kong allowed wealthy Chinese citizens to gain the right to live there if they had permanent residence in another country. As of 2013, some 9, 000 Chinese obtained residence permits for Gambia. The maneuvering went on until 2015, when Hong Kong suspended the program. A review found that many of the people enrolled didn’t eventually settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not Gambia).

UPDATE: I have a “before” picture of the vehicle now, posted below.
UPDATE2: Perhaps storm chasing has reached a tipping point.
Respected Tornado Reseacher And Storm Chaser Among Dead In Oklahoma | FOX17online.com
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. — Family members and members of the storm chasing community are confirming that well-respected tornado researcher and storm chaser Tim Samaras is among the eleven confirmed victims of Friday’s tornado that ripped through El Reno, Oklahoma. Samaras was one of the most well-known and respected tornado researchers in the world and had made many appearances on television shows like the Discovery Channel series Storm Chasers and was a regular contributor to shows on National Geographic.
The day that should change tornado actions and storm chasing forever
Update 9:30 a.m., June 2: We now hear that “veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras; his son, Paul Samaras; and chase partner Carl Young, are among those killed by Friday’s EF-3 tornado in El Reno, OK.”
===============================================================
In the midst of all the tragedy unfolding in Oklahoma, media and storm chasers have been swarming all over the tornado outbreak. I’ve seen this many times in my years in television news: when you are tasked with going live, sometimes common sense gets literally thrown to the wind.

The Weather Channel lost sight of reality today, trying to get close to get the best footage for live coverage, and paid the price. Fortunately, they weren’t killed.  Just last year, the TWC ran this segment by TWC meteorologist Mike Bettes, where he asked:

Mike Bettes’s Open Mike Discussion “Storm Chasers, Have They Gone Too Far?”

And it seems, Mike Bettes doesn’t listen to his own advice. Watch:


From TWC’s report on the incident:
Meteorologist Mike Bettes was chasing the monster rain-wrapped tornado near El Reno, Okla. when he says the storm picked up the heavy chase SUV and threw it an estimated 200 yards.
“We were ahead of the storm. We stopped to broadcast and I saw a large violent wedge tornado,” Bettes said in a live phone interview after he established phone connection after the incident.
“What we were trying to do was just get away from it and get to the south side of it,” Bettes said. “But what ended up happening was all three of our vehicles that we chase with were all hit by it.”
Basically, he put his team so close, he couldn’t get away from it.
And, he should know better. From the videos I’ve seen, this appeared to be a multiple vortice tornado, with a central core surrounded by other vortices (typically 3 or 4). Sometimes these outer vortices are intermittent and invisible.

Trying to dodge multiple vortices in the middle of live TV is of course a recipe for disaster.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere was a time when Germany’s power was mostly generated by the traditional sources of coal, nuclear, oil, natural gas and hydro. These sources were reliable and keeping the power grid under control was a routine matter. Germany’s power grid was among the most stable worldwide. But then came Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, and with it the very volatile sources of sun and wind.
As a result, today’s German power grid has become a precarious balancing act, and keeping it from collapsing under the load of wild fluctuations has become a real challenge. At the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here, Dr. Klaus Peter Krause writes a piece titled: Always on the brink of a widespread blackouts, where he writes how and why Germany’s power grid has become extremely vulnerable:
Already 3500 emergency grid interventions per year – According to the TAB report of 2011: More than a couple days of blackout would be a national catastrophe – Germany sacrifices its uniquely reliable power supply for the ‘transition to renewable energy’.”
One example Krause cites is a recent incident at the Trimet aluminum plant in the industrial city of Essen:
In the last 12 months the German power grid barely averted a collapse twice by shutting down production. The Westfälische Rundschau (here) on 17 September quoted Trimet Chairman Martin Iffert: ‘We are prepared that something like that would happen as a consequence of the transition to renewable energy, however we were surprised that we had to slam on the brakes already two times.’ According to Iffert the power grid had been on the ‘brink of collapse’ shortly after a drop in wind energy.”
Krause writes that the frequency of emergency grid intervention by grid operators has skyrocketed since renewable energies started coming on line, see the chart here depicting the number of times emergency interventions in the German power grid have been taken each year. Before 2006 grid operators rarely had to take action to keep the grid stable. The number of interventions took off in 2008, and has since spiraled uncontrollably.
Krause writes:
Thus the power supply in Germany is no longer secure enough. It is even highly vulnerable. A blackout could occur on any given day. Up to now they have been successful at averting grid collapses by taking lightning speed action, but the number of emergencies has increased massively and is still rising.”
The instability of the German power grid was even confirmed by Jochen Homann, President of the Bundesnetzagentur, as quoted by German national daily FAZ on 25 June 2014:
Due to the shutdown of the nuclear power plants [in the wake of Fukushima] and the installation of renewable energy generation, the existing power grid is however under considerably more stress. The transmission network operators, who are responsible for the functioning grid operation, must intervene in the use of the grid far more often in order to ensure the stable operation of the grid.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Krause then explains that the power-consumer protection agency NAEB wrote in a recent member newsletter of volatile power, and how Germany had once acted as a pillar of stability for the overall European-wide power network. “This stability is being sacrificed for no urgent reason and irresponsibly for the sake of the transition to renewable energy, whereby the damage will impact even all of Europe.”
Just how serious the implications of Germany’s unstable power grid are is poignantly described by a German government-commissioned report (TAB, no. 17/5672) of 27 April 2011, where the chance of a massive blackout can no longer be excluded. The summary of the report writes:
Because of the complete proliferation of electrically powered devices in the living and working world, the consequences of a widespread and long-lasting power outage would accumulate to a level of damage of considerable quality. Impacted would be critical infrastructure, and a collapse of the entire society would hardly be preventable.“
Krause writes that just how precarious the situation has become is almost unknown to citizens, and so many are ill-prepared.
He adds that even a power outage of even several hours or a day would cause massive disruptions and paralyze the public transportation of persons and goods, stranding tens of thousands, and blocking fire and medical rescue services, especially in urban areas. Gas stations would be out of order and fuel would thus be lacking. And because of today’s just-in-time supply chains, food at supermarkets would disappear very quickly.
Granted, Krause writes, that the chances of a big blackout are small, but warns the chances are growing and becoming a real threat. “Because of the ‘increase in decentralized and stochiastic power feed-in’, the risk of a grid failure and higher outage rates in on the rise. Here wind and solar energy are meant“.
Moreover, experts say that the German power grid is more vulnerable than ever to storms, snow, ice, criminal activity, terrorism, or just plain human error. All the vulnerability is due to a recklessly applied disorganized renewable energy policy. Krause summarizes:
Germany, like all modern industrial countries is highly vulnerable to possible power outages. But with its energy policy, Germany’s leadership is increasing the risk, without any urgent reason, in a wanton irresponsible manner.”
Finally, Steffen Hentrich, of the Liberalen Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann Foundation for Liberty wrote one year ago (here):
It’s no longer a secret that the almost unbridled expansion of so-called renewable energies in the context of a technically and economically overloaded power grid will become a risk for the power supply stability in Germany, and increasingly for our European neighbors.”

The North Korean decarbonized zone. NASA photo taken by the International Space Station (ISS), acquired January 30, 2014.
Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) took the above shown night image of the Korean Peninsula.
NASA writes that the light emission from North Korean capital Pyongyang is equivalent to the smaller towns in South Korea and that differences are illustrated in per capita power consumption in the two countries, with South Korea at 10,162 kilowatt hours and North Korea at a resp0nsible 739 kilowatt hours.
It’s time for the global warming alarmists to nominate North Korea for the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, with all the worldwide conferences and jet-setting, the carbon footprint on the planet by 2007 Nobel Peace prize winners Al Gore and the IPCC, and all the delegates globally, probably exceeds that of the entire North Korean country.

NOTE: see video below, where you can watch the entire 2012 hurricane season on satellite time-lapse, way cool. – Anthony

Busy 2012 hurricane season continues decades-long high activity era in the Atlantic
Four U.S. land-falling storms include devastating Sandy and Isaac
November 30 marks the end of the 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season, one that produced 19 named storms, of which 10 became hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The number of named storms is well above the average of 12. The number of hurricanes is also above the average of six, but the number of major hurricanes is below the average of three.
Based on the combined number, intensity, and duration of all tropical storms and hurricanes, NOAA classifies the season as above-normal. 2012 was an active year, but not exceptionally so as there were 10 busier years in the last three decades.

This season marks the second consecutive year that the mid-Atlantic and Northeast suffered devastating impacts from a named storm. Sandy, and Irene last year, caused fatalities, injuries, and tremendous destruction from coastal storm surge, heavy rainfall, inland flooding, and wind. Storms struck many parts of the country this year, including tropical storms Beryl and Debby in Florida, Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana, and post-tropical Cyclone Sandy in New Jersey.
“This year proved that it’s wrong to think that only major hurricanes can ruin lives and impact local economies,” said Laura Furgione, acting director of NOAA’s National Weather Service. “We are hopeful that after the 2012 hurricane season, more families and businesses all along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts become more “weather ready” by understanding the risks associated with living near the coastline. Each storm carries a unique set of threats that can be deadly and destructive. Mother Nature reminded us again this year of how important it is to be prepared and vigilant.”
An interesting aspect of the season was its early start, with two tropical storms, Alberto and Beryl, developing in May before the season officially began. Also, this is the seventh consecutive year that no major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5) have hit the United States. The only major hurricane this season was Hurricane Michael, a Category 3 storm that stayed over the open Atlantic.
Several storms this year were short in duration, weak in intensity, and went largely unnoticed by the general public because they stayed out over the Atlantic. A persistent jet stream pattern over the eastern portion of the nation helped steer many of this season’s storms away from the United States. The number of named storms and hurricanes was higher than predicted in NOAA’s pre-season outlook, in large part because El Niño – which likely would have suppressed overall storm activity – never materialized as predicted by many climate models.
Hurricane forecasters remind us that a well-established climate pattern puts us in an ongoing era of high activity for Atlantic hurricanes that began in 1995. Since that time, more than 70 percent of seasons have been above normal, including 2012. Historically, Atlantic high-activity eras have lasted 25 to 40 years, with the previous one occurring from the mid-1930s until 1970. Several inter-related atmospheric and oceanic factors contribute to these high activity years, including warmer Atlantic Ocean temperatures, an enhanced West African monsoon, and reduced vertical wind shear.
NOAA will release its pre-season outlook for the 2013 hurricane season in May.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski, an educated geologist, presents an article today at the online Spiegel explaining how the once highly ballyhooed “97% consensus” claim is in fact deceptive and “a half-truth”: Failed Scientists’ Call To Action at UN Climate Conference: The 97 Percent Trap.
Bojanowski begins by describing how last year even President Obama tweeted the claim, but then adds that the “claimed consensus among scientists is actually something other than what Obama suggests“.
97 scientists “deceiving the public”
And on the latest pre-New York Climate Conference campaign by 97 scientists promoting the idea of consensus, the Spiegel journalist writes that “they are deceiving the public“.
Last year scientists led by John Cook of the University of Queensland published in the journal Environmental Research Letters a study showing that more than 97% of scientists claim global warming is man-made. Bojanowski writes: “They [the scientists] had asked environmental activists at the Internet site ‘Skeptical Science’ to evaluate thousands of climate studies.”
On the results Bojanowski writes that “less than 1% of the studies expressly disputed the impact by man. A good two thirds took no position on the topic – and so were not included.”
No consensus to speak of
Bojanowski blasts the results of the survey, explaining that “the study confirms only a banality: Scientists are for the most part in agreement than man contributes to climate warming. Even hard-nosed critics of climate science do not doubt the physical principle that exhaust from automobiles, factories and power plants warm the air.” He then reminds readers that man’s impact is a side issue, and that the real issue is the extent man has an impact and whether or not the climate warming is a dangerous thing. Here on the real central issues Bojanowski writes there is absolutely no consensus to speak of.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




So why are the 97 scientists trying to produce a different impression? Bojanowski provides an answer:
The public, so the authors justify the idea behind the study, are hesitating to support climate protection because of uncertainty over the consensus among scientists. […] The 97 percent campaign is to ‘strengthen’ the study, the initiators at ‘Skeptical Science’ write.”
Massive criticism from experts worldwide
Critical reaction from other experts came rapidly, Bjoanowski cites Dan Kahan of Yale Law School, who believes the message “promotes the polarization of society“. Also cited is meteorologist Victor Venema of the University of Bonn, who wrote that “‘consensus’ is in itself uncomfortable to many scientists.”
Bojanowski also puts Georgia Tech professor Judith Curry down as a harsh critic of the Cook study asl well. Curry calls the nature of such a survey “senseless”.
Also Richard Tol is cited in the Spiegel article. Bojanowski writes:
Richard Tol of the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin aims methodical criticism at Cook’s study: The evaluated climate studies were haphazardly selected. And whether or not the people evaluating the studies worked reliably was not tested. ‘People who want to argue that climate researchers are secretive and incompetent,’ says Tol polemically, ‘only have to point to the 97% consensus paper’.”
Bojanowski ends the piece with a shot of sarcasm, telling readers that “the Environmental Research Letters, which published the paper, was impressed by the Cook study. They selected it “best article of 2013“.

**_Congress and state lawmakers (and where appropriate, the president and executive branch law enforcement officials) should_**



• review existing law with an eye toward rolling back overcriminalization and replacing criminal penalties with civil sanctions where feasible;  
• enact reforms such as the model Criminal Intent Protection Act to bolster recognition of _mens rea_ (punishment should ordinarily require a guilty state of mind, not inadvertent noncompliance) as well as the related _mistake of law defense_ in criminal law;  
• codify the common law rule of lenity (ambiguity in law should be resolved against finding guilt), as Texas joined other states in doing in 2015;  
• devise safe harbor provisions that enable economic actors to avoid criminal liability by behaving reasonably and in intended compliance with the law;  
• limit agency discretion to create new crimes without an act of the legislature;  
• enact guidelines to strengthen judicial oversight of deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements (explicit court approval, not the unilateral say‐​so of government prosecutors, should be required for appointment of corporate monitors or the extension of time under supervision);  
• enact asset forfeiture reforms such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner’s (R-WI) Due Process Act, including requiring that conviction be a prerequisite for forfeiture;  
• review and, where appropriate, reduce or coordinate per‐​offense fines and sanctions to avoid levying penalties disproportionate to the gravity of misconduct;  
• prohibit, as a proposed New Mexico law would do, the allocation of settlement moneys (cy pres) to charities, nonprofits, or advocacy groups not themselves injured;  
• assign penalties, forfeitures, and settlement proceeds to the public treasury or, where appropriate in certain cases, to private parties who can show specific individual injury from the offense (penalties should not fund particular government agencies in ways that incentivize zealous enforcement or insulate the agencies from appropriations oversight);  
• prohibit the payment of public lawyers and forensics experts on contingency, that is, in ways dependent on case outcome or the magnitude of penalties (this principle should apply alike to career prosecutors, other staff public lawyers, experts, and outside law firms); existing contingency arrangements should be terminated;) and  
• impose transparent principles of selection and payment on outside contracting for legal services.



“The increasing criminalization of corporate behavior in America,” noted _The Economist_ in 2014, “is bad for the rule of law and for capitalism.” In fact, the British weekly noted, prosecution as a means of regulating business in the United States has become “an extortion racket… . The formula is simple: find a large company that may (or may not) have done something wrong; threaten its managers with commercial ruin, preferably with criminal charges; force them to use their shareholders’ money to pay an enormous fine to drop the charges in a secret settlement (so nobody can check the details). Then repeat with another large company… .



“Perhaps the most destructive part of it all is the secrecy and opacity. The public never finds out the full facts of the case, nor discovers which specific people — with souls and bodies — were to blame. Since the cases never go to court, precedent is not established, so it is unclear what exactly is illegal. That enables future shakedowns, but hurts the rule of law and imposes enormous costs.”



Many abuses arise from prosecutors’ search for publicity and glory. These include splashy raids on offices and “perp walks” for executives, in situations where a simple request to cooperate would have sufficed, and manipulation of the media through leaks and prejudicial publicity.



The most natural way to address prosecutorial abuse might seem to be disciplinary sanctions based on traditional standards of legal ethics and applied by judges or bar panels. The trouble with relying on that solution is that few prosecutions of large businesses eventuate in trial before a judge. When a business does put up a fight, it sometimes wins big. In 2016, after the Department of Justice (DoJ) indicted the FedEx Corporation on charges that it had knowingly done business with illegal pharmacies, FedEx refused to settle; once before a judge, DoJ’s case collapsed in spectacular fashion and it dropped the charges midtrial. Much more often, however, businesses faced with a doubtful or overreaching prosecution take their lawyers’ advice and fold their hands and try to get the best possible settlement. For businesses based on trust or regulatory permission, the costs and risks of defying federal law enforcement — legal, reputational, and otherwise — are just too high. The government has the upper hand. That is one reason lawmakers need to step in.



There are now more than 4,000 federal criminal offenses, up from approximately 165 in 1900, 2,000 in 1970, and 3,000 in 1982, along with hundreds of thousands of regulations backed up by criminal sanction.



Under the rule of law, citizens should be able to arrange their actions so as to avoid the commission of crimes. Yet the proliferation of highly technical laws, many going beyond the prohibition of intrinsically wrongful acts, makes it more likely that even a careful business with thousands of employees will commit some violations — especially if criminal infraction of regulations can be assessed without reference to _mens rea_ (i.e., guilty intent).



As Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has written, “Congress should enact legislation that requires the government to prove the defendant knowingly violated the law — or that, at least, allows a ‘mistake of law’ defense — for certain classes of crimes that have no analog in the common law or that no reasonable person would understand to be inherently wrong. Where the government has criminalized non‐​blameworthy conduct for regulatory purposes, ignorance of the law should be a valid defense to criminal liability.”



• “When I got there, there were people in SWAT attire that evacuated our entire factory.” Thirty federal agents raided the headquarters of Nashville’s legendary Gibson Guitar, carting away a fortune in wood and instruments and interrogating staff without benefit of a lawyer. The charge was that the company had used small quantities of imported wood without doing enough to ascertain suppliers’ compliance with a federal law called the Lacey Act. Gibson’s chief executive officer — who “had not received so much as a postcard telling the company it might be doing something wrong” — got a letter the next day warning him that if he so much as touched any guitar left in the plant he could be charged with a separate federal offense, with possible jail time, for each “violation.” After much press coverage sympathetic to the company, the feds settled for a relatively low $300,000, a sum far below what Gibson would have been likely to pay in legal defense, and returned the seized instruments.  
• The federal government extracted more than a billion dollars from Toyota in a settlement, even though its own engineers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cleared the Japanese automaker of charges that its cars were subject to runaway acceleration. The penalties were mostly premised on minor regulatory infractions unrelated to any injuries or accidents. The Department of Justice’s press announcement employed language suggesting that the problem of mechanical acceleration had been real, though Washington had good reason to know better.  
• The federal government and various states, notably New York, launched enforcement actions against major banks whose actions, it was alleged, had helped propel the mortgage bubble and crash of 2008. No one really knew, and no court ever decided, whether the charges were true or what a suitable penalty level might be. When the dust settled, major banks had agreed to pay record settlements, some going to investors and consumers, but with hundreds of millions also going to nonprofit organizations that the various law enforcement officials saw as worthy causes — which, in the case of the Obama administration and the attorney general of New York, happened also to be close political allies.  
• Several small family‐​owned retailers, including a Maryland dairy farm, a Detroit‐​area grocery, and a North Carolina convenience store, violated the little‐​known federal “structuring” law, which prohibits depositing money into banks in sums under $10,000 so as not to trigger a paperwork filing to the government, even when no tax or other laws are being evaded in the process. Federal agents seized the families’ bank accounts. With volunteer legal help, and amid public outcry, all three businesses managed to get their money back. But many other small businesses swept up by the same law, sometimes unable to pay lawyers because of the freeze on their assets, had by that time capitulated to large forfeitures.



The situation is even worse when laws are so vague that even reading them does not give fair notice of what they prohibit. Courts are inconsistent about applying the “rule of lenity” (ambiguities should be resolved against finding guilt) and the “void for vagueness doctrine” (laws can fail constitutional muster if they leave too much doubt about what they prohibit). As a result, certain areas — including federal mail and wire fraud, “honest services” fraud, antitrust law, and securities law — have proved particularly resistant to clarification.



In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice has also sought to expand something called the “responsible corporate officer doctrine.” That doctrine allows the government to hold executives criminally liable for the sins of the corporation generally, even when those executives have not been shown to personally hold a guilty state of mind. Although the doctrine somehow passed muster at the U.S. Supreme Court in the cases of _United States v. Dotterweich_ (1943) and _United States v. Park_ (1975), it is ripe with potential for injustice.



Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) and their close relatives, nonprosecution agreements (NPAs), have become a major tool of white‐​collar prosecution in recent years. Typically, in exchange for avoiding trial, a business defendant agrees to some combination of cash payment, agreement to change behavior, and submission to future oversight by DoJ. Often, DoJ assigns “monitors” with broad, vaguely defined powers to oversee the affairs of defendant companies and report back to Washington on an ongoing basis.



NPAs at the federal level date back only to 1992. But they have multiplied rapidly, from 1 or 2 a year in the nineties to more than 30 a year during the Obama administration. Since 2010, 16 of the largest U.S. businesses have come under Department of Justice supervision, with tens of billions of dollars extracted in settlements.



Notably, in these agreements, a business defendant may pledge to alter its future course of action in ways that a court would never have ordered had the case gone to trial but that the government is interested in extracting as concessions. These deals may have the effect, or even the aim, of helping or hurting third parties who have the ear of the government, such as customers or competitors of the targeted defendant.



“Without any adjudication to establish wrongdoing and without any judicial oversight, businesses have agreed through these settlements to remove or replace key officers and directors; to change sales, marketing, or compensation plans; and to appoint new officers or independent ‘monitors’ reporting to prosecutors but paid by the companies,” write James Copland and Isaac Gorodetski. The two argue that this process adds up to a “shadow regulatory state” lacking many of the administrative law protections of the visible regulatory state. Appointed monitors, in particular, can wield ill‐​defined but wide‐​ranging power with little accountability if it is put to heavy‐​handed use.



What to do? The United Kingdom took an early lead with its 2013 Crime and Courts Act, which, among other provisions, directs judges to determine that the provisions of DPA equivalents are “fair, reasonable, and proportionate.” In the U.S. Congress, a proposal called the Accountability in Deferred Prosecution Act of 2014 attempted to pursue similar principles. Much more is needed if U.S. law is to catch up with the institutional reality of a Department of Justice that has become the nation’s most powerful business regulator without anyone’s having designed it that way.



At base, the case for civil liberties in the business world is much the same as the case for civil liberties generally. Businesses deserve impartial prosecution in the interests of justice, not merely scoring wins for the government; speedy trial and clear exposition of charges; determination of guilt on an individualized, not group, basis; no excessive punishment; protections against baseless search and seizure; and, in general, the full range of due process protections. The marketplace, like the rest of American society, deserves the full protections of the U.S. Constitution.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
It’s a bad week for poor people around the planet. First, and with great fanfare, our President unleashed his patented climate plan, affectionately known as Obama’s War on Coal™. He hasn’t said yet how much Obama’s War on Coal™ will cost, but we can be sure that it will not be cheap. And as in any war, it is guaranteed that the poor will suffer the most.
Sadly, this was followed by even worse news. The World Bank has decided it wants to keep the developing world from having inexpensive electricity. They will not make any more loans for coal-fired power plants.
You remember “inexpensive electricity”? When I was a kid, the US Government used to be in favor of inexpensive electricity, because it was rightly seen as the savior of the poor farmer and the poor housewife. That’s why the Tennessee Valley Authority came to be. I wash the clothes around our house, and I don’t do it by hand. I have inexpensive energy to do that. Now, however, the government and the environmental NGOs and the climate alarmists are doing every single thing that they can to make energy more expensive. And the World Bank has just officially joined the baying chorus.
The World Bank thinks that inexpensive energy will harm the poor … not now, of course, but in fifty years. And on that basis, the World Bank thinks it is justified to harm the poor now.
This is the madness at the base of the climate alarmists policy—it actively harms the poor now, with the justification that it might help their grandkids avoid harm in 50 years.
The wealthy fat-cats running the World Bank are unwilling for school kids in India to have cheap electricity to study by, on the grounds that it might, not will but might, make those students’ grandkids a bit warmer in a century. I doubt that the poor in India would vote for that plan, but I guess the World Bank is our economic paterfamilias who knows what the poor need, much better than the poor know themselves, and it’s not cheap electricity …
The same thing is going on in the US. Where I live, California, the resident burglars are called the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, known as PGE. They are a monopoly utility, and supposedly they are run for the benefit of the ratepayers.
Now, if you had a monopoly public utility for say water, and your water supplier said they were going to charge twenty times the going price for a glass of water if you were really, really thirsty, would you think that was in the public interest?
That’s exactly what’s happening to Anthony, PGE is gouging him on the price because that’s when he really needs the electricity … what kind of a screwed up world has this become? A public utility is supposed to provide cheap energy, not gouge the customers at the time they really need the electricity.
Now, the East Coast and the Powder River country is going to feel the pain, as coal-fired plants close and their electricity costs start to creep up. So, since war has been declared, let’s see if Obama’s War on Coal™ is worth the billions and billions of dollars it will cost … what are we buying for our money?
Well, fortunately I don’t have to go through all the math to figure it out. There is a strong supporter of the Obama climate plan named Chris Hope, who has done the math for us. His blog says:
Chris is a climate change policy researcher, PAGE model developer, and faculty member at Cambridge Judge Business School, interested in environment and energy.
He has used his whiz-bang model to do the calculations. His assumption is that the US will do the following
1) Lower the CO2 emissions to 83% of the 2008 level over the next seven years, and
2) Maintain that low level of emissions for the succeeding 80 years.
Now, absent a huge technological breakthrough or another depression, there’s little chance of us getting to 83% of 2008 emissions in the next seven years.
But that pales before the improbable idea of the US maintaining that low a level of emissions for the next 80 years.
So to start with, we see that Mr. Hope has made the most hopeful assumptions about the climate plan—first that it will meet its initial goal, and second that it will maintain that goal for over three-quarters of a century.
And with those likely unattainable assumptions, what does Mr. Hope calculate as the effect of Obama’s War on Coal™?
Well … um … well, he says that by the year 2100, nearly a century from now, that the temperatures will be much cooler.
…
How much cooler, you ask?
…
Well … two …
…
Two degrees C?
…
Er … no …
…
Oh … so, it’s two tenths of a degree C, then, not two degrees C?
…
Um … no.
…
I have to confess, in writing this I find that I am very reluctant to reveal the expected outcome of Obama’s War on Coal™ for a simple reason—it is at times like this that I’m embarrassed to be an American.
…
Because the reality is that Chris Hope, an ardent supporter of the War on Coal™, using the most optimistic (and unattainable) assumptions, says that IF we win the War on Coal and we put hundreds of people out of work and increase the cost of electricity for poor and wealthy alike (although obviously, Obama and his rich pals don’t care about the cost increase), here’s our prize. Here’s what Chris Hope says we’ve bought for the all the pain and suffering:
In the year 2100 the world might be 0.02°C cooler.
Two hundredths of a degree in a century. Maybe. That’s the prize. That’s what Chris Hope has proudly announced will be the reward for the job loss and the pain and suffering of the poor.
Two hundredths of a degree of cooling. An amount that is far below our ability to even measure …
Me, I think that that one fact alone should be our emblem and our rallying cry in opposition to this gob-smacking lunacy. So the next time someone says they think the War on Coal™ is a brilliant plan, gently point out to them that they are advocating spending billions and billions of dollars to cool the planet by two hundredths of a degree in the year 2100, and in the process harming the poor … and ask if that strikes them as the most rational of plans …
Or you could just shake them until their teeth rattle and say “You think we should spend billions of dollars to cool the planet two hundredths of a degree a century from now, while hurting the poor today? Have you gone barking mad? Billions for a reward that’s too small to be even measured, while pensioners shiver in fuel poverty? Unhand my wallet, you thieving varlet, and slink back to your hole!”
I swear, this unremitting attempt by Obama and the activists and the environmental NGOs to crush the poor back into their hovels, while they proudly declaim the noblest of motives, turns my stomach and threatens to fair unhinge my reason … how can they do that?
Billions and billions of dollars for two hundredths of a degree … bad news, folks, the Emperor not only has no clothes. He’s lost his mind entirely.
Grrrrr, bad for my blood pressure … in any case, here’s what coal did while Obama was declaring war on it …

From Penn State
English: Ozone Depletion comparison in North America from 1984-1997. Contrary to popular belief, the Ozone depletion does not affect exclusively the south pole. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Depletion of Antarctic ozone is a more important factor than increasing greenhouse gases in shifting the Southern Hemisphere jet stream in a southward direction, according to researchers at Penn State.
“Previous research suggests that this southward shift in the jet stream has contributed to changes in ocean circulation patterns and precipitation patterns in the Southern Hemisphere, both of which can have important impacts on people’s livelihoods,” said Sukyoung Lee, professor of meteorology.

According to Lee, based on modeling studies, both ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increase are thought to have contributed to the southward shift of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream, with the former having a greater impact. B, but until now, no one has been able to determine the extent to which each of these two forcings has contributed to the shift using observational data.
“Understanding the differences between these two forcings is important in predicting what will happen as the ozone hole recovers,” she said. “The jet stream is expected to shift back toward the north as ozone is replenished, yet the greenhouse-gas effect could negate this.” Lee and her colleague, Steven Feldstein, professor of meteorology, developed a new method to distinguish between the effects of the two forcings. The method uses a cluster analysis to investigate the effects of ozone and greenhouse gas on several different observed wind patterns.
“When most people look at ozone and greenhouse gases, they focus on one wind pattern, but my previous research suggests that, by looking at several different but similar patterns, you can learn more about what is really happening,” said Feldstein.
In their study, the researchers analyzed four wind patterns. The first wind pattern corresponded to an equatorwarda shift of the midlatitude westerlies toward the equator. T; the second pattern also described an equatorward shift, but included a strong tropical component. T; the third pattern corresponded to a poleward shift of the westerlies toward the South Pole with a weakening in the maximum strength of the jet; and the. The fourth pattern corresponded to a smaller poleward jet shift with a strong tropical component.
In addition to their novel inclusion of more than one wind pattern in their analysis, the scientists investigated the four wind patterns at very short time scales.
“Climate models are usually run for many years; they don’t look at the day-to-day weather,” said Feldstein. “But we learned that the four wind patterns fluctuate over about 10 days, so they change on a time scale that is similar to daily weather. This realization means that by taking into account fluctuations associated with the daily weather, it will be easier to test theories about the mechanism by which ozone and greenhouse gases influence the jet stream.”
The researchers used an algorithm to examine the relationship between daily weather patterns and the four wind patterns. They found that the first wind pattern — which corresponded to an equatorward shift of the midlatitude westerlies — was associated with greenhouse gases. They also found that the third pattern — which corresponded to a poleward shift of the westerlies — was associated with ozone. The other two wind patterns were unrelated to either of the forcings. The researchers found that a long-term decline in the frequency of the first pattern and a long-term increase in the frequency of the third pattern can explain the changes in the Southern Hemisphere jet stream.
“Ozone had the bigger impact on the change in the position of the jet stream,” said Lee. “The opposite is likely true for the Northern Hemisphere; we think that ozone has a limited influence on the Northern Hemisphere. Understanding which of these forcings is most important in certain locations may help policy makers as they begin to plan for the future.”
In addition to finding that ozone is more important than greenhouse gases in influencing the jet-stream shift, the scientists also found evidence for a mechanism by which greenhouse gases influence the jet-stream shift. They learned that greenhouse gases may not directly influence the jet-stream shift, but rather may indirectly influence the shift by changing tropical convection, or the vertical transfer of heat in large-scale cloud systems, which, in turn, influences the jet shift. The researchers currently are further examining this and other possible mechanisms for how greenhouse gases and ozone influence the jet stream as well as Antarctic sea ice.
The results will appear in the Feb. 1 issue of the journal Science.
“Not only are the results of this paper important for better understanding climate change, but this paper is also important because it uses a new approach to try to better understand climate change; it uses observational data on a short time scale to try to look at cause and effect, which is something that is rarely done in climate research,” said Feldstein. “Also, our results are consistent with climate models, so this paper provides support that climate models are performing well at simulating the atmospheric response to ozone and greenhouse gases.”

"BIRMINGHAM, England  —   On Saturday night at the Genting Arena here, a billowing white curtain whipped up and into the ceiling to reveal the singer Ozzy Osbourne, who, for perhaps the last time ever as the frontman of Black Sabbath, plunged into the 1970 song that gave the band its name. The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called “The End,” which the   band has billed as its last performances. After 49 years, the group  —   which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members  —   finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert. “Let’s go crazy,” Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd, adding an expletive early in the concert, before turning in thrashing renditions of the band’s   songs, including “War Pigs,” “Into the Void” and “Iron Man,” and deeper cuts like the instrumental “Rat Salad. ” Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises  —   perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer, Bill Ward, estranged from the group since 2012. But Black Sabbath played it straight, turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960s and ’70s songs, pretty much unadulterated (but, of course, quite loud). Flanked by the original band members Tony Iommi (on guitar) and Geezer Butler (on bass) and backed by Tommy Clufetos, a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour, Mr. Osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone, undulating back and forth as he sang. There were pyrotechnics for the big numbers, confetti at the end, and at one point a surprise volley of fireworks onstage. Giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song, and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night. Nearly a   ago, Black Sabbath began as a blues band. It quickly morphed into its own genre. In the band’s early years, its   anthems and vague overtures toward Satanism in its lyrics earned them ridicule from mainstream critics and audiences while mobilizing a growing underground fan base. Mr. Osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living, and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert. But Mr. Osbourne’s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 MTV reality TV show “The Osbournes,” which portrayed him as a lovable, murmuring goofball and family man. And at its closing concert, Black Sabbath seemed pretty mainstream. On Saturday, the crowd was dotted with   fans decked out in    Black Sabbath regalia. But most concertgoers wore their fandom more lightly: One man in a Black Sabbath shirt who declined to give his name said that he worked in financial services in London and read an issue of The Economist in the moments before the lights went down. By the time Mr. Osbourne hit the climax of “Black Sabbath,” the magazine was tucked away and the man was on his feet with his hands raised in the shape of devil’s horns, singing gleefully along to the lyrics: “Satan’s sitting there, he’s   those flames get higher and higher. ” The band has always identified as rough and tumble, alternative, working class and distinctly Birminghamian, so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on Saturday. “Black Sabbath are part of the cultural identity of being in Birmingham,” said Pamela Pinski, 31, who lives and works in the area. Coming to the concert, she added, felt “kind of patriotic to the city,” and like a chance to celebrate “local boys that done good. ” In interviews, the band members have insisted that “The End”  —   which began in Omaha just over a year ago and made stops in Europe, South America and Australia before coming to Britain last month  —   really is their last run. Mr. Iommi, who learned he had cancer several years ago, told Rolling Stone that his “body won’t take it much more. ” And Mr. Osbourne said in a recent interview with the BBC, “This is definitely it. ” Mr. Osbourne has said goodbyes to music before, though, so you could forgive fans for not taking him entirely at his word: In 1992, he went on a farewell tour that he billed as his swan song. Three years later, he was on the road again. Outside the arena, Errol Lynch, 45, was one of several fans who said he thought the band had more in store. “Two years down the line, they’ll say, ‘Let’s put our problem behind us,’” he said, adding that even if the band wouldn’t tour again, “they will do an odd festival. ” Mr. Lynch, originally from Ireland, was in Birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week. (Mr. Osbourne, who has performed with other bands and as a solo act, and who was estranged from Black Sabbath through much of the 1980s and ’90s, has at least one solo date planned for this summer, in Illinois.) Mr. Osbourne had said that he was feeling emotional in the   to Saturday’s concert, but he gave only a fleeting farewell speech, marveling at “what a journey we’ve all had. ” Several times throughout the night he thanked the audience, and at one point he got down on his knees and bowed. When the last song, “Paranoid,” ended, he blew a kiss, took some final bows, then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage. In the arena lobby after the concert, Mike King, 32, who had traveled from San Francisco, said that he ranked the show among Black Sabbath’s better recent performances. “I’m really, really, really going to miss them,” he said, adding, “Once they’re gone, that’s it. ”"
"**The coronavirus pandemic has inspired the latest Christmas film by a man whose John Lewis-inspired festive shorts have gone viral each year.**
A Gift They'll Never Forget tells a touching story of the power of memory and remembering lost loved ones.
It comes two years after creator Phil Beastall's Christmas film, Love is a Gift was watched more than 50m times online.
Mr Beastall said he hopes the new film ""resonates after the year we've had"".
The film shows a mother sending her son a video message to his phone in the future.
The 34-year-old filmmaker, from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, said: ""Many people will have suffered the unfortunate and premature loss of loved ones.
""In our digital age, now's the time to be saving photos, videos, documents and anything of importance in a safe and secure space, before it's too late.""
Mr Beastall said the pandemic led to extra hurdles when it came to making his latest film in November.
""We faced more challenges than normal when trying to capture this film, due to Covid restrictions,"" he explained.
""We were also hit with another national lockdown not long before our first day of filming.
""However, James Whitehill, our producer, did a fantastic job in ensuring that everything stayed on track despite many last-minute changes that had to be made.""
Mr Beastall has said his films were inspired by the John Lewis Christmas adverts.
After Love is a Gift went viral in November 2018, Mr Beastall set up a video production company with his partner.
This led to him directing Lewis Capaldi's video for his single, Someone You Loved, starring Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi.
Made for You, his Christmas 2019 follow-up to After Love is a Gift was also a huge hit online.
Mr Beastall is now head of film and video at smartphone app company Memories Group which commissioned A Gift They'll Never Forget."
"“An idea is a good thing,” Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said on Tuesday, as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another. “But a theme can scare me running away. ” Despite everyone’s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week: Men’s, a unifying theme emerged: the parlous state of current politics. It didn’t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro Gómez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette. Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a   marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House. “It’s hitting people like a dagger in the heart,” the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men’s wear show in years, at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown. Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump’s order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country. “People are in disbelief,” Mr. Varvatos said. “Half the people in my company are from someplace else. ” So, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men’s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation. Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a   American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The   Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America. Even the virtuosic   Raf Simons  —   whose finely calibrated collection of satiny topcoats, boxy jackets and slouchy woolens was shown on Wednesday night  —   has only recently transposed his    label to New York, where he also serves as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Notably, Mr. Simons chose as the locale for his debut on these shores a Gagosian Gallery, which is run by the   art world powerhouse Larry Gagosian, a California native whose grandparents were immigrants from Armenia. It is not only the big guns who can boast of a hyphenated heritage. The Ovadia twins, Ariel and Shimon, moved to Brooklyn from Israel in the early 1990s. The slick show they presented on Tuesday to an audience peppered with   stars and athletes was inspired, as Ariel said backstage, by a soccer obsession they share with their father, a man who got his start in the garment business selling children’s wear from the back of a   Oldsmobile. A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled “Brown Power” and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. “The political moment is hard,” Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation. “But it’s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It’s up to us now to be harder ourselves  —   to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas. ” Ideas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria’s supersize denim trousers, his   coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: “Gender Bender Super Bawl Champions. ” There were Mr. Simons’s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser’s “I ♥ NY” logo. There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called “brand confusion. ” Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the   he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos  —   an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag  —   and confident enough in his taste to wear a   suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy. Barely out of Parsons, Matthew Adams Dolan is already a name to reckon with, largely on the basis of an interest taken in him by a single superfan. “Rihanna’s team saw my senior thesis and called in some things,” Mr. Dolan, a   native, said modestly on Thursday, as a cluster of models slumped on a dais at the P3 studio at Skylight Clarkson North. “She gets photographed in them a lot, I guess,” he added, referring to monster denims that resemble the offspring of a Carhartt jacket and a moving blanket. Mr. Dolan’s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. “My mom was a big quilter, and that’s been a big influence on me,” he said. That Todd Snyder’s brightest ideas are often not original to him is something of which the designer makes no secret. For years, Mr. Snyder has mined thrift stores and the treasure troves maintained by folks like the   wizard Bob Melet for inspiration. As Mr. Snyder made clear in his Thursday show, his design skill lies in taking the   sports jerseys or the weary,   stadium coats he finds and then  —   exploiting his savvy way with fabrics and his tailoring background  —   turning them into covetable stuff like a handsome camel hair overcoat so pilled it looked as though he had skinned a family of teddy bears to create it. The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos’s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. “They want to push out the boundaries,” Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too. With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and     jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback. The best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling  —   just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions. It’s easy enough to guess at the outrage triggered in the mind of an   activist by Mr. Varvatos’s wholesale dispatch of livestock. More challenging, perhaps, is imagining what a traditional male might make of the clothes created by Mr. Palomo. Invited to be a guest of the C. F. D. A. the designer  —   who has generated a lot of press and engendered a small cult following at home  —   brought with him a group of clothes that seemed relatively tame by his standards. It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with   portrait collars or gold lamé with flounces and neck frills or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of   briefs. Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men’s, Mr. Palomo’s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men’s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced   costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, passé."

The German catastrophists-in-a-hurry media already see the earth being beyond the tipping point and every weather anomaly as a sign of human sin.
Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor of Chemistry Fritz Vahrenholt write about a prime example of media climate propaganda that one often finds in catastrophe-obsessed Germany. They write:
Michael Odenwald, who is responsible for the populist climate alarm at the German FOCUS news magazine, has struck again. On June 3, 2014 Odenwald penned the following apocalyptic article at the online Focus:
‘Drought, crop failure, ice melt, greenhouse gas record: Never has so much CO2 been measured
For the first time the concentration of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide has exceeded for an entire month a critical threshold. The consequences are an advancing global warming and the now palpable impacts.’
The 4-page article is chock full climate alarmist ideas. Lots of studies that support the catastrophe theories are listed and cited. But upon closer inspection, almost every single one of the claims is not supported by science. We’ve been through it all in detail, and so it is not necessary to repeat it again. The FOCUS chief editors would be well-advised to have Odenwald’s  articles to first be checked by independent scientists. Of course here we do not mean member of the PIK (Potsdam Institute). When one reads the FOCUS alarm-piece, one gets the uneasy feeling that the PIK scientists may have probably participated in writing the text…
Reading Odenwald’s claim that the 400 ppm level is “a critical threshold” and backs it up with anecdotes, one gets the impression that he thinks we have already gone beyond the point of no return and that CO2 emitted by man is now the sole cause of all bad weather. Years.
What does this tell us about journalism? If you cannot properly analyze anything, thus making you completely useless to do any practical job, then become a journalist.

"**Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol.**
An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer
Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday.
Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday.
Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday.
The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions, including from its own backbenches.
Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday.
That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said.
Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"".
He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here.
""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament.""
Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday.
""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said.
Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"".
Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland.
He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"".
""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said.
""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers.
""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work...
""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion.""
Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules.
""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said.
""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all.
""It's frustrating.""
Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low.
Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later.
Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"".
The petition showed more than 18,000 signatures on Wednesday afternoon.
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol.
""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said.
""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus.""
Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter.
Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK.
Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added.
The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, has called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.
Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme.
The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus.
A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown, after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches.

 _Global Science Report is a weekly feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
The good news keeps coming in about sea level rise—or more precisely, Antarctica’s (minimal) contribution to it. Last time, we reviewed recent scientific findings indicating Antarctica was on the verge of gaining ice mass (and thus acting to draw down global sea level) as a slightly warmer Southern Ocean results in increasing snow accumulation which acts to offset ice loss from its peripheral (marine‐​terminating) glaciers. Without a contribution from Antarctica, alarming visions of a large and rapid sea level rise this century—upwards of a meter (and by some reckoning up to 6 meters)—are pretty much out the door. _Sans_ Antarctica, we are looking at a foot to foot‐​and‐​a‐​half of rise, give or take a few inches. Such an amount will undoubtedly require some adjustment and adaptation, but will not involve a wrenching transformation of society. Most of us probably wouldn’t even notice. Consider that, due to a combination of geology and oceanic warming, this same amount (or more) has been experienced in many East Coast locations in the last 100 years.   
  
  
The good science news may be one reason why global warming has been so absent in the election debates. In response, last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists helped a collection of local government officials and scientists from Florida pen an open letter to the candidates imploring them to address the issue of sea level rise during their third and final debate (held in Boca Raton). They didn’t.   
  
  
It is a good thing that they left the issue alone, for in this week’s _Nature_ magazine comes more evidence that Antarctica is perhaps not going to be the great sea level rise contributor that other research as made it out to be (e.g. Velicogna et al., 2009; Rignot et al., 2011).   
  
  
Matt King, from Newcastle University, and colleagues set out to refine the Antarctic ice mass change calculations that have been performed using data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. GRACE determines how the mass is changing underneath the satellite by measuring temporal variations in the pull of gravity. If the strength of the local gravitational attraction increases over time, then it is inferred that the local mass must be increasing (and vice versa). This is a handy tool for assessing trends in dynamic ice/​snow mass in places like Greenland and Antarctica.   
  
  
But, variations in the ice/​snow burden are not the only thing that can change the gravitational pull observed by the GRACE satellite. The ground underlying the ice and snow may be changing as well. And, in fact, it is. The ground in many places around the world is still adjusting to the burdening and subsequent unburdening from the coming and going of the massive amount of snow and ice from the last ice age (and its termination). This process is known as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).   
  
  
The problem is that while we understand that GIA is taking place, we really don’t precisely know the details, like where, when, and how fast—especially over sparsely monitored and studied places like Antarctica.   
  
  
Two years ago, a study was published that showed that the GIA model used in most GRACE‐​based studies was in error, and that when it was corrected, the rate of calculated ice mass loss from across Antarctica declined by some 40 percent (from ~150 gigatons/​yr to ~87 Gt/​yr). Since it takes about 374 Gt of melted ice to produce 1 millimeter of global sea level rise, these findings indicated that Antarctica was contributing to sea level rise at a rate of about one‐​quarter of a millimeter per year (or about 1 hundredth of an inch per year). We detailed that finding, by Xiaoping Wu and colleagues, in a Cato _Current Wisdom_ article in October of 2010.   
  
  
Now along comes the new study Matt King et al. (2012) that further refines the local GIA over Antarctica. Here is how they did it:   




Here we applied a new GIA model (W12a) to GRACE data to estimate the ice‐​mass balance for 26 independent Antarctic drainage basins from August 2002 to December 2010. The W12a model comprises a glaciologically self‐​consistent ice history constrained to fit data that delimit past ice extent and elevation, and an Earth viscosity model chosen such that GIA predictions from W12a best fit a suite of relative sea‐​level records around Antarctica. The advance of W12a on previous models applied to GRACE data is illustrated by the misfit to GPS uplift rates being halved. Our use of W12a addresses the dominant GRACE‐​related error in previous Antarctic analyses.



With this new model in hand, they were able to produce a new estimate of the rate of ice mass change over Antarctica from 2002 through 2010. That estimate is a loss of only 69 Gt/​yr (+/- 18Gt/​yr). And further, they found no statistically significant change in this rate when averaged over the whole continent—in contrast to other prominent studies (e.g. Rignot et al., 2011) which claimed a significant acceleration was taking place.   
  
  
So King and colleagues’ latest refinement puts the Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise at a rate of about one‐​fifth of a millimeter per year (or in English units, 0.71 inches per century).   
  
  
Without a significantly large acceleration—and recall the King et al. found none—this is something that we can all live with for along time to come.

Earlier this month, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced that it had broken up a ring that smuggled millions of packs of cigarettes from Virginia to New Jersey, where state officials estimate that bootleg cigarettes constitute 40 percent of the market.



“The trafficking of contraband tobacco is all about greed from the enormous profits that can be made by engaging in such criminal activity” said Special Agent in Charge Matthew Horace.



The illicit cigarette trade and the crime that accompanies it have plagued the Garden State for decades. Here’s a question for legislators considering hiking Minnesota’s cigarette tax: What do they think creates this problem?



It is taxes, of course. For years, New Jersey has levied one of the highest cigarette taxes in the country.



Today it is $2.70 per pack, near the level to which State Sen. Carla Nelson and state Rep. Mike Benson, both Republicans, have proposed hiking the Minnesota excise ($2.52).



At this rate, bootleggers would be able to earn more than $1 million on every truckload of cigarettes smuggled into the state.



Like New Jersey, Minnesota has long had problems with cigarette‐​tax evasion. Trouble began shortly after the state enacted its cigarette tax in 1947. Soon smokers began crossing into neighboring states to secure their nicotine fix.



Others began buying tax‐​exempt cigarettes at military bases and on American Indian lands. Still others purchased tax‐​free cigarettes via mail order. More ominously, criminals began to smuggle cigarettes into the state, mixing them into the retail market.



By the mid‐​1950s, official figures show, the sale of legal, tax‐​paid cigarettes had plunged 20 percent below the national level. Frustrated by the inability to collect the taxes due, the state’s chief cigarette tax administrator quipped that “even the attorneys who come into my office are smoking untaxed cigarettes.”



The state government’s response was to increase enforcement and try to discourage consumers from buying tax‐​free cigarettes, but nothing worked. In spite of this, lawmakers repeatedly hiked the tax, and by the mid‐​1970s, Minnesota had one of the highest cigarette excises in the country. Soon illegal cigarettes from as far away as Kentucky and North Carolina were pouring into the state.



Minnesota was far from alone in its battle with the illicit tobacco trade. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, high‐​tax states across the country were inundated with contraband, and in 1975, the federal government released a major report on cigarette bootlegging.



It described the smuggling problem in Minnesota as one of the worst in the country and estimated that nearly 15 percent of the cigarettes consumed in the state were the product of bootlegging.



Commenting on the report, then Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue Arthur Roemer noted that cigarette bootlegging deprived states of millions of dollars in tax revenue, corrupted government officials and encouraged a wide range of criminal activity.



The massive tax evasion and ancillary crime that came with it tempered legislators’ enthusiasm for additional tax hikes for much of the next decade, and by 1985 inflation had effectively lowered the cigarette excise to levels not seen in decades.



This reduced the incentive to evade the tax, and sales of legal cigarettes in Minnesota rose to record levels by mid‐​decade. Unfortunately, lawmakers’ memories are woefully short when it comes to the harmful effects of excessive cigarette taxes.



A series of hikes in the late 1980s and early 1990s raised the tax to 48 cents by 1992. Not surprisingly, taxed sales fell as smuggling and border‐​shopping surged.



The latest series of hikes, which began in 2005, have pushed the per pack tax to $1.58. A 2009 report commissioned by the Department of Revenue found that the state government loses millions of dollars annually to cigarette tax evasion.



These losses do not include those incurred by the private sector, such as those resulting from lost sales and increased thefts.



Nelson and Benson defend their proposal by arguing that the funds raised by hiking the cigarette tax will allow the government to improve education and the business climate in the state.



If such broad public benefit is possible, doesn’t tax equity call for the reliance on a broad‐​based tax — such as one on income, property or sales — rather than one that falls on just a small, relatively low‐​income subset of the population?



The history of cigarette taxation in Minnesota clearly shows that adherence to this simple principle would not only improve fairness, it would go a long way in improving tax administration and respect for the law in the state.

"WASHINGTON  —   Some of the current members of the Supreme Court had written books before they were nominated. Remember “Civil Procedure in Sweden,” by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Or “Regulation and Its Reform,” by Justice Stephen G. Breyer? Perhaps not. But a book by Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, may make a more lasting impression. It is called “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” and it opens a window into Judge Gorsuch’s thinking not only on those topics, which are interesting enough, but also on the relationship between them and abortion. The book, published in 2006, is ambitious, learned, balanced and unusually lucid, at ease in philosophy, law and empirical research. It discusses the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence in detail, but Judge Gorsuch’s goal was not to critique those cases. He asked, rather, whether a constitutional right to abortion necessarily implies a right to assisted suicide and euthanasia. Sure, there are general statements about the value of human life, drawn from what Judge Gorsuch called “secular moral theory. ” “Human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,” he wrote, adding that “the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. ” This led him to support existing laws barring assisted suicide and euthanasia. But that broad statement does not answer the question of whether a fetus is a human life in the sense that Judge Gorsuch meant, or where he stands on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Asked about the book at his 2006 confirmation hearing, after President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal appeals court in Denver, Judge Gorsuch first said that his personal views did not affect his judicial work. “My writings, just to clarify, have been largely in defense of existing law, that is, they are consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in this area and existing law in most places,” he added. “So, I do not think there is actually much tension between my writings and anything that might come before the court. ” That is about right. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that bans on assisted suicide and euthanasia should be retained, based partly on his understanding of the limits of the constitutional logic of the Supreme Court’s abortion decisions. His account of Roe v. Wade, for instance, is straightforward. “Under Roe’s express holding,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “a fetus does not qualify as a person. ” In a footnote, he described a contrary view from a 1986 dissent. Notably, it came from a mentor, Justice Byron R. White, for whom Judge Gorsuch worked as a law clerk in 1993 and 1994. “The right to terminate a pregnancy differs from the right to use contraceptives because the former involves the death of a person while the latter does not,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, describing his old boss’s views. The important point for Judge Gorsuch was that the debate over assisted suicide was different from the one over abortion, as there was no doubt that there was a person involved when suicide was at issue. The task there, he said, was balancing “the interests of those persons who wish to control the timing of their deaths and those vulnerable individuals whose lives may be taken without their consent due to mistake, abuse or pressure in a regime where assisted suicide is legal. ” Judge Gorsuch also worked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy during his clerkship for Justice White, who had by then retired. As it happened, Judge Gorsuch arrived at the Supreme Court soon after another major abortion decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, issued in 1992. In a carefully hedged statement that avoided reliance on firsthand knowledge, though he doubtless had some, Judge Gorsuch described the atmosphere at the court in the wake of the Casey decision. “Rumors persist,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “of considerable acrimony among court members during deliberations in Casey, arising perhaps in part because Justice Kennedy reportedly switched his vote after the court’s conference on the case, thereby altering the outcome in the case. ” The Casey decision is generally said to have reaffirmed Roe’s core holding. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that the decision should be read narrowly, in an apparent attempt to limit its implications for a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia. He acknowledged that the controlling opinion in Casey  —   from Justices Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor and David H. Souter  —   contained sweeping language, and he quoted what he called its “mystery of life” passage, which is generally attributed to Justice Kennedy. “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,” the joint opinion said. But the opinion also relied on a second and narrower ground, saying that respect for precedent  —   stare decisis, in legal Latin  —   required the court to follow Roe. Judge Gorsuch argued that the flowery stuff was an aside. “Usually, though not always, only the narrowest rationale is said to control future courts,” he wrote. “Casey may come to be dominantly read as a stare decisis decision  —   a ruling, in essence, that we must respect the abortion right out of traditional deference to settled law  —   rather than creating any new,   right to ‘define one’s concept of existence,’” Judge Gorsuch wrote. At bottom, then, Judge Gorsuch saw no necessary constitutional connection between a right to abortion and one to assisted suicide or euthanasia. But Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year and whom Judge Gorsuch hopes to replace, said the questions were related, if only because the Constitution was silent about all of them. “We have now determined,” Justice Scalia said in a 2004 speech, “that liberties exist under the federal Constitution  —   the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy  —   which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years. ” He added that his colleagues might be prepared to discover a right to assisted suicide in the Constitution. “We’re not ready to announce that right,” he said, sarcastically. “Check back with us. ”"

When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, pundits were certain that Thomas’s confirmation hearings would focus on his positions on abortion and affirmative action. Although those issues did come up at the hearings, the Democratic senators saved their most probing and hostile questions for the issue of constitutional protection of economic liberty. They grilled Thomas about his professed affinity for the writings of Stephen Macedo of Harvard University and Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago Law School, two exponents of greater judicial protection for economic liberty.[1] And they also asked Thomas narrower, more specific questions, such as: Did he think that minimum‐​wage laws violated the Constitution? Should judicial protection of property rights be expanded at the expense of Congress’ regulatory power? What is the scope of Congress’ power to regulate commerce?



That constitutional protection for economic liberty should have been a major focus of a Supreme Court confirmation hearing in 1991 is an extraordinary development in the history of American constitutional law. During the New Deal era, a liberal Supreme Court reversed dozens of precedents that had restricted the power of government to regulate economic activity. From that time until the late 1970s, there was almost unanimous agreement among legal scholars on both the left and the right that the Supreme Court’s pre‐​New Deal protection of economic liberty–stretching back for a century and a half–was a mistake that should never be repeated.



Beginning in the late 1970s, however, a few dedicated legal scholars began to revive the idea that the Constitution limits government power in the economic sphere and that the judiciary should enforce those limits.[2] At first the mainstream legal community ignored the works of those scholars. But as the Reagan Revolution transformed the ideological character of the federal judiciary, the intellectual climate changed as well. Suddenly, scholars who had been dismissed as eccentrics by mainstream legal academia had the attention of the federal bench.[3] Meanwhile, scholarship and discussion relating to economic liberties exploded.



Yet, despite all of that activity, there has been relatively little movement in the courts toward greater protection of economic liberty.[4] The biggest obstacle has been the Supreme Court’s refusal to reconsider the decisions of the last six decades that have eviscerated constitutional protection of economic liberty. Even under the current conservative Court, the best one can say is that things have not deteriorated further. Yet, with the Court’s opinions often focusing on the original intent and plain meaning of the Constitution, there is still hope that economic liberty may once again take its place among the constitutional rights strongly protected by the Constitution.

"SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, Bangladesh Two hundred years ago, the first cholera pandemic emerged from these   mangrove swamps. It began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out. Water loss turns victims ashen their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings. Cholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions. Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine’s “Cholera in Paris” and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice. ” Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life. Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than one billion people are at risk. Now, thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera’s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the   plague is in sight. A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99. 9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades. Just as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W. H. O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. Merely creating that stockpile  —   even of a few million doses  —   profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera, Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W. H. O. said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said. That has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. “More cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,” Dr. Chan said. The treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR, B, in Dhaka. Although Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases. While its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the center’s ground floor is the world’s largest diarrhea hospital. Its vast wards treat 220, 000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day. The ICDDR, B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that era’s “soft diplomacy. ” Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America. The wards, which in the rainy season extend into   tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of “cholera cots. ” On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup. Defying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with. Patients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in  —   limp, dehydrated and barely conscious  —   by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds. It contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics, the patient is usually fine. Within hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR, B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade. Usually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil. Only about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, salmonella or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death. “I thought I was dying,” Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt    printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse. Now, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana. “His stool is changing from   to green, so he is recovering,” said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose. Mr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a. m. a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. “Usually I drink safe water, filtered water,” he explained. “But I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this. ” Cholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak. Vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the well’s pump handle. Because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine. Now they have one. Injected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR, B confirmed that. In the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid. Transporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses. In 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR, B, obliged. “This isn’t an elegant vaccine  —   it’s just a bunch of killed cells, technology that’s been around since Louis Pasteur,” said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR, B’s executive director. He and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnam’s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70, 000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective. Although his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgren’s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously. In 1997, Vietnam became the first  —   and thus far, only  —   country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to a 2014 study, and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily. But Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnam’s vaccine factory did not meet W. H. O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine. Because no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in “the valley of death”  —   the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a   version safe for millions. In 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized. “They were literally operating out of a basement then,” he said. “I got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, ‘Here’s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?’ “But without that,” Dr. Clemens continued, “this wouldn’t have seen the light of day. ” With that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dang’s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W. H. O. standards. Rolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W. H. O. The vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and “cholera ward care” was saving many lives  —   when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haiti’s explosive outbreak in 2010. The “valley of death” lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The impasse was broken only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly berating the W. H. O. for not moving faster. The agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, an emergency stockpile was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses. The vaccine is now used in Haiti, and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015. And later this year, Bangladesh  —   where it all began  —   hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR, B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses. The world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of history’s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy. With 1. 4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in   countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea. Even Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, has asked: “We actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?” Looking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccine’s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. “We’re probably not bad scientists,” he said, “but we were lousy advocates. “If this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk polio vaccine. ”"

Thanks largely to the Laffer Curve, there are some impressive examples of failed tax increases in countries such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. But if there was a prize for the people who most vociferously resist turning over more of their income to government, the Italians would be the odds-on favorite to win.   
  
When they're not firebombing tax offices to show their displeasure, they're taking to the high seas to escape.   
  
Here are some excerpts from a report in the UK-based Telegraph about runaway yachts. 



Thousands are weighing anchor and fleeing with their gin palaces to quiet corners of the Mediterranean to escape a tax evasion crackdown – part of efforts by the government of Mario Monti, the prime minister, to tackle Italy's €1.9 trillion public debt. ...in the ports and marinas they are going after the owners of luxury yachts. Uniformed officers of the Guardia di Finanza, or tax police, are performing on-the-spot checks, boarding boats and checking owners' details against their tax records. ...The unwelcome attention has led many yacht owners to flee Italy's marinas for friendlier foreign ports, from Corsica and the Cote d'Azur in the west to Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece in the east. Others are heading southwards, to Malta and Tunisia - where they can access their boats on low-cost budget flights from Italy for a fraction of the tax bill they might otherwise face.



Not surprisingly, a lot of middle-class people are suffering because of lost business. 



  


![Media Name: Italian-Yacht.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/Italian-Yacht.jpg?itok=PizFFLVL)



Around 30,000 yachts have fled Italy this year, costing €200 million in lost revenue from mooring fees, port services and fuel sales, according to Assomarinas, the Italian Association of Marinas. ""We've lost 10 to 15 per cent of our regular customers,"" said Roberto Perocchio, the president of Assomarinas. ""This is the worst crisis in Italian boating history. The authorities are using scare tactics and creating a climate of fear."" ...Plans for a further 30,000 new berths have been put on hold. Business is down by more than a third in many marinas, with some half empty compared to last summer. ""We've lost 40 boats in the last few months, all between 20 and 25 metres long,"" said Giovanni Sorci, director of a marina at Rimini, on the Adriatic coast. ""Most went to Slovenia – in fact it is so popular that there's now barely a berth to be had there. ...At Porto Rotondo in Sardinia, Giacomo Pileri, the general manager of a 700-berth marina, said at least 150 boats had fled to nearby Corsica. ...A steep new tax of up to €700 per day on the largest yachts mooring in Italian ports, introduced by the Monti government in December, was watered down in March to exclude foreign-owned boats. But it has further fuelled the exodus of Italian boats abroad.



And it's not just yachts that are being targeted by a revenue-hungry government. Here's a remarkable report from Reuters on what's happened to the luxury car market (h/t: suyts space). 



Italians spooked by rising car taxes and highly publicized tax fraud spot checks cut back their purchases of Fiat's high-end sports car brands Ferrari and Maserati in the first quarter of 2012, an industry body said on Tuesday. Ferrari sales slumped 51.5 percent, in Italy, and Maserati sales plummeted by 70 percent, said Italian car dealers group Federauto in a statement. Prime Minister Mario Monti's government has stepped up its fight on tax evasion with spot checks on supercar drivers, as well as higher taxes on large cars. ""These figures show how the choices made by the government are literally terrorizing potential clients,"" said Federauto chairman Filippo Pavan Bernacchi.



I assume those awful sales numbers are partly because the economy is weak, but well-to-do Italians obviously don't want to attract attention from the tax police.   
  
The moral of the story is that Italy's government should try a new strategy. The politicians need to understand that taxpayers don't meekly acquiesce, like lambs in a slaughterhouse. 





Heck, even the folks at the International Monetary Fund (a crowd not known for rabid free-market sympathies) have acknowledged that excessive taxation is the leading cause of the shadow economy.   
  
So rather than trying to squeeze more blood from an unwilling stone, maybe the Italian government should junk the current tax code and adopt a simple and fair flat tax.   
  
To conclude, here's Part II of the three-part video series on the Laffer Curve, which focuses on historical evidence (including what happened to the yacht market in the U.S. when politicians went after the ""rich"").   




Sort of makes you wonder why politicians never seem to learn from their mistakes - especially when thoughtful people like me give them free lessons about the relationship between tax rates, tax revenue, and taxable income.   
  
P.S. While I'm very happy to defend tax evasion in cases where government is excessive, venal, and/or corrupt, I suspect that Italians would evade even if they lived under a Hong Kong-style fiscal regime. If that ever happened (don't hold your breath), even I wouldn't get upset about crackdowns on yacht owners and Maserati drivers who aren't declaring any income.

"TEHRAN  —   With Iran calibrating how to deal with President Trump, its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, caustically thanked the new American leader on Tuesday for revealing “the true face” of the United States. “We are thankful to this newcomer,” Ayatollah Khamenei told Iranian Air Force commanders, according to a report posted on his official website. Iranian officials had been showing caution since Mr. Trump took office last month. Despite expressing anger at his policies and comments, even   have taken care not to provoke the new American president. But on Tuesday, it became seemingly apparent to Iran’s leaders that Mr. Trump is not easily ignored. After Ayatollah Khamenei spoke out sarcastically about Mr. Trump, others expressed worries. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interview with a local newspaper that he expected “difficult times ahead” for Iran, now that Mr. Trump was in charge. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers, including the United States, by saying that the deal was “ ” for all. But Mr. Trump  —   who has described the nuclear agreement as “really, really bad” but has not made any moves to alter it  —   disparaged Iran again on Twitter, this time in a defense against criticism that he is too close to Russia and its leader, President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump wondered how President Barack Obama could have made a nuclear agreement with Iran, a country Mr. Trump described as “#1 in terror. ” Mr. Trump seemed to be summarizing comments by his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, who on Sunday called Iran the “biggest sponsor of state terrorism. ” Many Iranians have expressed astonishment and ridicule at such assertions, pointing to terrorist groups that despise Iran and the West. First Al Qaeda, responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and more recently the Islamic State, which has been killing thousands in the Middle East and is responsible for committing and inspiring attacks in Europe and the United States. “Trump is trying to corner Iran, to make us bow before the U. S. and change our behavior, or face confrontation,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a political activist close to Mr. Rouhani’s government. Mr. Trump included Iran on  a list of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the United States under an executive order that has been blocked, for now, in the American court system. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Tehran last week that it had been put “on notice” after an Iranian missile test. Washington imposed new economic sanctions on 25 people and entities after the missile launch, which Mr. Flynn said had violated a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution approved after the United States and other world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Iran has asserted that its missile tests do not violate that resolution and fall within its rights to  . In another possible move against Iran, Mr. Trump’s advisers are debating an order intended to designate its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, according to current and former officials in the United States briefed on the deliberations. For Ayatollah Khamenei, Mr. Trump’s ascent appears to have vindicated many suspicions harbored by the Iranian leader, who has said many times that the United States cannot be trusted. “He has proven what we have been saying for more than 30 years  —   we would always speak about the political, economic, moral and social corruption in the U. S. administration  —   this man revealed it during the election campaign and since then,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to a translated text of the speech. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran’s leaders, said Mr. Trump’s “threatening and ranting” style reflected a miscalculation of Iran’s power. “He will soon realize Iran will not be intimidated,” Mr. Taraghi said. The history of animosity between both countries is long and deep. Several American administrations, including Mr. Obama’s, have argued for years that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, because of its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the United States regards as terrorist organizations. Iran has also been held responsible by the United States for several terror attacks, most decades ago. One of them, of course, was the seizure of 54 members of the American Embassy staff in Tehran for 444 days during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Iran also has been accused of involvement in a 1983 bomb attack at a Marines barracks in Lebanon, where 241 service personnel died. In 2003, a federal judge ruled that Hezbollah carried out the attack at the behest of Iran. Several judges have ordered Iran to pay billions of dollars in damages. Iran denies the accusations. Iran has pressed several claims against the United States. Iran holds the United States responsible for having supported Saddam Hussein with intelligence, funds and weapons after he attacked Iran in 1980, dragging both countries into a   war where thousands of Iranians and Iraqis died. In 1988, an American naval vessel, the Vincennes, shot down an Iran Air commercial plane, flying over the Persian Gulf to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people aboard died. Iran called the attack deliberate and the United States called it a mistake. Under a settlement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the United States offered no apologies and was ordered to pay around $60 million in damages to families of the victims. Some of Mr. Trump’s top aides apparently view Iran and its clerical leaders as a leading source of evil. During his inaugural speech, Mr. Trump vowed to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. ” At the time, many thought he meant the Islamic State, but in books and speeches both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Mattis said Iran was radically Islamic and described the country as the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said: “Iran is playing with fire  —   they don’t appreciate how ‘kind’ President Obama was to them. Not me!” Ayatollah Khamenei responded to Mr. Trump’s Friday posting in biting fashion with his own remarks on Twitter. “Iran should’ve appreciated Obama!” he wrote, adding, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State: “How come? Appreciate him for #DAESH, war in Iraq Syria or public support for 2009 unrest?” In a   post, he said that Iranians would hold a rally on Friday, the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, to show “their position toward threats. ”"

Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, said Thomas Jefferson, and that includes religious freedom. Religious persecution is tragically common abroad.



While members of all faiths are sometimes at risk somewhere, Christians are constantly victimized almost everywhere. And in many of these cases the threat is violence, imprisonment, and even death. Martyrdom apparently is more common today than during Roman times.



The California‐​based group Open Doors has released its latestWorld Watch List of the 50 worst persecutors of Christians around the globe. A Baker’s Dozen are communist or former communist states, led by North Korea. An incredible 38 are Muslim, including several of Washington’s allies. (Seven are both communist/​former communist and Islamic, truly a toxic combination.) The other six are a potpourri — Hindu India, Buddhist Burma and Bhutan, conflict‐​ridden Colombia, and Eritrea and Ethiopia, which are both repressive and religiously divided.



Topping the World Watch List is the so‐​called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which leads any parade of the world’s repressive, impoverished, or just plain awful places. Explains Open Doors: “Defiantly Communist in the Stalinist style, a bizarre quasi‐​religion was built around the founder of the country, Kim Il Sung. Anyone with ‘another god’ is automatically persecuted, which is why the 200,000–400,000 Christians in this country must remain deeply underground.” At least a quarter of them may be confined to labor camps.



Number two is Afghanistan, where Americans and Europeans continue to die trying to create a Western‐​style liberal democracy. The status of Christians continues to decline. Reports Open Doors: “Despite having signed all international agreements designed to protect the freedom of religion, the government in the current setting is not even able to guarantee the most basic tenants of this right.” To the contrary, mobs cheerfully murder Americans and other non‐​Muslims when copies of the Koran are accidentally burned.



Another “friend” of Washington, Saudi Arabia, is number three. “Religious freedom does not exist in this heartland of Islam where citizens are only allowed to adhere to one religion,” notes Open Doors: “Apostasy — conversion to another religion — is punishable by death if the accused does not recant.” Of course, the Saudi royals live licentiously when abroad while posing as defenders of Islam at home.



Fourth is Somalia, another Muslim land. This area no longer constitutes a traditional nation. Alas, says Open Doors, “The overall persecution situation in Somalia tightened a bit more in the country. The main persecution engine is Islamic extremism.”



Iran, most in the news over fears that it might be developing nuclear weapons, ranks number five. “Religious persecution of certain minorities has intensified in Iran since 2005,” concludes Open Doors, including of Baha’is, Sufi Muslims, and Christians. Indeed, the group adds, “almost all Christian activity is illegal, especially when it occurs in Persian languages.” The regime has publicly denounced the expansion of Christianity, which it blamed on “the enemies of Islam.”



The Maldives comes next at six, a small island nation which simply bans other faiths. States Open Doors: “As every Maldivian citizen has to be Muslim, all deviant religious convictions are strictly forbidden.” Believers must “practice their faith in utmost secrecy, always in fear of being discovered.”



Number seven is Uzbekistan, where “All activities of unregistered churches are strictly forbidden, both inside and outside the churches. Youth activities are forbidden, outreaches are forbidden, seminars and training are forbidden.” Uzbekistan is a Muslim state that spent seven decades under Communism, a tragic mix almost guaranteeing religious persecution.



Also in the news is Yemen, which falls to eight on the World Watch List. Reports Open Doors: “Islam is the state religion and sharia is the source of all legislation. There is some religious freedom for foreigners, but evangelism is prohibited; several expatriate workers were deported in the past for Christian activities. Yemenis who leave Islam may face the death penalty as a result.”



Persecutor number nine is Iraq, a nation nominally liberated with American blood. Unfortunately, the U.S. invasion unleashed civil chaos and conflict which may have consumed 200,000 lives. The Christian community ended up as collateral damage. Explains Open Doors: “A true exodus of Christians is going on in Iraq. Christians are fleeing the country.” And for good reason: “Christian individuals are still being threatened, robbed, raped, or kidnapped and churches attacked.” Moreover, the situation is deteriorating even in Kurdistan, which until recently had been relatively safe for Christians.



Another not‐​so‐​loyal ally, Pakistan, rounds out the negative top ten. “Christians are a beleaguered minority… caught between Islamic militant organizations that routinely target Christians for violence, and an Islamizing culture that makes Christians feel less and less a part of Pakistan,” says Open Doors.



In eleventh place is Eritrea, a religiously mixed state ruled by one of the most viciously repressive governments in the world. Reports Open Doors: “Christians from the evangelical minority are pressurized to change or renounced their religion. They are tortured and forced to revert to the registered denominations. While no Christian has been killed in the last year, five Christians died in prison due to illness.”



Next at twelve comes backward Laos, still ruled by communists in a world in which communism has been largely relegated to academia, requires registration of religious groups, which are then controlled. Open Doors explains that “Other small independent Protestant congregations are under pressure and have been refused recognition. The activities of unrecognized churches are considered illegal by authorities, who detain and arrest their members and leaders under various pretexts.”



Northern Nigeria, which is majority Muslim, puts this important African state at number thirteen. Reports Open Doors: “The main persecution engine in northern Nigeria is Islamic extremism.” A recent rise in deaths caused the organization to raise Nigeria from 23 to 13: “this change highlights the structural process in which social groups firmly linked to a dominating religion (Islam) and government drive each other into a ‘vicious circle’ of suffocating religious minorities (Christians) in the sharia dominated areas of Northern Nigeria.”



At number fourteen is another Islamic African nation, Mauritania. Says Open Doors, “Because of harsh government restrictions, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for Christian missions and Christians in general to operate in the country.” Like other Islamic states, Mauritania “does not include any provision for religious freedom in its constitution, and its laws prohibit conversion to Christian faith. The sentence for apostasy is death,” adds the group.



Another long‐​time persecuting U.S. ally is Egypt, which holds the fifteenth position. For Christians, at least, the Arab Spring has turned into an Arab Winter. Open Doors details the sad tale: “… as the Islamists succeeded in the events following the constitutional referendum, the government was unable to restore necessary law and order.” Violence is increasing and “Persecution of Christians in Egypt is on the rise, with a substantial increase in numbers killed, physically harmed and churches/​houses attacked.”



In recent decades Sudan has been among the most tragic of nations, with more than a million or more people killed in long‐​running domestic conflict. Despite a reduction in fighting, Sudan still comes in at number sixteen on the World Watch List. “The main persecution engine in Sudan is Islamic extremism,” observes Open Doors: “persecution has increased rapidly over the past 12 months.” Moreover, “The number of formally reported killings is limited, but the whole Abyei, South Kordofan and Blue Nile area has seen thousands killed, religion being one factor.”



Next at seventeen is the small Himalayan (and largely Buddhist) country of Bhutan. The new constitutional monarchy is democratizing, with some improvement in the status of Christians. Reports Open Doors: “The church in Bhutan is no longer an underground church, since Christians are allowed to meet in private homes regularly on Sundays without any interference by authorities; Christians in remote villages encounter more difficulties, though.” Moreover, the parliament is debating legislation to criminalize conversions.



At number eighteen is the Islamic and former communist republic of Turkmenistan, where, notes Open Doors, “the tight grip of the authorities on Christians continues.” This state’s repression appears to more reflect Turkmenistan’s communist than Muslim heritage. Alas, “All unregistered religious activity is strictly illegal” and “For native Turkmen communities, being registered is simply impossible, for the others it is difficult.”



Although Vietnam has moved away from doctrinaire communism, it is nineteen on the Open Doors World ranking. The organization explains that “Vietnamese authorities keep a close eye on all Christian activities in the country. Believers face more problems by officials, often being accused of causing ‘social disturbances’, ‘fighting the local government’ or simply ‘subversion.’ Church leaders are carefully monitored.”



Completing the top twenty is Chechnya, formally a republic within the Russian Federation. “The general religious climate in Chechnya has always been Islamic, and the influence of Islam is growing.” The government has discussed implementing sharia law and “Slowly but surely, the country is Islamizing.” Moreover, Muslim converts to Christianity “suffer greatly from government and family oppression.”



The terrible list goes on. Leading the next ten is China, a still nominally communist state where the situation remains mixed — better than during the Maoist era but still repressive. Then comes Qatar, one of the Muslim Gulf sheikdoms, which restricts Christian worship and conversion. Another repressive North African Islamic state, Algeria, follows, where, unfortunately, “oppression of Christians has been constant.” Next is the Islamic island of Comoros, which restricts expatriate worship and punishes Muslims who convert to Christianity.



Azerbaijan is both Islamic and former communist, which leads to persecution of Christians, in this case police raids, imprisonment, and more. In “liberated” but Muslim Libya the situation of Christians has not improved from the Gaddafi era. Islamic Oman restricts Christian worship by expatriates and pressures Christian converts. Islamic Brunei tightly regulates Christians and plans to introduce Islamic criminal law. The situation for Christians has improved somewhat in Morocco, another Muslim North African state, where “the main source of persecution is Muslim fundamentalist influence on the authorities and in society.” Kuwait always has been a fairly liberal Islamic state, but pressure on Christians remain; “the main persecution engines are family and Muslims extremists, and to a lesser extent authorities.”



The next group of ten is: Islamic but nominally secular Turkey, where “various forms of persecution of Christians” nevertheless occur; Hindu India, where “The main persecutors are mobs organized by extremist Hindu organizations”; Buddhist Burma, where the army long has victimized largely Christian ethnic minorities such as the Karen and Kachin; Muslim and former communist Tajikistan, which recently implemented new restrictive church registration laws; Islamic Tunisia, where pressure on Christians has increased since the “Jasmine Revolution”; Muslim but secular Syria, where support of Christians for “the Alawite regime in the past has made them vulnerable to attacks from the opposition”; the Islamic United Arab Emirates, a relatively liberal Gulf sheikdom which nevertheless restricts Christian practices; religiously mixed Ethiopia, where persecution has come from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as well as Islamic extremists; Muslim Djibouti, where family law discriminates against Christians; and Jordan, where Christian proselytism is forbidden and Islamic converts to Christianity continue to suffer.



Bringing up the rear are communist Cuba, former communist and still repressive Belarus, Muslim Indonesia, the Islamic Palestinian Territories, former communist and Islamic Kazakhstan, Muslim Bahrain, democratic and Catholic Colombia (where organized crime targets Christian social reformers), former communist and Islamic Kyrgyzstan, Muslim Bangladesh, and Muslim Indonesia. Christians suffer from a variety of repressions, debilities, pressures, and discriminations in these nations.



Persecution of any religious believer is a moral outrage, a violation of individual conscience and assault on human dignity. But the principle source of religious persecution today is unambiguous: Islam. As Open Doors emphasizes, 38 of 50 persecutors are Muslim. Nine of the top ten and the three largest risers (Northern Nigeria, Egypt, and Sudan) are Muslim. Islamic extremism is the “usual suspect” among persecutors around the world.



The U.S. government should include religious liberty in its dialogue over human rights with other countries. Moreover, as individuals and in community with one another Americans — not just Christians or people of faith, but anyone who believes in human life, dignity, and freedom — should target persecutors and support the persecuted. If nothing else, those persecuted for their faith should not stand alone.

"**There were 223 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales registered in the latest week.**
This is 33 more than the previous week and accounts for 26.3% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
There were 65 deaths across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area - 44 in hospital - in the week to 20 November.
There were 58 deaths in care homes involving Covid-19 - the highest weekly number since mid May.
Eleven of the deaths were in care homes in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), nine in Neath Port Talbot and six in the Vale of Glamorgan.
There were 47 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 38 deaths in Swansea Bay, 21 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 23 in Cardiff and Vale.
There were 21 deaths in Hywel Dda - more than double the figure last week - and eight deaths involving Powys residents, five of them in hospital.
The total weekly deaths is the highest since the start of May.
Meanwhile, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board have reported another 27 deaths related to hospital infections in the last week.
There were eight more deaths in both Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals, and nine at the Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend.
It takes the total number of deaths to 204.
There have been more than 700 cases linked to the outbreaks, although the rise in cases has slowed down.
So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average.
Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a reliable measure of the impact of the pandemic.
In Wales, the number of deaths increased from 742 to 848 in the latest week, which was 195 deaths (29.9%) higher than the five-year average for that week.
Altogether, there have now been a total of 851 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 20 November, making up 24.6% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.
There have been 20 care home deaths in recent weeks in Llangollen but only two deaths in Denbighshire were registered in time for the latest figures.
The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 13 November was 3,464 deaths.
When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,536 deaths up to 20 November.
RCT, with 503 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales so far in the pandemic. Cardiff has had 442 including the latest week.
Ceredigion has the lowest number of deaths but the total rose by eight in a week to 23. Neither Anglesey or Gwynedd had a death registered involving Covid in the most recent week.
The deaths involving Covid include both suspected and confirmed cases and where Covid is a factor - although it is estimated in 90% of cases the virus is the underlying cause of death.
Unlike Public Health Wales' daily reporting of deaths, this also includes deaths in people's homes, all care homes and hospices."
"**Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.**
The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group.
No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement.
And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group.
All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic.
The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough.
The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business.
Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group.
""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said.
""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side.
""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.""
Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit.
He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses.
Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast.
The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman.
But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers.
And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options.
He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy.
As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set.
Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.
Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time.
""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match.""
In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.
The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches.
While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship.
Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday.
""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said.
""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs.""
Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business.
""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members.
Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct.
Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.
Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion.
Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic.
Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March.
The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports.
Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain.
JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year.
Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe alarmists at Skeptical Science put up a “Hiroshima Bomb Heat Clock” claiming that the earth’s climate system has “accumulated” over 2 billion Hiroshima bombs worth of thermonuclear heat since 1998. This heat, they say, will pop out in the future and make us all very sorry.

Image cropped yesterday from Skeptical Science. 
Yet, despite the hundreds of millions of Hiroshima heat bombs, we have seen 0°C of warming in the earth’s atmosphere during the very same period. Comically, despite the 2 billion plus climate ground-zeros, not a single one of them can be found in our atmosphere:

NTZ climate temperature clock. Chart: Wood For Trees. 
So where could all that heat possibly have gone? Why hasn’t the global atmospheric temperature gone up with all that accumulated (trapped) heat?
The answer is that a part of this alleged quantity of heat very likely has not been permanently trapped. A significant part likely has been re-radiated back out into space. Things like that happen when it’s a little warmer. Moreover, much of it probably has been absorbed by the oceans, whose sheer mass has a thermal heat capacity that is 100 times that of the atmosphere. Even SkS acknowledges this here.
The problem is that the SkS bedwetters would like to have us believe that the heat absorbed by the oceans is somehow getting packed in a compact suitcase, is getting transported around below the ocean surface for awhile, and that it will later get suddenly belched out back into the atmosphere almost all at once. This is a story that is either the product of astonishing ignorance or a malevolent desire to deceive.
That’s not the way heat behaves, of course.

Think of it as hot water getting introduced into a bath tub filled with cool water. The heat just doesn’t stay together in a clump and swim around waiting to scald you 30 minutes later, rather it quickly gets distributed via conduction and convection throughout the entire bathtub.
In a similar manner, heat absorbed by the ocean gets distributed around the ocean’s vast volume via convection and thermal conduction as well. It just doesn’t stay clumped together, hide for awhile, and later pop out all at once. It’s very complex and it just doesn’t work the way the SkS horror-storytellers say it does. In fact, none of their stories have turned out to be right so far. According to their fairy tales from ten years ago, the atmosphere was supposed to be some 0.3°C warmer today than it actually is.
2 billion Hiroshima bombs would heat the ocean a mere 0.024°C
So how much would 2 billion Hiroshima bombs heat the entire ocean system if it got more or less uniformly distributed? This is easy to compute. The mass of the ocean is about 1.3 x 10exp24 grams. The energy of 2 billion Hiroshima bombs is approx. 130  x 10exp21 Joules. the specific heat of water is 4.186 Joules/g°C. Thus the 2.1 billion Hiroshima bombs of heat would warm the ocean by approx.:
0.024°C
The range of uncertainty in measuring ocean temperature is far greater. There are lots of zeros involved and hopefully I didn’t lose or gain one or two during the number-crunching. Remember, this is assuming that there really is 2.1 billion bombs of heat accumulated.
What we are talking about here is on the same order of magnitude as someone trying to heat his home with a single cigarette lighter…and hoping none of the heat escapes out of the house!
Of course added heat is not distributed throughout the ocean uniformly, but it is certainly not kept in a tidy little package either. Ocean currents are still very poorly understood.
The Hiroshima heat clock is a gimmick
So why has SkS come up with this somewhat idiotic and reality-remote Hiroshima heat-bomb-clock? It’s a gimmick. It’s to distract the readers from the embarrassment of no global atmospheric warming since their silly clock started counting.
We’ll get our natural ENSO heat releases and absorptions and the corresponding heating and cooling in the atmosphere. But at the same time, any external heat absorbed by the ocean will get distributed with much of it is likely not coming back out for a very long time…and only when the atmosphere cools.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing from alarmists that if we sacrifice by giving up carbon based fuels and bring atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 350 ppm, then we will get nice weather with far fewer extremes – like in the 1930s.
Reader Jimbo however shows that this is all bogus. Now he has compiled a list of extreme weather events occurring in 1936…before 15 billion “Hiroshima bombs worth of heat” were added to the climate system by humans – and at a time when CO2 were well below the “safe level” of 350 ppm.
Recall awhile back we posted Jimbo’s list of extreme weather events for the year 1935 here.

 _The BFD_ has canvased the EV battery disposal problem here:



Dr Woods wants us to build 4.5 windfarms per year. Very fortunately, this is another CoL target that is being comprehensively missed as no one wants to see New Zealand end up looking like France does at the moment. Ugly turbines everywhere, with a maximum of about one in three actually rotating when we visited France last month.



Turbines do not last forever, the life cycle of a modern wind turbine is around 20 to 25 years, so what happens at the end of that lifespan?



You can’t burn the blades, and currently they are not recyclable, so the only option is landfill, something the Greens hate with a passion. But these blades are massive: 50 – 80m long, so not every landfill can handle them. Then there is the tower and the massive concrete foundations to dispose of eventually.



According to Pu Liu and Claire Barlow ( _Waste Management,_ April 2017), there will be 43 million metric tons of blade waste worldwide by 2050, with China possessing 40% of the waste, Europe 25%, the United States 16%, and the rest of the world 19%. The problem of blade disposal, they conclude, is just beginning to emerge as a significant factor for the future.



A 2017 report from researchers Katerin Ramirez-Tejeda, David A. Turcotte, and Sarah Pike ( _New Solutions)_ asserts that “the environmental consequences and health risks are so adverse that the authors warn that if the public learns of this rapidly burgeoning problem, they may be less inclined to favor wind power expansion.”



Ramirez-Tejeda, _et al.,_ added that landfilling turbine waste is especially problematic “because its high resistance to heat, sunlight, and moisture means that it will take hundreds of years to degrade in a landfill environment. The wood and other organic material present in the blades would also end up in landfills, potentially releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other volatile organic compounds to the environment.”



  
Clearly any process to break down the blades, so that they take up less valuable landfill space, will require a significant energy input, further reducing the climate-saving ability of the turbines. Chain-gangs and sledgehammers seem to have fallen out of favour.



Are the costs and hassle (and waste of limited landfill space) of disposing of millions of tons of turbine blades factored into the cost-benefit for any wind project? Will this cost be added to your monthly power bill? 



Ultimately, according to Sarah Lozanova ( _Earth911,_ August 2017), decommissioning wind farms might be [more costly than the construction phase](http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/102458629/DTU_INTL_ENERGY_REP_2014_WIND_91_97.pdf). Indeed, she added, [decommissioning and recycling wind turbines](http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/102458629/DTU_INTL_ENERGY_REP_2014_WIND_91_97.pdf) is a blind spot when considering the total environmental impact of wind energy.

By **Owen Jennings**



Someone called James Renwick (described as a “climate scientist”), managed to get himself on the front page of Granny Herald recently. I’m not sure what a “climate scientist” is. We never used to have such a term – we had geologists, physicists, biologists, chemists, etc.



I think we had a “climate scientist” down the West Coast when I was a kid. Old Harry Watson was the local guru on all things “climate”. He knew if it was going to be a wet summer or a cold winter. He could tell you which week to cut the hay or castrate the lambs. He was always crystal clear, very definite and stuck to his guns. Mind you, predicting a wet summer on the Coast was a pretty sure bet.



But this guy Renwick doesn’t know his job. He is all “ _coulds_ ”. 



It “ _could_ get hotter”. “It _could_ get wetter”. The sea level _could_ rise”. The “Pacific Islands _could_ become uninhabitable”. “New Zealand _could_ become a haven for refugees”.



What wimpish stuff! The Herald called him a Professor. Old Harry leaves Renwick for dead on climate predictions and Harry isn’t a “professor” of anything much, although he does know when the whitebait are running.



What’s the use of “ _could_ ” happen? 



All things “ _could_ ” happen and all things “ _could_ ” not happen. It’s about as useless as it gets. If he is a Professor he should have a list of references to back up his “ _coulds_ ”. That’s what real scientists do.



Come to think of it maybe he got warned off by that guy Hansen, another James – he is one of these professors of climate predictions and he said back in 1998 that New York would be half under water by the year 2000. He should have said “ _could_ be under water”. Kinda safer.



Or maybe it was a warning from that other great Professor – Albert Gore. He even made a movie about all nasty things that were going to happen – no arctic, no polar bears, no snow on Kilimanjaro, no food, no future. Professor James should have told him about “ _could_ ”. But come to think of it, James will probably not ever get a Nobel Prize and a $300 million bank account.



He “ _could_ ” get a job advising _TIME_ magazine though. _TIME_ magazine’s January 31, 1977 cover featured a story: “How to Survive the Coming Ice Age.” It included “facts” such as scientists predicting that Earth’s so-called average temperature _could_ drop by 20 degrees Fahrenheit due to man made global cooling. Dr Murray Mitchell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned readers that “the drop in temperature between 1945 and 1968 had taken us one sixth of the way to the next Ice Age temperature.”



Now _TIME_ have come out with a totally opposite edition – we are all going to a hot hell in a hand basket. They have dropped the “ _could_ ”. They must be right this time for sure. They would have been better to follow James’s lead and add a “ _could_ ” or two again.



Mind you, it could be that Professor James is onto something with his “ _could_ be hotter, _could_ be wetter” meme. The IPCC, a group set up by the UN to inflict global warming on us, gets all antsy about predictions. They are a bit more sophisticated than Kiwi James. They use lofty terms like “low confidence” or “high confidence”. In other words, they haven’t got a clue and their pride won’t let them be nice and clear cut like my old mate from down the Coast. 



One thing for sure old Harry doesn’t have any “models” to go by although he did have a Model T years ago. It was a darn side more reliable than the models Professor James reveres. Even Harry could have told James to “get real” had he seen the models James is relying on. He would have pointed out that when you are already a degree or more out with your predictions (as the models are), it’s time to give up. “You’d be better off coming down the Coast and catching a few eels while I teach you a few facts about what the climate does” Harry would claim.



I guess they forgot about the “ _coulds_ ” when they called it ‘settled science’. If it’s so settled why not say “will”?



As for “catastrophes” – the only real catastrophe we have is something called a Zero Carbon Bill. It’s all about closing down agriculture and planting New Zealand in trees. It’s a catastrophe for rural New Zealand, for rural businesses and for exports. But when you do not know what GDP is why would you worry about exports and productivity? 



And “emergencies”? Yep, we’ve got a bunch of them. Like: China is building 300 coal fired power stations while we grandstand about reducing our 0.17% of world emissions. Chuck a few cockies and rural businesses under the bus so you can crow at the next IPCC meeting.



What about when the ‘local’ closes and I can’t get beer anymore? That’s a real “emergency”.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Orakei Ward**



I’ve lived in this area for several years, in Remuera and Meadowbank for 3 years before moving over to the Shore for work reasons. Returned to this side of the bridge last September, living in St. Johns. Really feels like being back home again.



Incredibly my voting papers are still sitting on the kitchen bench unopened, a change from my usual modus operandi which is to tear them open during the journey from letterbox to door. Couldn’t see the point in opening them until I’ve researched the Council race today and the Local Board contest tomorrow. I don’t know about everyone who follows this guide but I am literally waiting to read my recommendations before voting.



[ **Alan Barraclough**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/who-you-can-vote-for.aspx)– Green Party **$**



It’s not uncommon to see the Green party stand someone in this ward, with the exception of Cameron Brewer’s unopposed win in 2013. I wouldn’t have thought the party viewed Orakei as fertile territory. Interesting side-point from UN is the discovery that lifting people out of poverty has the unexpected consequence of being environmentally beneficial! Once community GDP breaches the US$5000 mark, individuals are sufficiently wealthy to start prioritising environmental improvements in their societies. Perhaps Alan is targeting the guilt-ridden wealthy liberal vote?



Barraclough believes there are more safety improvements that can be made on local roads for protecting children, pedestrians and cyclists. He has mentioned traffic islands along Remuera Road, a stretch that is generally slow and congested throughout the week anyway. Radical-leftists Generation Zero scored Alan Barraclough a B rating (that 75% for competence must have hurt).



Alan’s priorities if elected are:



[ **Mike Padfield**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9cf532ef-47af-494c-8e7d-acf0ecf18797&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)– Better Auckland **$$**



The Better Auckland ticket has Padfield and Carmel Claridge running for Council in Orakei and Maungakiekie-Tamaki respectively. Mike’s approach to city planning is a bit more rigid and narrow minded than his running mate.



Padfield lives in the area, owns a small business and has 20 years of involvement in Council and community issues. This is his second crack at winning Orakei; a tall ask considering the popularity of the incumbent. He was categorically thumped in 2016, finishing behind the Green candidate.



His priority is always Progress not Politics. Like those who cry People Before Profit who are left bereft of profit for the people, Mike will find it tough to make progress if he writes-off the necessary politics to achieve progress.



His biggest passion is enhancing parks, reserves and community facilities and begrudges the perceived ignorance of our neighbourhood by Council, despite the high rates paid in the area. He has a point though if the amount of rates paid was the main determining factor in where it is spent, wealthy local boards would be showered with cash while Otara-Papatoetoe has very little.



He is opposed to any selling off of parks and reserves, a mainstream local body viewpoint even in the very bluest of wards and says High Rise development in every street must stop. I think he is exaggerating a little but Auckland needs to remove the urban boundary to reduce land prices, building up and out. Protecting the property rights of existing home owners is my measure of appropriate development, not whether someone down the road is building a house that looks different to yours.



[ **Desley Simpson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=2bb58ea4-562f-43cc-9908-e5f401a916b0&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)C&R – Communities & Residents[ ****](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=2bb58ea4-562f-43cc-9908-e5f401a916b0&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)**$$$$$**



Simpson is world famous in Orakei and very popular with the locals. She was Chair of Orakei Local Board 2010-16 and succeeded Cameron Brewer as Councillor in 2016.



Desley received a red cross from Auckland Ratepayers Alliance this month for signing their 2016 pledge to keep rate increases capped at 2% but voting for a 3.5% increase onwards from now.



However, Desley claims that she has championed a new ‘Value for Money’ programme producing $260 million savings in the first two years. A Herald reporter questioned these figures on [Simpson’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/desley.simpson/posts/10156669081197709). Simpson doubled down in response to his claim that the Value for Money programme had saved $500k this year. She advised that Value for Money had realised $270m in savings over two years (Orsman claims 10 years) with an additional $69m saved on top this term…



I was somewhat sceptical and asked for evidence of the claims which Simpson provided:



In black and white, Value for Money programme reviews estimate $430 million in savings over ten years with $270 million already achieved. Desley Simpson is Chair of the Quality Advice Working Party, which has achieved a requirement that council agendas now contain headings including financial implications and risks.



I haven’t supported everything Desley has done while on Council. When Eden Park put out the begging bowl to Auckland Council, Desley voted with the majority to grant Eden Park $9.8 million rather than an alternative proposal to loan the money with no interest and no end date, only to be paid should the land be sold. I believe she aligned herself to the wrong side when supporting the implementation of Mayor Goff’s failed bed tax.



However when St.Heliers was under threat of wide-scale chaos being inflicted by Auckland transport on its roads, Simpson stood up for her ward against proposals to remove 40 car parks, build 12 additional raised zebra crossings, new traffic islands and extra cycle lane divisions.



It barely need be mentioned, but I suspect the Queen of the East will reign at least another three years.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You may cast one vote in this FPP contest

Government spending must be cut. The national debt exceeds the annual GDP. Total unfunded liabilities are 14 times as much, more than $200 trillion. Government spending once again must be cut.



Unfortunately, the biggest pots of money have the largest number of dedicated guardians. Interest on the national debt must be paid, unless Uncle Sam is prepared to default, like Greece. Seniors form a phalanx around Social Security and Medicare. Medicaid already ill serves the poor and underpays doctors. The military‐​industrial complex fights as hard for weapons spending today as it did against communism during the Cold War.



About all that’s left is domestic discretionary spending, roughly 15 percent of the budget. Most everyone in Washington talks about freezing or cutting these outlays, but nothing ever happens. Politicians want pork to distribute and interest groups want grants, loans, loan guarantees, tax preferences, and all manner of other privileges funded by government. Whether Republicans or Democrats are in control, the taxpayers’ money continues to be wasted.



Last year the deficit was $1.3 trillion. That means every “discretionary” outlay effectively came from borrowed money. Loans that must be repaid. By taxpayers in a weak economy made permanently smaller by the diversion of otherwise productive resources to political projects.



If Congress doesn’t have the courage to cut even these expenditures, then what hope is there that it will bring the nation back from hundreds of trillions in future overspending?



Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) is a rarity on Capitol Hill, a scourge of the wasteful foolishness which emanates from the Potomac. In his view “perhaps there was no bigger waste of the taxpayers’ money in 2011 than Congress itself.” Lots of people talk about “waste,” but few do anything about it. Sen. Coburn identified 100 really dumb projects and collected them in the “2011 Wastebook: A Guide to Some of the Most Wasteful and Low Priority Government Spending of 2011.” It is a great place to start cutting unnecessary government.



Number one is obvious with the approach of another presidential election. As of November Presidential Election Campaign Fund contained $35.38 million. What could be dumber than forcing the American people to pay for the campaigns and conventions of the very politicians who created today’s mess? At least President Barack Obama is helping to destroy the system by eschewing public funding.



The 99 other examples of waste? The U.S. Agency for International Development (U.S. AID) spent $30 million to spur mango production and sales in Pakistan — and failed utterly. The Air Force spent $14 million to switch three radar stations to wind power; poor planning forced cancellation of one turbine and consideration of the same for the other two. The Federal Aviation Administration devoted $6 million to subsidize air service at small, underused airports.



A federal grant for $765,828 went to — I am not making this up, to quote Dave Barry — bring an International House of Pancakes franchise to Washington, D.C. Although the famed “Bridge to Nowhere” might never be built, Uncle Sam still shelled out $15.3 million in project costs, including a 14‐​minute promotional video, on top of $50 million already absorbed by the Knik Arm Bridge. The Office of Personnel Management sent $120 million to dead federal employees (actually, they probably did less harm than the live ones!).



The Department of Transportation spent $529.689 to create the fourth visitor center around the 54 mile Talimena Scenic Drive between Oklahoma and Arkansas. A check for $113,277 was cut to help the International Center for the History of Electronic Games to preserve “historic” video games. Washington helpfully gave almost $18 million in foreign aid to China — money effectively borrowed from China. The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided a $484,000 grant to build a “Mellow Mushroom Pizza Bakers” restaurant in Texas.



Uncle Sam sent $100,000 to the Washington State Fruit Commission to stage a “celebrity chef fruit promotion road show” in Indonesia. U.S. AID gave $10 million to an arts organization in Pakistan — a country threatened with disintegration — to produce local episodes of Sesame Street. Then there was $150,000 for the American Museum of Magic in Marshall, Michigan. Another HUD grant, this one for $1 million, went to a foreign architectural firm to move its headquarters from Santa Monica to Los Angeles. The federal government cut a check for $550,000 to underwrite a documentary on the impact of rock and roll on the collapse of communism.



The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided a $702,558 grant for the study of the impact of televisions and gas generators on villages in Vietnam. Hawaii’s annual Chocolate Festival collected $48,700 from Washington. People who didn’t own homes, such as children and prisoners, claimed as much as a billion dollars in tax credits for promoting energy efficiency in their homes. The Department of Commerce gave $936,818 to create a web TV soap opera on single moms to spur adoption of broadband.



Michigan received $75,000 to promote Christmas trees and poinsettias. The State Department spent $350,000 to underwrite an arts festival in Venice, Italy. NIH gave the University of Kentucky $175,587 to study the impact of cocaine on the sex drive of Japanese quail. A grant for $2 million went to Washington State’s Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center.



The Department of Agriculture spent $200 million — still not real money in the nation’s capital — to promote industry groups, cooperatives, and corporations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spent $385,005 to survey what bus riders thought of HIV videos. Maine collected $95,000 to purchase iPads for kindergarteners. The Agency for Health Research and Quality spent more than $1 million to get people to visit its website. The National Science Foundation (NSF) used $200,000 to see what the public thinks of politicians and climate change.



The Federal Highway Administration (FHA) gave $916,567 to underwrite horse‐​drawn carriage exhibits and survey shipwrecks in Wisconsin. The Veterans Administration spent $221,540 on a conference on disability ratings. NSF spent $300,000 for tourism podcasts in Alaska. The IRS used $862,000 to store unused furniture and equipment. NSF (again!) spent nearly a half million dollars to study whether people trust Tweets from Twitter. U.S. AID devoted $12 million to help the hapless Pakistanis use less energy.



The Oregon Cheese Guild received $50,400 to promote cheese. HUD gave $168 million, still pocket change in Washington, to the federally chartered Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, deemed unnecessary and duplicative by the Congressional Budget Office. The Agriculture Department, another multiple offender, spent $73,824 to encourage bed and breakfasts to use local produce. New Hampshire’s Museum on the History of Skiing received $86,000.



Fraud and waste in wartime contracting may have cost about $4.4 billion. Now that’s real money!



Uncle Sam spent $111,000 to send brewery experts to conduct classes in China. A grant for $24,632 went for the Milwaukee Public Museum to produce a 3-D virtual mummy unwrapping. NSF (won’t they ever stop?) provided $149,990 for production of a guppy‐​to‐​fish video game. The Department of Agriculture spent $9.49 million on a duplicative program in management of foreign forests which even the White House wants to eliminate. Washington used $697,006 to beautify Las Vegas highways.



The ubiquitous NSF spent $764,825 to study student social networking. The equally wastral Agriculture Department devoted $171,050 for a farm marketing effort in Vermont. The federal government paid $136,555 so teachers could retrace the steps of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. The Energy Department’s $231 million weatherization program was inefficient, wasteful and duplicative.



U.S. AID underwrote a $1.35 million “entrepreneurship initiative” in Barbados. The Coast Guard spent $24,450 on a float in the Mardi Gras. NSF (yet again!) spent $126,242 on a study of campaign websites. Salt Lake City received $150,000 to renovate a carriage house. The Department of Transportation spent $8.3 million to preserve covered bridges. Wine promotion benefited from $62,000 in federal promotional funds. Another $206,214 went to develop games to promote nutrition. Uncle Sam cut a check for $60,000 to count trees in Henderson, Nevada.



More than $22 million went for the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing Program at the CDC, which duplicated similar efforts at the Department of Agriculture. The latter gave $181,966 for Tennessee to develop a smart phone app for special crop producers. NSF provided $300,000 to study the effectiveness of leaders of the European Parliament. A grant for $100,000 went to help the Massachusetts video game industry.



The Department of Defense spent $207 million on a duplicative second engine design for the F-35 fighter. NIH, also a repeat offender, spent $55,382 to study hookah smoking in Jordan. The Department of Homeland Security used $6,279 to purchase Snow Cone ice‐​making machines for emergency services in Michigan. The Agriculture Department, a perpetual waster, gave Oklahoma $93,000 to promote specialty crops. The ever busy NSF devoted $300,000 to developing a dance program to illustrate the origins of matter.



The National Institute for Aging paid researchers $610,908 to survey well‐​being around the world. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) provided $50,000 for a self‐​guided art tour in Wisconsin. The Technology Innovation Program spent $45 million subsidizing the research of numerous large, profit‐​making corporations. The Department of State spent $30,000 to send a New York City dance company to Indonesia. NSF — they never stop! — devoted a half million dollars to studying “information dissemination” on the Web.



The Department of Agriculture spent $12 million on a duplicative energy assistance program which both the Bush and Obama administrations proposed closing. U.S. AID consumed $156,273 celebrating its 50th anniversary of spending lots of money with little positive effect. The Agriculture Department — yet again! — devoted $15 million to repairing privately‐​owned rental property for low income people. The Rural Business Enterprise Grant program gave the Kriemhild Dairy Farms $55,660 to buy a new butter packing machine. NEA provided $50,000 to underwrite an international film festival in San Francisco.



The ever‐​busy NSF gave nearly a half million dollars for a children’s chemistry theater. Some $50 million went for retrofitting diesel engines as part of an Environmental Protection Agency program which even the Obama administration wanted to kill. The Air Force Academy spent $51,474 to construct an outdoor worship center for “earth‐​based” religions. NSF provided $425,642 to study information dissemination and Indian politicians. A Missouri museum collected $300,000 for an exhibit on the history of transportation.



The National Endowment for Humanities paid $159,865 to send 16 university professors to Rome for five weeks. The duplicative Rail Line Relocation Program collected $10.5 million despite President Obama’s attempt to end the outlay. The Department of State used $306,000 to bring European college students to America to learn civic activism. Columbia University collected $606,000 for a study of online dating. Uncle Sam gave $74,470 to a Utah museum to teach puppetry. The Appalachian Regional Commission, one of four “economic development” agencies, spent $68 million despite having no measurable effect on economic development.



NSF, ye gods!, used $198,195 to study what people expect from social media. Washington devoted $25,000 to transcribe a traditional love ballad in the Maldives. U.S. AID, another unrepentant recidivist, spent $15 million in a program permeated by waste and fraud to help Afghan war victims. NIH devoted $592,527 to study why chimpanzees throw objects. NSF used $130,987 to review the use of robots to promote language skills in preschoolers. The Transportation Department gave Louisiana $5.18 million to build the Steamboat Overlook Interpretive Center.



The never idle NSF gave $338,998 for researchers to, I am not making this up, study the impact of women on the Icelandic textile industry. The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering received $50,000 from Washington. The Agriculture Department devoted $742,907 to study using “targeted sheep grazing” against weeds. The Federal Highway Administration gave Washington, D.C. $83,000 to upgrade planter boxes in the median of a major street.



The Treasury Department spent $184 million to keep the paper dollar bill in circulation. NSF gave PBS $130,000 to redesign the website for one of its shows. Nearly half a million dollars went to the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation, which no president has supported since its creation two decades ago, to promote activities “for the benefit of mankind.”



It’s quite a list of silly and frivolous government expenditures. But it is only a small beginning.



Save all the money from killing these programs and America still would be going broke. Much more needs to be cut.



However, Sen. Coburn has provided a good starting point. Legislators of both parties insist that outlays must be reduced. Here is their chance.



If they won’t get rid of ridiculous programs like these, they won’t take on serious programs like Social Security and the Pentagon. And if they won’t do that, then Uncle Sam might as well start filling out his papers to declare bankruptcy.

Karl du Fresne writes about the po-faced, weirdo, wowsers starting to infiltrate our supermarkets while annoying good, normal, meat-eating, Kiwi shoppers:



My wife and I don’t always agree about things – just choosing a paint colour for the bathroom can take months. But we celebrated a moment of instant accord over breakfast recently.



In front of us was a newspaper account of the [black-clad vegan protesters](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/115875483/vegans-anger-st-lukes-countdown-customers-during-meat-aisle-protest) who formed a line in front of the meat shelves in an Auckland supermarket.



Shoppers, who were prevented from buying meat, reportedly lost their patience, lashing out at the protesters.



My wife’s reaction was the same as mine. We agreed that if we’d been there, we probably would have been among those doing the lashing out.



I’d like to see these long, lanky streaks of mobile misery try their protest on somewhere like Te Kuiti. You may be sure that there would be Vegan blood noses running down the aisles of the local Countdown as the no-nonsense rural types take umbrage at the group of urban tossers telling them what they can or can’t eat.



I respect the right of vegans to renounce meat and I’m certainly not insensitive to concerns about inhumane treatment of animals. But protesters are inviting a backlash when they arrogantly assert the right to obstruct people going about their lawful business.



Don’t these Militant activists know that for the very best quality meat you need to treat animals well and kill them quickly? Of course, you don’t need to fight your way past these fools if you [buy your meat directly from The Whale Meat Company](http://www.whalemeat.co.nz) as that way it goes straight to your meat-eating door (possibly delivered by your local Hindu, vegetarian courier driver who is unlikely to steal your meat, especially if it contains sacred cow).



The right to protest is an essential item in the democratic toolkit and one I’ve taken advantage of myself. But I’ve never assumed my beliefs were so sacred that they took precedence over the rights of others – which is why, although I marched against the 1981 Springbok tour, I avoided taking part in protests that tried to prevent fans from getting to matches.



It’s also why I get mad when I see activists trying to bar people from attending political events they disapprove of.



Unfortunately, the thing about zealots is that they become so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that it overrides all other considerations. Thus we are now witnessing the rise of militant veganism, as was evident in the meat section of the Countdown supermarket in the Westfield St Lukes Mall.



Food has been well and truly politicised, and with that has come a rising level of strident militancy – hysteria, almost – and denunciation of anyone who doesn’t fall into line with the “meat is murder” agenda.



It’s all part of the so-called culture war – the clash between traditional liberal values and those promoted by the radical and increasingly assertive authoritarian Left.



Yes, I’d bet a dollar to a knob of goat poo that these vegan numpties are Green voters to a “they”…the “male” ones certainly would barely qualify as men given how much soy they likely ingest.



A significant recent development was the convergence of two of the great secular theologies of our age: **militant veganism and climate change alarmism.**



The two came together in fist-pumping union nine months ago with the publication of a report purporting to link climate change with supposedly unhealthy global food production systems.



There you have it: two moral panics rolled into one – pure gold for the ideologues who endlessly lecture us on the supposed failings of capitalism and Western civilisation.



Published in the British medical journal _The Lancet_ , the report – written by a team headed by Professor Boyd Swinburn of Auckland University, a high priest of wowserism – claimed that food production systems, controlled and manipulated by profit-crazed global business interests, are not only driving climate change, but propelling us toward early graves.



How this squares with statistics showing steady worldwide improvements in life expectancy wasn’t explained, but hey – **why nitpick?**



Nah, let’s nitpick. You see the very report that Karl writes about has been slammed for the wonky piece of political agitprop that it was by none other than the Chief Scientist for the Ministry of Primary Industries.



Swinburn and his accomplices even came up with a fancy new term for this looming apocalypse. They called it a Global Syndemic, or a “synergy of epidemics” interacting with each other to produce “complex sequelae” – a bit of Latin always looks impressive – which ultimately threaten the planet.



There should be no mistaking the purpose of such reports. They are aimed at frightening people into meekly accepting radical changes imposed on us by those who insist they know better.



Neither should there be any doubt about the real target of the reformist zealots.



They may not say it in so many words, but their goal is to dismantle international capitalism. That’s the agenda that underpins almost all the moral crusades currently being waged in Western societies.



  
Part of that crusade includes lawfare against industry and confident opposing voices that challenge their agitprop. One must not dare argue against “the science” is the constant refrain we are beaten with. No matter that the “science” is as weak as a vegan weightlifter.



Karl du Fresne better watch out. Boyd Swinburn doesn’t like being challenged and he likes to lawyer up between his frequent trips around the world proselytising in his battle against “Big Food”. Like climate scientists, he never admits when [he’s been wrong](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11864953) and he’s [never met a tax he doesn’t like](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&biw=2361&bih=1253&ei=1juUXYDXOYWS9QPf3rGgAg&q=boyd+swinburn+tax&oq=boyd+swinburn+tax&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160l3.3764.4802..5934...0.0..0.207.617.2-3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0j33i21.U3PdAPGquG4&ved=0ahUKEwiAmtLw8fzkAhUFSX0KHV9vDCQQ4dUDCAo&uact=5) for the [targets of his opprobrium](http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/early-edition/audio/boyd-swinburn-salt-tax/?region=wellington). 



Karl du Fresne is right, these wowser types are extremely annoying, and wrong.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate scientist Michael Mann’s perception of reality may be formed more by what he desires to see than what he actually sees. For example:
1.)  Despite reams of proxy data and historical records showing that the Earth’s temperature behaved sinusoidally over the last 1000 years, Mann only sees a hockey stick behavior.
2) Despite the Nobel Prize Committee specifically stating that IPCC lead authors were not the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize, Michael Mann saw himself as a Nobel Prize winner.
3. Despite the fact that the Oxburgh report never exonerated Michael Mann, Michael Mann insists it did.
4. Despite the fact that most climate science skeptics get very little or no funding from Big Oil, Michael Mann insists that they get funded generously.
5. Despite Mann’s insistence climate science is settled, never has it been more in dispute.
And on it goes.
Now Mann’s longtime nemesis, Steve McIntyre, writes in his latest post that also the Muir Russell inquiry did not exonerate him, thus contradicting Mann’s claim that it had. What is now appearing is a pattern of Mann possibly confusing reality with his own personal desires of how he wishes things to be.
Yesterday McInytre wrote (my emphasis):

…Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Oxburgh inquiry had no more validity than Mann’s claim to have won a Nobel prize. In today’s post, I’ll continue my series on the “investigations” by showing that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Muir Russell inquiry is equally invalid.
In my most recent post, I showed that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Oxburgh inquiry had no more validity than Mann’s claim to have won a Nobel prize. In today’s post, I’ll continue my series on the “investigations” by showing that Mann’s claim to have been “exonerated” by the Muir Russell inquiry is equally invalid.
In their memoranda supporting their original motions to dismiss, both National Review and CEI had observed (correctly) that the Muir Russell panel had limited their findings to “CRU scientists” and contested Mann’s assertion that the Muir Russell panel had made any findings regarding Mann himself, let alone “exonerated” him.
In Mann’s Reply Memorandum, he vociferously rejected the (correct) assertion that the Muir Russell had not exonerated Mann himself, describing such assertion as merely an attempt to “obfuscate and misrepresent”. Mann supported this bluster with an apparent quotation from the Muir Russell report, but the phrase within the quotation marks does not actually occur within the Muir Russell report.  As shown below, Mann and/or his lawyers subtly altered the quotation to more supportive language.”
Read complete post here.
Again, if Steve McIntyre’s assertions are accurate, and I have little doubt they are, it appears Michael Mann tends to believe and cling to things that he desires to see, and not what is plainly real. This is troubling because Dr. Mann is not alone in struggling with the growing gap between what one wishes to see and what reality plainly is. Today we are witnessing the same exasperation and desperation throughout much of the established climate science community in its dealing with the unexpected 17-year temperature plateau. Many scientists just refuse to see it and insist the temperature is still rising rapidly – elsewhere…somewhere. It’s there, they insist – even if we can’t see it!
Another example are the severe winters and record ice we’ve been seeing. Some insist these are actually signs of warming! Naturally for an objective outside observer, it all looks a bit nutty.
Climate science finds itself in dire psychological circumstances. Therefore, as reality continues unfolding, we should not be surprised if climate science suddenly finds itself having a nervous breakdown. That’s what happens to anyone when reality becomes too much to take.

This is a scathing and revealing comment from another scientist regarding the Marcott et al affair. The context of it all has an odor of hydrogen sulfide about it.

There are a few bad eggs, with the Real Climate mafia being among them, who are exploiting climate science for personal and political gain. Makes the whole effort look bad.
-Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. in a comment (#6) on his blog
The larger posting is also quite interesting where Dr. Pielke suggests that “misconduct” might be an applicable term.
Dr. Pielke writes:
=============================================================


In 1991 the National Research Council proposed what has come to be a widely accepted definition of misconduct in science:

Misconduct in science is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, in proposing, performing, or reporting research. Misconduct in science does not include errors of judgment; errors in the recording, selection, or analysis of data; differences in opinions involving the interpretation of data; or misconduct unrelated to the research process.
Arguments over data and methods are the lifeblood of science, and are not instances of misconduct.
However, here I document the gross misrepresentation of the findings of a recent scientific paper via press release which appears to skirt awfully close to crossing the line into research misconduct, as defined by the NRC. I recommend steps to fix this mess, saving face for all involved, and a chance for this small part of the climate community to take a step back toward unambiguous scientific integrity.
The paper I refer to is by Marcott et al. 2013, published recently in Science. A press release issued by the National Science Foundation, which funded the research, explains the core methodology and key conclusion of the paper as follows (emphasis added):
Peter Clark, an OSU paleoclimatologist and co-author of the Science paper, says that many previous temperature reconstructions were regional and not placed in a global context.
“When you just look at one part of the world, temperature history can be affected by regional climate processes like El Niño or monsoon variations,” says Clark.
“But when you combine data from sites around the world, you can average out those regional anomalies and get a clear sense of the Earth’s global temperature history.”
What that history shows, the researchers say, is that during the last 5,000 years, the Earth on average cooled about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit–until the last 100 years, when it warmed about 1.3 degrees F.
The press release clearly explains that the paper (a) combines data from many sites around the world to create a “temperature reconstruction” which gives a “sense of the Earth’s temperature history,” and (b) “that history shows” a cooling over the past 5000 years, until the last 100 years when all of that cooling was reversed.
The conclusions of the press release were faithfully reported by a wide range of media outlets, and below I survey several of them to illustrate that the content of the press release was accurately reflected in media coverage and, at times, amplified by scientists both involved and not involved with the study.
…
Let me be perfectly clear — I am accusing no one of scientific misconduct. The errors documented here could have been the product of group dynamics, institutional dysfunction, miscommunication, sloppiness or laziness (do note that misconduct can result absent explicit intent). However, what matters most now is how the relevant parties respond to the identification of a clear misrepresentation of a scientific paper by those who should not make such errors.
That response will say a lot about how this small but visible part of the climate community views the importance of scientific integrity.
=============================================================
Read his entire essay here: http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2013/03/fixing-marcott-mess-in-climate-science.html
Given this concession in the recent Marcott et al FAQs:
20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.
It seems there is a lot of walkback to do not only for the people who did the study and pushed the press release, but those who reported on it as if that uptick was valid, when clearly if has been demonstrated to be nothing more than an artifact of statistical methods and data manipulations.
It seems a clear case of noble cause corruption by “the team” for “the cause”. Will the NSF do anything about it? I doubt it, as their herd circling has already begun over at Real Climate. Being institutionalized science, they’ll worry more about how to spin it up and down the climate food chain than to come clean about the issue in my opinion.
Perhaps the best way for regular folks like us to counter the damage done is that anytime Marcott et al is mentioned, to always refer to the Marcott et al graph as this version below, along with the quote from their FAQs since the uptick “is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes”:

I have to wonder, given the fact that Marcott’s thesis paper didn’t contain such an uptick, and then after being welcomed into the “climate syndicate” (or as Pielke Jr. calls them, “Real Climate mafia”) with all of the features, upgrades, and connections that membership provides, maybe this is simply a case of them making young Mr. Marcott an offer he couldn’t refuse.

Stability in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism. Many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs.



The U.S. State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act. Pakistan illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries.



Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights. A national community which refuses to defend those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed beyond its own country’s boundaries.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was reflected in the assassinations of Punjab Governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, a Christian, said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.”



Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers. Taseer’s son was kidnapped in August.



In such an environment, official support for al‐​Qaida and other terrorists should come as no surprise. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from others.



The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. The department noted: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the commission and the department emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Last year Freedom House concluded: “The situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



Even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “The number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make the toxic human environment an issue of bilateral discussion.



The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires the State Department to act, such as imposing sanctions, or granting a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation can spark an ongoing dialogue. Many Americans already wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines the State Department against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system which celebrates intolerance and murder.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If Pakistan is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the consequences could be incalculable. Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a threat. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen listening to Al Gore’s numbers and figures, we really do need to worry that he may have completely lost his sense of reality. Otherwise we can only conclude that he is a stunningly unscrupulous fraud.

Image cropped from: Rush Limbaugh site.
In Gore’s self-imagined climate-crisis world, global temperatures are accelerating, the center of the earth is several million degrees, mankind has only a few months left to live, and the ocean will soon swallow ground zero, where the World Trade Center once stood. His latest wild exaggeration: Industrial country Germany is now getting 37% of its energy needs from wind and solar.
“Journalistic fraud”
This and other claims made by Al Gore in a recent article in Rolling Stone Online, however, are completely false and totally foreign to reality. I know because I live in Germany and have written often about this topic. Gore’s portrayal of a German success is completely false. Moreover, Climate Depot here also brings up an interview where German renewable energy expert Steffen Henne calls Gore’s claims “journalistic fraud”.
Early in the Rolling Stone piece, Gore claims:
Germany, Europe’s industrial powerhouse, where renewable subsidies have been especially high, now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar; and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020. (Indeed, one day this year, renewables created 74 percent of the nation’s electricity!)
178% exaggeration
This is complete nonsense and it is obvious that Gore, or his researchers, never bothered to check the readily available facts. Just a quick look at Wikipedia here (hardly a shill for the fossil fuel industry) and we get the de-fantasized figures on the share of total power (2012) that wind and sun have in Germany:
Wind: 8%
Solar: 5.3%
Total wind and solar: 13.3%
Gore’s claim: 37%
Factor of exaggeration: 178%
In fact, all the renewable energies combined, i.e. solar, wind, biogas, hydroelectric, etc. amount only to 25% share of Germany’s total energy supplied as of 2012. Already leading officials concede there is little chance of reaching 40% total renewable energy by 2020, let alone 50% with only solar and wind.

Germany’s skyrocketing electricity prices
Far more significant is that Gore totally ignores the dark side of Germany’s renewable energy push: It has caused Germany’s electricity prices to soar, so much so that 600,000 German households were having their power cut off every year. Peter Altmaier, former environment minister under Angela Merkel, said Germany’s renewable energy obligations will cost consumers almost 1 trillion euros by 2030.
And Gore forgets to mention that almost every solar module manufacturer in Germany has gone bankrupt, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of “jobs for the future”.
Unstable power grid
In addition, the erratic feed-in of the constantly fluctuating supply of wind and sun is putting the stability of Germany’ power grid in serious jeopardy. Many industries that rely on stable source of electricity are thinking twice about investing in Germany and are increasingly considering moving operations to foreign locations.
Gore also fails to tell his rock-and-roll readers that Germany has brought on-line more coal power over the past years in an effort to stabilize its base power supply. German CO2 emissions are back on the rise.
He fails to mention that many of the generous renewable energy subsidies have since been scaled back in an effort to keep the exploding costs and power grid stability from careening completely out of control.
Biodiversity genocide
Gore forgets to mention that Germany’s biogas industry has turned a large part of the country’s landscape into a giant corn-field monoculture that has resulted in large-scale biodiversity genocide. Germany’s imports of palm oil from tropical countries has also led to the mass deforestation of once pristine rainforests abroad. These biotopes are now lost for a very long time, if not forever.
Already just the first few paragraphs of Gore’s Rolling Stone piece are so detached from reality and false that everything he writes thereafter is likely of the same quality. People should have stopped listening to Gore a long time ago.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you on Wednesday morning.**
One-time high street giant Debenhams is set to close its doors for good, the company confirmed today. All 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs - that's in addition to the 6,500 that have already gone since May as the firm has struggled to stay afloat in administration. The death knell for the 242-year-old store chain was probably sounded when the last remaining bidder - JD Sports - withdrew. Topshop owner Arcadia is also in trouble, with 13,000 jobs at risk. But there are employers still hiring - find out which ones here
Coronavirus is forcing nearly everyone to rethink their normal Christmas plans this year. And that includes the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be spending the festive season ""quietly"" at Windsor Castle rather than at Sandringham, Buckingham Palace said. The Royal Family has been making the trek to the Queen's Norfolk estate every Christmas since 1988, according to the official web site. ""Like everyone, they hope things will get back to normal in 2021,"" a palace spokesperson said.
An argument over whether a stricter Covid tiers system should come into effect in England is still going on in Parliament, with Boris Johnson facing a threatened rebellion from his own backbenchers. Even if they do rebel, the measures are likely to go through, thanks to Labour and the SNP abstaining on the vote, expected at around 19:00 GMT. You can look up what tier your area is likely to be in, and the rules, in this handy guide.
Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton has gone into self-isolation for 10 days after returning a positive Covid result. He woke up with mild symptoms on Monday and says he's ""really lucky"" he feels OK. In his tweeted statement, Hamilton said he was ""devastated"" he won't be able to race in this weekend's Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain.
And finally, one of the last countries in Europe to introduce mask-wearing has now made it compulsory to wear a face-covering in indoor public spaces. The Netherlands has been one of the countries worst affected by Europe's second wave of Covid-19. The rule will apply to those over the age of 13 in public buildings such as shops, railway stations and hairdressers from Tuesday.

"**People in Scotland will start to receive a Covid-19 vaccine from next week, Nicola Sturgeon has said.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as being safe for use.
The first minister said it was expected the first jabs could be administered in Scotland on Tuesday 8 December.
She said this was ""without a shadow of a doubt the best news we have heard since the pandemic started"".
Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we are not at the end of this pandemic yet"" and added that the vaccination programme would be a massive logistical exercise.
But she added: ""Today does feel like it may well be the beginning of the end of this horrible experience"".
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness - is safe to roll out, and immunisations for people in priority groups could start within days.
The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each.
About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK next week, with a share being made available for Scotland.
Ms Sturgeon said this was ""fantastic news"", and that there was a ""high probability"" that people could start receiving the first of two required doses in the next week.
She said: ""If we receive the first doses as soon as we are expecting to, I can confirm the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday, 8 December. That is just six days from now.""
Ms Sturgeon said rolling out the vaccine across the country would be a ""massive operation"", and said people ""must not ease up in our effort to control"" the virus in the meantime.
She added: ""For all the difficulties that lie ahead, this should give us real hope that the end of this pandemic is in sight.""
Ms Sturgeon said she would be getting vaccinated as soon as she could - and would be prepared to get the jab live on TV if it encouraged others to get it.
The vaccination will not be mandatory and the first minister stressed that the government was ""not planning sanctions"" for those who decide not to get it.
But she added: ""We will put everything we've got behind persuading everybody to get this vaccine as soon as they become eligible.""
The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said British Army planners have already been working with the Scottish government and a number of health boards to provide strategic planning expertise to help ensure people in Scotland get the vaccine as quickly as possible.
It is thought that big venues such as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre are being lined up as the type of venue that will be transformed into vaccine distribution ""hubs"" once the second phase is rolled out for the wider population.
The vaccine doses will be rolled out as quickly as the company in Belgium can make it, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
But the bulk of the rollout will be next year, he added, while predicting: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.
""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray welcomed the vaccine announcement as ""the day we have all been waiting for"".
But he said the Scottish government's recent track record on logistics has ""not been so good"", citing problems with delivery of PPE and expanding the testing programme.
Mr Gray said it was important that lessons were learned from that, and said it needed to be ""all hands to the pump to make this work"".
Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination - that's 4.4m people.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised.
It has said that the priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are:
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Another vaccine from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring.
The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. That vaccine uses a harmless virus, altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19.
Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. Both work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine. There are some other promising vaccines that could also be approved soon.

From the University of Alberta, this news release is making the rounds, but what many of the alarmists don’t get (Joe Romm for example) is that these plants had to have a warm environment to grow in first, then they were covered by ice, emerging again after the LIA ended. Many reports are only looking at the current emergence in a warmer period as if it is unique. – Anthony
400-year-old plants reawaken as glaciers recede
UAlberta researcher discovers plants exposed by retreating glaciers regrowing after centuries entombed under ice.

(Edmonton) When Catherine La Farge threads her way through the recently exposed terrain left behind by retreating glaciers, she looks at the ancient plant remains a lot closer than most. Now, her careful scrutiny has revealed a startling reawakening of long-dormant plants known as bryophytes.
La Farge, a researcher in the Faculty of Science, and director and curator of the Cryptogamic Herbarium at the University of Alberta, has overturned a long-held assumption that all of the plant remains exposed by retreating polar glaciers are dead. Previously, any new growth of plants close to the glacier margin was considered the result of rapid colonization by modern plants surrounding the glacier.

Using radiocarbon dating, La Farge and her co-authors confirmed that the plants, which ranged from 400 to 600 years old, were entombed during the Little Ice Age that happened between 1550 and 1850. In the field, La Farge noticed that the subglacial populations were not only intact, but also in pristine condition—with some suggesting regrowth.
In the lab, La Farge and her master’s student Krista Williams selected 24 subglacial samples for culture experiments. Seven of these samples produced 11 cultures that successfully regenerated four species from the original parent material.
La Farge says the regrowth of these Little Ice Age bryophytes (such as mosses and liverworts) expands our understanding of glacier ecosystems as biological reservoirs that are becoming increasingly important with global ice retreat. “We know that bryophytes can remain dormant for many years (for example, in deserts) and then are reactivated, but nobody expected them to rejuvenate after nearly 400 years beneath a glacier.
“These simple, efficient plants, which have been around for more than 400 million years, have evolved a unique biology for optimal resilience,” she adds. “Any bryophyte cell can reprogram itself to initiate the development of an entire new plant. This is equivalent to stem cells in faunal systems.”
La Farge says the finding amplifies the critical role of bryophytes in polar environments and has implications for all permafrost regions of the globe.
“Bryophytes are extremophiles that can thrive where other plants don’t, hence they play a vital role in the establishment, colonization and maintenance of polar ecosystems. This discovery emphasizes the importance of research that helps us understand the natural world, given how little we still know about polar ecosystems—with applied spinoffs for understanding reclamation that we may never have anticipated.”
The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Abstract
Across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, widespread ice retreat during the 20th century has sharply accelerated since 2004. In Sverdrup Pass, central Ellesmere Island, rapid glacier retreat is exposing intact plant communities whose radiocarbon dates demonstrate entombment during the Little Ice Age (1550–1850 AD). The exhumed bryophyte assemblages have exceptional structural integrity (i.e., setae, stem structures, leaf hair points) and have remarkable species richness (60 of 144 extant taxa in Sverdrup Pass). Although the populations are often discolored (blackened), some have developed green stem apices or lateral branches suggesting in vivo regrowth. To test their biological viability, Little Ice Age populations emerging from the ice margin were collected for in vitro growth experiments. Our results include a unique successful regeneration of subglacial bryophytes following 400 y of ice entombment. This ﬁnding demonstrates the totipotent capacity of bryophytes, the ability of a cell to dedifferentiate into a meristematic state (analogous to stem cells) and develop a new plant. In polar ecosystems, regrowth of bryophyte tissue buried by ice for 400 y signiﬁcantly expands our understanding of their role in recolonization of polar landscapes (past or present). Regeneration of subglacial bryophytes broadens the concept of Ice Age refugia, traditionally conﬁned to survival of land plants to sites above and beyond glacier margins. Our results emphasize the unrecognized resilience of bryophytes, which are commonly overlooked vis-a-vis their contribution to the establishment, colonization, and maintenance of polar terrestrial ecosystems.

Next week’s climate beano at the UN is shaping up to be a bit of a fizzer. Rare as it is for the hangers-on and blood-suckers of Big Climate to turn down some free wine and cheese and business class flights, as we’ve already reported on _The BFD_ , “Few world leaders are lining up…the New York agenda looks deflated”.



You’d think, then, that beggars wouldn’t be choosers. But no, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres seems not to be bothering even hiding any more that climate change is a massive wealth-redistribution scam.



Australia has been barred from speaking at a UN climate summit in New York next week, where China and India will call for ­trillions of dollars more in climate funding from the developed world.



Other big economies, including the US and Japan, have also been silenced because they have not agreed to increase their am­bitions to tackle climate change.



Despite being one of the world’s top investors in ­renew­able energy last year, ­Australia is criticised for relying heavily on coal and refusing to contribute fur­ther money to a green climate fund […] China and India, which are still investing in coal-fired power at home and around the world, are treated differently under the UN rules as developing nations.



Both will address the UN conference to argue that the different treatment of developed and developing nations should continue and that more money is needed.



In other words, despite having the third and fifth largest economies in the world, these shiftless grifters are still going to ram it up the West’s tailpipe for as much money as they can scam.



A statement issued by China on Wednesday said […]“China urges the developed countries to honour the commitment of $US100bn allocation each year from 2020 […]”



India said […]“The recent estimates for taking climate actions are laying out a case for trillions of dollars, and not billions, in new and additional financing.”



 **They’re not even bothering to pretend, any more.**



Joseph Conrad wrote of the 19th century “Scramble for Africa”, that “They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got”. Even Conrad would be astonished by the rapacity of the Scramble for the West.



But the mega-wealthy Chinese and Indian mendicants are not content to merely rob the West blind: they’re determined to rub our noses in it at the same time.



Fewer than one-third of the 197 parties to the Paris Agreement will be allowed to address the New York conference.



Australia’s leadership are at least treating this globalist smash-and-grab with the indifference it deserves.



Scott Morrison will not be attendin­g the New York conference. Australia will be represented by Foreign Minister Marise Payne.

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

"LONDON  —   To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee on Monday, marking 65 years on the British throne, there were new coins, a new stamp, gun salutes, and a reissued portrait taken by a famed photographer. The only thing missing? The queen, who, in keeping with past practice on the anniversary itself, planned to observe the day privately, with a quiet reflective commemoration at her estate in Sandringham, in eastern England. Grander celebrations are in the works for the platinum jubilee in 2022. Royal jubilees commemorate the life and reign of monarchs. Elizabeth, 90, the world’s   monarch, is the first British sovereign to hold a sapphire jubilee. The events were relatively muted compared to the silver (25 years) gold (50 years) and diamond (60 years) jubilees, which were celebrated with   festivities across Britain. There was a ruby jubilee to mark Elizabeth’s 40 years as queen, but that anniversary was also  . Few British monarchs have reached the   milestone. King George III and Queen Victoria marked their golden jubilees with huge celebrations. Elizabeth was expected to spend the anniversary at Sandringham, and there will be no broader celebrations in coming days, as there had been for previous jubilees. She was apparently in “good spirits” at a church service on Sunday, local news outlets reported. There have been concerns about the queen’s health ever since she missed church services on Christmas Day and on New Year’s Day because of what Buckingham Palace described as a “heavy cold. ” Those absences were the first time in about 30 years that she had missed a holiday service. The queen made her first public appearance this year on Jan. 8, after a month’s absence. She celebrated her diamond jubilee, in 2012, with a series of events, including a floating pageant on the River Thames and a tour across Britain. A traditional   royal salute was held at Green Park in London. That was followed by a   salute at the Tower of London. A 2014 portrait of the queen, taken by the British photographer David Bailey, wearing sapphire jewelry given to her by her father, King George VI, as a wedding gift in 1947, was published as part of the commemoration. The Royal Mail issued a stamp worth 5 pounds, or about $6. 25, to mark her accession to the throne, and ranges of special jubilee coins have been cast by the Royal Mint to mark the occasion, with one worth about £50, 000. Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the queen on behalf of the nation, calling her an “inspiration. ” “It is a testament to her selfless devotion to the nation that she is not marking becoming the first monarch to reign for 65 years with any special celebration, but instead getting on with the job to which she has dedicated her life,” Mrs. May said in a statement."

“Overly Overcast: Germany Weathers Darkest Winter in 43 Years”
It seems that there’s a lot of gloom in Germany this Winter, more so than usual. This article in Spiegel explains why:
“The days may be getting longer, but there’s still not a hint of springtime sunshine in Germany. Weather data shows that this winter has been the gloomiest in 43 years. If the sun doesn’t start shining soon, it will be the darkest winter on record.

Winter in Germany is typically a grim affair, dark and steeped in the kind of chilly damp that goes straight to the bones — and, unhappily, to the psyche. But many residents feel that this winter has been particularly hard to bear.
Meteorologists say that’s because it has been the darkest winter in more than four decades. Less than an average of 100 hours of sunshine have been recorded so far over the course of the meteorological winter, which runs from December through February, said National Meteorological Service (DWD) spokesman Gerhard Lux on Monday. The winter average is an already measly 160 hours of sun.”

"**Jason Bassett is planning a journey this weekend to tend a grave in Moffat cemetery.**
It is for a woman he had not heard of until a few days ago.
At the same time, Christine Hastie from Solihull has been spending time at a memorial to Mr Bassett's father - a man she never met.
It is all the result of an appeal made on Facebook in the hope of assistance due to the inevitable difficulties caused by coronavirus restrictions.
It started when Mr Bassett - a funeral director in Dumfries - realised his family was unlikely to be able to make the journey to his dad John's ashes memorial plot at Robin Hood Cemetery in Solihull this year.
""I moved away from Birmingham when I was 13 but my dad still stayed in Birmingham,"" he explained.
""We always made the trip to see my dad at Christmas and, when he passed away, we just continued doing it but putting a holly wreath at his memorial in the cemetery.
""Obviously this year we are not able to go down and I had just accepted, well I won't go down.""
However, he decided to post on a local Facebook group in Solihull to see if anyone else might be willing to help him.
""I was just inundated with people with messages,"" he said.
""I don't know how many people have been in contact since then to arrange things.""
One woman agreed to lay a wreath and then Ms Hastie got in contact to say she had a predicament much like his own.
""A lady messaged me to say she was in a similar situation but her mum was in Scotland,"" he said.
""I thought, I will ask where in Scotland because Scotland is big and I couldn't believe it when she said Moffat.
""It is only a 40-minute car journey for myself so I offered to do the same for her.""
Mr Bassett's father died seven years ago and he said it would mean a lot to his family for someone to visit his memorial.
""I think when someone passes away that's it so I don't get much from visiting people's graves - it is mainly for my brothers and sisters,"" he said.
""I know it would mean a lot more to them - but that doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything to me.""
Ms Hastie's mother, Catherine Rowley, died two years ago and her birthday was on Christmas Day so she likes to try to visit over the festive season.
When she saw Mr Bassett's post on Facebook it struck a chord.
""I understood how he felt because my mum is buried in Moffat cemetery and I get upset because I feel she is a bit neglected because we can't go and visit easily,"" she said.
""Jason offered to go and visit and tidy up the grave for me and I am reciprocating for his dad.
""Jason had quite a good response, we are quite a nice community. It was nice that so many people cared. ""
Ms Hastie said her mother was born in Hamilton but loved Moffat so much she wanted to go ""home"" when she died.
""I tried to explain it to Jason, I actually feel a bit of relief that somebody is going to just tend her grave so she is not alone,"" she said.
""I know that sounds really odd but it is nice to have visitors at a grave. Somebody is remembering you.""
Mr Bassett now hopes their story might encourage others to offer to visit graves that families cannot get to this year.
""This Christmas will be different, but it doesn't have to be any less special,"" he said."

Several House Democrats claim that trace amounts of carbon dioxide could push women to ‘transactional sex’ for survival

Several House Democrats are calling on Congress to recognize that climate change is hurting women more than men, and could even drive poor women to “transactional sex” for survival.
…
Climate change could also add “workload and stresses” on female farmers, which the resolution says produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in developing countries.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The press has been quick to jump on the idea that post-tropical cyclone Sandy (it was not a hurricane at landfall) was worsened by anthropogenic global warming and that “superstorms” are here to stay.   
  
But I must ask the impertinent question: could anthropogenic global warming actually have lessened the impacts of Sandy?   
  
There are basically three pro-global warming talking points involving Sandy: 1) global warming has caused sea levels to rise, thus making the storm surge larger, 2) global warming has led to higher sea surface temperatures and thus stronger hurricanes, and 3) global warming is making extratropical circulation features more conducive to intense and slower moving storm systems.   
  
There is precious little evidence to definitively support any of these points when applied to Sandy, and, in fact, there exists a body of evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion—that anthropogenic global warming may have actually acted to mitigate the intensity of Sandy. Perhaps what lies closest to our current best understanding is that anthropogenic global warming made little contribution one way or the other.   




Let’s start with sea level rise. Water levels at New York City’s Battery Park location have been measured and recorded since 1856. The full record shows an overall (relatively steady) rise of about 0.11 inches per year, for a total rise between 1856 and now of just a bit more than 17 inches. How much of this has to do with _anthropogenic_ global warming? Maybe a third, or about 6 inches. Of the rest, about half was caused by a subsidence of the land (geological processes related to the end of the last ice age, see Engelhart et al., 2009 for example), and the remainder to a warming up from the naturally occurring cold period which ended in the mid-19th century. So of the total 17.34 feet of water (above the station datum) recorded at The Battery tide gauge during the height of Sandy, about 0.5 feet of that could probably be linked to anthropogenic global warming. This is not nothing, but the overwhelming majority of the damage done by the storm surge would have happened anyway. For comparison, the influence of the full moon that night was about as large as the influence of anthropogenic global warming.   
  
As to anthropogenic global warming’s impact on the path, frequency, and intensity of hurricanes, there is a mixed bag of potential outcomes which may be detectable far in the future (towards the end of the century) if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. The current science suggests that the frequency of hurricanes could decrease, the intensity may increase slightly, and the preferred path may be displaced out to sea (Wang et al., 2010). The net effect on the U.S. is anyone’s guess at this point (but 2 of the 3 argue for fewer hurricane impacts in the U.S.). But what virtually everyone does agree upon is that _any_ influence of anthropogenic global warming on hurricane characteristics is not detectable in today’s climate (see for example, Knutson et al., 2010). So that talking point is basically off the table.   
  
Which brings us to the third global-warming-made-Sandy-worse talking point—the influence of anthropogenic global warming on the extratropical circulation characteristics.   
  
This is where the rubber really meets the road when it comes to Sandy’s behavior. Without the northward, and ultimately westward pull from the upper atmospheric jet stream, Sandy would have progressed harmlessly eastward, away from the Northeast coast, and out to sea. But that is not what happened. Instead, a fairly deep trough (southward excursion) of the jet stream was coincidentally passing through the eastern U.S. just as hurricane Sandy was progressing up (but offshore) the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. This trough had the effect of attracting Sandy, and drawing it northwestward, pumping energy into it, and changing its character from a hurricane to an extra/post tropical storm system (also known as a Nor’easter in this part of the country). In October, this type of behavior is not particularly unusual. The preferred tropical cyclone track maps provided by the National Hurricane Center (Figure 1) indicate a general tendency for tropical cyclones in October to curve back into the northeastern U.S.—just like Sandy did.   






Figure 1. Prevailing tropical cyclone tracks for the month of October (source: National Hurricane Center, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/)   
  
In fact, since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been about a dozen or so tropical cyclones that have made landfall in the U.S. north of Cape Hatteras which had a westerly component to their trajectory either immediately before or just after they came ashore. This includes historically damaging storms such as the 1903 New Jersey hurricane, the 1938 Long Island Express hurricane, and 1972’s Hurricane Agnes which is still the flood of record in many parts of the Northeast.   
  
The last one was tropical storm Danielle, over twenty years ago. This is the longest interval in the record (since 1900) between westward-component storms north of Hatteras. So much for the influence of global warming!   
  
So, given this fairly typical behavior—why would anyone even consider that anthropogenic global warming played a role in Sandy?   
  
For two reasons: 1) any bad weather these days is immediately linked to global warming by someone with an agenda, and 2) there was a paper published last spring (Francis and Vavrus, 2012) in which the authors concluded that the decline of Arctic sea ice (tied to anthropogenic global warming) was causing the Arctic to warm up faster than the lower latitudes, reducing the natural north-south temperature gradient which is where the jet stream (and extratropical storms) gain energy. According to Francis and Vavrus, a less energetic jet stream contracts and becomes more meandering, with relatively deeper troughs and higher ridges which produce slower moving storm systems and more extreme weather.   
  
Since Sandy was strengthened and pulled ashore by a deep trough/ridge system in the jet stream, folks are quick to assume that the Francis and Vavrus mechanism tying in anthropogenic global warming must be involved.   
  
Not so fast!   
  
This is like claiming to have made a new discovery that, when flipping a coin, heads are now more likely to occur than tails. And wouldn’t you know, the next time the coin is flipped, it came up heads—to which you proclaim, “See, I told you so.” And since heads are associated with a bad outcome, the press flock to your explanation. But what is completely overlooked, is that other researchers have examined every coin flip for the past 60 years and found that heads and tails occur with equal likelihood. So the current heads outcome is simply part of the natural 50-50 occurrence of heads or tails.   
  
In this case, the other researchers are a pair of atmospheric scientists from Cornell University which have examined the forward speed of all nor’easters along the East Coast from 1951 through 2006 (Bernhardt and DeGaetano, 2012). And what they found, in their own words, was “There was no clear trend in [nor’easter forward] speed during the time period, although considerable season-to-season variability was present.” In other words, while there is a lot of storm-to-storm and season-to-season variability, there is no overall trend towards slower moving nor’easters (Figure 2)—so much for the Francis and Vavrus hypothesis.   
  




Figure 2. Average speed of East Coast winter storms (nor’easters), from 1951-2006 (source: Bernhardt and DeGaetano, 2012).   
  
And, there has been a lot of other research on changes in the patterns and characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream during the period of anthropogenic global warming which did _not_ find that same thing that Francis and Vavrus found (we detailed many of these findings in our March 8, 2012 _Current Wisdom_). At least one of those papers suggested that the methodology employed by Francis and Vavrus “can generate false, or mask actual, variability patterns including trends” (Strong and Davis, 2007). Others concluded that global warming contracted, the jet stream, flattened it over the eastern U.S., and sped it up a bit—characteristics, which, along with a decreased temperature gradient, if applied to Sandy, would have combined to produce a _less_ intense post tropical storm system than if global warming had not been occurring.   
  
So rather than anthropogenic global warming making Sandy worse, it could have actually lessened its intensity and impacts.   
  
The truth is, is that it is impossible to know how, or even _if_ , global warming played any role at all in the lifecycle of Sandy. The science is all over the map, and the signal-to-noise ratio is so low that no matter what is occurring its impact in any direction is undetectable.   
  
But it is sexier and has much more press appeal to proclaim that the destruction wrought by “superstorm” Sandy is the product of our unrestrained fossil fuel consumption, rather than the equally plausible opposite—that anthropogenic climate changes may have combined to lessen Sandy’s intensity.

Hurricane Sandy—which was, technically, not a hurricane by the time it buzzed into the Jersey Shore—was a terribly destructive cyclone. But blaming it on global warming, as did Al Gore, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and NYC’s Mayor Bloomberg, is scientifically ludicrous.



One has to be amazed at how little fact‐​checking the global warming alarmists do. I guess they don’t want the latest storm crisis to go to waste, but they don’t help their cause by mis‐​stating the obvious.



There’s a pretty sizable scientific literature out there on hurricanes and global warming. From the “modeling” end, probably the most cited paper is a 2004 study by Tom Knutson from the government’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton. Although he’s tweaked it a bit since then, the result remains the same. There should be a slight increase (8 per cent) in hurricane power by the end of this century. But the inter‐​annual variability of these storms is so great that this signal will not emerge from the noise until around 2080.



From the “real world” point of view, I published a bunch of papers in response to Tom’s work in which we found, using his assumptions about the amount of oceanic warming, that there would be a similar—again 8 per cent—increase in the number of big (Category 3 or higher) storms in the same time frame. When we adjusted for the pokey rate of oceanic warming being observed, that figure dropped by half.



Chunzai Wang of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has performed a very interesting data‐​based analysis of Atlantic hurricane tracks showing that increasing the area of warm water results in a significant _lowering_ of the likelihood that a storm will strike the U.S., something that should happen with continued oceanic warming. The reason is because storms form further out to sea, and there are more chances for a kink in the mid‐​atmospheric winds to direct them to the north.





One has to be amazed at how little fact‐​checking the global warming alarmists do.



A recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) purports to show an increase in hurricane‐​related storm surges that conveniently begins in 1923, which was during a decade‐​long lull in hurricane activity. Starting something at a low point pretty much insures a trend in any randomly distributed variable. This problem was noted by the above‐​mentioned Tom Knutson.



But the real killer to the hurricane‐​global warming hype comes from Dr. Ryan Maue (pronounced like the island) of Weatherbell Analytics. Using satellite data that gives global coverage beginning in 1972, Maue has calculated what is called the “Accumulated Cyclone Energy” (ACE) index. This is a mathematical integration of storm wind speed and longevity. There obviously is no change in hurricane energy that at all relates to warming, and it is currently near its lowest levels on record.









**Ryan Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the globe (blue circles), Northern Hemisphere (black circles) and the Southern Hemisphere (area between the circles) shows no relationship between overall hurricane severity, frequency and global warming. Thanks to Ryan Maue and Weatherbell Analytics.**



I trotted this out once in a discussion with Nick Kristof on CNN’s Piers Morgan show on November 1. CNN, of course, cannot let go of the meme that Sandy (which was not a hurricane at landfall) was amped by global warming, so Kristof’s substantive response was to accuse me of not publishing any scientific papers since 1992. (I emailed him the 8‐​page single spaced list beginning in 1992, presuming he will set the record straight with CNN—and also rag on whomever gave him that little bit of libel.). Morgan’s producer also had copies of the papers dealing specifically with oceanic temperatures, climate change, and hurricane intensity.



What is really modulating Atlantic hurricanes is the distribution of temperature in the Atlantic. It was in an unfavorable mode in the 70s and 80s, which reversed in the mid‐​90s, concurrent with the start of a ten‐​year very active period. Since the big storm outbreak in 2005, the Atlantic hasn’t been unusually energetic since then. In fact, we are now enjoying the longest interval in the modern record (seven years and counting) without a major (Category 3) hurricane strike in the U.S.



The bottom line is that, everything else being equal, warmer oceans should produce stronger or more frequent storms. But the change has clearly been so small that there is simply no detectable signal—and is likely to remain so for a long time. Further, everything else is almost never equal. It would have been nice if Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo had done a bit of fact‐​checking before stirring the global warming pot. As for Gore, the lack of any increase in hurricane energy related to global warming is just an inconvenient truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European Institute Climate and Energy (EIKE) has sent over some slides from a presentation showing Germany’s mean temperature has been cooling over the last decades.
A couple of days ago a certain reader named Neville (Warming-In-Our-Time) (or was it Neven? whatever…) was complaining that the Eastern Alps were not representative of Europe and thus the data there showing colder winters meant little for Europe, let alone the northern hemisphere. The first slides Klaus Puls sent are  data charts for snow cover for the entire northern hemisphere and mean winter temperatures for Germany.
The first chart below shows snow cover in square kilometers for Europe and Asia, where we see an upward trend over the last quarter century. This is not something you’d expect in a warming world.

It just happens that global temperatures have dropped slightly over the last 10 years, and haven’t risen in 17 years. So the trend in snow cover is no mystery to those who know the data.
If Europe and Asia are not enough to convince you, Puls’s next chart shows that 5 of the 6 top northern hemisphere snow coverage extents occurred in the last 6 years!

The trend over the last 47 years is upward. The mean for the last 10 years is at a record high.
The next chart shows the trend for mean sonw coverage for the northern hemisphere for the fall season since 1967.

Here also the mean autumn snow coverage trend has risen almost half a million square kilometers in 45 years. Again a surprise that flies in the face of a warming planet (one that hasn’t warmed in almost 2 decades).
The next chart shows that winters (DJF) in Germany have gotten “considerably colder over the last 26 years,” Puls says.

The above chart uses data from the German Weather Service (DWD).

 **Devonport-Takapuna Local Board**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



It’s quite incredible to watch the percentage of votes being returned compared to previous elections. This article will be published a couple of days after writing but 2019 is currently 40% lower than the record low turnout of 2016. 



I lived in this local board area for about 5 years up until the end of last year. While I have now returned to the Orakei ward, I still work on the Shore in Hauraki and breathe a sigh of relief that my journey stops at the entrance to the much maligned Lake Rd.



There are 18 candidates contesting 6 positions. You may cast up to 6 votes in this FPP contest.  




[ **Aidan Bennett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5f0630e5-5274-4716-a0e5-e88c2e27f0c7&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– A Fresh Approach **$$$$$**



A Fresh Approach is a new ticket running three candidates who didn’t contest 2016. If any new candidate knows the issues in this local board area, I’d bet money Aidan does. His printing company Benefitz employs 80 people and he also publishes Channel Magazine – a monthly local. If you’re getting into politics, what better tool than your own magazine?



Bennett says he is standing because he believes the performance of the local board is declining and there are incumbents who have been there far too long. Bennett is very future focused in terms of embracing and preparing for further intensification, driving electric cars, bikes and scooters. Instead of fighting change, he wants to adapt accordingly.



Bennett has invested in the area, not just as a business owner but also in the community, receiving a QSM in 2018. He has held various roles in the North Harbour Club Charitable Trust over a 14 year period and also as a trustee of Takapuna Beach Playground Charitable Trust getting – you guessed it – the playground on that beach constructed.



He hasn’t mentioned the controversial carpark issue but he mentions creating a vibrant town centre so you can probably join the dots for his position on that.



[ **Mary-Anne Benson-Cooper**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=ed389e5e-258a-45ef-bedf-6030ba4b68c6&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board) – Independent ****



I first encountered Mary-Anne while rating the Upper Harbour contest. She is standing for three different local boards and if she is elected to more than one, Devonport-Takapuna isn’t her first priority. Considering she finished in 14th place for this local board in 2016, she clearly isn’t your top priority either.



She says if she is elected, she would find solutions for Lake Rd. I guess she doesn’t have any yet. She also says she will keep rates low which reinforces my suspicion she really has no idea what she’s talking about.



[ **Kevin Brett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=20c18cc5-8a08-4ed3-9e2a-5c7eb1ac88c1&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– The Trump New Zealand Party



When I stumbled across the Trump NZ Party several weeks ago I was immediately intrigued and had a look at their website[ trump.org.nz](http://www.trump.org.nz/) It is a hideous site/sight to behold. Messy, cheap, overflowing with capital letters and exclamation marks. I emailed them to find out more and found out nothing as there was no response.



You don’t really need me to tell you how silly this group is. Brett’s poorly written candidate profile is all the red flags you need:



 _Workers including professionals from all over the CPTPP Nations are going to pour into NZ to take your Jobs they will work for less than you._



This is just nonsense. Your job is the one you currently have, not fantasy positions you might like to do one day. What a knob.



[ **Gavin Busch**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=bd308169-24cf-46c3-9b83-55c1bee44be5&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood **$$$$**



Team George Wood was formed in the 2016 elections and it is the first example of a personally named local board ticket I’ve ever seen. They took 3 of the 6 seats. Busch stood last time but wasn’t successful.



Busch lives and works in the area and has degrees in Finance and Economics. Those certainly wouldn’t go to waste if he represents you on the local board. 



Gavin doesn’t consider himself a natural politician (another plus) but is standing because he blames the lack of support from Council on having a board which has been dysfunctional compared to others which do enjoy Council support. While he claims that has improved with the election of three Team George Wood candidates in 2016, things could still be better.



I personally can see the benefit in electing a board ticket that holds a majority. It’s reasonable to expect you’d see a more efficient board that makes faster progress. Rodney and Manurewa are good examples of this.



Busch has identified groups and facilities that are focused on water sports and safety as a priority for local board funding which is sensible considering much of the area is coastal. He also wants to deliver on the Local Centre plans for Devonport, Takapuna and Milford. He has also been involved with the development of the Narrow Neck Pump Park and is keen to get it started sooner.



[ **Paul Cornish**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=6b2d9ec4-bcc3-4d92-b385-66ba064f4abe&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Keep Our Open Spaces **$$$**



Paul is the sole candidate running on the ‘Keep Our Open Spaces’ ticket, which he describes as a byline, reinforcing my suspicion about the general validity of local body affiliation practices.



Obviously Cornish is focused firstly on preserving open spaces and acting as a watchdog to protect jeopardised public space. At least he accepts the need to move on from the battle over the Takapuna car park and instigate a new town square.



He has led a campaign to “erode the dominance of the sole Lake Rd petrol outlet” and support the establishment of a rival outlet. I had never heard of this campaign but upon taking a closer look it would appear Devonport has been serviced by a solitary BP at the top of Lake Rd since 2010. Gull actually commenced plans for an unmanned petrol station on Vauxhall Road min 2018 but that is being objected to by bloody heritage NIMBYs from [Devonport Heritage Inc](http://www.devonportheritage.net/aboutus). I recall the group was bankrupted in 2016 after losing an Environment Court battle to interfere in the business of the owners of the Masonic Hotel. Unfortunately a new group was formed within a year. Cornish wants to conserve heritage buildings so I’m unsure how serious he is about his petrol campaign.



Paul has put a lot of energy into reviving two squash clubs and the Victoria Theatre in Devonport. I immediately started searching his profile for hints of a desire to pump your money into the theatre, of which I found none.



[ **Trish Deans**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5a6174a2-4a9a-49ab-9cc9-0b9c6f82bdb6&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$**



Trish is the Chair of Devonport Heritage formed in 2017 and was chair of the original Devonport Heritage which went into liquidation following an unsuccessful attempt to interfere in other people’s business; opposing Redback Develop’s plans to demolish the Masonic Tavern and build apartments.



Auckland Council and North Shore City spent $322,838 defending the resource consent. In 2011, Auckland Council voted to withdraw a claim for $106,500 costs against the trust and other groups also involved. Devonport Heritage was unable to pay a $27,000 bill for court costs resulting from the battle.



Evidently Deans is quite comfortable with sticking her beak where it doesn’t belong, running up six-figure bills in the process, walking away without paying the bill then building a clone organisation to do the same to others.



[ **Donald Horsburgh**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=189d97e5-73dc-49a9-98c8-e8ffbb9ea8d0&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Independent **$**



Donald thinks the board needs to get real input from the entire community to ensure it is trying to achieve what the community wants. He would establish more reference groups similar to the last Greater Takapuna Reference Group in Sunnynook, Devonport and Milford.



From what I’ve gathered researching the North Shore race, the slow progress being made by Council is not due to a lack of consultation but rather too much. Council funding for irrigation and lighting work at the Allen Hill Reserve, the Lake Pupuke walkways and the cycleway and walkway at Plymouth Reserve had been allocated. Some members of the board who aren’t standing for re-election insisted upon resource consents being opened up to full public notification. This adds 12 months to the process and Council won’t hold those funds if there is not an expectation of them being used within the year.



[ **Ruth Jackson**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=d5a0d34f-00df-455b-aad3-ba62c1d2a18e&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$**



Heart of the Shore, in my estimation, is the far-left ticket for DT Local Board. Jackson has been fighting the closure of the Anzac Street car park in Takapuna. In March 2018 Auckland Council voted to sell the land and develop a new Town Square and park, plus apartments and retail with new parking very nearby. Unfortunately, on June 22, the genuinely insane [Miriam Clements ](https://www.facebook.com/www.logic.org.nz/videos/vb.187401794783973/2179873922283699/?type=2&theater)successfully convinced the High Court to put a temporary block on the sale pending a judicial review in August 13.



It’s a long, messy, confusing tale to follow but it appears the project was back on track following the judicial review. Move forward another 12 months and it appears that Takapuna Residents Association has just lodged an appeal with the High Court asking for a review of “serious flaws” during the Auckland Council’s approval for the regeneration of the Anzac Street car park. Iain Rea is the spokesman for the group and also a Heart of the Shore candidate for Local Board, so I’ll continue this under his candidate rating…



Ruth Jackson says in her candidate profile (with my comments in brackets) that she is committed to:



Then continues with the standard mentions of clean waterways, beaches etc. She will be obstructive, irritating and cost Takapuna millions of dollars in Auckland Council investment while she attempts to hamstrung any progress on the local board.



[ **Jenn McKenzie**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=cef20a9e-969b-447c-ae98-d8a556df4fc8&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood **$$$$**



McKenzie was elected to local board in 2016 and at 31 years old, brings a younger perspective. That’s borderline ‘youth voice identity politics’ nonsense which most candidates under 30 sink their campaigns by using. Borderline.



Living and working in the area, she also works as a Brand Manager which is a bit vague and previously has been President of Takapuna Rotary and a Girl Guide leader in Hauraki.



There’s no beating around the bush in communicating her priorities for her second term; environmental issues including water quality on beaches at the Wairau Estuary, improving play spaces and improving accessibility to facilities, especially those who are not able-bodied.



Glad to see she has also highlighted the importance of doing this in a fiscally prudent manner.



[ **Jan O’Connor**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5cee2e9d-3406-476d-98e1-f88e7cd6b94b&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$$**



Writing a voting guide can be awkward at times as I know several of the candidates personally. It’s always been a pleasure talking politics with Jan. I had also worked with her late husband Mike on various political projects many years ago.



Alas, Jan’s viewpoints couldn’t be any more different from mine and we are diametrically opposed on the big Anzac Street car park stoush, but I wish her well for the campaign. 



[**Iain Rea**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e6f8bf89-9716-41d9-b425-9350f778205d&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$**



Iain Rea is the latest person to throw yet another spanner in the works of the decade long battle over Anzac Street car park. He gives his reason for appealing to the High Court to determine whether two competing proposals for a town square accurately presented to councillors and was the public consultation, cited to support those proposals, proper and fair.



Rea says “Council should work better!” If he genuinely believed that, he wouldn’t be seeking your vote.



Rea is also chair of Devonport Peninsula Precincts Society who appealed to the Environment Court in February 2017 to object to the design of a proposed Ryman Healthcare 600 bed, six storey retirement complex in Devonport. Rea was also assisted by nosey-parker neighbour group Urban Auckland and the NZ Institute of Architects in the ensuing mediation process. The 5 week mediation process cost DPPS $50,000 but I’m unable to determine the cost to Ryman Healthcare from the delay. It resulted in Ryman changing its plans to four and five storey blocks and reduced unit numbers.



Notorious obstructive NIMBY Tricia Deans, Heart of the Shore candidate also ensured her unwelcome opinions were heard. Nothing was mentioned about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her activities had cost ratepayers in earlier NIMBY battles.



[ **Ian Revell**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=694d1e32-b118-4d1f-ac69-319f77d8c597&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood **$$$**



I thought I recognised the name. Revell is a previous National MP. He is very enthusiastic about achieving the goals Team George Wood has set for the next three years, such as the overdue improvements to Lake Rd, finally getting the Takapuna town square upgrades underway, the Milford Takapuna walkway, Wairau Estuary boardwalk and dealing with the water quality issues at Castor Bay, Milford and Takapuna beaches.



Revell is especially keen to get the Castor Bay public facilities completed as well as urgent geotech stability work on the Castor Bay Cliff. I don’t share his enthusiasm for undergrounding “ugly power poles” because there are far better ways to spend ratepayer money.



The 2019 elections need to return a board with a majority grouping that shares the same aspirations for the area, avoiding the delays, obfuscations and deadlock that has characterised the previous three years. 



[**Dorothea Scanlan**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9454e410-f08e-402d-a4ae-791ce51a218d&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– The Trump New Zealand Party





Scanlan is opposed to the CPTPP Labour signed following the US withdrawal from the TPPA. It’s completely irrelevant to a local board contest. In her experience “bullying, racial discrimination, emotional blackmail, public humiliation are all used in the corporate sector against women.”



The Trump New Zealand Party Policies are designed to preserve the existing culture and heritage. She also wonders why we don’t talk much about the ongoing issues in the Amazon Basin which she believes plays a critical role in stabilising the global climate. She is a vegan who enjoys going to plant based cafes with others from her gym after yoga.  
  
Why am I writing this? It’s all I’ve got and it’s on her candidate profile.  




[ **Michael Sheehy**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=1b79eaf6-d520-4d45-9ccd-8ee266b1c764&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood $$$$



Michael has been on the local board for George Team Wood and also served on Takapuna Community Board pre-super city.



His focus for the next term is to fix Lake Road, ferry terminal for Bayswater, improve water quality from the Wairau creek and our beaches. Support the Wairau Creek boardwalk, local business, and local clubs. A floodlit basketball court for Sunnynook, and improvements to Allen Hill Stadium.



He believes the Shore is getting short-changed by Auckland Council and will pressure them to forward the outcomes of the Sunnynook and Belmont plans.

Toni currently works as the Devonport Business Improvement District Manager and has been involved in leading roles on the Devonport Arts Festival Trust. She is also a founding member of the Devonport Zero Waste Committee and very enthusiastic about improving the local environment through sustainable practices.



Her employed and voluntary activities mean she should be well aware of how local boards and the Council works so she is a step ahead of most first-time candidates.



Her professional role means meeting with numerous community groups and volunteers who happily dedicate their free time to activities that improve the neighbourhood, such as weeding reserves, cleaning beaches and organising parades. She can see the importance in engaging with and mobilising that energy from a seat on the local board.



Like other A Fresh Approach candidates, she wants to prepare for a new town centre and the challenges that will come with the inevitable intensification of the area. 



[**Danny Watson**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=999a13ff-a982-4069-bd0c-9fe0f96a6ab7&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– A Fresh Approach **$$$**



Watson will be well known to many as a former talkback host on Newstalk ZB and I’m just old enough to vaguely remember him on What Now! He lives in Bayswater running a karate and arts school with his wife.



He’s interested in big plans to deal with transport problems and says we need to be bold and start digging the tunnel from Epsom to Albany and Waterview to the Shore. That certainly is bold.



[ **George Wood**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=17e3a0c2-6b8d-4f3f-b33f-baad6e2f4e6e&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood **$$$$$**



George Wood is a very familiar face, having been Mayor of North Shore City for nine years, North Shore Councillor for six and the Chair of Devonport-Takapuna for the last three. He’s experienced, knowledgeable and driven to complete the major projects coming up in the region.



In 2015, Devonport-Takapuna lost the $54 million budget for Lake Rd, but three years later, George and his team got $47 million replaced in the budget for the urgent upgrades needed to fix the daily traffic snarls. Also to come are improvements on Esmonde Rd and finishing the cycleway linkage between Francis Street and Esmonde Rd.



Milford Mariners are currently spending $1.1 million without Council assistance dealing with the pollution issues caused by sediment flowing down the Wairau Creek into Milford Estuary from Thomas Park. The current leaseholders, Takapuna Golf Club, have 6 years to run on their current agreement.



George’s experience at all levels of local body make him well qualified to embark on essential improvements to storm water systems and with a new targeted rate in place, he will be lobbying strongly for improvements to the water coming down Milford Estuary onto Milford and Castor Bay beaches.



The other big project on the cards is Unlock Takapuna which will include the replacement of Anzac Street car park with a new town centre, and increased car parks nearby plus the upgrade of Hurstmere Road.



In my view, to continue the momentum on these plans, it is essential that George and the other Team George Wood candidates are elected.



[ **John Wood**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=eb26811f-760e-4c3e-af46-6767cb9674d3&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Future Focus   




I thought Wood’s background as an employer and employment mediator would be welcome on the Local Board. However, he thinks Auckland Council needs to reduce carbon emissions by 50% over the next decade. He is prepared to have the challenging conversations needed to bring about change.



Talking to yourself is only insane if you get a reply.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn early April, the 7th Climate Conference, featuring distinguished non-alarmist scientists and organized by the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), took place at the Steigenberger Hotel Mannheimer Hof in Mannheim, Germany.
The 2-day conference featured heavyweights like Richard Lindzen, Nir Shaviv and Henrik Svensmark who brought the message that today’s climate science tells us there really isn’t much to be alarmed about. CO2 is nowhere near the big driver the media and government-funded scientists make it out to be.

Prof. Lindzen, NN, Dr. Thüne, Prof. Shaviv, Prof. Svensmark. Photo: EIKE
The conference room was large enough to accommodate an audience of 100 people, yet 130 specialists of various fields jammed inside. Those coming late had to stand. Year by year interest in other views in the climate debate and explanations as to why global temperatures refuse to rise has been growing among the public in Germany and Europe. Little wonder that the place sold out.
But interest in rational climate science ends at the media’s front door. The non-alarmist message put forth by the distinguished scientists obviously was not what the German mainstream media wanted to splash in their newspapers, TV screens or internet pages. EIKE reports that not one of the three invited local newspapers bothered to show up and report on the conference and cover the story.
Instead of delivering vivid pictures of doom and gloom scenarios like the IPCC does, the dissident scientists came to tell the world that there really isn’t a man-made climate problem and that the real problem is the man-made climate science disaster. For years the IPCC has been giving the public a distorted and manipulated picture of our climate.  The non-irrational scientists at the conference showed the data to back it up. But this was not the message the German media wanted to hear or to spread to the public. The willful deception continues.
EIKE asks and comments:
Does the print media see the writing on the wall as to why readers are leaving in droves? It’s little wonder. The readers want to see objective information, and not eco-propaganda. […]
As it stands, one has to consider the often sworn free, objective German media as definitely having reached communist East Germany media levels.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe world’s poor are refusing to be denied affordable, reliable fossil energy – like the rest of the developed world enjoys.
According to a new new peer-reviewed paper, during the last decade the world added more coal power than any decade before. A lion’s share of that increase was in developing countries, who understandably want to pull themselves out of agonizing poverty. This should be good news.
However, the opulent elite classes on the planet, which include jet-setting billionaires and Hollywood stars, are having a tough time accepting this and view it as a worrisome development. They expect the world’s underclasses to forego the blessings of cheap energy that they themselves enjoy profusely.
Fortunately the poor are flatly rejecting their demands and are refusing to return to dirt huts. They’ve waited long enough. The poor now know electric power can be produced very cheaply, is plentiful and is there for the taking, and they are now demanding unhindered access to it. Little wonder more coal power came online over the last decade in developing countries. And little wonder much more will be coming online over the next 10 years.
A recent story at the online India Today poignantly illustrates how the world’s poor are refusing to forego fossil fuel generated electricity: Bihar village clamours for real electricity.
The article describes how a village in India had been without electrical power for more than 30 years, and longed to get back on the grid. Greenpeace decided to use the village as an example to the world to showcase how communities can do just fine on renewable energy. Greenpeace India set up a “solar-powered micro-grid” to power the village and it was paraded before the media as a success. The whole world should follow Bihar’s example, Greenpeace and renewable energy activists bellowed. The project reaped lots of praise from the global elitists, and probably won lots of awards. There, you see! That’s how it’s done! 
Greenpeace India describes the project as follows:
The solar powered micro-grid is a comprehensive, first of its kind enterprise that provides electricity to more than 400 households and 50 commercial establishments. This includes 70 kW for electricity generation and 30 kW for 10 solar powered water pumping systems of three horsepower each. The 100 kW micro-grid also takes care of 60 street lights, energy requirements of two schools, one health centre, one Kisan Training Centre and 50 commercial establishments.”

However, the story does not have a happy ending. There’s only one (huge) problem: The citizens of Bihar aren’t happy with part-time modernity. India Today writes:
The residents of Dharnai are far from satisfied to see lights for the first time in 33 years, courtesy a solar-powered micro-grid set up by the environment watchdog Greenpeace India.”
The India Today article goes on to describe how Bihar citizens “want asli bijli (real electricity) from the government” and that village youngsters were carrying placards demanding “real source of energy“, and “not the fake solar powered” one.
It’s obvious: Who needs the lights in the daytime? Lights are needed at night. The problem with the Greenpeace solar micro-grid is that you can’t power the lights at night. And what good is a fridge or freezer when it can be powered only 8 hours a day? Why should a developing country settled for part-time modernity when you can have it full time, and at a price that is less than half of the part-time “fake” energy? How can you run a factory or a hospital when the power is absent 14 hours a day?
Under pressure to quell the people’s anger over having a half solution thrust upon them, and being expected to just shut up and accept it, the government “eventually promised the villagers that ‘real electricity’ would be provided to them shortly.”
India Today writes that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has “instructed senior officials of the energy department to look into their demand for the real stuff“.
The world’s poor want asli bijli, and they aren’t going to settle for less. Hat-tip: Alex Epstein at Twitter.

I’m a bit late in covering this due to other issues of interest taking precedence, but I want to make sure this is widely known. We’ve covered the issue of the Gergis et al paleoclimatology paper this past summer, as well as noted the retraction, but the real action as usual, is behind the scenes in the emails, emails now made available via FOI thanks to Michael Kottek who posted this on Climate Audit to announce the emails were now available: 

Posted Oct 28, 2012 at 7:04 AM | Permalink
The results of my FOI request to the University of Melbourne can be seen here:
http://tinyurl.com/96ey5dt
I requested all correspondence between the authors and the journal regarding the paper. The referees reports were exempted as were documents relating to the resubmitted paper.
I also requested correspondence between the authors after the paper was accepted. Once again emails relating to the resubmitted paper were exempted, and personal material redacted.
I note that emails regarding the paper that were received by one author and not forwarded to the others would not have been covered by my request.
Despite the embarrassment of the withdrawn paper, the University is to be commended for their no nonsense approach to this request. As an alumunus, I am pleased that the response is far more sensible than the approach taken by the UEA and UVa.
That’s true, because there appears to be no holding back of any important correspondence. Here’s some select portions.
Karoly’s first technical response (June 7 Melbourne) to Neukom’s confession was a surprisingly strong endorsement of criticism of non-detrended correlation, going as far as to even agree with [McIntyre] by name:
”If the selection is done on the proxies without detrending ie the full proxy records over the 20th century, then records with strong trends will be selected and that will effectively force a hockey stick result. Then Stephen Mcintyre criticism is valid”.
And then there’s this from Gergis
[…]
”Over recent days we have been in discussion with colleagues here in Australia and internationally about the use of detrended or non detrended data for proxy selection as both methods are published in the literature .
People have argued that detrending proxy records when reconstructing temperature is in fact undesirable (see two papers attached provided courtesy of Professor Michael Mann) .
While anthropogenic trends may inflate correlation coefficients, this can be dealt with by allowing for autocorrelation when assessing significance. If any linear trends ARE removed when validating individual proxies, then the validation exercise will essentially only confirm the ability of the proxies to reconstruct interannual variations. However, in an exercise of this nature we are also intrinsically interested in reconstructing longer-term trends. It therefore appears to be preferable to retain trends in the data, so that we are also assessing the ability of the proxies to reconstruct this information.”
And this admission from co-author Phipps:
Based on the various emails circulated over the past few days, it appears that we will not have a viable millennial-scale reconstruction if we pursue the detrended approach. I therefore feel that we should use the raw data to validate the proxies…
My preference is therefore for David’s Option 2, with Option 1 as my second choice. I dislike Option 3 as it will not leave us with a viable reconstruction. I also dislike Option 4 as it strikes me as essentially starting again from scratch – which seems unnecessary given how far this work has already progressed, and also seems out of proportion to what is only a matter of fixing a technical issue.
Mann, in correspondence with the authors Gergis and Karoly, in his typical style tried to sell a collection different workarounds for the problems they brought on themselves, and in the end, his advice was rejected, the JC editors told the authors the paper was not viable, and the authors were forced to withdraw the paper. Full stop.
Journal of Climate editor Chiang wrote:
After consulting with the Chief Editor, I have decided to rescind acceptance of the paper- you’ll receive an official email from J Climate to this effect as soon as we figure out how it should be properly done. I believe the EOR has already been taken down.
Also, since it appears that you will have to redo the entire analysis (and which may result in different conclusions), I will also be requesting that you withdraw the paper from consideration. Again, you’ll hear officially from J CLimate in due course. I invite you to resubmit once the necessary analyses and changes to the manuscript have been made.
I hope this will be acceptable to you. I regret the situation, but thank you for bringing it to my prompt attention.
The end result of the AMS putting the authors on notice, plus the admissions in the emails, rather puts this early defamatory remark from Dr. Mann in perspective:
Well I’m afraid Mclntyre has probably already leaked this anyway. I probably don’t have to tell you this, but don’t trust him to behave ethically or honestly here, and assume that anything you tell him will be cherry-picked in a way that maximally discredits the study and will be leaked as suits his purposes.
Read the whole episode here at Climate Audit. 
It should be noted that commenter Jean S. contributed the first valid critique, which then later grew into this full retraction. Kudos to him too.

Dominant powers rarely give way graciously. Great Britain only reluctantly accepted America’s rise and refused to similarly yield to the emerging German giant on the European continent. The U.S. has discouraged independent European actors, advanced NATO to shrunken Russia’s borders, and ringed China with bases and forces.



Conflict often results during power transitions. It took two world wars to sort out Britain’s and Germany’s roles: both receded from the international summit though, ironically, the latter, while the military loser, is the greater economic power today. While most of Europe would fight for little if anything, Moscow recently beat up two of its weaker neighbors to force Washington to respect Russia’s much diminished interests.





Washington continues to insist on running the globe, setting the rules, and ordering everyone about. However, the world increasingly is unwilling to cooperate.



The U.S. and People’s Republic of China have yet to come to blows, but escalating tensions before Donald Trump even took office highlighted the potential dangers of estrangement. Washington continues to insist on running the globe, setting the rules, and ordering everyone about. However, the world increasingly is unwilling to cooperate. Certainly Beijing is in no mood to kowtow to America.



Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has been the most aggressive nation on earth and possesses the world’s most powerful military. But Washington has grown used to threatening or battling military midgets: Haiti, Panama, Somali warlords, Bosnian Serbs, Serbia, Afghanistan’s Taliban, Iraq, Libya’s faltering Khadafy regime, the Islamic State. And most of these conflicts ended unsatisfactorily, sometimes even embarrassingly.



Backing into war with the PRC would be far worse. China possesses nuclear weapons—far fewer than in America’s arsenal, but enough to loose mass death and destruction on any nation targeted. The People’s Liberation Army would be no pushover, and the PRC is far too big to conquer, occupy, and remake.



Nor is the international climate conducive for American dominance. The Obama administration, with full support of the Neoconservative hawks who dominate the Republican Party, especially in Congress, have managed to reverse Richard Nixon’s great strategic opening to the PRC and pushed Russia and China together against the U.S. Much naturally divides Moscow and Beijing, but Washington’s militaristic meddling is encouraging the two to cooperate. Nor are America’s allies and the PRC’s neighbors nearly so enthused about the potential for conflict as are the GOP’s hawks.



Worse, even victory in war would only set the stage for future conflict, just as the Versailles Treaty proved to be but a truce for a generation while the combatants recovered their wind. Beijing and Washington need to peer into the future, however darkly, and choose a different course.



The U.S. should learn from Great Britain’s policy toward the rabidly nationalistic rising giant on the North American continent. After fighting two wars with its one‐​time colonists, Britain wisely chose peace. London settled border disputes despite America’s unreasonable demands; accepted an outrageous diktat excluding European powers from Latin America; avoided conflict despite American maritime violations of neutral rights during the Civil War; and accepted U.S. naval parity and eventual superiority. As a result, an important international partnership endures today.



Unfortunately, the Trump administration appears inclined toward conflict. The President seems determined to trigger a trade war, apparently believes Beijing can be bullied into imposing regime change in Pyongyang, and even before placing a foreign policy team in place challenged the PRC with U.S. encouragement of Taiwanese independence. Trump is pouring gasoline all over the relationship. Alas, it didn’t take long for a match to be lit, in this case the Chinese seizure of the underwater drone, which could have ended very badly.



Adviser and former CIA Director James Woolsey proposed “a grand bargain in which the U.S. accepts China’s political and social structure and commits not to disrupt it in any way in exchange for China’s commitment not to challenge the status quo in Asia.” However, that’s no deal from the PRC’s standpoint. Despite Chinese insecurities, there’s little in practice that Washington can do to overthrow the quasi‐​fascist regime which currently governs China. And for a rising power, one that may eventually match U.S. economic and military strength, to complacently accept permanent American dominance along its border would be intolerable.



Imagine London insisting that residents of the U.S. acquiesce to British naval patrols up the East Coast and throughout the Caribbean. Britain dictating American behavior toward Cuba and other nearby territories. British military bases in Mexico, Canada, and throughout the Caribbean. A “pivot” or “rebalance” through which Britain moved military units from Europe and Asia to the Americas. Public debates in London about the potential for war with the U.S. America’s reaction would not have been polite.



Washington is almost frivolously courting conflict. There is no clash of fundamental interests. The two nations are not striving to control the same land mass. There are no disputed territorial claims. Beijing is not threatening to invade America or seize America’s Pacific possessions. There is no danger of military domination of Eurasia. Indeed, China is encircled by potential adversaries—India, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Japan—several of which are backed by Washington.



The U.S. has legitimate interests, but they are limited: free navigation, which the PRC has not threatened; commercial cyberwar, which apparently has been tamed by agreement; abusive trade practices, though the U.S. is no economic virgin; violation of human rights, but Washington ignores equal crimes in Saudi Arabia, Central Asia, Egypt, and other “friendly” states; security of allied nations, though Beijing has threatened the independence of no state other than Taiwan, which historically was controlled by China; and North Korea, but Washington’s containment strategy discourages Chinese action against Beijing’s sole military ally.



None of these cases warrant the possibility of war.



Perhaps President Trump is playing an elaborate geopolitical game for diplomatic advantage. If so, he will need to deploy more than bluster and provocation. And he will need to plan carefully lest his policies trigger a violent reaction. Peace and security for both America and China, and East Asia, are at stake.

We all want a cleaner, more sustainable environment, but effective changes won’t come from loony Greens or ranting adolescents. They will come from sensible decision making based on scientific data, not emotional rage.



We should remember this when we are assaulted by strident demands from a generation which rejects eating meat to save the planet from greenhouse gases, which urges us to follow its lead because glaciers are melting, sea levels are dramatically rising and polar bears are starving to death because of man-made climate change.



Of course, very little of this is true, much less their fault and **previous generations are to blame for the “disaster” because they invented the technology** that, incidentally, provides this ungrateful generation with warm, dry, housing, efficient transport, life-saving hospital equipment and procedures, affordable clothing and good food on their tables.



Greta Thunberg rejected air travel because of the environmental cost, choosing instead to sail to her UN platform to berate us about killing the planet and ourselves. But will she reject medical technology, when she needs it, to stand by her principles? Thought not.



Until this generation throws away its computers and mobile phones, ditches fossil-fueled transport and refuses all medical treatment except via herbs and naturopaths, it is simply a generation of hypocrites.



They are typical social justice warriors who refuse to research the facts, instead protesting, shouting and hysterically screaming at the sky – all at someone else’s behest – and always blaming someone else for the impending prophetic doom. Venting doesn’t change anything, but perhaps it makes them feel better.



“How dare you?” thunders the venomous Greta Thunberg, saying “we” have stolen her childhood. Then she contradicts herself by saying “I feel like I’m dying inside if I don’t protest.” So who is to blame for what is happening inside her head? She also says “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future”. But the media lap up every word, holding up St Greta as the saviour of the planet, and children everywhere follow her lead.



They scream, protest and do little else. They certainly do not listen to the quiet voice of reason. 



Against loud media voices saying Trump didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell, the quiet American voice of reason was strong enough to buck the liberal lefty trend and elect a sensible president. Australia quickly followed suit with their own sensible prime minister. 



These two talk about reducing unemployment, bolstering national defence, making trade surpluses and better decisions. **They are the voice of the quiet majority.** This unites them along with their “shared objectives” and “looking through the world through similar lenses”. As ScoMo said, “Australia and America are warmed by the same inner fires.”



 **Both leaders measure their success by numbers rather than feelings.**



Australia’s defence spending will be 2% of GDP, second only to the USA. Australia is in its 29th year of economic growth, including a strategic four billion-dollar free trade agreement with China (Trump is still working on theirs). I can only imagine Trump or Morrison’s privately held, un-PC responses to our “Wellness Budget”.



Mike Pence welcomed the Australian prime minister and his wife to the White House describing Trump’s 2016 election by the American **“forgotten men and women”**. Similarly, he said Australia’s **“quiet majority”** elected Scott Morrison. It gives me hope.



 **Pence also said the greatest tie between these two great nations is forged on the lives of those who died protecting freedom.**



“This evening, we honor every Aussie and American hero who has paid the supreme sacrifice so that we might live in safety and in peace.”



Remembering that our heritage is also built on the lives of New Zealanders, we must counter the temptation to treat our freedom with the casual disdain of youth and we must protect it from abuse. For instance, we achieved the freedom to express our sexuality but then went a step too far when people are free to switch from Arthur to Martha, demand non-sexist language and insist babies are born genderless, their gender to be chosen by the infant within its first few years. This is not freedom.



Within _The BDF_ , and elsewhere, we find kindred spirits who remember the real cost of the freedom that we refuse to take for granted, and it gives me hope that a quiet revolution will happen here.

It can take years or decades for a bad economy to recover if government throws enough obstacles in the way, like high taxes, costly regulations and class warfare against “millionaires and billionaires.” But a turnaround can begin within hours when government gets out of the way.



That’s what happened in West Germany. The Nazis had established a regime with totalitarian control of the economy, and for four years after World War II the Allied occupation authorities continued to enforce Nazi economic regulations. “When I got out of the airport bus in Frankfurt,” recalled the American journalist William Henry Chamberlin, “A crowd of barefooted boys clamored for a chance to carry my bags to the hotel, where they expected compensation not in paper marks, virtually worthless at the time, but in the universal substitute currency — cigarettes. Such scenes suggested some poverty‐​stricken Asiatic country, not Western Europe.”



Ludwig Erhard, an economist who had participated in the anti‐​Nazi underground, repeatedly urged the Allies to phase out the controls, and eventually he prevailed. The Allied Occupation authorities appointed him director of economic policy. On Sunday evening, June 20, 1948, Erhard went on the radio and announced that the almost worthless Reichsmark would be replaced by a new currency, the Deutschmark. People would receive one Deutschmark for every 20 Reichsmarks they handed in. Exchange controls would be abolished, since these aimed to maintain currency at above‐​market exchange rates, discouraging foreigners from accepting it as payment and thereby making lawful trade impossible.



A new currency, however, wouldn’t buy anything as long as chronic shortages persisted, so Erhard announced that price controls and rationing regulations would be abolished. Price controls simultaneously (1) discourage suppliers from providing more goods and (2) encourage consumers to line up for whatever might be available, which is why such controls cause shortages. U.S. commander Gen. Lucius Clay reportedly warned Erhard, “My advisers tell me you’re making a terrible mistake.” Erhard said, “Don’t listen to them, General. My advisers tell me the same thing.”



Within hours after Erhard’s announcement, goods that had been reserved for black market deals began to reappear on long‐​empty store shelves. During the 1950s, West Germany’s industrial production soared 225 percent. West Germany became a leading exporter. Overall, West Germany turned in the best economic performance of any developed country during this period. West Germany charged through the 1970s without the stagflation that afflicted the United States and other countries.



Although it’s well‐​known that a devastated economy like Germany’s could grow at above‐​average rates, the fact is nobody predicted the German economic miracle. It didn’t encounter serious trouble until West Germany absorbed backward, bankrupt communist East Germany after 1989. “The turnaround in Germany in 1948 was nothing short of a miracle,” MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch observed. “From one day to the next, productive forces were unleashed to let recovery and growth proceed at breakneck speed.”



Japan also had an amazing recovery. In 1977, historian Edwin O. Reischauer wrote that Japan emerged from World War II “a defeated pariah among nations — its cities destroyed, its industry at a standstill, its people exhausted, confused and demoralized. Yet in only one generation the country has risen like the proverbial phoenix to become, next to the colossi of the United States and the Soviet Union, the greatest economic power in the world.” Historian Patricia Hagan Kuwayama added, “If there is one common theme running through the story of postwar Japan’s economy, it is rapid, unceasing change.”



American Occupation authorities broke up government‐​enforced cartels and implemented the 1948 Dodge Plan. This limited the Japanese government’s economic power and made it easier for new entrepreneurs to emerge. “For the first time,” reported economist Katsuro Sakoh, “practically any Japanese, regardless of age, class, or family background, could venture into business and succeed if the elements of hard work, imagination, willingness to take risks, and luck were present. Not only did established businesses prosper under fresher and younger management, but thousands of entirely new enterprises, such as Honda, Yamaha, Sony and Suzuki, to name but a few, were born in this new climate.”



Many people have claimed that Japan succeeded because of a government‐​driven “industrial policy,” but nothing could be further from the truth. Taxes were a smaller percentage of Japan’s GDP than was the case for England, France, West Germany or the United States. Japan had relatively small, balanced budgets — the opposite of what fashionable Keynesian economists recommended he private sector dominated Japanese capital markets, providing a reported 90 percent of outstanding loans and 75 percent of total capital. Government paid for a lower percentage of R&D funding in Japan than in West Germany, England or the United States. The principal Japanese government‐​owned manufacturer produced cigarettes, whereas in Europe government‐​owned businesses manufactured iron, steel, cars, airplanes and other products.



It’s true that the Japanese government “targeted” certain industries for development, but the top target was agriculture, because after World War II farmers made up about half the Japanese population. There was government assistance for forestry and fishing as well as rural areas such as Kyushu, Shikoku and Hokkaido. Infrastructure — roads and bridges — was another high priority. Losses from the government‐​owned Japanese National Railway consumed almost 20 percent of the national government budget. The fabled Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) mainly targeted heavy industries like shipbuilding, coal mining, hydroelectric power plants, nuclear power plants, petrochemical plants and oil refineries.



In other words, the Japanese government didn’t do many favors for popular exports like consumer electronics and cars. Indeed, MITI tried to obstruct some of Japan’s greatest entrepreneurs.



For example, in 1946 Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita started what became Sony Corporation. They wanted to license Bell Labs’ transistor technology, but MITI blocked Sony’s $25,000 payment for the license fee — scarce U.S. dollars shouldn’t be spent on something with unknown potential, MITI said. Eventually MITI relented, and in 1955 Sony began producing small transistor radios.



MITI tried to force seven Japanese automakers to merge, but four including Honda refused. Soichiro Honda fumed, “If you want to control us, you will have to be a shareholder. Only our shareholders have the right to dictate to the management of this organization. Then we will listen to you!” MITI had less power than many people realized. It was thanks to resourceful entrepreneurs that starting in 1950, Japan’s annual economic growth averaged 9.4 percent for the next 22 years — an extraordinarily long‐​lived boom.



There have been many other cases of troubled economies that recovered fast when government got out of the way. For example:



* **Chile.** September 1970 was the first time a Marxist was elected president of Chile, South America’s longest‐​running democracy. Salvador Allende seized businesses. He seized some 1,400 farms, and agricultural production collapsed. He seized banks, then went on a money‐​printing binge. Inflation hit 1,000 percent. Allende decreed price controls that caused severe shortages.



By 1972, investigative journalist David Meissner reported: “People line up for sugar. Beef can be bought only on Friday and Saturday. Toilet paper is the subject of a run on stores.” There were daily protests against Allende. On September 11, 1973, General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte led a coup, and Allende was killed.



The economic crisis continued until 1975 when Pinochet decided to cut spending, cut taxes, liberalize trade, privatize money‐​losing nationalized enterprises and convert the troubled, government‐​run retirement program into a system with individually‐​owned retirement accounts. Chileans became the most prosperous people in South America, and by 1988 there was a transition to free elections.



* **United States.** During the late 1970s, Americans were angry about gasoline shortages, seemingly endless gas station lines and double‐​digit inflation. After Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president, his first official act was to sign an executive order abolishing price controls. The resulting surge in gas prices sent a powerful signal that profits could be made by supplying more gasoline. Prices came down as gasoline became abundant, and gas station lines vanished.



In addition, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker was determined to squeeze inflation out of the economy, but he needed political support, something that Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter was unable to provide. That’s because the pain (higher unemployment) comes before the gain (lower inflation, then lower unemployment). Affected interest groups complained bitterly about Volcker, as did some of Reagan’s closest advisors who worried that Republicans would suffer a setback in congressional elections. Reagan remained steadfast with Volcker, double‐​digit inflation was vanquished, and a remarkable era of low‐​inflation prosperity began.



* **Bolivia.** Bolivia had Latin America’s worst‐​ever inflation, because the left political party in power was a coalition that wanted the government to spend more money on social welfare programs and hire more unionized government employees. But spending exceeded tax revenue, and there were no buyers for Bolivia’s risky government bonds​.In August 1985, inflation hit an annualized rate of 60,000 percent.



Then Victor Paz Estenssoro, a center‐​right politician, was elected president. He seemed to understand that fighting inflation would be hard on many people, so it made sense to get through the process as fast as possible. To cut spending, the government let go of 27,000 employees at the government‐​run oil and tin companies (Bolivia’s population at the time was 6 million). The Bolivian peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar, thereby getting control of the Bolivian money supply out of the hands of Bolivian politicians. Price controls, wage controls, exchange controls and interest‐​rate controls were abolished. Taxes were somewhat simplified. The runaway inflation was stopped in 10 days.



* **Hong Kong.** As a British colony (until 1997), Hong Kong endured shocks from Japanese invaders, communist revolutionaries who claimed Hong Kong for China and Chinese Nationalist agitators who claimed Hong Kong for Taiwan. Hong Kong was overwhelmed with some 3 million refugees, and the total population quadrupled in a few years. Ultimately China, which had cut itself off from the outside world, seems to have decided against an invasion because half their foreign income was earned in Hong Kong.



Meanwhile, Hong Kong offered more freedom than just about anyplace else on earth, thanks to colonial administrators like Financial Secretary John Cowperthwaite. He perfected a laissez‐​faire paradise that focused on protecting people from force and fraud, supporting free trade and stable money, maintaining low taxes and few regulations, with no special favors or bailouts. Hong Kong became a world‐​class manufacturing, trade and financial center. When China finally absorbed Hong Kong — and promised to leave it intact — its per capita GDP ($22,990)was 37 times larger than mainland China ($620.)



* **China.** The economic outlook for China began to improve after the eagerly‐​awaited death of Mao Zedong in 1976. His worst disaster was an insane Soviet‐​style five‐​year plan known as the Great Leap Forward that promoted heavy industry and sacrificed agriculture where China had comparative advantages, causing a famine estimated to have killed some 45 million people.



Deng Xiaopeng emerged as the new Chinese leader, and he insisted that the top priority must be reviving the economy. Although he never repudiated the deadly dogmas of Marx, Lenin and Mao, and the Communist Party continued to monopolize political power, Deng stimulated agriculture by dismantling communes that suffocated the initiative of peasants. The government encouraged foreign investment. Money‐​losing government enterprises continued, but private individuals were permitted to work for themselves and establish businesses, which had been unheard of under Mao. Deng declared, “to get rich is glorious.” A substantial private sector began to develop, and China has reported high growth rates for the last three decades.



* **Brazil.** For perhaps a half‐​century, the Brazilian government directed development, expropriated private property, inflated the money supply and maintained high tariffs to prevent Brazilian customers from shopping for the world’s best deals. Result: financial crises, soaring debt, runaway inflation, political turmoil and sometimes military coups.



But by 1990, there was a growing consensus in Brazil to curb inflation, privatize moribund government enterprises and liberalize trade. In 1995, annual inflation — that had peaked around 2,900 percent — was brought down to single digits. In 2002, former labor union official Lula da Silva won the presidential election. Widely expected to pursue an anti‐​business agenda, Lula turned out to be a very practical man. He affirmed that high inflation must not come back and that Brazilians would be smart to embrace global markets. Brazil became safe for investors and entrepreneurs, helping to usher in today’s remarkable economic boom.



So, there really isn’t any secret about what needs to be done. There is, however, a huge political challenge about how to do it.

Musk is splashing the cash trying to show the world that the Tesla S is better than the electric Porsche, so he has sent a Tesla S to Germany to try for the Nürburgring record. 



The nearest charging point is in the nearby town but it is not a “supercharger” so would take too long to recharge the car.



The simple solution for Musk was to install a supercharger at the circuit … powered by a hunking big diesel generator he brought with him in a container from the US.



Together with the Tesla a container from America arrived at the ring. Its content: a large diesel engine. This generates the power to charge the Model S. **Since it is noisy day and night, it has already attracted the annoyance of local residents.** However, Tesla has reacted and unceremoniously installed a Supercharger on the ring. However, he obviously first of all serves his own needs as he stands in the area of ??the rollercoaster behind a locked gate immediately next to the start and finish straight of the GP course. So not accessible to Tesla customers. 



  
Behind the ‘clean, green’ image there is always another story. Whether it is on the Nürburgring, the Ngauranga Gorge or the Northern Motorway, the dirty truth for virtue-signalling electric car drivers is that the energy has to come from somewhere. 



Currently, it appears a diesel generator is powering one Tesla at the Nürburgring track.

"David Shepard, a film preservationist who restored hundreds of discarded, hidden or forgotten films by masters like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and F. W. Murnau and packaged rarities for the consumer market, died on Jan. 31 in Medford, Ore. He was 76. The cause was cancer, said his brother, Donald. The era of Valentino and Fairbanks had been over for decades when Mr. Shepard, barely in his teens, began buying old films, reel by reel, with money earned from his paper route. He had been bitten by the bug when his uncle Myron, a photographer in the Signal Corps, brought home a projector and a boxful of films from France after World War II  —   abridged versions of Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis” and Georges Méliès’s experimental “A Trip to the Moon,” among others. They kindled an enthusiasm that only grew with time. Working for the American Film Institute and later for Blackhawk Films, which reproduced old films for the collectors’ market, Mr. Shepard began searching out movies that had been languishing in studio vaults or private collections and bringing them in for restoration. By trial and error, he developed techniques now used widely in commercial preservation laboratories. In 1989, after acquiring Blackhawk’s library, he created his own company, Film Preservation Associates. Over the years, he restored or made available many of the silent films now found in DVD and video libraries, including the 12 shorts that Charlie Chaplin made for the Mutual Film Corporation in 1916 and 1917, Murnau’s 1927 masterpiece “Sunrise,” all of Buster Keaton’s independent films of the 1920s, and Soviet silent films from the same decade. For many films, he commissioned new musical scores. One of his most stunning efforts was the restoration of the French filmmaker Abel Gance’s “La Roue” (“The Wheel”). Originally shown in 1923 over three days, it was cut down to two and half hours for commercial distribution, and the original was subsequently lost. Mr. Shepard, with the archivist Eric Lange, reassembled a      version from five different prints, released in 2008 by Flicker Alley. “If you’ve seen a superior print of a film by Chaplin or Keaton, Griffith or Murnau, chances are David had a hand in restoring it,” the film critic Leonard Maltin recently wrote on his blog. Just as important, Mr. Shepard brought films out of the archives and to the general public, building on the work of the pioneer revivalist Kevin Brownlow. “He was able to build an audience for silent film and keep it going,” Jeffrey Vance, a film historian who has written books on Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd, said in an interview. “He made silent films available to everyone. ” David Haspel Shepard was born on Oct. 22, 1940, in Manhattan and grew up, from the age of 11, in Tenafly, N. J. His father, Bertram, was an executive with the Grand Union grocery chain his mother, the former Marjorie Markley, was a homemaker.’ ”He was film crazy from his earliest years, with a connoisseur’s bent that his father indulged by taking him to the film programs at the Museum of Modern Art. After buying a   projector at 12, he discovered that film rental companies, hard hit by television, were selling off their stocks, and he began acquiring films for $1 a reel.” ’In junior high and high school, he filmed football games for the coaches to study. In the   he used the camera to make his own films with student actors. Mr. Shepard earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and religion from Hamilton College in Clinton, N. Y. in 1962 and a master’s in American studies from the University of Pennsylvania a year later. He was teaching theater and film at Pennsylvania State University in 1968 when the fledgling American Film Institute hired him to seek out historically significant films from studios and collectors, with the aim of having them donated to the institute for preservation and archiving. In an early coup, he persuaded Paramount Pictures to turn over the 200 silent features it had in storage in Fort Lee, N. J. After five years, he went to work for Blackhawk, in Davenport, Iowa, as head of product development. It was there that he led the project to acquire and restore Chaplin’s Mutual shorts, in which Chaplin’s Little Tramp character evolved from a purely slapstick figure to a rich, comedic personality. Mr. Shepard was hired by the Directors Guild of America in 1976 to oversee special projects, notably a series of oral histories with directors like King Vidor and Henry King. In the 1980s, he began teaching film history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California. In 1977, he married Kimberly Fetter, who had worked with him at Blackhawk. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his brother, he is survived by a son, Ben Baker. Pinched by competition from the video market, Blackhawk Films closed in 1987 and offered Mr. Shepard its equipment for scrap value. He bought an industrial building to house it, and to pay off the building he began doing commercial preservation and restoration work. Soon after, he acquired Blackhawk’s film library, which became the basis for Film Preservation Associates. The company worked with distributors like Kino International and Flicker Alley. Many of the titles were released in box sets, including “Masterworks of D. W. Griffith,” “The Art of Buster Keaton,” “The Golden Age of German Cinema,” “Cecil B. De Mille: The Visionary Years,” “Douglas Fairbanks: King of Hollywood” and “Georges Méliès: First Wizard of the Cinema. ” In 2006, the National Society of Film Critics gave its Film Heritage Award to Mr. Shepard and his collaborators  —   Anthology Film Archives and the film restorer Bruce Posner  —   for the   collection “Unseen Cinema: American   Films. ” Mr. Shepard, who lived in Hat Creek, Calif. had his fair share of serendipity along the way. Raoul Walsh’s first film, “Regeneration” (1915) sometimes credited as the first gangster feature, simply fell into his lap when a meter reader from Missoula, Mont. contacted him about some films he had stumbled across in a building scheduled for demolition. “When he went to read the meters for the last time, the tenants were gone but the films were still there, so he took them,” Mr. Shepard told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. “He called me looking for someone to preserve them. ” Better yet, he told the newspaper in 1999, while he was visiting a colleague in France in the early 1970s, a boy rode up on a bicycle balancing a box of films on the handlebars. He had recently retrieved them from the family farm in Normandy. Among the films was an original print of “The Tramp,” which Chaplin had made at Essanay Studios in 1915. “You couldn’t stage this in a bad play,” Mr. Shepard said."
"

So the spoiled brat is scolding us again. 



Greta Thunberg [joined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLzaHr_LkM) a large crowd of young people skipping school in Iowa City, Iowa for a climate change protest on Friday, where she declared the recent United Nation’s action summit on climate change a flop.



The summit, which ran in conjunction with the U.N.’s annual General Assembly meeting, featured Thunberg and other youth speakers.



“We told world leaders to act on the science,” Thunberg, 16, said at the protest inspired by the Fridays for Future school walkout she started a little over a year ago in her homeland Sweden. “And we demanded a safe future for us and for everyone.”



brat, Greta Thunberg, who just two weeks ago was being lauded literally as the new messiah has now declared that the summit where she was beatified was a ‘failure’.



“But they didn’t listen,” Thunberg said. “As we all know, **the U.N. climate action summit was a failure.”**



 **“That was, unfortunately, what we had expected,”** Thunberg said.



Thunberg said world leaders are “uncomfortable” standing behind the “science.”



  
A failure, huh? A failure moreover that she “expected”. If she expected to fail then why bother? If her childhood hopes and dreams are going to remain stolen then “brat” Greta shouldn’t have been in New York scolding us in the first place. If it was a failure as “expected” then why is she still out of school continuing to scold us all? What is the point? It is about time that she realised that the real culprits in the high crime of stealing her dreams and childhood are her paymasters, like George Soros and her parents, who painted for her a doomsday picture of the future and who have heartlessly used her to further their political agenda.



If I were a rude person I would riff off of [last night’s Jeremy Clarkson video,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/clarkson-explains-why-cycling-is-actually-bad-for-the-environment/) and say that Greta Thunberg should just eff off. I am not that rude, however, so I will simply predict her gradual decline into obscurity.



She will now be ignored because the very summit that was used to beatify her has now been declared a failure; **ergo she is a failure.** She isn’t so saintly anymore and the silence from the media about her latest huffy outburst is telling.



I think I can safely predict that, like the so-called Occupy movement, these climate whingers will be ignored, then forgotten. Does anyone remember the rowdies occupying everywhere saying that they would stay until they got what they wanted? Well, where are they now? That’s right, nowhere. We all got bored with their scolding and rubbish, their unkempt appearance and their violence and simply ignored them. Then winter came and went and took the losers with them.



Governments will fail to declare climate emergencies, and they won’t make such declarations, because to do so will open them right up to lawsuits over the tide coming in and a few extra puddles forming after a thunderstorm. Then people will start to realise that there actually isn’t an emergency and the world isn’t ending and we will just carry on.



Bloviating politicians like Jacinda Ardern will cuddle their tarnished Nobel Peace Prize and mutter to themselves that no one listened, as they continue to enjoy their winter holidays beside the beach in some tropical paradise that is still there and hasn’t been washed away. Not for them to spend time in a barren winter wasteland when there are warmer climes to enjoy.



Have you ever wondered why these climate conferences always seem to occur in high summer? Never do they have one in the depths of winter in Siberia or Alaska where their rhetoric would be swallowed up and muffled by mountains of inconvenient snow.



As Clarkson said, they, Greta, Jacinda, all of them “can just eff off.”

 **Presented in association with[The Unshackled](https://www.theunshackled.net). Trans-Tasman Talk (TTT) is hosted by Tim Wilms from Melbourne and Dieuwe de Boer from Auckland. The show debuts every Tuesday at 9pm New Zealand time (and 7pm Melbourne time). Episodes are broadcast live on the [Right Minds Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFcFU3Qv9lKc9rHEIqWd6Dw) and also on [The Unshackled](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHfXKg-zg-VrSVIu6AK5R0Q).**



In the third episode of Trans-Tasman Talk, Tim and Dieuwe look at how our respective Prime Ministers were received by Donald Trump. They discuss local developments in New Zealand, such as the Auckland Mayoral race and another NZ Labour sex scandal. Plus, Dieuwe explains Maori ethno-nationalism and how an Auckland mayoral candidate’s “seig heil” outburst had nothing to do with fascism, but rather the adoption of Nazi symbolism by local Maori gangs.



Both Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern were on the Atlantic Coast in the United States this week. ScoMo for an official state dinner with Donald Trump at the White House, and Jacinda to attend the UN Climate Change Summit in New York with keynote speaker Greta Thunberg.



Jacinda scored a pull-aside with President Trump, the lowest level of diplomatic meeting possible, while the rest of his schedule was full of bilateral meetings with other nations. Morrison had a full State Dinner with the Trump Administration while securing steel tariff concessions and a trade deal. Ardern walked away with nothing.



There was a breaking news bulletin about Brexit during the show and a brief discussion of the possibility of new trade deals with the Mother Country, a CANZUK free movement agreement, and the deportation procedures for foreign-born criminals.



Climate change has been a hot topic recently, and the Australian climate protests and New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Bill both featured on the show.



 _Due to daylight savings kicking in a week early in New Zealand, next week’s show will premiere at 9:30pm. We sync back up with Australia the week after and TTT will return to its regular slot._

Both sides of the Tasman have switched over to daylight savings, and both the hosts are very much enjoying the instantaneous climate change it created. Extinction Rebellion protests kicked off this week, but are they Green or are they Red? This “rebellion” has the same anti-capitalist and pro-globalist message of all socialist action movements that came before it. There were dozens of arrests made throughout Australia and New Zealand, but the police were generally very soft and no charges were laid. PM Jacinda Ardern did not have any kind words for the “rebels” while in contrast, the leader of the opposition egged them on.



PM Scott Morison made another anti-globalist speech last week, and this one was endorsed by deputy PM Winston Peters. He’s sounding like his old nationalist self again, could he be gearing up the the 2020 general election? NZ First MP Shane Jones has threatened utu (revenge) against the forestry industry if they don’t vote NZ First. “I’ve shown you the money, now show me the votes,” he was reported to have said. He has been reprimanded by the Prime Minister, but not lost his portfolios.



New Zealand’s local elections conclude this week, and the media seems to have picked two front-runners for races throughout the country without any supporting polling at all. Avi Yemini, an Australian alt-media personality, faces the courts this week for charges related to his independent campaign in a state election.



It’s been 250 years since Captain Cook re-discovered New Zealand, but the event has not been marked with much celebration as the elites have been pushing a campaign to discredit the great explorer. Don Brash called for the resignation of the UK’s High Commissioner after it announced that there would be an apology for deadly confrontations between the Maori and Cook’s men.



Don Brash was the best prime minister New Zealand never had, a long-serving Reserve Bank governor, and is now a campaigner for racial equality and free speech. He remains a popular figure that the media can’t ignore.



Just before we went live there was an announcement that a database of NZ First members, with all the personal details, has been leaked to the media and opposition parties. There have been a number of other leaks related to NZ First over the past week, showing how disgruntled the membership is, and there is clearly a staffer or candidate with an axe to grind against Winston.



Finally, there was some good news to share: New Zealand will no longer be making donations to the Clinton Foundation — a policy which has seen both National and Labour governments give around $10m to the Clintons.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s no secret that many vegetarians are also radical environmentalists and climate alarmists who are obsessed and hysterical about the planet burning up. Perhaps the University of Graz in Austria has discovered one reason why: their “unhealthy” diet.

Study shows that big meat-eaters are healthiest. Photo credit: Alpha, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
A new University of Graz study concludes that vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters. According to the German press release, vegetarians “have cancer and heart attacks more often”. The release also says that they show more psychological disorders than meat eaters. Consequently, the report writes, they are a greater burden on the health care system.
According to the press release the scientists evaluated data from the Austrian Health Interview Survey (AT-HIS), which is also part of an important and valuable EU survey (European Health Interview Survey).
The scientists examined a total of 1320 persons who were divided up into 4 groups of 330 persons each. All groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, and socio-economic status. The study also accounted for smoking and physical activity. Also the BMI was within the normal range for all four groups (22.9 – 24.9). The only thing that really was different among the four groups was the diet. The four groups were: 1) vegetarians, 2) meat-eaters with lots of fruit and veggies, 3) little meat-eaters and 4) big meat-eaters. More than three quarters of the participants were women (76.4%).
Vegetarians plagued by significantly more chronic illnesses
The press release states that the results contradict the common cliché that meat-free diets are healthier. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters do (30.6% to 16.7%) and they showed 166% higher cancer rates (4.8% to 1.8%). Moreover the scientists found that vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks (1.5% to 0.6%). In total the scientists looked at 18 different chronic illnesses. Compared to the big meat-eaters, vegetarians were hit harder in 14 of the 18 illnesses (78%) which included asthma, diabetes, migraines and osteoporosis [1, p.4, Table 3].
The Medical University of Graz confirms the findings of the University of Hildesheim: More frequent psychological disorders among vegetarians, the press release states.
The roots of anxiety and depression?
In the analysis, the University of Graz found that vegetarians were also twice as likely to suffer for anxiety or depressions than big meat eaters (9.4% to 4.5%). That result was confirmed by the University of Hildesheim, which found that vegetarians suffered significantly more from depressions, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints and eating disorders [2]. The U of Graz scientists also found that vegetarians are impacted more by ilnessses and visit the doctor more frequently [1, p. 3, Table 2].
Big meat-eaters were also found to have a “significantly better quality of life in all categories”, the study found. The four categories examined were: physical and psychological health, social relationships and environment-related life quality [1, p. 5, Table 4].

Dubious science everywhere
Again this is not the first study that has recently contradicted the claims that vegetarians are healthier. The world’s largest study on nutrition (EPIC) indicated that vegetarians in general tend to die earlier [3].
Recently experts have shown that the alleged health benefits of a vegetarian diet are myths and fairy tales. For example, according to Professor Ulrich Voderholzer, Director and Chief Physician of the Schön Klinik Roseneck and an expert for eating disorders, promises made by vegetarian organisations “are not scientifically supported.”
The University of Graz press release writes [4]:
It’s more about an ideological message that suggests false promises.“
The press release also adds [5]:
Concerning cancer prevention through fruits and vegetables, Prof. Rudolf Kaaks of the German Cancer Research Center DKFZ recently stated: ‘There’s no relationship, zero-point-zero.’“
Gee, it all sounds as bad as the science we have been seeing that tries to link bad weather to CO2.
Not only are greens duped about climate science, many are also duped by nutritional science. Granola-eating tree-huggers are turning out to be the most ill-informed, unhappy and hysterical people on the planet.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
As Anthony discussed here, some Australian climate scientists think that there was an “angry summer” in 2012. Inspired by the necromantic incantations in support of the Aussie claims coming from the irrepressible Racehorse Nick Stokes, I went to take a look at the Australian temperature data. I found out that in response to hosts of complaints about their prior work, in March of 2012 the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) released a new temperature database called ACORN-SAT. This clumsy acronym stands for the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network (overview here, data here)

It’s a daily dataset, which I like. And they seem to have learned something from Anthony Watts and the Surfacestation project, they have photos and descriptions and metadata for each individual station. Plus the data is well error-checked and vetted. The site says:

Expert review
All scientific work at the Bureau is subject to expert peer review. Recognising public interest in ACORN-SAT as the basis for climate change analysis, the Bureau initiated an additional international peer review of its processes and methodologies.
A panel of world-leading experts convened in Melbourne in 2011 to review the methods used in developing ACORN-SAT. It ranked the Bureau’s procedures and data analysis as amongst the best in the world.
and
Methods and development
Creating a modern homogenised Australian temperature record requires extensive scientific knowledge – such as understanding how changes in technology and station moves affect data consistency over time.
The Bureau of Meteorology’s climate data experts have carefully analysed the digitised data to create a consistent – or homogeneous – record of daily temperatures over the last 100 years.
As a result, I was stoked to find the collection of temperature records. So I wrote an R program and downloaded the data so I could investigate it. But when I had just gotten all the data downloaded started my investigation, in the finest climate science tradition, everything suddenly went pear-shaped.
What happened was that while researching the ACORN-SAT dataset, I chanced across a website with a post from July 2012, about four months after the ACORN-SAT dataset was released. The author made the surprising claim that on a number of days in various records in the ACORN-SAT dataset, the minimum temperature for the day was HIGHER than the maximum temperature for the day … oooogh. Not pretty, no.
Well, I figured that new datasets have teething problems, and since this post was from almost a year ago and was from just after the release of the dataset, I reckoned that the issue must’ve been fixed …
…
…
… but then I came to my senses, and I remembered that this was the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), and I knew I’d be a fool not to check. Their reputation is not sterling, in fact it is pewter … so I wrote a program to search through all the stations to find all of the days with that particular error. Here’s what I found:
Out of the 112 ACORN-SAT stations, no less than 69 of them have at least one day in the record with a minimum temperature greater than the maximum temperature for the same day. In the entire dataset, there are 917 days where the min exceeds the max temperature …
I absolutely hate findings like this. By itself the finding likely make almost no difference for most applications. These are daily datasets, with each station having around 100 years of data, 365 days per year, that means the whole dataset has about 4 million records, so the 917 errors are 0.02% if the data  … but it means that I simply can’t trust the results when I use the data. It means whoever put the dataset out there didn’t do their homework.
And sadly, that means that we don’t know what else they might not have done.
Once again, the issue is not that the ACORN-SAT dataset had these problems. All new datasets have things wrong with them.
The issue is that the authors and curators of the dataset have abdicated their responsibilities. They have had a year to fix this most simple of all the possible problems, and near as I can tell, they’ve done nothing about it. They’re not paying attention, so we don’t know whether their data is valid or not. Bad Australians, no Vegemite for them …
I must confess … this kind of shabby, “phone it in” climate science is getting kinda old …

From our WUWT.TV 24 hour broadcast answer to Al Gore’s dirty weather on November 14-15, 2012. Dr. Sebastian Lüning of Dr. Franz Vahrenholt are co-authors of the book “Die Kalt Sonne” which we previously reviewed here and here on WUWT. Here, in this interview and presentation, Lüning, who is a geologist by trade, explains how he was converted to climate skepticism by his own research.
It is a powerful demonstration of how people can come to understand just how flimsy the evidence is for catastrophic global warming, and is well worth your time to watch.

As I’ve noted previously in this space, the Justice Department has been strenuously ramping up prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the law that criminalizes many of the sorts of official payments that alas typify the business climate across much of the globe. Per Shannon Green at Corporate Counsel, “2011 Was a Banner Year for FCPA Enforcements and Trials.” Unfortunately, as I argued in that earlier post, the law is so vague, uncertain and unpredictable in its reach that many businesspersons risk prosecution even though it is far from clear that their actions actually did violate the law.   
  
  
Don’t just take my word for it: ask federal judges. Over the past two months alone they’ve thrown out three high‐​profile FCPA prosecutions in whole or part after finding the Department hadn’t proved its case.   
  
  
On Monday U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston, after hearing the prosecution case, dismissed the jury and summarily tossed out DoJ’s 12‐​count FCPA indictment against John O’Shea, an executive with the Swiss engineering company ABB Ltd., over allegedly improper payments in Mexico. Judge Hughes “said O’Shea’s conduct was reasonably explained by lawful motives,” to quote FCPA Blog. He also dismissed a conspiracy count. C. M. Matthews at the WSJ’s Corruption Currents Blog has more on the case. (O’Shea continues to face some other counts, in particular under the federal “money laundering” statute, itself a case study in rampant overcriminalization.)   
  
  
Last month district judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C. dismissed conspiracy charges against six defendants caught in an African arms‐​trade “sting” operation, which resulted in the outright acquittal of one of the defendants, Stephen G. Giordanella, who unlike the others faced no substantive FCPA charges. Earlier, Judge Leon criticized federal prosecutors for “sharp” tactics in handling evidence of interest to the defense.   
  
  
And DoJ’s most stinging embarrassment of all came last month as well, when federal judge Howard Matz in Los Angeles — quoting the WSJ again — “threw out the landmark FCPA conviction of Lindsey Manufacturing Co., the first company convicted under the law, and offered a scathing assessment of the Justice Department’s handling of the case.” Specifically,   




it is with deep regret that this Court is compelled to find that the Government team allowed a key FBI agent to testify untruthfully before the grand jury, inserted material falsehoods into affidavits submitted to magistrate judges in support of applications for search warrants and seizure warrants, improperly reviewed e‐​mail communications between one Defendant and her lawyer, recklessly failed to comply with its discovery obligations, posed questions to certain witnesses in violation of the Court’s rulings, engaged in questionable behavior during closing argument and even made misrepresentations to the Court.



Efforts to reform the substance of FCPA are picking up steam in Congress, and that’s all to the good. But equally or more vital to the public liberty is countering the danger of out‐​of‐​control federal prosecution, which we’ve seen lately in fields ranging from environmental enforcement to dubious obstruction‐​of‐​justice charges. Isn’t it time for Congress to use its oversight powers more vigorously?

There’s an interesting measure of atmospheric CO2, called the “airborne fraction”. The airborne fraction is the fraction of the CO2 emitted each year which remains in the atmosphere. When humans emit say 9 gigatonnes of carbon, only about half of that remains in the air. The other half of the emitted carbon is absorbed, “sequestered” in some semi-permanent fashion, by various carbon sinks in the land and the ocean.
Dr. James Hansen of NASA, another in the long line of climate alarmists who don’t mind shafting the poor with expensive energy, has come out with a most surprising statement in his latest paper, Climate forcing growth rates: doubling down on our Faustian bargain, hereinafter Hansen 2012. The statement involves Hansen et al.’s explanation for a claimed recent decrease in the airborne fraction. Here’s their graphic showing the changes in the airborne fraction since 1960.
Figure 1. Hansen 2012 Figure 3. I’ve added a vertical line highlighting June 1991. 
[ORIGINAL CAPTION] Fossil fuel CO2 emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed atmospheric CO2 increase to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.
I do wish people would show the underlying data and not just averages, but setting that aside, here are the authors’ claims about the drop in the airborne fraction (blue line) post 2000:
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks. One mechanism by which fossil fuel emissions increase carbon uptake is by fertilizing the biosphere via provision of nutrients essential for tissue building, especially nitrogen, which plays a critical role in controlling net primary productivity and is limited in many ecosystems (Gruber and Galloway 2008). Modeling (e.g., Thornton et al 2009) and field studies (Magnani et al 2007) confirm a major role of nitrogen deposition, working in concert with CO2 fertilization, in causing a large increase in net primary productivity of temperate and boreal forests.
This is an interesting argument, but it has a few moving parts. Let me list them.
1) Increased coal use leads to increased net primary productivity (NPP) .
2) Increased NPP is evidence of increased carbon absorption.
3) Increased carbon absorption leads to increased biologically driven carbon sequestration.
4) Increased biologically driven sequestration explains the post-2000 decrease in airborne fraction.
I’m good with claims number 1 and number 2, but from there they get increasingly unlikely for various reasons. I’ll go get the data and show the actual airborne fraction, but first, let me quote a bit more from Hansen 2012, this time regarding Pinatubo.
Remarkably, and we will argue importantly, the airborne fraction has declined since 2000 (figure 3) during a period without any large volcanic eruptions. The 7-year running mean of the airborne fraction had remained close to 60% up to 2000, except for the period affected by Pinatubo.
and also …
Thus we see the decreased CO2 airborne fraction since 2000 as sharing some of the same causes as the decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption (figure 3).
I looked at the chart, and I looked at the dates. Pinatubo was in June of 1991. Here’s what I get from the data:
Figure 2. Annual airborne fraction (red line), along with 7-year average (blue). Green line shows theoretical airborne fraction assuming exponential decay of excess CO2.
So to start with, from both his graph and mine I’m saying absolutely no way to Hansen’s claim that there was a “decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption”. Hansen seems obsessed with Pinatubo. He previously has claimed (falsely) that it represented a successful test of his GISS climate model. See here, here , and here for a discussion of how poorly the models actually did with Pinatubo.
He is now claiming (again falsely) that there is some drop in the airborne fraction after Pinatubo. I’m sorry, but that’s a totally false statement. There’s no sign of any unusual drop post-Pinatubo in this record at all, neither in the annual data nor in the average data. The majority of the drop he seems to be pointing to occurred well before Pinatubo occurred …
In passing, let me comment that any reviewer who let any of that Pinatubo nonsense past them should resign their commission. It was the first thing I noticed when I looked at the paper.
There’s a second problem with what Hansen et al. have done. They say regarding their 7-year average (blue line) that: Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means. Sadly, this means that the final point in the 7-year average is forced to be equal to the last point in the raw data … easily the worst choice of ways to handle the final points of any average, almost guaranteed to have the largest error.
But that method does have one advantage in this case. It greatly exaggerates the amount of the recent drop. Note for example that had the data ended one year earlier, the final point in his average would have had a value 60% … here’s what the 7-year average figured their way would have looked like if the data had ended in 2010.
Figure 3. As in Figure 2, but with the 7-year average ending in 2010 using their method. Note that the final point is forced to equal the 2010 value.
As you can see, their curious treatment of the 7-year average at the end of the data is the only thing that makes the trend look so bad. When changing the data length by one year makes that kind of change in an average, you can assume that your results are far, far from robust.
But neither of those is the main problem with their claim. The main problem is that the general slight decrease in the airborne fraction is an expected result of the exponential decay of the excess atmospheric CO2. As the green line shows, the actual results are in no way different from the value we’d expect to see. The green line shows the result of the exponential decay of the excess CO2 if we assume a half-life of about 46 years. The expected value decreases slightly from 1970 to 2011.
It’s worth noting that if CO2 emissions leveled off entirely, the airborne fraction would gradually decay to zero. This is because if emissions level off, eventually the excess CO2 level will be such that the annual sequestration will equal the annual emission with nothing to remain airborne.
To close, let me return to their claim:
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks.
I must confess that I hadn’t looked at fuel use by type in a while, so I was unaware of a large spike in coal use.
Figure 4. Carbon emissions by fuel type. Note the steady rise of natural gas, which will only increase with the advent of fracking.
So yes, coal use has indeed spiked since 2000, with a jump in coal emissions putting it back out in front of oil. I assume, although I’ve not checked, that this is the result of the huge increase in coal for electricity generation in India and China. And good on them, the folks in that part of the planet desperately need cheap energy.
Returning to the claims in Hansen 2012, it is true that the carbon uptake by the various sinks has constantly increased over time. This increase, however, appears to be much more related to the exponential decay of the CO2, and has less to do with the changes in the biosphere. We know this because the change in the amount sequestered is much larger than the change in the NPP.
Here are the figures. In 1960 the natural sinks were sequestering about 1 gigatonne of excess carbon annually. By 2011, this had risen to 4.5 gigatonnes annually. I agree that CO2 fertilization is real, but clearly this 4.5-fold increase in total tonnage of excess carbon sequestered cannot all be the result of increased NPP from CO2 fertilization.
So while I’m glad to hear that Hansen thinks that coal is good for something, I fear his explanation for the increase in the amount sequestered is not correct. The increases in the amount sequestered have been much, much larger (450% since 1960) than the increase in the amount of sequestration due to greater NPP.
Before I leave, let me remind folks what cheap electricity and energy from coal does for us all, rich and poor alike, every day of the year.
Figure 5. Daily output of coal energy. SOURCE 
That huge benefit to the poor and the rich is what Hansen is trying to get rid of … but he and others have very little with which to replace it. So all that happens is that the price of energy goes up, and the poor once again are impoverished the most.
Brilliant plan, that fellow Hansen truly cares about the future … he just doesn’t seem to care if he hurts people in the present.
My best to everyone,
w.

From Andrew Montford, who points out the obvious (at least obvious to everyone else) when it comes to the “big oil” and “big coal” meme.


It’s extraordinary how this “massive campaign” by fossil fuel interests has gone almost entirely undocumented. There is, to the best of my knowledge, virtually no evidence to support the claim at all. It is something of an indictment of the standards in academia that this kind of conspiracy theorising goes unremarked and entirely unchallenged.

Gotta love this, with all the hullabaloo over a possible new world temperature record in Death Valley, a logging town in Washington has pre-empted them.
Hilariously, the reading of 139 degrees F is listed as “suspect” as it should be, but at 133 degrees F in the next reading (just under the Death Valley all time record of 134F) it is listed as “OK”.
See the screencap:

Obviously it is an equipment malfunction. I wonder how many other weather stations will go on the fritz in our upcoming heat wave.

The CoL has quietly kicked to the kerb the idea of **making all government vehicles (where practicable)** **electric by 2025**. 



“Although it was repeated as recently as June, that goal has been very quietly revised to a commitment that, **after mid-2025, all _new_ vehicles entering the fleet will be emissions-free.”**



Marc Daalder, writing for Newsroom, says:



“Making the government fleet fully emissions-free would have been a daunting task, even with the “where practicable” caveat. The Government’s progress so far has been abysmal. 



Out of around 15,000 vehicles, **less than half of a percent of the Government’s fleet is electric.** This has been the case for at least the past nine months, according to data from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.”



Given our PTPM’s insistence on there being a climate emergency as recently as last week – when she took the UN podium following Thunderpants’ address – why the down grade? 



Is it par for the course, ie the usual CoL downhill trend, from KiwiFail to EVFail? 



Did they finally ask themselves why more people aren’t investing in EVs? 



Or could it be that they eventually did their sums and added up the lost fuel taxes which, according to David Seymour add up to around $20,000 per fossil fuelled vehicle.



“Motorists already pay an ETS charge of approximately 6c per litre when buying petrol. They then pay a further 64c of other taxes and, in Auckland, a further 10c regional fuel tax. GST is charged on top of those costs, taking the total tax per litre to around 81c per litre (and 92c in Auckland). Purchasers of electric vehicles are already absolved of at least 80c per litre in tax on their fuel. 



The Green Party has long (incorrectly) argued that tax treatment of oil and gas exploration amounts to a subsidy to the industry **. They cannot deny, then, that avoiding petrol taxes is already a major subsidy to electric vehicles.**



Over the lifetime of a vehicle, the subsidy to electric vehicles is already very large. The driver of a Toyota Corolla that travels 300,000km at 8L/100km will pay approximately **$20,000 of fuel tax over its life time** (80c/L x 8L/100km x 300,000km). For less efficient vehicles, the lifetime subsidy is much larger.”



Naturally, the greens are purple in the face about the government back down.



“Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Amanda Larsson criticised the decision. “The Government’s quiet back down on electrifying its vehicle fleet is surprising and incredibly disappointing,” she said. 



This is a **climate emergency** and the Government should be leading by example to cut our dependence on the dirty fuels driving this crisis.”



The wheels have fallen off the CoL’s foray into EVs.



“The Government might consider that electric vehicles are a very expensive way of reducing emissions already, and avoid putting further money into such an ineffective approach. 



“The ‘social justice’ wing of the Green Party might ask why the party is prepared to put even more cost onto those who drive cheap, reliable cars such as petrol powered Toyota Corollas, just so the ‘environmental’ wing can try out a Tesla.”



David Seymour was three months ahead of the CoL in arriving at his conclusion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a press release from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research.
Original article: Bayr, T., D. Dommenget, T. Martin, S. Power, 2014: The eastward shift of the Walker Circulation in response to global warming and its relationship to ENSO variability. Climate Dynamics, DOI 10.1007/s00382-014-2091-y.
Note that their results are based on climate model simulations, the same kind that have had a 97.4 % failure rate thus far (see chart, above).
Yet these scientists think they are good enough to make predictions for the year 2100. This is what I call classic, very transparent quackery (They couldn’t even get the first 15 years right).
That aside, here is the GEOMAR press release (try not to fall off your chair laughing):
========================
Will climate change make El Nino a permanent concern?
27 May 2014/Kiel. Currently there are many indications that an El Niño event will be developing in the months ahead. This could become a lasting situation as a result of increasing global warming – even if the observations of the last decade have been showing the opposite trend. This is the result reached by a study conducted by an international team of scientists lead by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research based in Kiel. The results have appeared in the international journal Climate Dynamics.

El Niño, or more correctly El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is the strongest climate fluctuation on timescales of a few (2-7) years. The phenomena often occurs at Christmas time and got its name from Peruvian fishermen (Span.: El Niño) and involves a strong warming of the Eastern Pacific and is connected to the absence of fish swarms.  Today we know that it involves a coupled system between ocean and atmosphere. The El Niño oceanic component is characterized by the warming of the central and eastern Pacific and the atmospheric Pendant Southern Oscillation, which is a measure for the pressure difference over the Pacific and Indian Ocean. During an El Niño, the area of low pressure that normally lies above the Indonesian region shifts eastwards over the Pacific. This leads to flooding in the eastern Pacific and droughts over northern Australia.
The model studies analyzed by the authors coming from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) , with which the climate projections for the IPCC climate report were calculated, show a general weakening and eastward shifting of atmospheric, equatorial circulation pattern until the year 2100 relative to the mean condition of the years 1950-1979. The pattern resembles a weak but lasting El Niño situation.
The ERA Interim Reanalysis 1979-2012, however, was not able to confirm this trend, but rather it showed an opposite development with a westward shift and strengthening of atmospheric circulation at the equator. “This apparent contradiction can be explained by internal variability in the climate system,” explains the study’s lead author Tobias Bayr of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. “We believe it is unlikely the models are falsely predicting the development as more than 36 different models and numerous model runs were used for the employed analyses,“ Bayr adds. With the help of the analysis process (Multi-model Ensemble) used for the study, very reliable, robust signals could be extracted from a variety of experiments. “And a clear majority of the models predict we will get a more or less permanent El Niño by the end of this century because of climate warming.”
All observations point to a development of an El Niño in the months ahead. However it remains anyone’s guess on whether or not this El Niño will be the turning point to the trend predicted by the models.
===================================
Stunning BS. Amazing such crap gets published nowadays.
Using models of the sort that have had a 97% failure rate thus far, they pretend being quite sure about the year 2100, and yet turn right around and admit that they can’t predict what will happen next year, writing it’s “anyone’s guess”.
Your tax-euros at work, folks. And they (media and established politicians) wonder why skeptic parties won huge in last weekend’s elections.

"**A village in Stirling was left without internet access for several days after a lorry crashed into a telegraph pole.**
The vehicle - owned by a contractor for Stirling Council - left ""significant damage"" following the incident on Thursday.
Broadband was affected for the majority of residents in Brig o' Turk and some properties in Invertrossachs.
Openreach carried out a temporary fix but a small number of households are still disconnected.
One local resident told BBC Scotland the Ripple Retreat - a respite centre for families affected by cancer - had also been impacted by the damage.
In an email to Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon, the woman described the significant impact on the community as poor mobile reception left many households ""without an alternative"".
She said: ""As a result, local children are unable to effectively revise for their preliminary exams, with most revision resources being online.
""Elderly people and other people vulnerable to Covid-19 are unable to shop for groceries online, leaving them with no safe means of accessing essential items.
""Rural businesses already struggling with the impact of the virus and its mitigation measures are unable to connect with customers or conduct necessary work online.
""People working from home during this crisis have unable to complete any online work.""
The Scottish government said it was investigating the issue ""as a matter of urgency"" given the impact on the community.
A spokeswoman said: ""Digital connectivity has proven to be vital during the last few months, whether supporting our health and emergency services or in enabling people to work or study from home and stay connected to friends and family.""
Openreach said the crash damaged overhead wiring and ripped up copper and fibre cables from the ground - the fibre cable supplies broadband to the majority of residents in the area.
Several days later engineers installed temporary fibre cables to restore service to the majority of households.
A spokeswoman for the firm said the pole and new aerial cables would be installed on Wednesday.
She said: ""We're really sorry for the disruption to broadband, which was beyond our control on this occasion.
""Anyone experiencing loss of service should report it to their service provider, who will arrange for Openreach to investigate further.""
Stirling Council said it was aware of the incident and the matter was under investigation."

Is global warming real? Have any such predictions been established scientifically? Would massive “carbon” taxes and other controls put America and the world—especially the poor—at great risk? At this special event, geoscientist and astrophysicist Willie Soon separates fact from fiction in the global warming debate. He explains why the forecasts from CO2 climate models have been so wrong—and why solar influences on clouds, oceans, and wind drive climate change, not CO2 emissions. Stanford University physicist Elliott Bloom then comments. “The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.” —Freeman J. Dyson, Professor Emeritus of Physics, Institute for Advanced Study; Templeton Prize Laureate “I am writing to express my deep admiration and respect for Dr. Willie Soon, a fine astrophysicist and human being…. As Willie has shown in many ways, observational facts do not fit the CO2 dogma, and an enormous amount of evidence points to the Sun as a much more important driver of climate…. Willie was right—whatever the cause of changing temperature, the main driver cannot be the concentration of atmospheric CO2.” —William Happer, Chairman, Presidential Committee on Climate Security; Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics Emeritus, Princeton University; Member, National Academy of Sciences Willie Soon is a geophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

"**Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.**
The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group.
No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement.
And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group.
All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic.
The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough.
The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business.
Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group.
""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said.
""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side.
""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.""
Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit.
He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses.
Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast.
The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman.
But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers.
And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options.
He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy.
As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set.
Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.
Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time.
""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match.""
In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.
The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches.
While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship.
Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday.
""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said.
""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs.""
Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business.
""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members.
Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct.
Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.
Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion.
Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic.
Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March.
The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports.
Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain.
JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year.

June 25th will mark the deadline for public comments on EPA’s dreadful proposal meant to fulfill President Obama’s campaign promise to “necessarily bankrupt” anyone foolish enough to build a new coal‐​fired power plant. EPA is properly braced for a very large volume of comments.



Sure, the economics favor gas today, as fracked natural gas floods the market, and it is in fact cheaper to build and run a gas‐​fired plant rather than one lit by coal. But that very abundance has now depressed the price of gas to the point that the major frackers, like Aubrey McClendon’s troubled Chesapeake Energy, are cutting way back. There’s no certainty about what the future price of gas will be, but it’s surely possible that it will again rise above coal on a per‐​unit‐​electricity basis. In that eventuality, you still could not operate a new plant.



That’s because EPA has proposed that no coal plant can be built unless it emits (per unit energy output) as little or less carbon dioxide than a comparable natural gas plant. Because producing a requisite amount of electricity from gas results in—estimate—about 50% of the carbon dioxide for the same coal‐​based electricity, the only way to meet the proposed standard is to capture the outgoing carbon dioxide, pipe it somewhere, and bury it. This raises the cost of power and also requires considerably more coal to be burned because it takes energy to capture and transport carbon dioxide. Hence, you go “necessarily bankrupt”.



I’ll be submitting my comments next Monday, and I’m going to go straight to the heart of the matter: EPA’s “endangerment finding” from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Concerning U.S. climate, it is largely based upon a single document, produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), called “Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States”.



My comments will include the first release of a late draft of an _Addendum_ to that report, produced by the new Center for the Study of Public Science and Public Policy (PSPP) here at the Cato Institute. The Center is particularly interested in the policy consequences of making the government the sole funding provider for policy‐​related scientific research.



And so, on June 25th (or shortly thereafter), you will be able to access our _Addendum_ , which pretty much matches—page for page, and subject for subject—the USGCRP document. The Government has 569 science citations, Cato has 932. Which is more complete?



Both are summarized in a set of ten “Key Findings” near the beginning of the documents. Here they are, side by side, USGCRP and Cato’s CSPP. (Also included are two examples of the subsequent text explaining the findings).



USGCRP:



1\. Global warming is unequivocal and primarily human‐​induced.



2\. Climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.



3\. Widespread climate‐​related impacts are occurring now and are expected to increase.



(Text: Climate changes are already affecting water, energy, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and health. These impacts are different from region to region and will grow under projected climate change. (p.41–106, 105–152))



4\. Climate change will stress water resources.



5\. Crop and livestock production will be increasingly challenged.



6\. Coastal areas are at increasing risk from sea‐​level rise and storm surge.



7\. Risks to human health will increase.



(Text: Harmful health impacts of climate change are related to increasing heat stress, waterborne diseases, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. Reduced cold stress provides some benefits. Robust public health infrastructure can reduce the potential for negative impacts. (p. 89))



8\. Climate change will interact with many social and environmental stresses.



9\. Thresholds will be caused, leading to large changes in climate and ecosystems.



10\. Future climate change and its impacts depend on choices made today.



PSPP:



1.Climate change is unequivocal and human activity plays some part in it.



2.Climate change has occurred and will occur in the United States.



3\. Impacts of observed climate change have little national significance.



(Text: There is no significant long‐​term change in U.S. economic output that can be attributed to climate change. The slow nature of climate progression results in _de facto_ adaptation, as can be seen with sea level changes on the east coast. (pp.45–144))



4\. Climate change will affect water resources.



5\. Crop and livestock production are adapting to and will adapt to climate change.



6\. Sea level rises caused by global warming will be easily adapted to in the U.S.



7\. Life expectancy and wealth are likely to continue to increase.



(Text: There is little relationship between life expectancy, wealth and climate. Even under the most dire scenarios, people will be much wealthier and healthier than they are today in the year 2100. (pp. 99–111))



8\. Climate change is a minor overlay on U.S. society.



9\. Species and ecosystems will change with or without climate change.



10\. Policies enacted by the developed world, including the U.S., will have little impact on global temperature.



We expect our _Addendum_ is going to cause a little heartburn at the EPA, and it should, with hundreds of more citations and endnotes than are in the documents that serve as the scientific cover to “necessarily bankrupt” people.

"■ The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, took aim on Monday afternoon at a New York Times story that described President Trump watching television in his bathrobe. ■ Opposition to Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions on certain countries mounted, but the president remained defiant and unbowed. ■ Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Monday and began challenging polls that showed his travel order was not popular. ■ A bipartisan group of former National Security Council officials filed court documents opposing the ban. ■ The Justice Department corrected the record on how many people had their visas canceled because of the ban. Mr. Spicer denounced The Times’s account, published Sunday night, of the president’s turbulent adjustment to life in the White House. In particular, he zeroed in on one detail among a few paragraphs of the story that he insisted were wrong: that the president has worn a bathrobe while alone in the White House residence. “That is literally the epitome of fake news,” Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump. “Start at the top. I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn’t wear one. ” The White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes. Within moments of Mr. Spicer’s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe. Mr. Spicer added that the story was “so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology. ” He went on, “Literally, blatant factual errors, and it’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or   reporting. ” The overall piece, which described Mr. Trump’s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic   of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was “not an accurate portrayal of what’s really happening,” Mr. Spicer concluded. Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning. In one Twitter post, the president rejected reports of polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order. In another, he appeared to lash out at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing. A CNN poll released over the weekend said that 55 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Trump’s travel order as an attempt to keep Muslims out of the country. The president also seemed angry about the    story line, which was featured in a Time magazine article and in a “Saturday Night Live” skit showing Mr. Bannon as the Grim Reaper directing Mr. Trump’s activities in the White House. On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports “fake news” that sought to marginalize him. If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O’Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight. Mr. Trump continued his screed against news coverage of him on Monday, training his fire at The New York Times in an apparent reaction to a portrait of his early stumbles published in Monday’s editions. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times’s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House’s most senior officials and others aware of the administration’s inner workings, as “fiction” based on fabricated sources. Mr. Trump has long delighted in denigrating The Times and claiming, falsely, that its coverage of him has led to declining readership. But in a meeting at The Times in November, he called the paper, which is among his first reads each morning, “a great, great American jewel. ” Last week, The Times surpassed three million print and digital subscriptions, adding 276, 000 net   subscriptions in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. It’s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump’s immigration order. Overnight, 97 companies  —   most of them technology firms, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  —   filed a legal brief arguing that the ban is unconstitutional and harms the interests of American businesses. The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, “hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent increases costs imposed on business makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations  —   and hire new employees  —   outside the United States. ” It is a remarkable statement of unity from the country’s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years. The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials. The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an   claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump’s executive order on visitors from seven   countries. The government lawyer provoked gasps in the courtroom when he told Judge Leonie Brinkema, one of the Federal District Court judges weighing legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s order, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as a result of the order  —   far more than had been understood to be the case. That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60, 000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban. On Monday, the department submitted a filing to Judge Brinkema that corrected its statement in the court. “In response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100, 000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,” it said. “The Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60, 000 visas. ” An outside,   political group is adding veteran   and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president’s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees. The group, 45Committee, has signed Larry Weitzner of Jamestown Associates, which produced most of Mr. Trump’s campaign ads in the general election. Mr. Weitzner’s first spot will air nationally this week, with a gauzy focus on the initial days of the Trump presidency. It’s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services. Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director. With Mr. Trump’s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics. Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for  . Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense. In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his   defeat to a host of enemies, including “leftist financier George Soros,” the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration’s Justice Department. Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal    charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge’s order to stop discriminating against Latinos. As the sheriff of Arizona’s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area. Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling."

About those ‘record’ Death Valley temperatures everybody is waiting for…

UPDATE: 128°F today at Death Valley COOP station. See Record Event Report below.
It seems the media and the alarmists are cheering on the possibility of an all-time temperature record in Death Valley. There’s lots of hullabaloo over the supposedly tied all time temperature record of 117°F in Las Vegas yesterday, which turned out to be false, but was tied today. And there has been lots of news on the potential for a new all-time temperature record in Death Valley, which would negate the all time world record of 134°F on July 10th, 1913, since the previous world record in Libya of 136.4°F (58°C) was recently said to be unreliable due to it being measured over asphalt and having an untrained observer.
But it looks like this anticipated new record for Death Valley may not come to pass. As of this writing, it is 125°F in Death Valley according to the Climate Reference Network site, the last three days of hourly data show it to be well short of the all time record, and the forecasts are ramping down for the predicted high in Death Valley and are expected to fall well short of the 134°F all time record:

Source: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mesowest/getobext.php?wfo=vef&sid=ISWC1&num=72&raw=0
NWS Las Vegas posted this infographic about the COOP station there:

But that only tells half of the story. You see, about 100 meters away  from the Cotton Region Shelter (CRS) aka Stevenson Screen is was a NOAA MMTS electronic thermometer, which I documented on Wednesday the 31st of October 2007:


Note the proximity to the asphalt and the building, a definite siting no-no. This station would be a CRN4 (unacceptable siting – heat sinks/sources within 10 meters) in this setup since the asphalt is less than 10 meters away.
Source: SurfaceStations.org
Here’s the aerial view:

But, an interesting thing has occurred, and I’d like to think that my work had something to do with it. It seems NOAA has abandoned the MMTS electronic thermometer and has gone back to using the max-min mercury thermometer in the Stevenson Screen.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen this happen, especially since the MMTS was supposed to be the “modernized” version of the COOP station equipment.
Metadata at NCDC confirms this, see below. the max-min thermometer was put back in service on September 19th, 2012:

The MMTS electronic thermometer went in service on May 20th, 1999:

Source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/#ncdcstnid=10100093&tab=PHR
What the NWS Las Vegas doesn’t mention in their infographic when they say “things have become much more modern today” is that the site was using modernized equipment for over 12 years, but now has “de-modernized” the station.
Here’s another infographic from the high yesterday, showing the thermometer reading. The photo taken by the National Park Service:

Why would this be?
I have two possible confounding factors.
1. As we learned from Menne et al. 2010, the MMTS shelter has a cool bias despite the overwhelming proximity of these sensors to buildings and other surfaces due to cable length/trenching issues putting them closer than the original stations they replaced. This has to do with the Gill shield (the stacked plates on the pole) offering better protection from solar radiation than the older stations. This better exposure and hence a cooler measurement environment is actually of greater magnitude than the warming introduced by proximity to buildings and surfaces.
2. As we learned from the SurfaceStations project, many CRS/Stevenson screen stations are is disrepair due to paint issues and blackening of  wood due to exposure. They tend to read higher temperatures due to absorbing more solar radiation due to flaking paint and darkening wood.
Did NOAA decide to go back to the CRS/Stevenson Screen because they knew it had a better chance of setting a new all-time high temperature record? It’s a possibility. It is also possible that since the El-Azizia record was shot down, purists argued that it would be unfair to record this important temperature with equipment that has a different character. They’d be right.
No matter what the reason, NOAA has done something unprecedented as far as I know: they closed a modernized temperature reporting station in use over a decade in favor of the older technology.
I hope to hear more about this, and I’ll advise if I find an official reason.
One thing is for certain, in 1934, there wasn’t a big parking lot next to the station as we have today:

Now there’s one more station in Death Valley you should know about, placed to obtain an “unofficial record”. The late great johnDaly explains:
Badwater
 by    John L. Daly     
(19th July 2002)
In climatology, record-breaking is of little significance climatically speaking. An all-time hot record in one place can be easily matched by an all-time cold record somewhere else. This year in the U.S. and in Australia, both hot and cold records have been broken at various times and places. They make interesting fare for the Guinness Book of Records, but little else.
However, record-breaking does have one purpose for the greenhouse industry, namely that of heightening public fears about global warming. For this reason, the industry likes to see hot records being broken as often as possible, present a lot of media hype about them, and then go into quick denial and spin-making when cold records are broken, sometimes even blaming the cold record on global warming!
The industry also dislikes a hot record being very old, such as the all-time hot daytime record for Australia of 53.1°C. set at Cloncurry, Queensland in 1889. Valuable research money and academic effort was spent in a futile effort to discredit that one record (Trewin, B., Aust. Met. Mag. 46 (1997) 251-256).
There is one all-time hot record that is the ultimate global prize: 58°C (136°F) set at Al Aziziya, Libya, in 1922. This was the hottest temperature ever recorded anywhere in the world and has stood for 80 years in spite of real or imagined `global warming”. It is even noted in the Guinness Book of Records. But 1922 is a long time ago and the longer it stands, the less convincing are the claims about global warming in the eyes of the public.
To topple this record, the industry has not bothered with the Cloncurry approach – that of seeking to discredit the record itself – as that appeared to be, and was, merely sour grapes and spin.

Fig.1 – Badwater
Instead, the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), has set up their own temperature instrument in Death Valley, even though there is already a long-standing instrument at Furnace Creek right in the open central part of the valley.
The new instrument is located 20 miles south of Furnace Creek at Badwater (Fig.1).
The photo shows the Badwater area with a large salt pan stretching into the far distance, caused by evaporation of salty water welling up from a spring just metres this side of the sign shown in the photo.

Fig.2 – GISS Historical Data for Furnace Creek
It was at Furnace Creek that the all-time hottest record in the USA was broken, 57°C. ( 134°F.) in 1913, just 2°F short of the Libyan all-time record.
The GISS historical data for Death Valley (i.e. Furnace Creek) is presented left and shows no overall warming at Death Valley since the 1950s.
The new instrument at Badwater was installed in the late 1990s, but it must be stressed that the record left is for Furnace Creek, not Badwater. Yet the public plaque on the instrument at Badwater implies otherwise.

Fig.3 – Part of the Badwater Plaque
Here is how the public plaque at Badwater misrepresents Death Valley (Fig.3). It’s red graph line traces the same data as the one above, and it is immediately clear that the ARC graph differs from GISS in that the ARC graph shows a continuous warming whereas the GISS graph only shows warming pre-1950s with little long-term change since. They can’t both be right. The plaque also said –
“During the summer of 1998 – the warmest year on record – we recorded the hottest air temperature anywhere in the world of 53.06°C ±0.1°C (128°F) on 17 July 1998 at 3:15 pm local standard time.”
Having mentioned 1998, that year was conveniently left off the chart. And with good reason, as Fig.2 shows that 1998 was a particularly cool year.

(left) Fig.4 – The Badwater instrument.
What exactly do those skilfully crafted words on the plaque mean anyway? Note, it refers to 1998 as the `warmest year on record’, but omits to say they are referring to the world as whole, not to Death Valley itself. 1998 at Death Valley (Furnace Creek) was actually cooler than usual.
The plaque claims Death Valley recorded the hottest air temperature anywhere in the world on 17th July 1998 – implying it was an all-time world record. It was not. It was referring to 1998 only. Actually, the hottest temperature ever recorded at Death Valley was way back in 1913 on 10th July – a whopping 134°F (57°C).
The sharp dip in temperature near the end of the record (Fig.2) was – 1998 ! – the `warmest year on record’ according to the plaque. In fact, 1998 was the coolest year at Death Valley since 1945, belying the implied claims about 1998.
Note how the ARC plaque refers to `Death Valley’ generally and not Badwater or Furnace Creek specifically. This merging of two quite different locations 20 miles apart is itself misleading to the public who may be unaware that `Death Valley’ now has more than one weather station.
A photo of the weather instrument at Badwater is shown left, the small yellow plaque mounted low down on the structure. I visited there during my trip in April this year.
Unlike the Furnace Creek instrument which is located in the open centre of the big valley, the new instrument has been mounted next to the eastern side of the valley at Badwater. The local topography is such that the instrument sits in a curved hollow (topographical map – Fig.5) so that it is well sheltered from all but westerly winds, and fully exposed to the afternoon summer sun. In fact, the whole area around the instrument is a perfect afternoon sun trap.
On the east side of the instrument is a high west-facing cliff over 500 feet tall, a cliff which will heat up magnificently in the afternoon sun on a hot summer’s day. 280 feet up on that cliff is a large sign which says `mean sea level’ (Badwater is 285 feet below sea level).

Fig.5 – Topographical Map of the Badwater area
Rising steeply above the cliff is the aptly named Dantes Peak, 785 feet high, overlooking what must be the nearest thing to `Dante’s Hell’ on Earth – Badwater in Death Valley.
On the western side of the instrument is a vast white salt pan, caused by salt deposits from a spring bubbling up from underground (the `bad water’) (Fig.1&6). This salt pan has a high albedo to sunlight so that the afternoon sun will reflect light and heat off the white expanse directly onto the cliff and the instrument itself. On a bright afternoon, it will act almost like a mirror to sunlight.


Fig.6 – The vast salt pan and salty spring directly to the west of the instrument
In all of Death Valley, the ARC has chosen just about the hottest spot possible in the hottest valley in North America. They have in effect put it into a natural oven – and done so in the full knowledge of Badwater’s topography. Now all they have to do is wait – wait for the inevitable day when the conditions will be just right – clear skies, still air, a blazing sun, and that instrument will heat up from the combined heating of the air, the immense heating from the nearby cliff only metres behind the instrument, the intense reflected heat radiation from the salt pan, and the mercury will very likely fall over the Libyan line and record the `hottest temperature ever measured on earth’.
Then we will see the champagne corks fly as the greenhouse industry will cry with righteous indignation, announcing the `new hottest temperature ever recorded on earth’, how it’s all due to global warming etc. etc. and all the time, the whole thing will be about as fake as a three dollar bill.
Even the wording on the plaque on the instrument betrays the real intent – the exclusive emphasis on the significance of heat, of global warming, of record-breaking temperatures, of the `hottest year ever’ etc. The plaque speaks of little else. Even the opening words of the text are `Carbon dioxide released by human activities etc. ….’. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that record-breaking is the primary purpose of the instrument, not genuine climatic research.

Fig.7 – The full information contained on the public plaque
This is further suggested by The Ames Astrogram, February 7, 2000, Page 2, who reported on a field trip by some of its scientists to Death Valley, (among them Dr Chris McKay who is cited on the plaque), and made this reference to the Badwater weather station – “The next stop was Badwater — minus284 feet below sea level, the lowest point in North America. McKay checked on a weather station he had installed at Badwater two years ago to precisely measure the temperature changes there and monitor global warming — which is much more noticeable in an extremely hot environment like Death Valley. In1999, McKay’s weather station recorded the continent’s highest temperature — a toasty 53.01 C.”
Even here, we have the focus squarely on global warming and breaking records just as on the plaque. ARC even reports the breaking of a continental record. If the Libyan world record of 1922 is broken, as seems inevitable at Badwater eventually, we can expect the full media scare treatment.
Death Valley is an interesting natural phenomenon because this valley is so unique, but the only instrument which will be credible in setting records or trends is the one at Furnace Creek, set properly in the open middle of the valley with a long respectable history of temperature data behind it.
If there is a media announcement of a record being broken at Death Valley, the skeptical observer should immediately demand to know if the record was broken at Furnace Creek, or at Badwater. If it is Furnace Creek, then the record will be quite genuine. But if it is Badwater, then the record will be a complete fake.

===============================================================
Mr. Daly didn’t have the advantage of Google Earth. It allows us to see that even in one of the most remote and desolate of places, there’s a road and parking lot nearby:

Google Earth street view:

Someday, in the future, this post may be referenced when a new world record temperature is recorded in Death Valley. If there is a new all time high at Badwater, making it the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth, I hope a future researcher will point out the siting/placement issue of the station at Badwater. – Anthony

Scott Morrison has delivered a stunning broadside at the globalist elite who fancy themselves the born rulers of a New World Order. In a speech that will certainly give the globalists a fit of the vapours, Morrison has reaffirmed the primacy of national sovereignty. Stand by for shrieks of “populism!” and “Trumpism!”



Scott Morrison is not only drawing a line in the sand on national sovereignty, but he is also reaffirming Coalition tradition and championing the “Forgotten People”, the “Quiet Australians” against the noisy elite.



Scott Morrison has declared his government will lead the charge in asserting the authority of ­nation states over unelected ­international ­institutions, such as the UN.



The Prime Minister, in a major foreign policy address…signalled Australia would seek to play a greater role in shaping a new economic and strategic world order.



Mr Morrison’s speech was aimed squarely at the push by the UN to set the global agenda on ­issues such as climate change and refugee policies.



As democratic nations increasingly band together to counter a rising China, Mr Morrison ­announced he would visit India and Japan early next year and ­Indonesia next month.



These are exactly the key allies, along with the US, that Australia and New Zealand should be [courting as a foil to China](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/how-should-we-defend-ourselves-against-china-pt-2/). All have a mutual self-interest against the rising dragon.



While Mr Morrison recognised the benefits the global economy had brought Australia, he declared that the ballot box should always be more powerful than international institutions.



This is the difference between globalisation and globalism. One is the natural, historical process of human communities sharing resources through trade, to their mutual benefit. It’s a process at least as old as the Silk Road from Europe to China.



The other, though, is the conceit that unelected international institutions can and should override national sovereignty. It’s an elitist doctrine that assumes that the “Guardian caste” are simply better, wiser and more entitled to rule than the hoi polloi with their ballot papers.



“Only a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia.”



Scott Morrison has defined the type of globalisation he does not like.



The Prime Minister remains an advocate of free trade, low tariff barriers, a rules-based international order and all the rest, but in a powerful address to the Lowy Institute he has set out his conviction that effective international action on big global issues comes from nation states co-operating freely.



As he puts it, “individual, like-minded sovereign nations acting together with enlightened self-interest”.



As opposed to this, he rejects the arrogance of a “new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies”.



This kind of globalism, Morrison rightly argues, leads to “elite opinion and attitudes” that “become disconnected from the mainstream” in their societies.



This in turn produces an alienating era of “insiders and outsiders”.



Globalists are invariably the sort of modern leftist who reaps the benefits of wealth and privilege while espousing a hypocritical socialism-for-the-rich. Just as socialists are horrified by the thought of a free market unshackled from bureaucracy, globalists are terrified of a world without a global ruler – a dictatorship of the elite.



Morrison is not championing a heedless beggar-thy-neighbour nationalism. Rather, with admirable realism, he is sketching the only kind of international co-operation that ever really works, that of strong nations pursuing enlightened self-interest and co-operating on shared projects arising from shared interests and shared values. If Morrison had been making this speech in Britain, it would sound like a pro-Brexit speech.



In Australia’s context, the criticism he makes is more directed at the plethora of UN agencies, most of which have no public profile in Australia, which criticise Canberra policy on secure borders, refugee flows, climate change, aid budgets and the many weird contortions and inversions of human rights that UN agencies and their dependent NGOs promote.



The UN agencies take special delight in criticising nations such as Australia while avoiding criticism of the nations that routinely commit crimes against humanity.



The UN has steadily betrayed its own charter, for decades. The EU is desperate to stamp out people’s movements, from Brexit to the Yellow Jackets. The nomenklatura jealously guards its privilege. Stand by for the elites and their mouthpieces, from _The Guardian_ and _The Economist_ to arrogant, globalist politicians, to attack Morrison for all they’re worth.



 **Morrison’s next meeting with Jacinda Ardern ought to be interesting.**

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeomar scientist dares to go public, criticizes publication censorship: criticism of IPCC models unwanted!
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Vladimir Semenov is a scientist at the Geomar Institute in Kiel, Germany. In 2009, together with colleague Mojib Latif and other colleagues, he submitted a manuscript to the Journal of Climate in which the authors feared that the CO2 climate sensitivity in the climate models was possibly pegged too high. During the peer-review process the reviewers requested that all passages containing doubt over Co2’s impact on climate be deleted, otherwise the paper would not get published. And so it happened: An entire section had to be removed before the study finally got published in 2010:
Semenov, V., Latif, M., Dommenget, D., Keenlyside, N., Strehz, A., Martin, T. und Park, W. (2010) The Impact of North Atlantic-Arctic Multidecadal Variability on Northern Hemisphere Surface Air Temperature Journal of Climate, 23 (21). pp. 5668-5677. DOI 10.1175/2010JCLI3347.1.
In the wake of the mobbing affair concerning the former director of the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute, Lennart Bengtsson, Mr. Semenov gathered the courage to take the issue to the public. He criticized that deleting the part challenging the IPCC model in his paper was a form of censorship.
The respected British daily The Times prominently reported on the matter on 8 July 2014 on the front page of its Environment section:
Voices of dissent drowned out by climate change scientists
Research that questioned the accuracy of computer models used to predict global warming was “censored” by climate scientists, it was alleged yesterday. One academic reviewer said that a section should not be published because it “would lead to unnecessary confusion in the climate science community”. Another wrote: “This entire discussion has to disappear.” The paper suggested that the computer models used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were flawed, resulting in human influence on the climate being exaggerated and the impact of natural variability being underplayed. The findings could have profound implications. If correct, they could mean that greenhouse gases have less impact than the IPCC has predicted and that the risk of catastrophic global warming has been overstated. However, the questions raised about the models were deleted from the paper before it was published in 2010 in the American Meteorological Society’s Journal of Climate. The paper had been submitted in July 2009, when many climate scientists were urging world leaders to agree a global deal on cutting emissions at the Copenhagen climate change summit in December that year. Vladimir Semenov, a climate scientist at the Geomar institute in Kiel, Germany, said the questions he and six others had posed in the original version of the paper were valid and removing them was “a kind of censorship.”

Also a presentation made by the Geomar team in July 2013 in den USA fits nicely (see our blog article “Mojib Latif in presentation in the USA: Climate sensitivity is set too high by the IPCC CO2“). With one exception (T. Martin), all the authors took a position that is identical to that in the publication in the Journal of Climate of 2010. In the conclusion of the presentation, the scientists state on slide no. 30:
(1) ‘MOC variability appears to be predictable about a decade ahead.’
(2) ‘The most recent decades contain a strong contribution from the AMO (MOC) even on a global scale,’ see also slide no.16.
(3) ‘This raises questions about the average climate sensitivity of the IPCC models,’ see also slide no. 21: ‘Implication: Climate sensitivity is too high’.

Well, we are all going to die; only that and taxes are certain on this planet.



However, the current tsunami of climate gloom, led by St Greta of Thunberg, the Extinction Rebellion crowd and school strikes for climate are having an actual and real harmful effect on children.



When you need to have experts warning parents against “terrifying” their youngsters with talk of climate catastrophe, the wheels really have fallen off.



A group of psychologists working with the University of Bath says it is receiving a growing volume of enquiries from teachers, doctors and therapists unable to cope.



The Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) told The Daily Telegraph **some children complaining of eco-anxiety have even been given psychiatric drugs.**



I guess the next conspiracy theory will be that the climate crisis is being pushed by Big Pharma.



The body is campaigning for anxiety specifically caused by fear for the future of the planet to be **recognised as a psychological phenomenon**.



However, they do not want it classed as a mental illness because, unlike standard anxiety, the cause of the worry is **“rational”**.



Well, that must make _The BFD_ readers – irrational.



“A lot of parents are coming into therapy asking for help with the children and it has escalated a lot this summer,” said Caroline Hickman, a teaching fellow at Bath and a CPA executive.



“The symptoms are the same [as clinical anxiety], the feelings are the same, but the cause is different.



“The fear is of environmental doom – that we’re all going to die.” […]



“Parents need to find some words to talk about it that is age-appropriate and not terrifying,” she said.



“You need to separate what is fact from what is unknown: tell them some species are going extinct and some humans are being harmed, but don’t say we’re all going to die, because that isn’t true.”



Which humans are being harmed? Which species are going extinct because of CO2?



“What you don’t want is that child to collapse in a well of depression saying “what’s the point in going to university”, or “what’s the point of doing my exams”, which I have heard children say.”



The CPA recommends a four-stage approach to explaining responsibly climate change to children without scaring them.



Eco-anxiety is steadily gaining recognition in the academic community. […]

"Thousands of years ago, every lake was like Great Bear Lake. So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it. So beautiful that people composed love songs to it. So mysterious that many believed it was alive. Today, of the 10 largest lakes in the world, it is the last one that remains essentially primeval. Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada. At just over 12, 000 square miles, the lake is the eighth largest in the world. It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior, and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year. The surrounding area is wilderness too  —   a sprawling land of untouched boreal forest and tundra, rivers and mountains. The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline, population 503. This isolated community is mostly Sahtuto’ine, meaning the Bear Lake People. They are as connected to the lake as the name implies, and for practical, cultural, historic and even prophetic reasons, they are determined to keep it pristine. Their efforts paid off in 2016. In March, the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Called the Tsá Tué Biosphere Reserve, it is the largest in North America, and the first in the world to be led by an indigenous community. Several months later, the Canadian government granted Deline   ensuring local control in areas like language and education. It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. Taken together, the Unesco and   announcements reinforce Deline’s ability to control what happens to Great Bear Lake. David Livingstone, now retired after decades of working on environmental issues for the Canadian government in the far north, helped Deline apply for Unesco designation. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is “not just a body of water it’s fundamental to their culture,” he said. “The folks in Deline consider the lake to be a living thing. ” Great Bear Lake is important to Mr. Livingstone as well. “It is the last great lake of its size and quality on the planet,” he said. “It’s like the Mona Lisa  —   a world treasure. ” I had spent an hour or two in Deline back in 2014, as an American diplomat posted to Canada. It was July and the lake was   endless and flat to the horizon. During my   tour, it was the sole time I needed a translator, because many Deline elders speak only their own language, North Slavey. This past November, I returned to Deline to learn more about the community’s relationship with the lake, to witness the interplay of culture, language, wilderness and isolation that makes this area so distinct. It was late afternoon when the small plane dipped through a thick,   cloud layer and I saw boreal forest  —   part of a vast biome that stretches across northern North America and Eurasia  —   as far as the eye could see. The plane descended toward a slender strip covered in white, Deline’s single runway. It was a short drive from the airport to the hotel where I was staying, the   Grey Goose Lodge. For such a tiny community, Deline has more tourist infrastructure than I expected, including a small handicrafts store in the hotel and an ambition to welcome the growing number of tourists who travel to Canada’s north for a winter and wilderness experience. The evening I arrived, I met with Morris Neyelle, a member of the new governing council, the K’aowedo Ke, as well as Danny Gaudet, a local businessman who was Deline’s lead negotiator for  . Sworn in on Sept. 1, the new Deline Got’ine Government is responsible for delivering an array of local programs and services. Mr. Neyelle, 65, tall and   switches easily between English and North Slavey. He said   allowed the residents of Deline to preserve their way of life and to use these traditions to tackle modern problems. In the past, Mr. Gaudet added, people would look only to the national and provincial government for help. Now, Deline would decide what was best for its people. This included making their own decisions about economic development, such as elevating cultural tourism through the   Destination Deline program. “Just on tourism alone, we think we can probably put everyone to work in this town,” Mr. Gaudet said. Protecting the lake, however, is not just about   and increased tourism. For the Sahtuto’ine, Mr. Neyelle and Mr. Gaudet explained, the lake was a powerful force in the world: a place critical to the survival of the human species. This belief is based on the prophecies of a Sahtuto’ine elder named Eht’se Ayah, who died in 1940. Some believe Mr. Ayah’s prophecies are literal, others believe they are allegory. Mr. Ayah foretold that in the future, people from the south would come to Great Bear Lake because it would be one of the few places left with water to drink and fish to eat. He said so many boats would come that you could walk from one to another without entering the water. Simply put, Great Bear Lake would be a last refuge for humanity. Mr. Gaudet said the predictions were a big reason the new government pushed to have authority over everyone in the area, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. If “hundreds of thousands of people” come because of the prophecies and because “we have the freshest water in the world,” he said, then “you have to live under our rules. ” People in Deline told me that the weather had been changing in recent years, and that the summer season was getting longer. The lake is taking longer to freeze, and it’s melting earlier. Mr. Neyelle said climate change added a note of urgency to the prophecies they may come true sooner than expected. “Maybe we’re in that era now where everything is changing,” he said, and people from the south “are going to come. ” Late that evening, I walked along Deline’s main street and tried to imagine hundreds of thousands of people coming to the area. It was hard to do. The night sky was overcast, and the temperature had dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius). Specks of ice from the   of Great Bear Lake filled the air. The flecks caused outdoor lights to reflect upward, creating optical illusions called light pillars that made it seem as if each light had become a searchlight aimed at the sky. I walked off the road and into a thicket of boreal forest. Hoarfrost from the lake clung to every surface of the trees and bushes. It covered even the undersides of spruce needles. I was hundreds of feet from the shoreline, yet Great Bear Lake was everywhere  —   in the air, on the ground and in the trees. At 8 the next morning, I awoke to darkness. From November until January, Deline gets less than five hours of sun each day, although it makes up for that between May and July, when it gets over 22 hours daily. Eventually, I saw a glimmer of predawn on the horizon, but it was not until 10:30 a. m. that the first rays of sun peeked out. I walked outside and headed toward the church for Sunday Mass. The round,   structure was in town, on the shore of Great Bear Lake. Chunks and shards of ice lay heaped on the shoreline, while farther out, the surface of the lake was   alternately skimmed white with snow or glistening with ice that froze overnight. A wedge of open water was visible just offshore. It looked turbulent, straining and frothing where it encountered the surface ice, as if it were determined not to freeze. Deline is predominantly Roman Catholic. Inside the church, I witnessed the community’s focus on preserving North Slavey. An elder was leading the congregation in the rosary. His call was in North Slavey, and the response was in a mix of Slavey and English. During the Mass, the Gospel and the homily were in English, followed by an    translation into North Slavey. The language is spoken everywhere  —   in church, on the streets and at home  —   as part of a concerted effort to keep it alive. The 2011 Canadian census counted only 225 people who identified the language as their mother tongue. But North Slavey is an official language of the Deline Got’ine Government and of the Northwest Territories. For the moment, North Slavey is not on the verge of extinction. It belongs to a family of North American indigenous languages that includes Apache and Navajo. Children in Deline’s primary school are taught the language this year, an elder began to teach North Slavey to high school students. Mr. Neyelle said the new government wanted to make acquiring and passing on the language a priority because it believed speaking North Slavey was crucial to preserving the culture. “Slavey is ours,” he said. “That’s where our powers lay. ” He said his descriptions in Slavey had more depth and color than those in English, even though he was fluent in both. Teenagers I spoke to echoed this thought. They said jokes were funnier in Slavey. After Mass, I walked over to Great Bear Lake, curious about the little skein of open water I had seen hours earlier. To my surprise, it had disappeared. Thinking I was turned around, I kept searching, but saw only the reflective surface of new ice and beyond that, a large field of older,   ice. Mr. Neyelle confirmed that the water had frozen over during the time I was in church. He was not surprised it had happened so quickly. Sometimes, he said, you could actually see ice creeping across open water. His description made it seem like a fox or wolf stalking its prey. We drove to Ski Hill, a gathering place for the community perched on top of a cleared rise near town. The sun had been up for three hours, but already it was getting dark. Several pickup trucks were parked close together, next to a recently built hut with a blazing fire pit in the middle. Children were sledding (despite the name of the hill, no one actually skis there) and some of the adults were   a new snowmobile with a powerful engine. Strips of lake trout along with moose meat and hot dogs cooked on top of barrel grills. The atmosphere was festive, perhaps because it seemed as if Great Bear Lake was finally freezing over. This meant access to the entire lake, better fishing and, eventually, an ice road that would temporarily connect Deline to the outside world. Or perhaps it was festive because these were friends gathering on a Sunday to enjoy the sunset, grilled food and conversation in North Slavey and in English. It reminded me that despite the groundbreaking nature of Deline’s   and Unesco status, it was still a small town. The type of town where the phone directory is a piece of paper taped to the wall. One elder I met there was Charlie Neyelle, 72, Morris Neyelle’s older brother and the elders’ representative on the K’aowedo Ke. Charlie Neyelle is a spiritual and mental health guide for the community, and pushed for   and preservation of Great Bear Lake. I asked him a question I had posed to many people during my time in Deline: What does Great Bear Lake mean to you? In response, Mr. Neyelle told me the   story, about a Sahtuto’ine ancestor who lived around Great Bear Lake, in an area called Caribou Point. One day the fisherman set out four hooks. When the fisherman returned to check on them, a lake trout had broken one of the lines and taken the hook. This bothered the fisherman, because in those days, hooks were extremely valuable. So that night, he transformed himself into a losch, also known as burbot, a freshwater version of cod. The fisherman swam down to the middle of the lake to look for the hook and heard a booming sound. There, at the bottom, he saw a gigantic beating heart. All the species of fish  —   trout, whitefish, pickerel, herring, suckers  —   faced the heart, surrounding and protecting it. He swam back to shore after seeing this, and the following morning when he went to check on his three hooks, he found three trout. One of them had the hook he had lost the day before dangling from its mouth. When the fisherman saw the   he realized Great Bear Lake was alive, Mr. Neyelle said. “The lake gives life to the universal: grass, insects, willow, everything. ” Some in Deline believe that the   at the bottom of the lake gives life to all of the lakes, oceans and rivers in the world. For the Sahtuto’ine, this belief underscores not only why Great Bear Lake must be protected, but also why its protection is of global importance. Toward the end of our conversation, Mr. Neyelle also mentioned Eht’se Ayah’s prophecy. “When there is no food or water all around the world, many will come to Great Bear Lake,” he said. “It will be one of the last places that has both. ” No matter how many times I heard this apocalyptic prediction, it was jarring to hear, especially when inserted into conversations about Great Bear Lake’s beauty and providence. The regular evocation of this prophecy reminded me of what happened on the other side of the lake in the 1940s, in Port Radium. The site of a large uranium ore mine, it was the most significant industrial development in Great Bear Lake’s history. During World War II, uranium from Port Radium was sent to the United States for the war effort, where it provided much of the material for the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although it stopped producing uranium in 1960 and is now abandoned, Port Radium was at its peak larger than Deline. Irene Kodakin was born near Port Radium in 1952, when the mine was still in operation. Now living in Deline, she describes Port Radium as a thriving community of aboriginal and nonaboriginal workers brought to work in the mines. Ms. Kodakin has happy memories of her childhood, in stark contrast to her experience in a residential school in Inuvik, a town more than 400 miles away. For much of the 20th century, the Canadian government forced many aboriginal children into these schools, with the goal of assimilating them into Canadian culture. “They would put their hand in our mouths and just press our bottom lips to our teeth until it bleeds” if you speak Slavey, she said. When she returned home, she could no longer speak North Slavey. Her older sister had to translate when Ms. Kodakin spoke to her own father. A generation of Sahtuto’ine lived and worked at Port Radium. Although it was known at the time that exposure to uranium was dangerous, this warning did not reach them. Long after the mine closed, Sahtuto’ine who had been in Port Radium began to die of various cancers. Ms. Kodakin’s father, George Kodakin, who had become a respected    chief in Deline, died of cancer at age 64. Ms. Kodakin’s older sister, aunts and uncles also died of it, and she believes the mine was the cause. Ms. Kodakin’s belief is shared by many in the community, including Gina Beyha, a coordinator for the Unesco Biosphere Reserve who was a nurse in Deline for 15 years. While researching links between cancer and Port Radium, Ms. Beyha and others discovered that uranium taken from the sacred Great Bear Lake was most likely used in the bombs that detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many people, especially the elders, were aghast, Ms. Beyha said. In 1998, Deline sent a delegation to Japan for the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony. It was a gesture of atonement as well as a way to start healing, particularly for the widows of men who had worked at Port Radium, who made traditional gifts that the delegation presented to the Japanese. During my time in Deline, the legacies of Port Radium and the residential schools were among many reasons people gave for protecting Great Bear Lake and for negotiating  . The others: to preserve Sahtuto’ine culture, to develop tourism, to honor elders and ancestors, and to prepare for the realization of Eht’se Ayah’s prophecies. After a week of talking with many Deline residents, these reasons all seemed tightly connected and at the core of the community’s identity. Those not living on Great Bear Lake, however, gave another reason that was perhaps the simplest of all. The lake, like the Mona Lisa, is magnificent. It draws the gaze as an ocean does. The slate blue ice and white snow merge seamlessly into the sky so that when you leave the shoreline, with brittle tiles of ice cracking underfoot, it feels like stepping into a cloud. And in the brief moments when the wind dies down, the silence is as deep and enormous as the lake itself. During my last days in the area, I went exploring with a Deline resident, Leeroy Andre, his wife, Diane, and his    daughter, Whitney. We would leave at sunrise and plunge into the boreal forest, following trails and old seismic lines. In the distance lay the frozen sheet of Great Bear Lake, and beyond, thick rolls of mist rose toward the sun, evidence of open water at the edge of the horizon. In North Slavey, this mist is called  . It is a land of ptarmigan and marten, musk ox, caribou, moose, wolf and bear. One day, after we had been out four hours, we came across a huge abandoned beaver lodge at least six feet high and twice as long. Around then, despite my wearing several layers, a parka and other gear, the cold started after me. It crept up from the ground onto my snowmobile. It cracked the rubber of my boots and shouldered inside. If I concentrated, I could feel ice crystals forming in my toes. When we started moving again, the cold took on the shape of a blanket and patiently tried to cover my shoulders and back. At sunset, the moon appeared like a slender comma above the trees, glowing in the   sky. We drove through marshmallow mounds: berry bushes covered in snow and hoarfrost for most of the year before they emerge in the summer and grow leaves and berries as fast as they can. Dark came quickly, and we sped across yet another small lake connected to Great Bear Lake. The snowmobile’s headlight illuminated a blizzard of snowflakes as shiny as diamonds, as if the land were showing what true wealth looked like. The northern lights appeared like a hallucination across the   sky. For hours they moved in slow motion above me, as the land seemed to recede and I faced the cosmos. If a recent scientific theory proves correct, somewhere out in space is the origin of the earth’s water, which fills Great Bear Lake and gives us life. This connected with something I was told when I first arrived in Deline. To the Sahtuto’ine, Great Bear Lake is not just a lake. They are part of it and it is part of them. No longer does this seem like a belief unique to their culture  —   it sounds like a universal truth. The water from Great Bear Lake flows in our veins, too."

The world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non‐​Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.



Religious persecution is a global scourge. Many of the worst oppressors are Muslim nations. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Bahrain, Iraq and Egypt are all important international actors. All also mistreat, or acquiesce in the mistreatment of, anyone not a Muslim. A few of them even victimize Muslims — of the wrong variety.



Islamabad is another frequent offender. The State Department’s report on religious liberty in Pakistan noted that “The constitution and other laws and policies officially restrict religious freedom and, in practice, the government enforced many of these restrictions. The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom continued to be poor.”



Minority faiths face violent attack. Believers are killed, churches are bombed, buses are attacked, homes are destroyed, social gatherings are targeted. Warned the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in its recent report: “In the past year, conditions hit an all‐​time low due to chronic sectarian violence targeting mostly Shia Muslims but also Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus.” Last year the Commission cited a spike in violence against Shiites as well as “numerous attacks against innocent Pakistanis” of other religions.





Blasphemy laws threaten basic individual liberties around the globe.



Although Islamabad did not launch these assaults, it did little to prevent or redress them. Even when scores or more are killed at a time there often is no response. Indeed, top government officials have been gunned down for defending freedom of conscience with no one arrested, let alone convicted. Explained State: “The government’s limited capacity and will to investigate or prosecute the perpetrators of increasing extremist attacks against religious minorities and on members of the Muslim majority promoting tolerance, allowed the climate of impunity to continue.”



The most common tool of persecution may be a charge of blasphemy. Said USCIRF: “The country’s blasphemy laws, used predominantly in Punjab province, but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and frequently result in imprisonment.” Two years ago a mentally handicapped 12‐​year‐​old Christian girl was charged; after an international outcry even the authorities became embarrassed and the case was dismissed, an unusual outcome.



The blasphemy laws are made for abuse. Explained the Commission, “The so‐​called crime carries the death penalty or life in prison, does not require proof of intent or evidence to be presented after allegations are made, and does not include penalties for false allegations.” In fact, courts hesitate to even hear evidence, lest doing so also be considered blasphemy. With evidence unnecessary, the charge has become a weapon routinely used in personal and business disputes, including a means to exact revenge for imagined offenses.



Between 1986 and 2006 695 people were charged with blasphemy. Today 16 people are on death row and another 20 are serving life sentences. Three Christians have been sentenced to death in the last few months. Many other Pakistanis are in prison waiting for trial, including English professor Junaid Hafeez, accused of blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. Penalties are not limited to the law. Explained the group Freedom House: “Regardless of the motives behind their charges and the outcome of their cases, those accused of blasphemy are subject to job discrimination, ostracism from their communities and neighborhoods, and even physical violence and murder at the hands of angry mobs, forcing many to live in fear.” Since 1990 at least 52 people charged with blasphemy have been killed before reaching trial.



Judges who acquitted defendants and politicians who talked of reforming the blasphemy laws also have been assassinated. In May gunmen killed Rashid Rehman, a human rights lawyer who was defending Hafeez. Previously fellow attorneys threatened Rehman, “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more.” A pamphlet circulated after the murder asserting that Rehman met his “rightful end.” He was the first defense lawyer killed. He probably won’t be the last.



Pakistan has jailed more people for blasphemy than any other nation, but it is not the only country which religious free speech. An incredible 14 of 20 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa criminalize blasphemy. Nine of 50 in the Asia Pacific, seven of 45 in Europe and three of 48 in SubSaharan Africa also do so. Eleven of 35 nations in the Americas have blasphemy laws. In the U.S. several states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, retain blasphemy laws, though they do not enforce them.



The group Freedom House published a detailed report on the detrimental impact of blasphemy laws on human rights. Put simply, these measures “impose undue restrictions on freedom of expression” and are “prone to arbitrary or overly broad application, particularly in settings where there are no checks and balances in place to prevent abuses.” Freedom House highlighted Algeria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia and Poland, as well as Pakistan.



In March the Commission made much the same point, issuing a special report entitled “Prisoners of Belief: Individuals Jailed Under Blasphemy Laws.” Victims include three atheist bloggers in Bangladesh, numerous Iranian Bahai’s, Christians and Sufi and Sunni Muslims, 63 Sunnis and Christians in Egypt, an atheist writer in Kazakhstan, scores of Indonesians and a Saudi blogger. Even Greece and Turkey have charged people with blasphemy.



The Arab Spring was supposed to bring liberty to the Mideast, but it had the opposite effect in many countries. For instance, in Kuwait, perhaps the most liberal Gulf State, the Islamist‐​dominated Assembly elected in early 2012 voted to impose the death penalty on Muslims convicted of blasphemy. The Emir blocked the law and later changed the election rules, resulting in a more moderate legislature.



Blasphemy prosecutions were initiated in post‐​revolution Egypt and even Tunisia, viewed as the most successful participant in the Arab Spring. USCIRF commissioners Zuhdi Jasser and Katrina Lantos Swett wrote: “Rather than giving rise to greater individual liberty, this trend could turn the Arab Spring into a repressive winter, with forces of intolerance and tyranny dashing hopes for genuine freedom and liberal democracy.”



Nevertheless, Pakistan remains a particular problem. The country’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, emphasized the importance of religious liberty. But Pakistan became more Islamic over time, a process accelerated by dictator Mohammed Zia ul‐​Haq. His government not only criminalized blasphemy, but, noted Freedom House, enacted new laws which imposed “harsh Shari’a punishments for extramarital sex, theft and violations of the prohibition of alcohol.”



The impact of such laws fell most heavily on religious minorities and liberals. Discrimination, intolerance and violence have become pervasive. Noted Freedom House: “it is clear that Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are used politically and applied disproportionately to non‐​Muslims. Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” Intolerance has become the norm — in a strategically placed nation possessing nuclear weapons.



Unfortunately, there are spillover impacts from abusive blasphemy prosecutions. Warned Freedom House, in practice the blasphemy laws have led to “extended arbitrary detention.” The process also has undermined even limited due process, with convictions rendered on minimal to nonexistent evidence. Along the way defendants have suffered from official torture and private vigilante injustice.



Blasphemy laws threaten basic individual liberties around the globe. The measures are bad in Western nations. They are far worse in the Muslim world. The problem is particularly severe in Pakistan. Warned Freedom House: “Pakistan’s blasphemy laws foster an environment of intolerance and impunity, and lead to violations of a broad range of human rights, including the obvious rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to due process and a fair trial; freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and the right to life and security of the person.”



Obviously, there is little the U.S. can do directly about policy in Pakistan. However, the International Religious Freedom Act allows the State Department to designate countries as Countries of Particular Concern. Noted USCIRF: “Pakistan represents the worst situation in the world for religious freedom for countries not currently designated” as CPCs. Unfortunately, in its latest designation announced last month State continued to leave Islamabad off of the list. The Obama administration should remedy that lapse.



For some, religious liberty is but an afterthought, an esoteric principle with little practical impact. However, the willingness of foreign governments to respect freedom of conscience acts as the famed canary in the mine. A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected. And a society in which life and dignity of the human person is not respected is more likely to become a hothouse to ideas and beliefs hostile to America.



As we see in Pakistan today. Rising religious extremism, exemplified by abusive blasphemy prosecutions, threatens the integrity of the Pakistani state — and the security of its nuclear program. Although Americans cannot control policy in Pakistan, they can help highlight a problem that threatens people in that nation and ultimately this one as well.

 ** _Introduction_**



Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green, and distinguished members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify in today’s important hearing.



I am Louise Bennetts, Associate Director of Financial Regulation Studies at the Cato Institute, a non‐​profit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington, D.C.



Before I begin, I would like to highlight that all comments I make and opinions expressed herein are my own and do not represent any official positions of the Cato Institute or any other organization. In addition, outside of my interest as a U.S. resident, consumer and taxpayer, I have no financial interest in the subject matter before the Committee today, nor do I currently represent any entities that do.



 ** _Background_**



Since 2008, commentators, industry professionals, regulators, and elected officials have made numerous, often contradictory, suggestions about how to deal with, or avoid, banking crises. These suggestions range from “bailing in” creditors, to making banks smaller (whether through size caps or limitations on acquisitions), to limiting the activities that banks undertake (the “Volcker Rule” and similar initiatives), to imposing ever more stringent regulations, in particular, on larger organizations. In addition, increasingly regulators are looking inward, trying to insulate their domestic banking sectors from external shocks.i



In the United States since 2010 we have seen the rollout of one of the most comprehensive “reform” agendas targeting the financial services industry both in the United States and abroad. The centerpiece of the reform agenda — the Dodd‐​Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act — has **394** associated rulemaking requirements and already has spurred thousands of pages of related rules.



But this is just the tip of the iceberg. As of February 2014, only 52% of the rules required by the Act have been finalized.ii Around 20% have yet to be proposed. And Dodd‐​Frank is but one component of a far greater regulatory reform agenda that includes a complete overhaul of the capital and liquidity rules imposed on the U.S. banking sector (the “Basel III” regime); a radical revision of the regulation of nonbank financial companies such as insurance firms and asset managers; changes in the regulation of the U.S. operations of foreign banks; changes in the regulation of consumer credit; imposing new monitoring and enforcement obligations on banks on behalf of the Federal government. All of these new obligations are only magnified for banks and financial service companies that operate cross‐​border. In addition, barely a month passes without a new initiative aimed at the financial services sector being proposed either in Congress or through the regulatory agencies.iii While most of these proposals will never see the light of day, they nonetheless impose a significant cost on the private sector in terms of the uncertainty they generate and the time and resources private firms must spend on evaluating the potential impact of such proposals.



The question before the Committee today is: how is this regulatory overhaul impacting the global competitiveness of the American financial services sector and, indeed, American consumers of financial services? To date, no assessment has been made and no studies have been undertaken to assess the cumulative impact or cost of all this regulation. To answer this question, in my view, we need to address two related issues:



Before I discuss these two key points with an analysis of some specific cases, I would like to make a few observations about the United States’ position in the global economy. **The United States is a net importer of capital and a net exporter of financial services and products**. Despite, or possibly even because of, its inauspicious and crisis‐​prone banking history, the United States has the world’s most vibrant capital markets and, currently, has the only well‐​developed debt market and short‐​term or overnight dollar funding market. Many foreign companies and banks raise a significant portion of their non‐​depositary short‐​term funding in the United States.



However, while the United States may have had a head start, one cannot assume a permanent state of dominance. Steps are being taken to develop high yield and other short‐​term funding markets in South East Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore as well as in Europe (although the European funding markets remain weak).iv In addition to the large European banks, several emerging markets, most notably China, are taking noteworthy steps towards the creation of worldwide banking conglomerates, by acquiring significant stakes in banks and financial companies in the developing, and to a lesser extent, the developed world.



 ** _The Costs of Regulatory Fragmentation within the United States_**



The United States’ financial services sector has long been subject to a fragmented regulatory regime, in part due to the structural spilt that historically characterized the market (between activities such as loan‐​making and underwriting) and the deep‐​seated American aversion to the “universal” banking model.v In most countries, banks and financial services companies report to a single regulatory authority. In the United States, even monoline financial firms such as commercial or investment banks must report to more than one regulatory agency and these agencies frequently have overlapping jurisdiction. This creates a competitive disadvantage for U.S. financial institutions as it increases the costs associated with regulatory compliance, decreases the efficiency of both the regulators and the regulated, opens the door for regulatory arbitrage and creates a lack of transparency as to who bears ultimate responsibility for regulatory oversight.



It could also result in the release of rules and regulations that are contradictory in nature, making it impossible for a regulated entity to be compliant with all rules at all times. The Dodd‐​Frank Act made this problem worse not better. Instead of streamlining the regulatory agencies responsible for the oversight of the financial system, the Dodd‐​Frank Act adds several new regulatory bodies — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of Financial Research and the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel. It also gives overlapping jurisdiction to multiple regulators and carves up the regulatory “turf” in arbitrary ways.vi This has led to the situation where, for example, multiple versions of rules on the same topic have been released by more than one agency (such as was the case with the first release of the Volcker Rule proposal).



 ** _The Dangers of Financial Sector “Balkanization”_**



Several commentators and industry experts have drawn a parallel between the current climate in global financial regulation and the relations that characterized trade politics among the world’s largest economies in the early 1930s following the passage of the “Smoot‐​Hawley” Tariff Act, a situation known as “balkanization.”vii In this regard, particular attention has been paid to current measures that have protectionist implications or serve to encourage the further balkanization of financial services or the isolation of American banks, companies and individuals, (such as the Federal Reserve’s recent Foreign Banking Organization proposal or the FATCA legislation). I believe the comparison is well made.viii



In the two years following the passage of Smoot‐​Hawley, the volume of U.S. imports fell 40 percent. This was due, in part, to a decline in domestic demand, but scholars estimate that at least a quarter of this decline can be directly attributable to the act itself.ix In addition, retaliatory actions against the United States resulted in a decline of 60 percent in U.S. exports in the 1930s, and this discrimination against U.S. products persisted for decades. In addition, Smoot‐​Hawley encouraged other countries—most notably Germany—to institute retaliatory measures, leading to a worldwide trade freeze that exacerbated hardships for local consumers and almost certainly contributed to the increasingly Balkanized international environment in the period leading up to World War II.



Following a crisis, the natural inclination for any regional authority is to attempt to erect walls around local industries and operations to make it easier—at least, theoretically—to address problems at a local level. Usually this also serves to meet the demands of local interest groups harmed by the crisis. But for U.S. regulators, the lesson from the Smoot‐​Hawley experience should be clear: this approach may yield positive results in the immediate term only, if at all, and any positive outcomes are far outweighed by the negative effects of retaliation. As the world’s leading financial services economy, the actions of U.S. policymakers have a disproportionate effect on the global financial sector and are likely to spur retaliatory actions elsewhere in the world. When it comes to the regulatory “marketplace,” the United States is a “price‐​setter” and ought to lead by example.



Indeed, my great fear is that the response to the 2007-08 Financial Crisis in the United States may be a classic example of policymakers throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In this case it is global capital flows—as with global trade flows in the 1930s—that could potentially suffer a steep decline in the wake of the measures adopted to address the perceived problems in the financial services industry.



Although the increased size, depth, liquidity, and complexity of financial markets has received widespread criticism, including being labeled as a “cause” of the crisis, in my view this criticism is misplaced. It overlooks the significant global benefits that fluid and highly developed capital markets have accrued—benefits that have not come close to being wiped out even in the wake of the financial crisis.x



In the only detailed study released to date on the effect of post‐​crisis reforms on global capital flows, the McKinsey Global Institute (the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey and Co.) found that since 2008, cross‐​border capital flows have fallen dramatically as banks and borrowers deleverage.xi **The firm estimates that cross‐​border capital flows have declined 60 percent since 2007**.xii Financial assets had been increasing by close to 8 percent per annum since the early 1990s, but they are now growing at under 2 percent.xiii At the same time, **government debt securities have increased by more than $15.4 trillion worldwide**. The authors note that “for three decades, capital markets and banking systems rapidly expanded and diversified, but now that process—called financial deepening— has largely ground to a halt.… Today, global financial markets are at an inflection point. One path leads to a more balkanized structure that relies primarily on domestic capital formation and concentrates risks within local banking systems.”xiv



The study also notes: “facing new regulations on capital and liquidity as well as pressures from shareholders and regulators to reduce risk, **many banks in advanced economies are winnowing down the geographies and business lines in which they operate. Since early 2007, commercial banks have sold off more than $722 billion in assets and operations, with foreign operations accounting for almost half of this total.** Regulators in many countries are moving to exert more control over the foreign banks that remain active in their jurisdictions, in some cases requesting that banks operate as subsidiaries rather than branches.”xv



Although the “Foreign Banking Organization” rule release last month by the Federal Reserve (discussed below) may stop short of requiring the full subsidiarization of foreign banks’ U.S. operations, the likely chilling effect on global capital is the same. The McKinsey Global Institute study concludes with the warning that regional differences in the availability of capital could emerge and that regions with high savings rates could find themselves with surplus capital and a shortage of good investment opportunities, while other countries could find themselves short of capital and facing lower growth.xvi



Undoubtedly, there are many factors contributing to the collapse of global capital flows post‐​2008, not least the European public debt crisis, the weaknesses in the Chinese financial sector, and a general lack of investor confidence worldwide. Nonetheless, any measures on the part of U.S. regulators that have the effect—whether intentional or incidental—of hastening the decline of such flows should be approached with extreme caution. This is especially true when it is unclear whether the measures will deliver their promised benefits.xvii



 ** _U.S. Regulatory Overreach and Potential Retaliatory Actions against American Banks and Financial Services Firms: The Case of the Federal Reserve’s “Foreign Banking Organization” Proposal xviii_**



The Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal represents a seismic shift in the regulation of U.S.-based subsidiaries and operations of foreign banks. Since the passage of the International Banking Act of 1978, foreign banks seeking to operate in the United States have been afforded considerable flexibility in the structuring of their U.S. operations.xix The Federal Reserve would now change this approach for important market players. This would require foreign banks to transfer their U.S.-based operations to an existing holding company or to a newly created one.xx Once this transfer is complete, the subsidiary would be required to comply with U.S. capital and liquidity standards as well as U.S.-specific requirements such as single counterparty credit limits, enhanced risk management practices, and early remediation requirements _in addition_ to meeting all home country requirements.xxi



At the macro level, the proposal interferes with the ability of global banks to allocate capital and liquidity in the manner they determine to be most efficient. The proposal would trap a material amount of capital and liquidity inside the U.S. subsidiary, rendering it unusable for the rest of the institution. Ironically, the Federal Reserve itself noted the benefits of its traditional approach to foreign bank supervision in the preamble to the FBO proposal: “[T]he structural diversity and consolidated management of capital and liquidity permitted under th[is] approach has facilitated cross‐​border banking and increased global flows of capital and liquidity.”xxii But the corollary is also true. If such flows stimulate economic growth, any reduction in those flows is likely to inhibit growth and prolong recessionary or sluggish tendencies. This seems a major drawback to a proposal introduced at a time when the Federal Reserve is engaged in unprecedented expansionary monetary policies to stimulate growth.



The Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal also contains a potential serious drawback for American banks and financial services firms, particularly those with significant cross‐​border operations. If foreign regulators use the same reasoning as the Federal Reserve, the FBO proposal would likely further encourage additional protectionist measures to be taken by foreign regulators. These measures could include retaliatory actions against U.S. banking organizations with significant international operations.



Many foreign supervisors raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s proposal during the public comment process, and they may well take more drastic actions if the FBO proposal is retained.xxiii Indeed, if the United States’ principal “systemic” regulator takes the position that ex ante ring‐​fencing of the U.S. operations of foreign banks is necessary to safeguard the U.S. financial system, why would other home country regulators not follow suit? And if they do, we will see a domino effect where host countries impose inefficient individual capital and liquidity requirements or move to requiring full subsidiarization.xxiv Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal _explicitly_ questions the principle of international cooperation that has been at the heart of cross‐​border bank supervision and regulation for decades



 ** _“Optimal” Levels of Capital and American Competitiveness_**



It is an article of faith that “well‐​capitalized” banks are safer banks. There can be no doubt that despite meeting existing regulatory capital requirements, many banks were under‐​capitalized and over‐​leveraged going into the Financial Crisis in 07/08. This increased the need for these institutions to rely on volatile short‐​term funding. While it is easy to suggest banks need to be “well‐​capitalized,” no‐​one seems able to agree on exactly what this term means, hence the difficulties associated with structuring global capital standards and the resulting complexity of the Basel III regime and related initiatives. In addition, there is a clear trade‐​off here: imposing very stringent capital requirements unavoidably reduces the funds available to banks to lend out or otherwise put to use in the broader economy. But there is also a more fundamental question: are high levels of capital and low leverage really a cure‐​all for financial crises?



Many commentators have noted — correctly — that smaller commercial banks, particularly those with assets of less than a billion dollars — operate with much higher equity capital reserves and far lower leverage than their larger and more diversified peers. Yet, in the United States, these smaller banks have a significantly higher rate of failure than larger banks. If capital were the only measure of stability, why should this be so? As we learn during every financial crisis, banks fail for one reason — undiversified risk.



We cannot eliminate risk from the banking system. Banking is nothing more than the pooling and management of risk. But if we view undiversified risk as the key cause of bank failure, then initiatives such as the Basel III risk‐​weighting system can potentially heighten the riskiness of banks even though the intention is to make banks better capitalized. This is because the regime uses advanced modeling techniques to determine which classes of assets are “safer” than others. It then incentivizes banks to hold assets in those “safer “classes, resulting in the assets held by banks becoming more concentrated not less — at both the firm and the industry‐​level.



 **I support the use of risk weighting models at the individual firm level. But, the industry‐​wide reliance on the same financial models is a recipe for a future crisis because all financial models, regardless of the complexity or sophistication, will contain some errors and when adopted by all industry participants, these errors can lead to a system‐​wide problem.** The same concerns can be raised about the C‐​CAR/​stress‐​testing process run by the Federal Reserve in which all major U.S. banks participate. While the models the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether banks are adequately capitalized are extremely sophisticated, they are nonetheless just that — models. And early indications are that U.S. banks have become increasingly focused on aligning their models with that of the Federal Reserve instead of focusing on their own concerns about market risk.



Some policymakers have proposed including a simple leverage ratio be used as a “backstop”. I should note that the proposed leverage ratio is an **additional** measure, _not_ a replacement. It is also an idea that has far greater traction in the United States — while regulators in Europe and Asia will adopt some leverage measure, it is unlikely to be especially stringent. Therefore, a proposal such as the one contemplated by some senior officials at the FDIC is an added burden on U.S. financial institutions and creates a competitive disadvantage because it is one that their foreign peers will not be subject to. Although a leverage ratio has the benefit of simplicity as a standalone measure and can be easily monitored and understood, it nonetheless does not cure the fundamental flaw in the risk weighting system — the tendency for concentration in certain asset pools. Therefore as an addition to the Basel III regime it is not especially helpful, in my view. It is clear that many of the proponents of the initiative view it not as a means to create safer institutions, but rather as a means to downsize large institutions (by forcing them to include derivative and other off‐​balance sheet activities in their liability calculations). The effect of this is to drive those activities into the unregulated sector or into single‐​activity shops, which may not be the most desirable outcome and may further segment the market. But this begs the question: if we are so concerned about leverage, why do we continue to incentivize banks and individuals to become over‐​leveraged in the first place? We have a system that heavily penalizes equity holders, while rewarding holders of debt with tax breaks and the like. Instead of imposing blunt tools that require expensive monitoring and enforcement on these institutions, we could begin by reforming the incentive structure that they operate under.



 ** _Differing Approaches to Regulation: Europe v. the United States_**



It may be worth highlighting that the United States and the European parliament have taken very different approaches to imposing the financial reform agenda and that this may further place U.S. institutions at a disadvantage. The recent passage of the final “Volcker Rule” in the United States (in particular the ban on proprietary trading) and its equivalent proposal before the European parliament is a useful case in point. While I should note that I disagree with the imposition of a ban on proprietary trading in any form as I consider it to be unnecessary, it nonetheless illustrates the differences in approaches taken by the United States and Europe. I should also note that the proposal before the EEC is in its very early stages and may never be enacted in its current form or at all).



The Europeans favor a “principle‐​based” approach, by outlining a simple prohibition. They do not impose extensive or costly compliance and monitoring obligations. They do not attempt to guess the intention of the trader or list and carve out every scenario that may conceivably lead to or indicate the presence of proprietary trading. If a bank can demonstrate that its trading activities are nominally in the client interest, it should fall comfortably within the rule. In contrast, the final Volcker Rule in the United States is an extremely poorly‐​drafted and highly‐​technical document that spans hundreds of pages and imposes an extremely complex and costly regime on banks and industry participants.



 ** _Conclusion_**



The time has come to acknowledge that we are at a crossroads — globally and domestically. One path leads to a system where American banks and financial services firms, buckling under the weight of excessive and contradictory regulations, become less diversified, less competitive globally, more inward looking and, in my view, potentially more unstable. This path leads to a sub‐​optimal outcome — one in which financial firms are less focused on market drivers and meeting the needs of consumers and more on pleasing local regulatory authorities. Another path begins with the recognition that we already may have gone a step too far. The time has come to ask ourselves, “what was the purpose of this all?” If the purpose is to make the United States banking sector less crisis‐​prone, safer and more competitive, we need a comprehensive and realistic assessment of whether all these regulations — given their significant costs — are achieving that outcome. I thank‐​you for the opportunity to testify today.

vi The swap market is a good example of this. The CFTC has jurisdiction over ordinary swaps; the SEC has jurisdiction over security‐​based swaps. These agencies have taken different approaches to regulating the swap market, particularly in the agencies’ respective approaches to the cross‐​border application of the rules, creating much confusion for the market participants who are tasked with implementing the rules.

viii In June 1930, Congress passed the Tariff Act, colloquially known as “Smoot‐​Hawley” after its two Republican sponsors. Smoot‐​Hawley raised tariffs on approximately 20,000 imported products to unprecedentedly high levels. Ostensibly, the act’s purpose was to protect U.S. industries, workers, and prices in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, but its medium‐ and long‐​term effects were dire. Although imports accounted for only 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product at the time, Smoot‐​Hawley had significant, if concentrated, regional effects and in particular served to further weaken the United States’ already‐​struggling banking system.

As if we didn’t already know…



Bryce Edwards writes for _The Guardian_ this week and expresses disappointment that Jacinda, known as the anti-Trump, is clearly nothing of the sort. To be honest, I am somewhat relieved that she does not appear to have been as rude to him as she was at their first meeting. Maybe Jacinda has realised that diplomacy is the only way to get what you want, and calling the POTUS ‘orange’ is probably not the way to get a reduction in tariffs or a free trade deal. She got neither, of course, but at least she appears to have remained civil, thereby increasing our chances for concessions from zero to not much.



Ardern’s liberal supporters see her as the polar opposite of the US president, and she has even been labelled the “anti-Trump”. They expected her in some way to speak truth to power when meeting the man who has become synonymous with the most reactionary problems in politics today. More than anything, Ardern might have been expected to use the opportunity to push Trump hard on the issue of climate change.



Instead, Ardern came out of the meeting typically upbeat, exuding her trademark diplomacy. She described the meeting as a “perfectly productive, warm, solid bilateral”, trotting out the usual platitudes about US-NZ relations, and highlighting Trump’s purported interest in New Zealand.



Her ‘trademark diplomacy’? Is Bryce Edwards being facetious here, or has he forgotten her scowling at Mike Pence, calling Trump ‘orange’ and railing against him when he told the four troublesome Congresswomen to go back to their own countries and fix up the mess there?



Unfortunately for Ardern, the New Zealand media is now giving plenty of coverage of her positivity towards Trump, mixed with reports of dissatisfaction over her failure to push climate change action at the meeting. And to make matters worse for her, Trump has now tweeted that the good news stories about their conversation are “true” and that it was “A wonderful meeting!” 



He is still a democratically elected premier (which is more than can be said for Ardern) and deserves some respect as a result. For once, Jacinda seems to have behaved herself.



It will not please many of her supporters though.



Ardern isn’t supposed to be a traditional PM. She came to power riding a wave of enthusiasm for being different. Jacindamania was based on the expectation that she would do politics differently and would reject business as usual. She promised “transformational change”. 



Now this anti-Trump politician has had her first formal meeting with the real Trump, and nothing much has changed. While no one can have reasonably expected that her meeting with Trump would produce immediate results, there was certainly an expectation that she would at least emphasise the need for action on climate change. 



It seems she was more interested in getting Trump to break the Second Amendment (which he will never do) or pushing her Christchurch Call agenda, where she thinks she can stop the next massacre by depriving law-abiding citizens of guns and stopping downloading live streams on the internet. It is a bit like having to declare all liquids and cosmetics on an aeroplane; the next massacre will use a different method. But Jacinda doesn’t seem to realise that yet.



Ardern is also fighting a rising tide of cynicism at home over whether her actions match her rhetoric. The New Zealand Labour party and, crucially, Ardern’s own office, is currently embroiled in a major sexual assault scandal. This is on the heels of failures to deliver promised changes – most notably the flagship housing policy has turned into a train wreck that her government is trying to salvage, without much success. 



It is worse than that. For all that Ardern tries to paint herself as a champion of climate change, the reality at home is somewhat different. The Zero Carbon Bill is failing on all fronts, because there is no agreement between the coalition partners, and it is most unlikely that it will be saved by the opposition. To continue to wear her halo on the international stage, Jacinda has to walk the walk. Much to our relief back home, she clearly isn’t doing that. 



It is all very well to parade this virtuous position to the eco-warriors at the UN, but at the moment, this is not being matched with domestic reality. Jacinda will not be able to get away with telling two different stories for much longer. 



Ardern’s performance in New York is not going to be enough to assuage the uneasy feeling that for all Ardern’s claims to be different, it’s very much business as usual.



She described climate change in her speech at the UN as an “extraordinary threat” but, right now, her response to that threat is looking – as we say _–_ “pretty ordinary”.



  
Don’t get me wrong. The last thing I want is for our farmers to be forced into bankruptcy because of the Zero Carbon Bill, but Jacinda will not be able to have it both ways. Very soon, the world will be able to see that she is nothing more than hot air and good intentions. We already know this, of course, but Jacinda’s saintly international reputation is taking a hit. 



I cannot wait for the world to realise how hypocritical and ineffectual Jacinda really is. She is good at championing minor causes that may look good, but will never change anything. We know this.



Now the rest of the adoring world are going to see it too. Yee ha.

Despite pledges to cut spending by the new Republican House majority, it appears spending during the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will actually be greater than in fiscal 2011. The House Republicans were filled with good intentions, but they got snookered by President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Foolmeonce, shameonyou. Foolmetwice, shameonme.



The Tea Party crowd and other Americans who believe in fiscal responsibility are unlikely to be tolerant of and re—elect Republicans who are so incompetent that they cannot reduce federal spending and continue to fund programs that most of their voters oppose. The Constitution is clear. Article I, Section 9 states, “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” That is, only Congress can authorize the spending of money.



It is true that the Republicans only control one half of Congress, the House, and that many of the Senate Democrats want higher spending, so the House Republicans are not going to be able to get all of the spending reductions they wish. But it also is true that the House Republicans can insist on reductions in overall spending and, particularly, get rid of unpopular and nonessential programs as a price for passing any of the necessary appropriations bills.



The Republicans allowed themselves to get snookered last year by not insisting on the “regular order,” whereby both the House and Senate are required to pass a budget resolution that sets the framework for overall spending. The various appropriations committees then are supposed to make their spending decisions within the limits set by the budget resolution. The House dutifully complied with the Budget Act and passed a budget resolution. The Senate did not — in fact, it has been three years since the Democrat—controlled Senate passed a budget resolution. Without a binding budget resolution signed onto by both houses of Congress, the appropriators basically had free rein, which is exactly what the majority of Democrats wanted.



The president and many of the Democrats demonstrate time and time again that they care little about the rules or the Constitution. Just last week, Mr. Obama made clearly unconstitutional “recess” appointments even though the Senate was not in recess. As former Attorney General Ed Meese and Todd Gaziano of the Heritage Foundation wrote: “If Congress does not resist, the injury is not just to its branch but ultimately to the people. James Madison made clear that the separation of powers was not to protect government officials’ power for their sake, but as a vital check on behalf of individual liberty. To prevent future tyrannical usurpations of power, Congress must act to redress this serious threat to our liberty.”



Again, Congress still has control of the purse, and even the big—spending senators cannot force an appropriation if the House majority does not approve it. Therefore, the Republican leaders must make it clear to the president, Democrats in the Senate and the American people that they will not approve any spending for programs or people that operate against the best interest of America or operate outside what is constitutionally permissible.



Republicans should prepare a specific list of spending non—starters and make it known to all. They need to be clear that if any of the items are contained in a future appropriations bill or continuing resolution, they will make sure it is defeated. The list should contain only those items that would cause the president to have a politically impossible public—relations problem if he threatened to veto the specific appropriation bill or continuing resolution and thereby shut down the government if the items were not included.



Republicans could start by insisting that no expenditure for salaries could be made for people not properly appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate as called for in the Constitution — that is, phony, non—recess appointments would not be funded.



A number of the international organizations for which the United States provides major support have gone rogue and spent monies on programs of which most fiscally responsible Americans disapprove (or would disapprove it they knew about them). These programs should be cut. Examples are the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (which ignores much sound science), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Fiscal Affairs Committee (which is attempting to create a high tax cartel) and possibly the International Monetary Fund, which keeps flirting with bailing out European economic mismanagement.



The GOP and others have rightly complained about regulatory excess, but they need to put some teeth in these complaints by refusing to allow funding for regulations that have not been justified by a truly independent cost—benefit analysis, so the Environmental Protection Agency could not get away with unnecessarily attempting to shut down many needed power plants. The cost—benefit requirement also should be applied to the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury so they could not continue such outrages as making it almost impossible for Americans living abroad to get bank accounts and driving hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign capital out of the United States.



Republicans may not be able to reduce spending greatly until they have control of both houses of Congress, but they can stop specific spending programs that have little or no popular support and do great damage. They need to insist on the regular order and provide their list of non—starters now and not wait until the next budget crisis when, once again, they are likely to get snookered.

Transcribing the part-time PM’s interviews can be a nightmare. When she is feeling the pressure, words come out rapid fire, which combined with her characteristic sloppy diction makes her very hard to understand. She is also rewriting the English language as we know it, and this guide will help you interpret what she really means.



Ardern invariably goes into attack mode when replying to awkward questions that have the potential to damage her position as leader of the Labour Party, or the party itself. 



The following words and phrases are littered throughout her interviews as hackneyed words and phrases trotted out to bat away awkward questions. The use of them is an indication that she is feeling the pressure. 



Top of the list are the words “again” and “clear.” They are her “go to” phrases in a conversation to gain a few seconds to prepare her railroading defence.



 **“Again” and “As I said”** are common diversions away from incriminating content and also a slur that the interviewer has already asked that question even when they haven’t. 



_Translation: “You weren’t listening to me the first time, were you?”_



 **“Just to be clear”, “I’ve been very clear on this”, “I just want to bring clarity” and “for clarity”.** A diversion used to avoid directly answering a question, and questions the interviewer’s ability to follow the conversation.



 _Translation: “Why are you such an idiot that I have to repeat myself?” and “You are not listening to me”._



 **“Information in the public domain.”** Reminding the interviewer that Ardern is party to information that is not available to us, and as such she gets a get out of jail free card for not being open and transparent. It is used to signal to the interviewer that, “unfortunately”, she is not free to talk about everything. 



_Translation: “Let’s keep talking about this for as long as possible because this is old news where I can’t possibly get into trouble.”_



 **“There is a process in place.”** Another diversion and an attempt to convince the listener of both her importance and capability. It always relates to delegation of duties, which Ardern is expert in. 



_Translation: “Give it a rest, why don’t you, I have this under control.”_ (Actually, she doesn’t and neither does anyone else.)



 **“Best practice”**



A neat little legal term rolled out when the proverbial hits the fan but the blame is easily attributed to someone else. 



_Translation: “Of course, I always perform to the highest standard, it’s my minions that stuff things up”._



 **“Lever”** Definition: In its simplest form, a lever is a stick that is free to pivot or move back and forth at a certain point but when Ardern uses the term “lever” there is no freedom of movement – it is her way or the highway. Eg [[Ardern] flagged](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116072532/jacinda-arderns-un-message-in-stark-contrast-to-donald-trumps-patriots-speech) that the Government will announce – along with other countries – a new initiative “that applies _trade levers_ to climate-related goods, services and technologies”.



 _Translation: “You will do as I say because I am making your life much more difficult until you do.”_

I had to laugh at this statement from the press release below:
“What we found is that during several recent extreme weather events these planetary waves almost freeze in their tracks for weeks.”
Gosh,”frozen patterns” like Rex blocks have been known for decades.Wikipedia has a good summary:
Blocks in meteorology are large-scale patterns in the atmospheric pressure field that are nearly stationary, effectively “blocking” or redirecting migratory cyclones. They are also known as blocking highs or blocking anticyclones. These blocks can remain in place for several days or even weeks, causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for an extended period of time (e.g. precipitation for some areas, clear skies for others).[2] In the Northern Hemisphere, extended blocking occurs most frequently in the spring over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
NCAR also has a good explanation of it here. An example: – NOAA on the Russian heat wave of 2010:
The heat wave was due primarily to a natural phenomenon called an atmospheric “blocking pattern”, in which a strong high pressure system developed and remained stationary over western Russia…”
One of the hottest summers the USA ever experienced in 1936 was due to a blocking high:



The 1936 blocking ridge happened several times in that year & had occurred in 1934, as well.  By comparison, record-breaking warmth occurred in March 1986, only to return in mid April with 88-93 setting records. – See more at: http://blogs.wlfi.com/2012/03/20/55894/#sthash.7p8c5pWX.dpuf
Now, according to PIK, suddenly such atmospheric blocks are caused by “climate change”. What a load of tosh. Thank our old alarmist buddy Hans Joachim Schellnhuber for turning mundane meteorology into something sinister.
Weather extremes provoked by trapping of giant waves in the atmosphere
02/2572013 – The world has suffered from severe regional weather extremes in recent years, such as the heat wave in the United States in 2011 or the one in Russia 2010 coinciding with the unprecedented Pakistan flood. Behind these devastating individual events there is a common physical cause, propose scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The study will be published this week in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and suggests that man-made climate change repeatedly disturbs the patterns of atmospheric flow around the globe’s Northern hemisphere through a subtle resonance mechanism.

“An important part of the global air motion in the mid-latitudes of the Earth normally takes the form of waves wandering around the planet, oscillating between the tropical and the Arctic regions. So when they swing up, these waves suck warm air from the tropics to Europe, Russia, or the US, and when they swing down, they do the same thing with cold air from the Arctic,” explains lead author Vladimir Petoukhov.
“What we found is that during several recent extreme weather events these planetary waves almost freeze in their tracks for weeks. So instead of bringing in cool air after having brought warm air in before, the heat just stays. In fact, we observe a strong amplification of the usually weak, slowly moving component of these waves,” says Petoukhov. Time is critical here: two or three days of 30 degrees Celsius are no problem, but twenty or more days lead to extreme heat stress. Since many ecosystems and cities are not adapted to this, prolonged hot periods can result in a high death toll, forest fires, and dramatic harvest losses.
Anomalous surface temperatures are disturbing the air flows
Climate change caused by greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning does not mean uniform global warming – in the Arctic, the relative increase of temperatures, amplified by the loss of snow and ice, is higher than on average. This in turn reduces the temperature difference between the Arctic and, for example, Europe, yet temperature differences are a main driver of air flow. Additionally, continents generally warm and cool more readily than the oceans. “These two factors are crucial for the mechanism we detected,” says Petoukhov. “They result in an unnatural pattern of the mid-latitude air flow, so that for extended periods the slow synoptic waves get trapped.”
The authors of the study developed equations that describe the wave motions in the extra-tropical atmosphere and show under what conditions those waves can grind to a halt and get amplified. They tested their assumptions using standard daily weather data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). During recent periods in which several major weather extremes occurred, the trapping and strong amplification of particular waves – like “wave seven” (which has seven troughs and crests spanning the globe) – was indeed observed. The data show an increase in the occurrence of these specific atmospheric patterns, which is statistically significant at the 90 percent confidence level.
The probability of extremes increases – but other factors come in as well
“Our dynamical analysis helps to explain the increasing number of novel weather extremes. It complements previous research that already linked such phenomena to climate change, but did not yet identify a mechanism behind it,” says Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of PIK and co-author of the study. “This is quite a breakthrough, even though things are not at all simple – the suggested physical process increases the probability of weather extremes, but additional factors certainly play a role as well, including natural variability.” Also, the 32-year period studied in the project provides a good indication of the mechanism involved, yet is too short for definite conclusions.
Nevertheless, the study significantly advances the understanding of the relation between weather extremes and man-made climate change. Scientists were surprised by how far outside past experience some of the recent extremes have been. The new data show that the emergence of extraordinary weather is not just a linear response to the mean warming trend, and the proposed mechanism could explain that.

"**When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, couples preparing for their big day had to abruptly stop planning.**
Lockdown was eased in June and wedding ceremonies could take place again - but they were subject to strict conditions.
With cases of Covid-19 remaining at a higher level in Northern Ireland, there have been further changes to the rules for weddings, civil partnerships and receptions.
Here's a guide to the rules.
In Northern Ireland, the limit for guests is currently set at 25.
This number includes children under 12 and the officiant.
Guidance from the Executive Office states that indoor and outdoor ceremonies are allowed, but with strict conditions.
Hotels and other venues licensed for ceremonies had to close on 19 October as a result of new Covid-19 restrictions.
Places of worship and local government offices are still permitted for weddings.
In England, only 15 people can attend a ""Covid-secure venue"", in Scotland wedding ceremonies of up to 20 people can be held and in Wales, receptions of up to 30 people are allowed.
In the Republic of Ireland. In Dublin and Donegal, ceremonies can only take place with 25 guests.
The rules on gathering in people's homes changed in Northern Ireland on 22 September, making it illegal for more than six people from two households to meet in a private garden.
There is no exemption in the legislation for larger wedding and civil partnership ceremonies to take place in someone's garden.
However, in the circumstance that one of the couple is terminally ill, a ceremony inside a private home is allowed.
Hairdressers and make-up artists are often an important part of the day, but the coronavirus laws state that close contact services must close until 11 December.
Hair and beauty salons are also closed as of 27 November for two weeks, so cannot carry out services in their premises either.
A photographer or videographer can come to your home, so as long as they can maintain social distancing with no close contact, in line with a completed risk assessment.
No.
The Executive Office guidance says there is no expectation that the couple or their party must wear face masks during the ceremony or reception afterwards.
However, it adds that wearing face coverings in public and indoor places is strongly advised, especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Anyone travelling by public transport to a wedding must wear a mask during their journey - with limited exemptions.
The advice says large groups should not form for the purposes of photographs unless social distancing can be adequately maintained.
The Executive Office says this depends on the venue.
Music - either live or pre-recorded - is permitted for ceremonies within a place of worship, however in venues where alcohol may be consumed, such as a hotel, community hall or marquee, live music is not allowed.
Recorded tracks are permitted.
As of 19 October, no wedding receptions or post-ceremony gatherings are allowed.
No-one can say for sure.
That depends what happens with the spread of the virus in Northern Ireland.
The Executive Office has deemed that indoor marriages and civil partnerships, in the context of Covid-19, must ""still be seen as carrying a serious risk""."
"**England enters a tougher version of its three tier system of restrictions on Wednesday, as a four-week lockdown ends.**
Northern Ireland has a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while Wales is banning the sale of alcohol in pubs, cafes and restaurants from Friday. Scotland has its own five-tier system.
Across the UK, some restrictions will be relaxed over Christmas, to allow three households to form a ""Christmas bubble"".
From just after midnight on Wednesday 2 December, areas will be placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
About 99% of England has been placed into the high and very high coronavirus risk category - tiers two and three.
The placing of areas in each tier will be reviewed every 14 days, with the first review on 16 December.
**Areas in tier two**
**Tier two (high) rules**
**Areas in tier three**
**Tier three (very high) rules**
Additional restrictions apply:
**Areas in tier one**
Only three areas have been placed in the lowest tier:
**Tier one (medium) rules**
Areas in the lowest tier will have some restrictions relaxed:
There are exceptions in all tiers for childcare and support bubbles. More details of the plan are here.
The new coronavirus tier restrictions will mean 55 million people will be banned from mixing with other households indoors. The decision about which tier to place an area in is based on:
Lockdown restrictions in Wales were eased on 9 November.
**The current rules say:**
People who you don't live with still cannot come into your home socially, unless you are in an extended household (bubble) with them. Tradespeople can enter your home to carry out work.
However, from **Friday 4 December:**
Read Wales' official guidance.
Northern Ireland started a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown from 00:01 GMT on Friday 27 November.
Read Northern Ireland's official guidance.
Each area of Scotland has been placed in one of five tiers.
Eleven local authority areas in west and central Scotland have recently moved from level three to level four, affecting two million people.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the level four measures would be lifted at 18:00 GMT on Friday 11 December.
**Areas in level zero**
No areas have been placed in the lowest tier.
**Level zero (nearly normal) rules**
**Areas in level one**
**Level one (medium) rules**
Additional restrictions apply:
**Areas in level two**
**Level two (high) rules**
Additional restrictions apply:
**Areas in level three**
**Level three (very high) rules**
Additional restrictions apply:
**Areas in level four**
**Level four (lockdown) rules**
Additional restrictions apply:
Schools stay open in all levels, and here must also be no non-essential travel between Scotland the rest of the UK.

What government unit has the right to tax you — your local government, regional or state government, federal government or multinational organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Bank and theWorld Health Organization? The reason the question is becoming more important is that rising numbers of politically powerful persons and institutions are calling for global taxes on such things as financial transactions, tobacco, sugar and carbon emissions.



The modern concept of the nation‐​state goes back to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Among other things, it limited the power of the sovereign to the territory of the state, including the power to tax. The American Revolution was, in part, fought over the demand for “no taxation without representation.” Despite the success of the Revolution, the principle of no taxation without representation was violated from the very beginning, for both good and bad reasons. Once government divides people into classes and allows some classes to tax other classes, people can be taxed without their consent. The original voting franchise was limited to male property owners; hence, the “classes” of women and non‐​property‐​owners were taxed without their consent, along with blacks in the slaveholding states.



People are no longer classified by sex or race in most countries when it comes to voting rights, but it is fashionable to classify people by income or occupation and then tax them differently — thus denying a fundamental human right of equal treatment. Now this concept of unequal treatment and nonrepresentation is being promoted across countries, whereby people (even the non‐​rich) in rich countries should pay more taxes to support people in poor countries — in practice, all too often the corrupt ruling class.



The American founders understood that people would have more say over their government the closer it was to them, which is why the United States was set up as a federal republic. Under the Constitution, the federal government has few powers, and state and local governments have many powers if the people so choose. The power to tax is one of the most coercive powers governments have, so it is extremely dangerous to both liberty and prosperity.



Think of the consequences if international organizations gain the ability to tax. The tax‐​exempt bureaucrats who run these organizations will have an endless list of “unmet needs” and thus will create reasons to have never‐​ending tax increases. The United Nations is pushing a global financial transactions tax “to offset the costs of the enduring economic, financial, fuel, climate and food crises, and to protect basic human rights.”



The World Health Organization, in the name of boosting expenditures for health research for diseases that “disproportionally affect the developing world,” has just proposed in a new report a “Financial Transactions Tax and a Solidarity Tobacco Contribution — that in addition to the airline taxes implemented in some other countries could be used to generate funds to be channeled through an international mechanism to supplement national resources” (global‐​bureaucrat‐​speak for taking your liberty and money and giving it to others).



James Hansen of NASA again recently proposed a “flat‐​rate global tax” on carbon to stop global warming. In 2009, then‐​House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed her support for a Group of 20 “global tax.” In March, Vice President Joseph R. Biden said, “We want to create a global minimum tax.” It goes on and on.



In sum, the global‐​tax advocates are demanding that the world’s most productive people and institutions give more money to global, nondemocratic institutions, which have been rife with mismanagement and corruption, so those within the global institutions can spend it as they see fit with virtually no accountability. The resulting misallocation of capital will make the world dirtier and poorer, with higher unemployment.



Tax money tends to be much better spent when the people can see how it is spent and who is spending it. This is accomplished more easily at local levels of government, where there can be more real representation and accountability, rather than at the national level and particularly at the international level, where there is no effective representation. The problems of poverty and environmental neglect most often occur where the people have no effective representation and accountability — i.e. authoritarian countries.



Switzerland is very prosperous, with little poverty, and has very high health, education and environmental standards. And individual liberty. Most taxation is done at the local and regional level, where there is a high degree of direct democracy, representation and accountability. Ask yourself whether the world would be better off if there were many more Switzerlands — or many more international, non‐​accountable bureaucracies to tax and spend your money.

Make no mistake, a second Asian Financial Crisis is on its way. This storm will not blow over soon. It originated in the US, when the Fed proposed to taper and end quantitative easing.



The frightening thing is that this will happen in stages over the next 12–18 months, and each turn of the liquidity screw can cause a fresh financial storm. Nothing Chidambaram or Raghuram Rajan says can avert the storm.



Learning from the 1997–99 experience, all Asian countries (including India) have built up large forex reserves, reduced leverage compared with 1997, and shifted to floating exchange rates. This makes them far more resilient, so they should not collapse as in 1997–99. But they will suffer severe damage regardless.



Depreciation raises the price of all items that can be exported or imported. Estimates differ, but a 10% depreciation probably sucks out 1–1.2% of purchasing power through inflation.



At Rs 68 to the dollar, currency depreciation is around 25% since May, implying a loss of purchasing power of 2.5–3% of GDP. That is hugely recessionary. It will be reflected in much higher prices of petroleum products, fertilizers, most commodities, and knock‐​on transport and material costs.



Chidambaram wants people to invest, but the coming recession will induce every corporate to postpone investment. A falling rupee keeps making Indian assets cheaper in dollar terms, so foreigners thinking India has good long‐​run prospects will wait till the Fed’s storm ends.



The fall in purchasing power created by a falling rupee cannot be offset by a huge fiscal and monetary stimulus, as in 2008.



 **Storm will Continue**



Chidambaram has sworn to hold fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP. With slowing revenues and rising subsidies, only slashing Plan spending can check fiscal deficit.



Money must be kept tight to check inflation. So, the crashing rupee will generate pro‐​recessionary fiscal and monetary forces. This in turn means corporate earnings will crash, a good reason to dump shares.



Corporate’s with large unhedged dollar borrowings will suffer huge balance sheet losses, jeopardizing banks that have financed them. International rating agencies will have good reasons to downgrade India, worsening the climate further.



Rohini Malkani of the finance ministry wrote in this newspaper on Tuesday that using a model based on relative inflation with trading partners, India’s equilibrium exchange rate should be the July level of Rs 58–60 to the dollar.



Many experts say the rupee has overshot and will come back. Really? Remember the same thing was said about the Indonesian rupiah when it depreciated from 2,500 to 3,000 to the dollar in 1997, but it eventually went all the way to 18,000.



Estimates based on fundamentals quickly become meaningless because a crisis changes fundamentals hugely. The crashing rupee has already changed the economy’s fundamentals. Do not think that the rupee has just temporarily overshot, and will revert soon to Rs 60 per dollar. The storm is going to continue well into 2014.

A media without shame drives us towards energy poverty.
By: Dr. Tim Ball and Tim Harris
Said Thomas Jefferson: “The man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers.” Jefferson’s comment may be expanded to include most of today’s mass media; this is especially true of television. As American linguist Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa said: “In the age of television, image becomes more important than substance.” It is effectively visual lying, dictated by Marshall McLuhan’s observation: “The medium is the message.” For example, TV news programs often illustrate air pollution with a smoke stack emitting water vapor, implying it is pollution when it is anything but.

Distortion and deception are accentuated by hyperbole. Television news and documentaries frequently report normal weather as “extreme weather,” implying it is abnormal and caused by human activity. But while a hurricane, for example, may inflict serious damage to our structures and cause major loss of life, it is a normal event in hurricane-prone regions, where it is foolish to live without preparing for the weather patterns of the area.
The problem is accentuated when supposedly prestigious newspapers like the New York Times present provably false information. “Summer’s Beast is Loose,” published in the Times on July 16, was an obvious attempt to sensationalize warm, but normal, summer temperatures:

"**England's new tiers system has started, but many are complaining areas with lower than average rates of infection have been unfairly put in high tiers.**
In the summer, action was supposed to be hyper-local, sometimes with different rules in the same local authority.
But now, tiers have been applied in broad areas, generally matching counties or city regions.
And in those larger areas, the case rates were all higher in tier three than in tier two in the week to 19 November.
The modellers advising government say working on a broader scale ""may make measures more effective"" since it reduces the chances of people travelling across tier boundaries.
The only exception to the ""bigger regions"" approach is Slough.
The surrounding parts of Berkshire are all in tier two - but Slough, with a higher rate of infection, has been put into tier three.
The price of this approach is low-Covid areas can be swept up into county-wide restrictions.
For example, Tunbridge Wells and Ashford, in tier-three Kent, had about 120 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 November.
But most local authorities in England saw more than 180 cases per 100,000 people that week.
The document describing the government's rationale for each decision lists four factors on top of the main case rates, however:
Tunbridge Wells and Ashford have seen rising rates in recent weeks, while the rates in the rest of England have been falling.
And with hospitals in Kent already under pressure, the worry is the high rates of infection in Swale and Medway spread out into the rest of Kent.
But many MPs are still unsatisfied with the government's explanations.
Conservative MP Damian Green, who represents Ashford, asked the government to apply rules at ""a local level, districts rather than counties or regions"" as ""restrictions which people feel are unfair to their particular community will simply not be respected or obeyed"".

"**As part of our CEO Secrets series, which invites business leaders to share their advice, we are focusing on start-ups that have launched during lockdown, looking at different types of entrepreneur. This week, we hear from people whose jobs are under threat in hospitality, a sector hit particularly hard during the pandemic.**
The hospitality industry has been left reeling after two national lockdowns and, although England is just emerging from the second one, things aren't necessarily looking better. The introduction of new tiered restrictions has been described in some quarters as a ""mortal blow"" for an industry ""bearing the brunt of the pain"".
Bruce Tate, 39, was in a bad place after the first lockdown.
His business in Newcastle, called Need Music, which handled live bookings for pubs and weddings, was forced to close, and he wasn't entitled to financial support from the government because he drew his income as company dividends.
But while contemplating his future, sitting at a picnic table outside his office, he had a ""light bulb"" moment.
A cyclist whizzed past. This was normal. The office garden overlooks Route 72, also known as Hadrian's Cycle Way, one of the UK's most popular cycle routes.
He suddenly thought: what if he turned this area, which his business was renting anyway, into a cafe, capitalising on the passing trade on wheels?
A few physical adjustments were necessary to make the idea possible.
Bruce created some covered wooden seating areas, added a serving hatch to his office kitchen, and Route 72 Cafe opened in July.
As predicted, cyclists have provided regular custom, stopping off for simple refreshments like cheese toasties, beans on toast and pannini.
In time Bruce added to the menu homemade pies and pulled pork sandwiches, made by his wife.
One particularly profitable day saw a group of 100 riders drop by, en route from Newcastle to Wylam.
The new business was gaining momentum and his investments were beginning to pay off when the new tiered restrictions arrived in the autumn, followed by a second national lockdown in November.
With lockdown now over, Newcastle is in tier three which means the cafe can open for takeaways only and Bruce has chosen to open only at the weekends for now.
He remains an optimist despite the huge upheavals to his life and business.
""I will come out of this pandemic stronger than I went in,"" he says. ""Hopefully I will have two successful businesses, instead of one.""
His advice to other people in the hospitality industry is to try different things with your existing resources and skills, but to build your new business around the restrictions - however frustrating that can be.
The hospitality industry includes businesses such as restaurants, cafes, pubs, bars, nightclubs, entertainment venues and hotels.
These types of businesses have lost more than 600,000 jobs this year, according to UK Hospitality.
The trade body estimates that previously expected annual growth of 5% has turned into a 40% contraction in 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.
What jobs are available at the moment?
Jessica Bond-Gallagher trusted her husband's cooking enough to let him do the catering for their wedding with nearly 200 guests. Then again, he is a professional chef. That was back in August 2019. Little did she know her husband's skill in the kitchen would also get them through coronavirus.
The couple both have careers in hospitality. Jessica, 29, works as a hotel manager, and Chris, 30, as a chef.
In March this year they took the first steps towards a long-term dream, which was to open a restaurant together in Staffordshire, where Jessica grew up. She had landed a job managing a lounge bar there, while Chris had a job offer to be head chef at a gastropub in neighbouring Cheshire - this meant they could both move from their temporary home in Cambridge.
""When Boris [Johnson] announced people had to avoid pubs, clubs and bars we immediately knew our jobs were lost,"" says Jessica.
Furthermore, they weren't on the payroll for their new roles yet, so they didn't anticipate any government help. ""I remember just saying, 'We have to do something,'"" says Jessica.
What they did was set up Gallagher's Home Kitchen.
They cleared out their kitchen in their house to make it resemble a commercial one.
They wanted to deliver food to people stuck at home during lockdown and thought there would be extra demand because of fears of food shortages. At first Chris just focused on making simple tray bakes.
They reached out to their local network of friends before trying social media to find customers. Jessica managed the orders and personally delivered them in a ""military operation"".
Deliveroo and Uber Eats were an inspiration, explains Chris. ""They showed people would buy food this way. But they also didn't serve our rural area, so there was a gap in the market.""
The demand was clearly there, so they scaled up the operation by renting a kitchen in a rugby club. Chris created a menu offering a different main dish for each day of the week, focusing on familiar favourites like lasagne and lamb stockpot.
On their first day in March they took one order. By the end of summer they were delivering 40 to 50 meals a day. The profits were more than enough to pay their bills and the couple also gave out some free meals to the elderly and NHS workers.
In September they downsized their successful lockdown enterprise into a once-a-month supper club, and used the money they made to secure something approaching their original dream: a grab-and-go deli shop on the High Street of the market town of Leek, Staffordshire.
""We want to reinvigorate our local High Street,"" says Chris, ""there's a lot of good will for independent shops.""
""In a way Covid was a blessing,"" says Jessica, ""in that it pushed us forwards, otherwise we'd still be in our old jobs.""
In south-east London another entrepreneur is pursuing a food dream, though he is learning from scratch.
Every Tuesday Andrew Woodhouse gets up at 3.30am to drive to Billingsgate Market. He buys a consignment of fresh salmon and takes it home, where he fillets it and leaves it to cure in trays of salt. He's finished by 6am. Then he can begin his day job.
This is Andrew's ""new normal"". He is an out-of-office fishmonger, thanks to Covid-19.
Since university the 27-year-old had worked in the financial events industry, organising conferences around the world.
These came to an abrupt halt when coronavirus struck.
""I was furloughed over the summer, which I expected, but I didn't want to waste my time sitting around,"" he explains. So he decided to work on a business idea inspired by a childhood passion.
He used to go coarse fishing on the River Mole near his home in Hampton, southwest London, catching carp, tench and pike.
By his twenties, he was fly fishing, and went on salmon fishing holidays as far afield as Iceland and North America.
In lockdown he decided to turn his catch into his product, selling smoked salmon, which he would prepare himself.
He built his own salmon smoker in his garden after researching some instructions online, and converted his basement into a curing room. ""My flatmates weren't too keen on smelly fish lying around,"" Andrew admits.
He has registered his food business Andrew's Smokehouse with the council and found a steady stream of customers by posting on Instagram the and Nextdoor app. At his peak he was fulfilling around 100 orders a month.
It was hard work over the summer when he devoted himself full-time to the start-up, but the profits topped up his wages back to100% (from the 80% furlough rate).
Andrew is now back working full-time from home organising virtual conferences, but still running his salmon business.
His advice for other entrepreneurs who are juggling paid employment and start-ups is this: ""You might feel time is the only thing stopping you, but you can always make time depending on what scale you want your business to operate. Why not give it a go?""

"**Fifteen further coronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in Northern Ireland bringing the Department of Health's recorded total to 1,011.**
Seven of the deaths occurred within the current reporting period, with eight outside it.
Health Minister Robin Swann said Tuesday's death toll was a ""sad milestone"" for Northern Ireland.
He also says the health service is ""primed"" and ""ready"" to deliver a vaccination safely and systematically.
Mr Swann said an effective vaccine was the biggest breakthrough since the pandemic began but that delivery will not be fast.
""There is no way around this and there is no quick fix,"" he said.
""We expect it to take many months before the vaccination programme is complete and we need to recognise that we are not through this yet.""
Health service staff will begin receiving a vaccine later this month.
Patricia Donnelly, head of the Covid-19 vaccine programme, says Northern Ireland is ""good to go"" from 14 December, pending the necessary approval of vaccines.
The department's daily figure is based on a positive test result having been recorded in the previous 28 days.
A further 391 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours.
Mr Swann said the new death toll was another ""harsh reminder"" of the threat of coronavirus and said people should not ""delude themselves"" by thinking otherwise.
""We always have to remember that we are not talking about statistics but much-loved people who are desperately missed.
""No-one should underestimate the virus, or delude themselves that it could never affect them.""
He said a ""small and vociferous minority"" continued to try and play down its risk.
Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and First Minister Arlene Foster met Mr Swann on Tuesday, ahead of an executive meeting on Thursday.
Ms O'Neill said they were working through detail of plans for the Christmas period and this needed to include plans for visiting arrangements at care homes.
""It won't be a normal Christmas and our guiding principle should be what is the advice of health officials,"" she added.
People from three households in Northern Ireland will be allowed to meet indoors for five days over the Christmas period.
NI's chief medical officer says surpassing a death toll of 1,000 is a ""grim reminder"" that Covid-19 is a ""very serious infection"".
Although Dr Michael Bride described the prospect of a vaccine as ""encouraging"", he also warned members of the public not to become complacent.
""That will not begin to do the heavy lifting until the spring,"" he said.
""It is only when we have those who are extremely clinically vulnerable, those older people vaccinated in sufficient numbers, that we will see the reduction on pressures on our health service, reduction in deaths and that we can begin to, with some confidence, look back to restrictions as increasingly a thing of the past.
""But, that is not today, that is not tomorrow, not next month.""
On Tuesday Northern Ireland hospitals were at 100% occupancy, with 419 inpatients with Covid-19, of whom 38 are in ICU, according to the Department of Health.
There have been 52, 856 positive cases in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began, with 2,523 people testing positive in the last seven days.
Tougher lockdown measures came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday 27 November, which are set to expire on 11 December.
In the Republic of Ireland, another 18 Covid-19 related deaths have been reported, bringing the death toll to 2,069, according to the Irish Department of Health.
A further 269 new cases of Covid-19 were also recorded in the country, bringing the total number to 72,798."
"Emmanuelle Riva, whose performance in the antiwar film “Hiroshima Mon Amour” in 1959 placed her at the center of the French New Wave  —   and who, more than 50 years later, became the oldest person nominated for an Academy Award for best lead actor or actress, as a woman debilitated by strokes in “Amour”  —   died on Friday in Paris. She was 89. The cause was cancer, her agent, Anne Alvares Correa, said. “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” directed by Alain Resnais and written by Marguerite Duras, was one of the first internationally acclaimed films to emerge from the French New Wave, a movement that rejected classic cinematic storytelling with youthful irreverence. In the United States it was an   hit. “With his first feature film,” Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice, “Resnais has made the most important contribution to realizable film aesthetics since ‘Citizen Kane. ’” The movie opens with Ms. Riva, playing an actress who has come to Hiroshima to make a film promoting peace, and her   Eiji Okada, as an architect, in a lovers’ embrace. Their faces are unseen and their limbs are covered in what appears to be ash, as if from a nuclear blast, that is then washed away. They speak in  . Ms. Riva says she has seen evidence of the bomb’s effects in a hospital and a museum. But Mr. Okada rebukes her, over and over: “You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing. ” She reveals tortured memories of an affair she had during World War II in her native Nevers, France, with a German soldier. Her living and dead lovers become linked  —   as do the horrors of Nevers and Hiroshima. Looking back at it nearly a   later, the critic Michael Koresky said that Ms. Riva’s performance was “responsible for much of the emotional heft” of the film and that “the range of feelings that run across Riva’s face is perhaps the most unforgettable element. ” Ms. Riva sensed at the time that “Hiroshima Mon Amour” might turn out to be the creative peak of a film career that had just begun. “I think I was particularly blessed because I put my trust in Alain Resnais,” she told an interviewer at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, when the film was shown there. But, she added: “I feel like I might be a disappointment after this, because Resnais pushed me to excel. He made me reach certain heights. ” Paulette Germaine Riva was born on Feb. 24, 1927, in Chenimenil, in northeastern France, and grew up in nearby Remiremont. Her father, René Alfred Riva, was a sign writer her mother, the former Jeanne Fernande Nourdin, was a seamstress. An only child, she never married and had no children. Ms. Riva had wanted to act since she was a child, she later said, but felt that her ambition was circumscribed by her family’s modest life in a rural village. She began performing in regional theater, but also trained as a seamstress before she entered acting school in Paris in her  . “If I had failed, I’d be dead,” she told the French newspaper Libération. “I did not have a second to lose. ” Her first role on the Paris stage was in Shaw’s “Arms and the Man” in 1954. Five years later, Mr. Resnais cast her as the nameless actress in “Hiroshima Mon Amour. ” In the decades that followed, Ms. Riva toggled from movies to stage work to television series. She distinguished herself in movies like “Léon Morin, Priest” (1961) but she never had another role as sensational as the one she played in “Hiroshima Mon Amour. ” “I refused as many offers as I accepted,” she told The New York Times in 2013. “I refused commercial roles. But it was wrong, I have been too extreme, and I don’t say it was good. ” Then the Austrian director Michael Haneke  —   who told The Times in 2012 that as a young man he had been “captivated” by Ms. Riva’s performance in “Hiroshima Mon Amour”  —   asked her to audition for “Amour. ” “Clearly he wanted to see me again after all these years,” she told The Guardian in 2013. “I was in his head, perhaps. ” In “Amour,” Ms. Riva played Anne, a retired music teacher who is failing mentally and physically. Her husband, Georges, played by   Trintignant, devotedly cares for her. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis called them “two titans of French cinema. ”  In an interview with the entertainment news website TheWrap. com, she said that Mr. Haneke had only one direction for her as she worked with Mr. Trintignant. “We were doing a scene,” she recalled, “and he said, ‘It’s very nice  —   very sweet, very tender  —   but it’s too tender. No sentimentality. From here on in, no sentimentality.’ This was the key that opened the horizon of the film. Once I heard that, it became much more clear. ” “Amour” won the Academy Award for best   film. Ms. Riva did not win the Oscar for best actress  —   she lost to Jennifer Lawrence for “Silver Linings Playbook”  —   but she won the César, the French version of the Oscar, and a Bafta film award, from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for the role. After the release of “Amour,” she said in an interview with The Times, she received a letter from a friend who wondered how she had aged “so tragically in front of our eyes. ” She explained:  “Anne is another person, it isn’t me. It is a journey into someone else, someone I’m not. ”"
"Adele and Beyoncé, should you happen to read this, consider including the following name in your acceptance speeches on Grammy night: John Billings. He’s not an engineer, producer or video director. But he has had a hand in every Grammy  —   literally  —   for the past four decades. Known as “the Grammy man,” Mr. Billings, 70, is a master mold maker who has been designing, crafting and delivering the awards to the academy for more than half of his life. “I’ve been around them forever,” he said in a telephone interview. “Every year they become more and more special to me. I’ve always been a music fan, and the Grammys have always turned me on to so much I wouldn’t hear if I just sat and listened to a radio station. ” For this year’s ceremony, airing on Sunday night on CBS, 350 trophies were made. And yes, they were all created equal. “When we’re making Grammys, we don’t know whose Grammy that’s going to be, so we don’t have one favorite,” Mr. Billings said, adding: “They’re all just like children. I really never try to question why someone is getting an award I do sometimes question why someone is not. ” Before artists can hoist the   award onstage in front of their peers, a lot of work must be done, which starts when the nomination list comes in. Mr. Billings and his team review it and estimate the number of Grammys that need to be cast to cover the nominees receiving the awards. In his    Ridgway, Colo. studio, the whirring of a polishing wheel and tapping of a hammer provide the soundtrack for his team of three, who tinker five days a week,  . “We really don’t have an average day,” Mr. Billings said of the   process needed to complete each trophy. “The guys who work with me really know what they’re doing. We don’t look at the clock, we don’t rush these things. ” The awards are made of a custom metal alloy called grammium (yes, really) and are cast from three molds: one for the base, one for the gramophone cabinet and one for the tone arm, which holds the bell. After the pieces are cast, they go through a series of filing, sanding and polishing processes, and the gramophone cabinet and tone arm are plated in   gold. Once dry, the three pieces are assembled, and each award is   with a unique serial number for authenticity. The Grammys used during the television broadcast are for show Mr. Billings and his team engrave the names of winners onto plates after the event. Mr. Billings’s relationship with the award began when he was 12, upon seeing his friend’s father, Bob Graves, make the first one in his garage. In 1976 Mr. Billings became Mr. Graves’s apprentice he took over production in 1983 after his mentor’s death. “It means a great deal to us  —   John is part of the family,” said Bill Freimuth, the vice president for awards at the Recording Academy. “It’s that personal service it’s not dealing with some sort of an anonymous corporation. It’s dealing with a person who is   who deals with making these beautiful works of art many times over. ” Over time the trophy, like the Grammy Awards show itself, has evolved. Since the first ceremony, in 1959, five different designs have been created the last major   came in the early 1990s, when Mr. Billings said he spent a year sketching and a few months fashioning three prototypes from scrap metal in his studio. The goal was simple: to keep the gramophone and its Art Deco influences but rework the tone arm, which was prone to breaking because of its thinness. Nearly 30 years later, Mr. Billings said he remains content with his design. “I think it’s going to stay exactly where it is,” he said of the current Grammy. “I don’t see a reason to change it. It’s become very iconic. People recognize it and understand what it symbolizes. ” Once Mr. Billings and his team have made the finishing touches on each set of Grammys, it’s time to send them to Los Angeles  —   but not via FedEx or U. P. S. “I’ve always just   them,” he said. “I just think it would be a nightmare to try and ship these. In the old days, there weren’t so many Grammys, so I would put them in my truck and make several trips. ” These days, Mr. Billings attaches a cargo trailer to his truck for the     journey. When the last Grammy is packed away and the trailer is locked, the team takes a moment to pause. “We open a bottle of champagne and write a date on the bottle and how many Grammys were made for that year,” he said. “That caps it off  —   the Grammys are done, now they’re on their way. Then we start making them all over again. ”"

I am Patrick J. Michaels, Director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a nonprofit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington DC, and Cato is my sole source of employment income. Before I begin my testimony, I would like to make clear that my comments are solely my own and do not represent any official position of the Cato Institute.



My testimony concerns the selective science that underlies the Obama Administration's determination of the Social Cost of Carbon and how a more inclusive and considered process would have resulted in a lower value for the social cost of carbon.



Earlier this month, the Administration's Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon (IWG) released a report that was a response to public comments of the IWG determination of the social cost of carbon that were solicited by the Office of Management and Budget in November 2013. Of the 140 unique set of comments received (including a set of my own from which this testimony in drawn), the IWG adopted none.



Here, I address why this decision was based on a set of flimsy, internally inconsistent excuses and amounts to a continuation of the IWG's exclusion of the most relevant science—an exclusion which assures that low, or even negative values of the social cost of carbon (which would imply a net benefit of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels), do not find their way into cost/benefit analyses of proposed federal actions. If, in fact, the social cost of carbon were near zero, it would eliminate the justification for any federal action (greenhouse gas emissions regulations, ethanol mandates, miles per gallon standards, solar/wind subsidies, DoE efficiency regulations, etc.) geared towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.



 _Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity_



In May 2013, the Interagency Working Group produced an updated SCC value by incorporating revisions to the underlying three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) used by the IWG in its initial 2010 SCC determination. But, at that time, the IWG did not update the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) employed in the IAMs. This was not done, despite there having been, since January 1, 2011, at least 14 new studies and 20 experiments (involving more than 45 researchers) examining the ECS, each lowering the best estimate and tightening the error distribution about that estimate. Instead, the IWG wrote in its 2013 report: ""It does not revisit other interagency modeling decisions (e.g., with regard to the discount rate, reference case socioeconomic and emission scenarios, or equilibrium climate sensitivity).""



This decision was reaffirmed by the IWG in July 2015. But, through its reaffirmation, the IWG has again refused to give credence to and recognize the importance of what is now becoming mainstream science—that the most likely value of the equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower than that used by the IWG and that the estimate is much better constrained. This situation has profound implications for the determination of the SCC and yet continues to be summarily dismissed by the IWG.



The earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity is defined by the IWG in its 2010 report (hereafter, IWG2010) as ""the long-term increase in the annual global-average surface temperature from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to pre-industrial levels (or stabilization at a concentration of approximately 550 parts per million (ppm))"" and is recognized as ""a key input parameter"" for the integrated assessment models used to determine the social cost of carbon.



The IWG2010 report has an entire section (Section III.D) dedicated to describing how an estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the scientific uncertainties surrounding its actual value are developed and incorporated in the IWG's analysis. The IWG2010, in fact, developed its own probability density function (pdf) for the ECS and used it in each of the three IAMs, superseding the ECS pdfs used by the original IAMs developers. The IWG's intent was to develop an ECS pdf which most closely matched the description of the ECS as given in the _Fourth Assessment Report_ of the United Nation's Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change which was published in 2007.



The functional form adopted by the IWG2010 was a calibrated version of Roe and Baker (2007) distribution. It was described in the IWG2010 report in the following Table and Figure (from the IWG2010 report):









The calibrated Roe and Baker functional form used by the IWG2010 is _no longer scientifically defensible_ ; nor was it at the time of the publication of the IWG 2013 SCC update, nor at the time of the July 2015 update.



The figure below vividly illustrates this fact, as it compares the best estimate and 90% confidence range of the earth's ECS as used by the IWG (calibrated Roe and Baker) against findings in the scientific literature published since January 1, 2011.



Whereas the IWG ECS distribution has a median value of 3.0°C and 5th and 95th percentile values of 1.72°C and 7.14°C, respectively, the corresponding values averaged from the recent scientific literature are 2.0°C (median), 1.1°C (5th percentile), and 3.5°C (95th percentile).



These differences will have large and significant impacts on the SCC determination.







_CAPTION: The median (indicated by the small vertical line) and 90% confidence range (indicated by the horizontal line with arrowheads) of the climate sensitivity estimate used by the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon Climate (Roe and Baker, 2007) is indicated by the top black arrowed line. The average of the similar values from 20 different determinations reported in the recent scientific literature is given by the grey arrowed line (second line from the top). The sensitivity estimates from the 20 individual determinations of the ECS as reported in new research published after January 1, 2011 are indicated by the colored arrowed lines. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95% confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing._



The IWG2010 report noted that, concerning the low end of the ECS distribution, its determination reflected a greater degree of certainty that a low ECS value could be excluded than did the IPCC. From the IWG2010 (p. 14):



“Finally, we note the IPCC judgment that the equilibrium climate sensitivity “is very likely larger than 1.5°C.” Although the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution, for which the probability of equilibrium climate sensitivity being greater than 1.5°C is almost 99 percent, is not inconsistent with the IPCC definition of “very likely” as “greater than 90 percent probability,” it reflects a greater degree of certainty about very low values of ECS than was expressed by the IPCC.”



In other words, the IWG used its judgment that the lower bound of the ECS distribution was higher than the IPCC 2007 assessment indicated. However, the collection of the recent literature on the ECS shows the IWG’s judgment to be in error. As can be seen in the chart above, the large majority of the findings on ECS in the recent literature indicate that the lower bound (i.e., 5th percentile) of the ECS distribution is lower than the IPCC 2007 assessment. And, the average value of the 5th percentile in the recent literature (1.1°C) is 0.62°C less than that used by the IWG—a sizable and important difference which will influence the SCC determination.



In fact, the abundance of literature supporting a lower climate sensitivity was at least partially reflected in the new IPCC assessment report issued in 2013. In that report, the IPCC reported:



Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C ( _high confidence_ ), _extremely unlikely_ less than 1°C ( _high confidence_ ), and very unlikely greater than 6°C ( _medium confidence_ ). The lower temperature limit of the assessed _likely_ range is thus less than the 2°C in the AR4 … 



Clearly, the IWG’s assessment of the low end of the probability density function that best describes the current level of scientific understanding of the climate sensitivity is incorrect and indefensible.



But even more influential in the SCC determination is the upper bound (i.e., 95th percentile) of the ECS probability distribution.



The IWG2010 notes (p.14) that the calibrated Roe and Baker distribution better reflects the IPCC judgment that “values substantially higher than 4.5°C still cannot be excluded.” The IWG2010 further notes that



“Although the IPCC made no quantitative judgment, the 95th percentile of the calibrated Roe & Baker distribution (7.1 °C) is much closer to the mean and the median (7.2 °C) of the 95th percentiles of 21 previous studies summarized by Newbold and Daigneault (2009). It is also closer to the mean (7.5 °C) and median (7.9 °C) of the nine truncated distributions examined by the IPCC (Hegerl, et al., 2006) than are the 95th percentiles of the three other calibrated distributions (5.2–6.0 °C).”



In other words, the IWG2010 turned towards surveys of the scientific literature to determine its assessment of an appropriate value for the 95th percentile of the ECS distribution. Now, more than five years hence, the scientific literature tells a completely different story.



Instead of a 95th percentile value of 7.14°C, as used by the IWG2010, a survey of the recent scientific literature suggests a value of 3.5°C—more than 50% lower.



And this is very significant and important difference because the high end of the ECS distribution has a large impact on the SCC determination—a fact frequently commented on by the IWG2010.



For example, from IWG2010 (p.26):



“As previously discussed, low probability, high impact events are incorporated into the SCC values through explicit consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. Although FUND does not include catastrophic damages (in contrast to the other two models), its probabilistic treatment of the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter will directly affect the non‐​catastrophic damages that are a function of the rate of temperature change.”



And further (p.30):



 _Uncertainty in extrapolation of damages to high temperatures_ : The damage functions in these IAMs are typically calibrated by estimating damages at moderate temperature increases (e.g., DICE was calibrated at 2.5 °C) and extrapolated to far higher temperatures by assuming that damages increase as some power of the temperature change. Hence, estimated damages are far more uncertain under more extreme climate change scenarios.



And the entirety of Section V [sic] ""A Further Discussion of Catastrophic Impacts and Damage Functions"" of the IWG 2010 report describes ""tipping points"" and ""damage functions"" that are probabilities assigned to different values of global temperature change. Table 6 from the IWG2010 indicated the probabilities of various tipping points.





The likelihood of occurrence of these low probability, high impact, events (""tipping points"") is greatly diminished under the new ECS findings. The average 95th percentile value of the new literature survey is only 3.5°C indicating a very low probability of a warming reaching 3-5°C by 2100 as indicated in the 3rd column of the above Table and thus a significantly lower probability that such tipping points will be reached. This new information will have a large impact on the final SCC determination using the IWG's methodology.



The size of this impact has been directly investigated.



In their _Comment on the Landmark Legal Foundation Petition for Reconsideration of Final Rule Standards for Standby Mode and Off Mode Microwave Ovens_ , Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2013) ran the DICE model using the distribution of the ECS as described by Otto et al. (2013)—a paper published in the recent scientific literature which includes 17 authors, 15 of which were lead authors of chapters in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. The most likely value of the ECS reported by Otto et al. (2013) was described as ""2.0°C, with a 5–95% confidence interval of 1.2–3.9°C."" Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC by 42 percent, 41 percent, and 35 percent (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). This is a significant decline.



In subsequent research, Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) examined the performance of the FUND model, and found that it too, produced a greatly diminished value for the SCC when run with the Otto et al. distribution of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Using the Otto et al. (2013) ECS distribution in lieu of the distribution employed by the IWG (2013), dropped the SCC produced by the FUND model to $11, $6, $0 compared with the original $30, $17, $2 (for the 2.5%, 3.0%, 5.0% discount rates, accordingly). Again, this is a significant decline.



The Dayaratna and Kreutzer (2014) results using FUND were in line with alternative estimates of the impact of a lower climate sensitivity on the FUND model SCC determination.



Waldhoff et al. (2011) investigated the sensitivity of the FUND model to changes in the ECS. Waldhoff et al. (2011) found that changing the ECS distribution such that the mean of the distribution was lowered from 3.0°C to 2.0°C had the effect of lowering the SCC by 60 percent (from a 2010 SCC estimate of $8/ton of CO2 to $3/ton in $1995). While Waldhoff et al. (2011) examined FUNDv3.5, the response of the current version (v3.8) of the FUND model should be similar.



Additionally, the developer of the PAGE (Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect) model affirmed that the SCC from the PAGE model, too drops by 35% when the Otto et al. (2013) climate sensitivity distribution is employed (Hope, 2013).



These studies make clear that the strong dependence of the social cost of carbon on the distribution of the estimates of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (including the median, and the upper and lower certainty bounds) requires that the periodic updates to the IWG SCC determination must include a critical examination of the scientific literature on the topic of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, not merely kowtowing to the IPCC assessment. There is no indication that the IWG undertook such an independent examination. But what is clear, is that the IWG did _not_ alter its probability distribution of the ECS between its 2010, 2013, and 2015 SCC determination, despite a large and growing body of scientific literature that substantially alters and better defines the scientific understanding of the earth's ECS. It is unacceptable that a supposed ""updated"" social cost of carbon does not include updates to the science underlying a critical and key aspect of the SCC.



We note that there has been one prominent scientific study in the recent literature which has argued, on the basis of recent observations of lower tropospheric mixing in the tropics, for a rather high climate sensitivity (Sherwood et al., 2014). This research, however, suffers from too narrow a focus. While noting that climate models which best match the apparent observed behavior of the vertical mixing characteristics of the tropical troposphere tend to be the models with high climate sensitivity estimates, the authors fail to make note that these same models are the ones whose projections make the _worst_ match to observations of the evolution of global temperature during the past several decades. The figure below shows the observed global surface temperature history from 1951-2013 compared with the temperature evolution projected by the collection of models used in the new IPCC 2013 report. We broke the climate models down into two groups—those which have a climate sensitivity greater than 3.0°C (as suggested by Sherwood et al., 2014) and those with a climate sensitivity less than 3.0°C. The Figure shows that while neither model subset does a very good job is capturing evolution of global temperature during the past 15-20 years (the period with the highest human carbon dioxide emissions), the high sensitivity models do substantially worse than the lower sensitivity models.





_CAPTION: Observed global average temperature evolution, 1951-2013, as compiled by the U.K's Hadley Center (black line), and the average temperature change projected by a collection of climate models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report which have a climate sensitivity greater than 3.0°C (red line) and a collection of models with climate sensitivities less than 3.0°C (blue line)._



While Sherwood et al. (2014) prefer models that better match their observations in one variable, the same models actually do worse in the big picture than do models which lack the apparent accuracy in the processes that Sherwood et al. (2014) describe. The result can only mean that there must still be even bigger problems with _other_ model processes which must more than counteract the effects of the processes described by Sherwood et al. After all, the overall model collective is still warming the world much faster than it actually is (see Figures below). In fact, for the observed global average surface temperature evolution for the past 30 years largely lies below the range which encompasses 95% of all climate model runs—an indication that the observed trend is statistically different from the trend simulated by climate models. And for periods approaching 40 years in length, the observed surface trend lies outside of (below) the range that includes 90% of all climate model simulations—and indication that the observed surface trend is marginally inconsistent with climate model simulations.





_CAPTION: The annual average global surface temperature from 108 individual CMIP5 climate model runs forced with historical (+ RCP45 since 2006) forcings were obtained from theClimate Explorer website. Linear trends were computed through the global temperatures from each run, ending in 2014 and beginning each year from 1951 through 2005. The trends for each period (ranging in length from 10 to 64years) were averaged across all model runs (black dots). The range containing 90 percent (grey lines), and 95 percent (dotted black lines) of trends from the 108 model runs is also indicated. The observed linear trends for the same periods were calculated from the annual average global surface temperature record compiled by the U.K. Hadley Center (HadCRUT4) (colored dots). Observed trend values which were less than the 2.5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored red, observed trend values which were between the 2.5th and the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored yellow, and observed trend values greater than the 5th percentile of the model trend distribution were colored green. ( Source: Michaels and Knappenberger, 2014)_



We note that our statistics are based upon both the warm and the cold departures from predicted trends. In reality, the cold departure is what is of most interest from a policy perspective—for if warming is being demonstrably overpredicted, then policies based upon models that are in error are a substantial regulatory overreach. Our probability estimates are conservative as values at the .05 level are actually at the 2.5th percentile for warmth from the model ensemble.



The divergence between observations and climate model projections is even worse in the earth's low-to-mid atmosphere (Figure below). As shown by Christy (2015), there is a gross departure of ""reality"" from model predictions. Christy (2015) noted that ""On average the models warm the global atmosphere at a rate three times that of the real world.""





_CAPTION: Five-year running mean temperatures predicted by the UN's climate models, and observed lower atmospheric temperatures from weather balloons and satellites._



These results argue strongly against the reliability of the Sherwood et al. (2014) conclusion and instead provide robust observational evidence that the climate sensitivity has been overestimated by both climate models, and the IWG alike.



 _Agricultural Impacts of Carbon Fertilization_



Carbon dioxide is known to have a positive impact on vegetation, with literally thousands of studies in the scientific literature demonstrating that plants (including crops) grow stronger, healthier, and more productive under conditions of increased carbon dioxide concentration. A recent study (Idso, 2013) reviewed a large collection of such literature as it applies to the world's 45 most important food crops (making up 95% of the world's annual agricultural production). Idso (2013) summarized his findings on the increase in biomass of each crop that results from a 300ppm increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide under which the plants were grown. This table is reproduced below, and shows that the typical growth increase exceeds 30% in most crops, including 8 of the world's top 10 food crops (the increase was 24% and 14% in the other two).



Idso (2013) found that the increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide that took place during the period 1961-2011 was responsible for increasing global agricultural output by 3.2 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars). Projecting the increases forward based on projections of the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, Idso (2013) expects carbon dioxide fertilization to increase the value of agricultural output by 9.8 trillion dollars (in 2004-2006 constant dollars) during the 2012-2050 period.





This is a large positive externality, and one that is insufficiently modeled in the IAMs relied upon by the IWG in determining the SCC.



In fact, only one of the three IAMs used by the IWG has any substantial impact from carbon dioxide fertilization, and the one that does, underestimates the effect by approximately 2-3 times.



The FUND model has a component which calculates the impact on agricultural as a result of carbon dioxide emissions, which includes not only the impact on temperature and other climate changes, but also the direct impact of carbon dioxide fertilization. The other two IAMs, DICE and PAGE by and large do not (or only do so extremely minimally; DICE includes the effect to a larger degree than PAGE). Consequently, lacking this large and positive externality, the SCC calculated by the DICE and PAGE models is significantly larger than the SCC determined by the FUND model (for example, see Table A5, in the IWG 2013 report).



But even the positive externality that results from carbon dioxide fertilization as included in the FUND model is too small when compared with the Idso (2013) estimates. FUND (v3.7) uses the following formula to determine the degree of crop production increase resulting from atmospheric carbon dioxide increases (taken from Anthoff and Tol, 2013a):





Column 8 in the table below shows the CO2 fertilization parameter ( _γr_ ) used in FUND for various regions of the world (Anthoff and Tol, 2013b). The average CO2 fertilization effect across the 16 regions of the world is 11.2%. While this number is neither areally weighted, nor weighted by the specific crops grown, it is clear that 11.2% is much lower than the average fertilization effect compiled by Idso (2013) for the world's top 10 food crops (35%). Further, Idso's fertilization impact is in response to a 300ppm CO2 increase, while the fertilization parameter in the FUND model is multiplied by ln(CO2t/275) which works out to 0.74 for a 300ppm CO2 increase. This multiplier further reduces the 16 region average to 8.4% for the CO2 fertilization effect—some 4 times smaller than the magnitude of the fertilization impact identified by Idso (2013).



Although approximately four times too small, the impact of the fertilization effect on the SCC calculation in the FUND model is large.



According to Waldhoff et al. (2011), if the CO fertilization effect is turned off in the FUND model (v3.5) the SCC increases by 75% from $8/tonCO2 to $14/tonCO2 (in 1995 dollars). In another study, Ackerman and Munitz (2012) find the effective increase in the FUND model to be even larger, with CO2 fertilization producing a positive externality of nearly $15/tonCO2 (in 2007 dollars).





Clearly, had the Idso (2013) estimate of the CO2 fertilization impact been used instead of the one used in FUND the resulting positive externality would have been much larger, and the resulting net SCC been much lower.



This is just for one of the three IAMs used by the IWG. Had the more comprehensive CO2 fertilization impacts identified by Idso (2013) been incorporated in all the IAMs, the three-model average SCC used by the IWG would be been greatly lowered, and likely even become negative in some IAM/discount rate combinations.



In its 2015 _Response to Comments Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866_ , the IWG admits to the disparate ways that CO2 fertilization is included in the three IAMs. Nevertheless, the IWG quickly dismisses this as a problem in that they claim the IAMs were selected ""to reflect a reasonable range of modeling choices and approaches that collectively reflect the current literature on the estimation of damages from CO2 emissions.""



This logic is blatantly flawed. Two of the IAMs do not reflect the ""current literature"" on a key aspect relating to the direct impact of CO2 emissions on agricultural output, and the third only partially so.



 _CO 2 fertilization is a known physical effect from increased carbon dioxide concentrations_. By including the results of IAMs that do not include known processes that have a significant impact on the end product must disqualify them from contributing to the final result. The inclusion of results that are known a priori to be wrong can only contribute to producing a less accurate answer. Results should only be included when they attempt to represent known processes, not when they leave those processes out entirely.



The justification from the IWG (2015) that ""[h]owever, with high confidence the IPCC (2013) stated in its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) that ̣'[b]ased on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive ones'"" is completely irrelevant as CO2 fertilization is an impact that is apart from ""climate change."" And further, the IAMs do (explicitly in the case of FUND and DICE or implicitly in the case of PAGE) include damage functions related to the climate change impacts on agriculture. So not only is the IWG justification irrelevant, it is inaccurate as well. The impact of CO2 fertilization on agricultural output and its impact on lowering the SCC must be considered.



 _The Misleading Disconnect Between Climate Change and the Social Cost of Carbon in the Integrated Assessment Models_



It is generally acknowledged, the results from IAMs are highly sensitive not only to the model input parameters but also to how the models have been developed and what processes they try to include. One prominent economist, Robert Pindyck of M.I.T. recently wrote (Pindyck, 2013) that the sensitivity of the IAMs to these factors renders them useless in a policymaking environment:



Given all of the effort that has gone into developing and using IAMs, have they helped us resolve the wide disagreement over the size of the SCC? Is the U.S. government estimate of $21 per ton (or the updated estimate of $33 per ton) a reliable or otherwise useful number? What have these IAMs (and related models) told us? I will argue that the answer is very little. As I discuss below, the models are so deeply flawed as to be close to useless as tools for policy analysis. Worse yet, precision that is simply illusory, and can be highly misleading.



…[A]n IAM‐​based analysis suggests a level of knowledge and precision that is nonexistent, and allows the modeler to obtain almost any desired result because key inputs can be chosen arbitrarily.



Nevertheless, federal agencies, such as the EPA and DoE incorporate the IWG determinations of the SCC into their cost/benefit analyses of proposed regulations—ill-advisedly so in my opinion.



Consider the following: the social cost of carbon should reflect the relative impact on future society that human-induced climate change from greenhouse gas emissions would impose. In this way, we can decide how much (if at all) we are willing to pay currently to reduce the costs to future society. It would seem logical that we would probably be more willing to sacrifice more now if we knew that future society would be impoverished and suffer from extreme climate change than we would be willing to sacrifice if we knew that future society would be very well off and be subject to more moderate climate change. We would expect that the value of the social cost of carbon would reflect the difference between these two hypothetical future worlds—the SCC should be far greater in an impoverished future facing a high degree of climate change than an affluent future with less climate change.



But if you thought this, you would be wrong.



Instead, the IAMs as run by the IWG2013 (and reflected in the July 2015 update) produce nearly the opposite result—the SCC is far _lower_ in the less affluent/high climate change future than it is in the more affluent/low climate change future. Such a result is not only counterintuitive but misleading.



I illustrate this illogical and impractical result using the DICE 2010 model (hereafter just DICE) used by the IWG (although the PAGE and the FUND models generally show the same behavior). The DICE model was installed and run at the Heritage Foundation by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer using the same model set up and emissions scenarios as prescribed by the IWG. The projections of future temperature change (and sea level rise, used later in the Comment) were graciously provided to us by the Heritage Foundation.



The figure below shows the projections of the future change in the earth's average surface temperature for the years 2000-2300 produced by DICE from the five emissions scenarios employed by the IWG. The numerical values on the right-hand side of the illustration are the values for the social cost of carbon associated with the temperature change resulting from each emissions scenario (the SCC is reported for the year 2020 using constant $2007 and assuming a 3% discount rate—numbers taken directly from Table A3 of the IWG2013 report). The temperature change can be considered a good proxy for the magnitude of the overall climate change impacts.





_CAPTION: Future temperature changes, for the years 2000-2300, projected by the DICE model for each of the five emissions scenarios used by the IWG2013. The temperature changes are the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario. The 2020 value of the SCC (in $2007) produced by the DICE model (assuming a 3% discount rate) is included on the right-hand side of the figure. (DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



Notice in the figure above that the value for the SCC shows little (if any) correspondence to the magnitude of climate change. The MERGE scenario produces the greatest climate change and yet has the smallest SCC associated with it. The ""5th Scenario"" is a scenario that attempts to keep the effective concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 550 ppm (far lower than the other scenarios) has a SCC that is more than 20% greater than the MERGE scenario. The global temperature change by the year 2300 in the MERGE scenario is 9°C while in the ""5th Scenario"" it is only 3°C. The highest SCC is from the IMAGE scenario—a scenario with a mid-range climate change. All of this makes absolutely no logical sense—and confuses the user.



If the SCC bears little correspondence to the magnitude of future human-caused climate change, than what does it represent?



The figure below provides some insight.





_CAPTION: Future global gross domestic product, for the years 2000-2300 for each of the five emissions scenarios used by the IWG2013. The 2020 value of the SCC (in $2007) produced by the DICE model (assuming a 3% discount rate) is included on the right-hand side of the figure._



When comparing the future GDP to the SCC, we see, generally, that the scenarios with the higher future GDP (most affluent future society) have the higher SCC values, while the futures with lower GDP (less affluent society) have, generally, lower SCC values.



Combining the results from the two figures above thus illustrates the absurdities in the IWG's use of the DICE model. The scenario with the richest future society and a modest amount of climate change (IMAGE) has the highest value of the SCC associated with it, while the scenario with the poorest future society and the greatest degree of climate change (MERGE) has the lowest value of the SCC. A logical, thinking person would assume the opposite.



While we only directly analyzed output data from the DICE model, by comparing Tables 2 and Tables 3 from the IWG2010 report, it can be ascertained that the FUND and the PAGE models behave in a similar fashion.This counterintuitive result occurs because the damage functions in the IAMs produce output in terms of a percentage decline in the GDP—which is then translated into a dollar amount (which is divided by the total carbon emissions) to produce the SCC. Thus, even a small climate change-induced percentage decline in a high GDP future yields greater dollar damages (i.e., higher SCC) than a much greater climate change-induced GDP percentage decline in a low GDP future.



Who in their right mind would want to spend (sacrifice) more today to help our rich decedents deal with a lesser degree of climate change than would want to spend (sacrifice) today to help our relatively less-well-off decedents deal with a greater degree of climate change? No one. Yet that is what the SCC would lead you to believe and that is what the SCC implies when it is incorporated into federal cost/benefit analyses. In principle, the way to handle this situation is by allowing the discount rate to change over time. In other words, the richer we think people will be in the future (say the year 2100), the higher the discount rate we should apply to damages (measured in 2100 dollars) they suffer from climate change, in order to decide how much we should be prepared to sacrifice today on their behalf. Until (if ever) the current situation is properly rectified, the IWG's determination of the SCC is not fit for use in the federal regulatory process as it is deceitful and misleading.



 _Sea Level Rise_



The sea level rise module in the DICE model used by the IWG2013/2015 produces future sea level rise values that far exceed mainstream projections and are unsupported by the best available science. The sea level rise projections from more than half of the scenarios (IMAGE, MERGE, MiniCAM) exceed even the highest end of the projected sea level rise by the year 2300 as reported in the _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see figure).





_CAPTION: Projections of sea level rise from the DICE model (the arithmetic average of the 10,000 Monte Carlo runs from each scenario ) for the five scenarios examined by the IWG2013 compared with the range of sea level rise projections for the year 2300 given in the IPCC AR5 (see AR5 Table 13.8). (DICE data provided by Kevin Dayaratna and David Kreutzer of the Heritage Foundation)._



How the sea level rise module in DICE was constructed is inaccurately characterized by the IWG2013 (and misleads the reader). The IWG2013 report describes the development of the DICE sea level rise scenario as:



“The parameters of the four components of the SLR module are calibrated to match consensus results from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).6″



However, in IWG2013 footnote “6” the methodology is described this way (Nordhaus, 2010):



“The methodology of the modeling is to use the estimates in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).”



“Using estimates” and “calibrating” are two completely different things. Calibration implies that the sea level rise estimates produced by the DICE sea level module behave similarly to the IPCC sea level rise projections and instills a sense of confidence in the casual reader that the DICE projections are in accordance with IPCC projections. However this is not the case. Consequently, the reader is misled.



In fact, the DICE estimates are much higher than the IPCC estimates. This is even recognized by the DICE developers. From the same reference as above:



“The RICE [DICE] model projection is in the middle of the pack of alternative specifications of the different Rahmstorf specifications. Table 1 shows the RICE, base Rahmstorf, and average Rahmstorf. _Note that in all cases, these are significantly above the IPCC projections in AR4_.” [emphasis added]



That the DICE sea level rise projections are far above the mainstream estimated can be further evidenced by comparing them with the results produced by the IWG-accepted MAGICC modelling tool (in part developed by the EPA and available from http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/wigley/magicc/).



Using the MESSAGE scenario as an example, the sea level rise estimate produced by MAGICC for the year 2300 is 1.28 meters—a value that is less than 40% of the average value of 3.32 meters produced by the DICE model when running the same scenario (see figure below).





_CAPTION: Projected sea level rise resulting from the MESSAGE scenario produced by DICE (red) and MAGICC (blue)._



The justification given for the high sea level rise projections in the DICE model (Nordhaus, 2010) is that they well-match the results of a ""semi-empirical"" methodology employed by Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009).



However, subsequent science has proven the ""semi-empirical"" approach to projecting future sea level rise unreliable. For example, Gregory et al. (2012) examined the assumption used in the ""semi-empirical"" methods and found them to be unsubstantiated. Gregory et al (2012) specifically refer to the results of Rahmstorf (2007) and Vermeer and Rahmstorf (2009):



The implication of our closure of the [global mean sea level rise, GMSLR] budget is that a relationship between global climate change and the rate of GMSLR is weak or absent in the past. The lack of a strong relationship is consistent with the evidence from the tide‐​gauge datasets, whose authors find acceleration of GMSLR during the 20th century to be either insignificant or small. It also calls into question the basis of the semi‐​empirical methods for projecting GMSLR, which depend on calibrating a relationship between global climate change or radiative forcing and the rate of GMSLR from observational data (Rahmstorf, 2007; Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Jevrejeva et al., 2010).



In light of these findings, the justification for the very high sea level rise projections (generally exceeding those of the IPCC AR5 and far greater than the IWG‐​accepted MAGICC results) produced by the DICE model is called into question and can no longer be substantiated.Given the strong relationship between sea level rise and future damage built into the DICE model, there can be no doubt that the SCC estimates from the DICE model are higher than the best science would allow and consequently, should not be accepted by the IWG as a reliable estimate of the social cost of carbon.



And here again, the IWG (2015) admits that these sea level rise estimates are an outlier on the high end, yet retains them in their analysis by claiming than they were interested in representing a “range” of possible outcomes. But, even the IWG (2015) admits that the IPCC AR5 assigned “a low confidence in projections based on such [semi‐​empirical] methods.” It is internally inconsistent to claim the IPCC as an authority for limiting the range of possibilities explored by the IAMs (which it did in the case of equilibrium climate sensitivity) and then go outside the IPCC to justify including a wildly high estimate of sea level rise. Such inconsistencies characterize the IWG response to comments and weaken confidence in them.



I did not investigate the sea level rise projections from the FUND or the PAGE model, but suggest that such an analysis must be carried out prior to extending any confidence in the values of the SCC resulting from those models—confidence that we demonstrate cannot be assigned to the DICE SCC determinations.



 _High Social Cost of Carbon Estimates_



A few papers have appeared in the recent scientific literature that have argued that the SCC should be considerably higher than that determined by the IWG. However, these papers suffer from serious flaws.



For example, Van den Bergh and Botzen (2014) purport to make a “conservative” estimate of the SCC that is nearly four times larger than the central estimate made by the IWG. This estimate suffers from the many of the issues described previously—a low discount rate, high climate sensitivity, and little to no positive benefits from agriculture. By including all sorts of imagined bad climate outcomes—with high monetary damages—and being largely dismissive of positive impacts, high SCC values are readily created by the authors.



Another recent analysis which arrived at an estimate of the social cost of carbon that was considerably higher than those made by the IWG was conducted by Moore and Diaz (2015). However, a careful examination shows that the assumptions made and methodologies employed therein produce a non‐​robust and ultimately unreliable result (McKitrick, 2015). Applying a better and more thorough methodology leads to results which are virtually opposite to those initially reported by Moore and Diaz (2015)—one in which the social cost of carbon is quite low and perhaps even positive.



According to McKitrick (2015), the major underlying flaw in the Moore and Diaz paper is the reliance on the results of Dell et al. (2012) in which a warming climate was linked to economic declines in both rich and poor countries. Using a more up‐​to‐​date dataset, McKitrick shows that the negative economic linkage to a warming climate is statistically insignificant and “not a robust basis for a policy assertion.”



Furthermore, McKitrick (2015) shows that if a the more standard methodology is applied, where the temperature changes are areally‐​weighted rather than weighted by country‐​level population, the relationship between economic growth and temperature change reverses for rich countries and becomes statistically significant. According to McKitrick (2015), “each degree of warming significantly _increases_ the annual income growth rate in rich countries by over 2 percentage points,” while in poor countries, the relationship “is statistically insignificant.“  
In conclusion, McKitrick (2015) finds:



The fact that the relevant poor‐​country coefficients are statistically insignificant implies they should not have been relied upon in Moore and Diaz (2015). And since the rich country coefficient corresponding to the [integrated assessment model] IAM structure is positive and significant, Moore and Diaz (2015) should actually have reported an acceleration of economic growth in rich countries associated with rising temperatures and a correspondingly reduced SCC. Also, since the rich countries begin with a larger GDP it is also likely that the overall global effect of warming on income growth would be positive, even applying the poor country coefficient. In any case the computations in Moore and Diaz (2015) are uninformative since they used coefficients from DJO based on an incomplete sample and a definition of temperature incompatible with their IAM.



Bottom line is that the Moore and Diaz (2015) high SCC estimates as well as the Dell et al. (2012) results upon which they were based, do not stand up under careful re‐​analysis. In fact, when assessed properly, they produce a low SCC estimate, in support of our overall analysis.



Overall, these new papers provide additional evidence as to the non‐​robust nature of current SCC determinations.



 _Conclusion_



The social cost of carbon as determined by the Interagency Working Group in their May 2013 Technical Support Document (updated in November 2013 and July 2015) is unsupported by the robust scientific literature, fraught with uncertainty, illogical, and thus completely unsuitable and inappropriate for federal rulemaking. Had the IWG included a better‐​reasoned and more inclusive review of the current scientific literature, the social cost of carbon estimates would have been considerably reduced with a value likely approaching zero. Such a low social cost of carbon would obviate the arguments behind the push for federal greenhouse gas regulations.

This is from Real Climate, who played the “he who must not be named” game again in not pointing out criticisms. Gavin dissapoints.
UPDATE: McIntyre responded earlier today with The Marcott Filibuster
Marcott et al have posted their long-promised FAQ at realclimate here. Without providing any links to or citation of Climate Audit, they now concede:
20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.
Otherwise, their response is pretty much a filibuster, running the clock on questions that have not actually been asked and certainly not at issue by critics. For questions and issues that I’ve actually raised, for the most part, they merely re-iterate what they already said. Nothing worth waiting for.

Primary results of study
Global Temperature Reconstruction: We combined published proxy temperature records from across the globe to develop regional and global temperature reconstructions spanning the past ~11,300 years with a resolution >300 yr; previous reconstructions of global and hemispheric temperatures primarily spanned the last one to two thousand years. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to quantify global temperature for the entire Holocene.
Structure of the Global and Regional Temperature Curves: We find that global temperature was relatively warm from approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years before present. Following this interval, global temperature decreased by approximately 0.7°C, culminating in the coolest temperatures of the Holocene around 200 years before present during what is commonly referred to as the Little Ice Age. The largest cooling occurred in the Northern Hemisphere.

Holocene Temperature Distribution: Based on comparison of the instrumental record of global temperature change with the distribution of Holocene global average temperatures from our paleo-reconstruction, we find that the decade 2000-2009 has probably not exceeded the warmest temperatures of the early Holocene, but is warmer than ~75% of all temperatures during the Holocene. In contrast, the decade 1900-1909 was cooler than~95% of the Holocene. Therefore, we conclude that global temperature has risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels of the Holocene in the past century. Further, we compare the Holocene paleotemperature distribution with published temperature projections for 2100 CE, and find that these projections exceed the range of Holocene global average temperatures under all plausible emissions scenarios.
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
Q: What is global temperature?
A: Global average surface temperature is perhaps the single most representative measure of a planet’s climate since it reflects how much heat is at the planet’s surface. Local temperature changes can differ markedly from the global average. One reason for this is that heat moves around with the winds and ocean currents, warming one region while cooling another, but these regional effects might not cause a significant change in the global average temperature. A second reason is that local feedbacks, such as changes in snow or vegetation cover that affect how a region reflects or absorbs sunlight, can cause large local temperature changes that are not mirrored in the global average. We therefore cannot rely on any single location as being representative of global temperature change. This is why our study includes data from around the world.
We can illustrate this concept with temperature anomaly data based on instrumental records for the past 130 years from the National Climatic Data Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.php#anomalies). Over this time interval, an increase in the global average temperature is documented by thermometer records, rising sea levels, retreating glaciers, and increasing ocean heat content, among other indicators. Yet if we plot temperature anomaly data since 1880 at the same locations as the 73 sites used in our paleotemperature study, we see that the data are scattered and the trend is unclear. When these same 73 historical temperature records are averaged together, we see a clear warming signal that is very similar to the global average documented from many more sites (Figure 1). Averaging reduces local noise and provides a clearer perspective on global climate.

Figure 1: Temperature anomaly data (thin colored lines) at the same locations as the 73 paleotemperature records used in Marcott et al. (2013), the average of these 73 temperature anomaly series (bold black line), and the global average temperature from the National Climatic Data Center blended land and ocean dataset (bold red line) (data from Smith et al., 2008).
New Scientist magazine has an “app” that allows one to point-and-plot instrumental temperatures for any spot on the map to see how local temperature changes compare to the global average over the past century (http://warmingworld.newscientistapps.com/).
Q: How does one go about reconstructing temperatures in the past? 
A: Changes in Earth’s temperature for the last ~160 years are determined from instrumental data, such as thermometers on the ground or, for more recent times, satellites looking down from space. Beyond about 160 years ago, we must turn to other methods that indirectly record temperature (called “proxies”) for reconstructing past temperatures. For example, tree rings, calibrated to temperature over the instrumental era, provide one way of determining temperatures in the past, but few trees extend beyond the past few centuries or millennia. To develop a longer record, we used primarily marine and terrestrial fossils, biomolecules, or isotopes that were recovered from ocean and lake sediments and ice cores. All of these proxies have been independently calibrated to provide reliable estimates of temperature.
Q: Did you collect and measure the ocean and land temperature data from all 73 sites?
A: No. All of the datasets were previously generated and published in peer-reviewed scientific literature by other researchers over the past 15 years. Most of these datasets are freely available at several World Data Centers (see links below); those not archived as such were graciously made available to us by the original authors. We assembled all these published data into an easily used format, and in some cases updated the calibration of older data using modern state-of-the-art calibrations. We made all the data available for download free-of-charge from the Science web site (see link below). Our primary contribution was to compile these local temperature records into “stacks” that reflect larger-scale changes in regional and global temperatures. We used methods that carefully consider potential sources of uncertainty in the data, including uncertainty in proxy calibration and in dating of the samples (see step-by-step methods below).

Q: Why use marine and terrestrial archives to reconstruct global temperature when we have the ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica?
A: While we do use these ice cores in our study, they are limited to the polar regions and so give only a local or regional picture of temperature changes. Just as it would not be reasonable to use the recent instrumental temperature history from Greenland (for example) as being representative of the planet as a whole, one would similarly not use just a few ice cores from polar locations to reconstruct past temperature change for the entire planet.
Q: Why only look at temperatures over the last 11,300 years?
A: Our work was the second half of a two-part study assessing global temperature variations since the peak of the last Ice Age about 22,000 years ago. The first part reconstructed global temperature over the last deglaciation (22,000 to 11,300 years ago) (Shakun et al., 2012, Nature 484, 49-55; see also http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~shakun/FAQs.html), while our study focused on the current interglacial warm period (last 11,300 years), which is roughly the time span of developed human civilizations.
Q: Is your paleotemperature reconstruction consistent with reconstructions based on the tree-ring data and other archives of the past 2,000 years?
A: Yes, in the parts where our reconstruction contains sufficient data to be robust, and acknowledging its inherent smoothing. For example, our global temperature reconstruction from ~1500 to 100 years ago is indistinguishable (within its statistical uncertainty) from the Mann et al. (2008) reconstruction, which included many tree-ring based data. Both reconstructions document a cooling trend from a relatively warm interval (~1500 to 1000 years ago) to a cold interval (~500 to 100 years ago, approximately equivalent to the Little Ice Age).
Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years?
A: Our global paleotemperature reconstruction includes a so-called “uptick” in temperatures during the 20th-century. However, in the paper we make the point that this particular feature is of shorter duration than the inherent smoothing in our statistical averaging procedure, and that it is based on only a few available paleo-reconstructions of the type we used. Thus, the 20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions. Our primary conclusions are based on a comparison of the longer term paleotemperature changes from our reconstruction with the well-documented temperature changes that have occurred over the last century, as documented by the instrumental record. Although not part of our study, high-resolution paleoclimate data from the past ~130 years have been compiled from various geological archives, and confirm the general features of warming trend over this time interval (Anderson, D.M. et al., 2013, Geophysical Research Letters, v. 40, p. 189-193; http://www.agu.org/journals/pip/gl/2012GL054271-pip.pdf).
Q: Is the rate of global temperature rise over the last 100 years faster than at any time during the past 11,300 years?
A: Our study did not directly address this question because the paleotemperature records used in our study have a temporal resolution of ~120 years on average, which precludes us from examining variations in rates of change occurring within a century. Other factors also contribute to smoothing the proxy temperature signals contained in many of the records we used, such as organisms burrowing through deep-sea mud, and chronological uncertainties in the proxy records that tend to smooth the signals when compositing them into a globally averaged reconstruction. We showed that no temperature variability is preserved in our reconstruction at cycles shorter than 300 years, 50% is preserved at 1000-year time scales, and nearly all is preserved at 2000-year periods and longer. Our Monte-Carlo analysis accounts for these sources of uncertainty to yield a robust (albeit smoothed) global record. Any small “upticks” or “downticks” in temperature that last less than several hundred years in our compilation of paleoclimate data are probably not robust, as stated in the paper.
Q: How do you compare the Holocene temperatures to the modern instrumental data?
A: One of our primary conclusions is based on Figure 3 of the paper, which compares the magnitude of global warming seen in the instrumental temperature record of the past century to the full range of temperature variability over the entire Holocene based on our reconstruction. We conclude that the average temperature for 1900-1909 CE in the instrumental record was cooler than ~95% of the Holocene range of global temperatures, while the average temperature for 2000-2009 CE in the instrumental record was warmer than ~75% of the Holocene distribution. As described in the paper and its supplementary material, Figure 3 provides a reasonable assessment of the full range of Holocene global average temperatures, including an accounting for high-frequency changes that might have been damped out by the averaging procedure.
Q: What about temperature projections for the future?
A: Our study used projections of future temperature published in the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, which suggest that global temperature is likely to rise 1.1-6.4°C by the end of the century (relative to the late 20th century), depending on the magnitude of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the sensitivity of the climate to those emissions. Figure 3 in the paper compares these published projected temperatures from various emission scenarios to our assessment of the full distribution of Holocene temperature distributions. For example, a middle-of-the-road emission scenario (SRES A1B) projects global mean temperatures that will be well above the Holocene average by the year 2100 CE. Indeed, if any of the six emission scenarios considered by the IPCC that are shown on Figure 3 are followed, future global average temperatures, as projected by modeling studies, will likely be well outside anything the Earth has experienced in the last 11,300 years, as shown in Figure 3 of our study.
Technical Questions and Answers:
Q. Why did you revise the age models of many of the published records that were used in your study?
A. The majority of the published records used in our study (93%) based their ages on radiocarbon dates. Radiocarbon is a naturally occurring isotope that is produced mainly in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. This form of carbon is then distributed around the world and incorporated into living things. Dating is based on the amount of this carbon left after radioactive decay. It has been known for several decades that radiocarbon years differ from true “calendar” years because the amount of radiocarbon produced in the atmosphere changes over time, as does the rate that carbon is exchanged between the ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere. This yields a bias in radiocarbon dates that must be corrected. Scientists have been able to determine the correction between radiocarbon years and true calendar year by dating samples of known age (such as tree samples dated by counting annual rings) and comparing the apparent radiocarbon age to the true age. Through many careful measurements of this sort, they have demonstrated that, in general, radiocarbon years become progressively “younger” than calendar years as one goes back through time. For example, the ring of a tree known to have grown 5700 years ago will have a radiocarbon age of ~5000 years, whereas one known to have grown 12,800 years ago will have a radiocarbon age of ~11,000 years.
For our paleotemperature study, all radiocarbon ages needed to be converted (or calibrated) to calendar ages in a consistent manner. Calibration methods have been improved and refined over the past few decades. Because our compilation included data published many years ago, some of the original publications used radiocarbon calibration systems that are now obsolete. To provide a consistent chronology based on the best current information, we thus recalibrated all published radiocarbon ages with Calib 6.0.1 software (using the databases INTCAL09 for land samples or MARINE09 for ocean samples) and its state-of-the-art protocol for site-specific locations and materials. This software is freely available for online use at http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/.
By convention, radiocarbon dates are recorded as years before present (BP). BP is universally defined as years before 1950 CE, because after that time the Earth’s atmosphere became contaminated with artificial radiocarbon produced as a bi-product of nuclear bomb tests. As a result, radiocarbon dates on intervals younger than 1950 are not useful for providing chronologic control in our study.
After recalibrating all radiocarbon control points to make them internally consistent and in compliance with the scientific state-of-the-art understanding, we constructed age models for each sediment core based on the depth of each of the calibrated radiocarbon ages, assuming linear interpolation between dated levels in the core, and statistical analysis that quantifies the uncertainty of ages between the dated levels. In geologic studies it is quite common that the youngest surface of a sediment core is not dated by radiocarbon, either because the top is disturbed by living organisms or during the coring process. Moreover, within the past hundred years before 1950 CE, radiocarbon dates are not very precise chronometers, because changes in radiocarbon production rate have by coincidence roughly compensated for fixed decay rates. For these reasons, and unless otherwise indicated, we followed the common practice of assuming an age of 0 BP for the marine core tops.
Q: Are the proxy records seasonally biased?
A: Maybe. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the paleotemperature records are biased toward a particular season rather than recording true annual mean temperatures. For instance, high-latitude proxies based on short-lived plants or other organisms may record the temperature during the warmer and sunnier summer months when the organisms grow most rapidly. As stated in the paper, such an effect could impact our paleo-reconstruction. For example, the long-term cooling in our global paleotemperature reconstruction comes primarily from Northern Hemisphere high-latitude marine records, whereas tropical and Southern Hemisphere trends were considerably smaller. This northern cooling in the paleotemperature data may be a response to a long-term decline in summer insolation associated with variations in the earth’s orbit, and this implies that the paleotemperature proxies here may be biased to the summer season. A summer cooling trend through Holocene time, if driven by orbitally modulated seasonal insolation, might be partially canceled out by winter warming due to well-known orbitally driven rise in Northern-Hemisphere winter insolation through Holocene time. Summer-biased proxies would not record this averaging of the seasons. It is not currently possible to quantify this seasonal effect in the reconstructions. Qualitatively, however, we expect that an unbiased recorder of the annual average would show that the northern latitudes might not have cooled as much as seen in our reconstruction. This implies that the range of Holocene annual-average temperatures might have been smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than the proxy data suggest, making the observed historical temperature averages for 2000-2009 CE, obtained from instrumental records, even more unusual with respect to the full distribution of Holocene global-average temperatures.
Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years?
A: Here we elaborate on our short answer to this question above. We concluded in the published paper that “Without filling data gaps, our Standard5×5 reconstruction (Figure 1A) exhibits 0.6°C greater warming over the past ~60 yr B.P. (1890 to 1950 CE) than our equivalent infilled 5° × 5° area-weighted mean stack (Figure 1, C and D). However, considering the temporal resolution of our data set and the small number of records that cover this interval (Figure 1G), this difference is probably not robust.” This statement follows from multiple lines of evidence that are presented in the paper and the supplementary information: (1) the different methods that we tested for generating a reconstruction produce different results in this youngest interval, whereas before this interval, the different methods of calculating the stacks are nearly identical (Figure 1D), (2) the median resolution of the datasets (120 years) is too low to statistically resolve such an event, (3) the smoothing presented in the online supplement results in variations shorter than 300 yrs not being interpretable, and (4) the small number of datasets that extend into the 20th century (Figure 1G) is insufficient to reconstruct a statistically robust global signal, showing that there is a considerable reduction in the correlation of Monte Carlo reconstructions with a known (synthetic) input global signal when the number of data series in the reconstruction is this small (Figure S13).
Q: How did you create the Holocene paleotemperature stacks?
A: We followed these steps in creating the Holocene paleotemperature stacks:
1. Compiled 73 medium-to-high resolution calibrated proxy temperature records spanning much or all of the Holocene.
2. Calibrated all radiocarbon ages for consistency using the latest and most precise calibration software (Calib 6.0.1 using INTCAL09 (terrestrial) or MARINE09 (oceanic) and its protocol for the site-specific locations and materials) so that all radiocarbon-based records had a consistent chronology based on the best current information. This procedure updates previously published chronologies, which were based on a variety of now-obsolete and inconsistent calibration methods.
3. Where applicable, recalibrated paleotemperature proxy data based on alkenones and TEX86 using consistent calibration equations specific to each of the proxy types.
4. Used a Monte Carlo analysis to generate 1000 realizations of each proxy record, linearly interpolated to constant time spacing, perturbing them with analytical uncertainties in the age model and temperature estimates, including inflation of age uncertainties between dated intervals. This procedure results in an unbiased assessment of the impact of such uncertainties on the final composite.
5. Referenced each proxy record realization as an anomaly relative to its mean value between 4500 and 5500 years Before Present (the common interval of overlap among all records; Before Present, or BP, is defined by standard practice as time before 1950 CE).
6. Averaged the first realization of each of the 73 records, and then the second realization of each, then the third, the fourth, and so on, to form 1000 realizations of the global or regional temperature stacks.
7. Derived the mean temperature and standard deviation from the 1000 simulations of the global temperature stack.
8. Repeated this procedure using several different area-weighting schemes and data subsets to test the sensitivity of the reconstruction to potential spatial and proxy biases in the dataset.
9. Mean-shifted the global temperature reconstructions to have the same average as the Mann et al. (2008) CRU-EIV temperature reconstruction over the interval 510-1450 years Before Present. Since the CRU-EIV reconstruction is referenced as temperature anomalies from the 1961-1990 CE instrumental mean global temperature, the Holocene reconstructions are now also effectively referenced as anomalies from the 1961-1990 CE mean.
10. Estimated how much higher frequency (decade-to-century scale) variability is plausibly missing from the Holocene reconstruction by calculating attenuation as a function of frequency in synthetic data processed with the Monte-Carlo stacking procedure, and by statistically comparing the amount of temperature variance the global stack contains as a function of frequency to the amount contained in the CRU-EIV reconstruction. Added this missing variability to the Holocene reconstruction as red noise.
11. Pooled all of the Holocene global temperature anomalies into a single histogram, showing the distribution of global temperature anomalies during the Holocene, including the decadal-to century scale high-frequency variability that the Monte-Carlo procedure may have smoothed from the record (largely from the accounting for chronologic uncertainties).
12. Compared the histogram of Holocene paleotemperatures to the instrumental global temperature anomalies during the decades 1900-1909 CE and 2000-2009 CE. Determined the fraction of the Holocene temperature anomalies colder than 1900-1909 CE and 2000-2009 CE.
13. Compared global temperature projections for 2100 CE from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for various emission scenarios.

Pope Francis’ new encyclical, “Laudato Si,” advocates a new “ecological spirituality.” Unfortunately, this challenging call is diminished by the document’s tendency to devolve into leftish policy positions. The encyclical seriously underestimates the power of market forces to promote environmental ends.



Drawing environmental lines requires balancing such interests as ecology, liberty and prosperity. One cannot merely assume that the correct outcome in every case is more of the first.



Indeed, the pontiff’s own goals conflict. He speaks movingly of the dignity of work and its importance for the poor. But the more expensive and extensive the government controls, the fewer and less remunerative the jobs.



Perhaps most disappointing is how the pope seemingly views capitalism, and especially property rights, as the enemy of a better, cleaner world. Yet most environmental problems reflect the absence of markets and property rights.



The encyclical rightly insists on “the obligation of those who cause pollution to assume its costs.” The best way to achieve this end is to either create or mimic markets and property rights.



For instance, public control rarely ends well. Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “tragedy of the commons,” in which land open to everyone typically is misused by everyone. Federal range and forest land is badly managed, not because government officials are malign, but because the incentives they face are perverse.



In contrast, a private owner bears both costs and benefits, and suffers when he misuses a resource. The owner may make a mistake, but his power to do harm is sharply limited.



Pollution taxes and tradeable permits attempt to apply market forces to the great common areas, such as air and water. Yet “Laudato Si” launches a perplexing attack on the use of emission credits to limit use of hydro‐​carbons. Properly designed, they create an incentive for those who can control emissions at the least cost to control them the most. This serves the common good far more than imposing greater expense on everyone.



Although the Pope acknowledges “that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views,” “Laudato Si” ignores the most sophisticated critiques of climate alarmists. For instance, many critics dispute the likelihood of catastrophic change, and the best means to deal with the likely impact of any temperature increases.



For years, models failed to match climatic behavior. Peer‐​reviewed research increasingly suggests that warming will be modest. Moreover, any prediction today as to conditions decades in the future is a wild guess.



These argue in favor of addressing specific problems rather than imposing arbitrary, draconian, and costly cuts in energy consumption. Economic analysis confirms that adaptation can achieve similar environmental ends at less expense.



The encyclical offers no evidence for its sharp attack on consumption in developed countries, which of course produce more goods than they use. In fact, unowned resources are vulnerable to abuse in any society. Resources priced too cheaply — usually for political reasons — are squandered wherever they are located.



Where markets operate, resource depletion is largely a myth. There now is more recoverable oil than ever. Increasing prices tell consumers to use less, producers to operate more efficiently, suppliers to find new sources, and everyone to seek substitutes.



Markets typically are better than governments in protecting “future generations.” An individual landowner who misuses his property and squanders the resources loses value of his land. By contrast, the typical political time horizon is until the next election.



Economic progress eases the impact of environmental problems on the poor. It also provides resources to enhance the environment, efficiencies to produce more using less, and technologies to better preserve ecological values. New technologies and processes may reduce or counter greenhouse gas emissions.



Of course, markets are not perfect or enough. Government must create a legal and policy framework. Even more important is the moral infrastructure, about which the church should engage the rest of us. “Laudato Si” is part of that dialogue.

Guest post by David M. Hoffer
In my first two articles on the leaked AR5 Chapter 11 (near-term projections) I looked at the caveats with which the IPCC is now surrounding their projections, and the lengths to which they are going to preserve the alarmist narrative. The caveats go to such ridiculous lengths that there is actually a quote suggesting that reality may well be within, above, or below the range projected by the models. Falsify that! To maintain the alarmist narrative , they characterize record ice extent in the Antarctic as a “slight increase” and make no mention in the executive summary of the projection buried deep in the report that tropical cyclones may decrease in frequency by as much as one third by 2100.
But what of their temperature projections? Do they say how much they expect it to warm up in the next few decades? They do. But these are the high stakes projections for the IPCC because, unlike most of their projections, these ones will be falsified (or not) within the life times of most of this readership. True to form, they’ve surrounded their temperature projections with caveats while taking an interesting approach to maintaining the alarmist narrative.
The projection is for between 0.4 and 1.0 degrees of warming for the period 2016-2035 compared to the period 1986-2005. Now normally when the IPCC gives a range, we expect that their “best guess” is in the centre of the range. But oddly we find this phrase in Chapter 11: 
[…] it is more likely than not that actual warming will be closer to the lower bound of 0.4°C than the upper bound of 1.0°C
In fact, they go out of their way elsewhere to suggest that the most likely outcome will be about 0.2 degrees per decade. With 2035 only a smidge over two decades away, how do they justify an upper bound 2.5 times their most likely scenario? While delving into this, I came across some rather interesting information. Here’s the graphs they provide with their projections for the beginning of the reference period (1986-2005) through to the year 2050:

Figure 11.33: Synthesis of near-term projections of global mean surface air temperature. a) 4 Projections of global mean, annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) 1986–2050 (anomalies relative to 1986–2005) under all RCPs from CMIP5 models (grey and coloured lines, one ensemble member per model), with four observational estimates (HadCRUT3: Brohan et al., 2006; ERA-Interim: Simmons et al., 2010; GISTEMP: Hansen et al., 2010; NOAA: Smith et al., 2008) for the period 1986–2011 (black lines); b) as a) but showing the 5–95% range for RCP4.5 (light grey shades, with the multi-model median in white) and all RCPs (dark grey shades) of decadal mean CMIP5 projections using one ensemble member per model, and decadal mean observational estimates (black lines). The maximum and minimum values from CMIP5 are shown by the grey lines. An assessed likely range for the mean of the period 2016–2035 is indicated by the black solid bar. The ‘2°C above pre-industrial’ level is indicated with a thin black line, assuming a warming of global mean SAT prior to 1986–2005 of 0.6°C. c) A synthesis of ranges for the mean SAT for 2016–2035 using SRES CMIP3, RCPs CMIP5, observationally constrained projections (Stott et al., 2012; Rowlands et al., 2012; updated to remove simulations with large future volcanic eruptions), and an overall assessment. The box 1 and whiskers represent the likely (66%) and very likely (90%) ranges. The dots for the CMIP3 and CMIP5 estimates show the maximum and minimum values in the ensemble. The median (or maximum likelihood estimate for Rowlands et al., 2012) are indicated by a greyband.
Is the first graph serious? 154 data plots all scrambled together are supposed to have some meaning? So I started to focus on the second graph which is presented in a fashion that makes it useful. But in examining it, I noticed that something is missing. I’ll give everyone 5 minutes to go back and see if they can spot it for themselves.
Tick
Tick
Tick
Did you spot it?
They hid the decline! In the first graph, observational data ends about 2011 or 12. In the second graph though, it ends about 2007 or 8. There are four or five years of observational data missing from the second graph. Fortunately the two graphs are scaled identically which makes it very easy to use a highly sophisticated tool called “cut and paste” to move the observational data from the first graph to the second graph and see what it should have looked like:

Well oops. Once on brings the observational data up to date, it turns out that we are currently below the entire range of models in the 5% to 95% confidence range across all emission scenarios. The light gray shading is for RCP 4.5, the most likely emission scenario. But we’re also below the dark gray which is all emission scenarios for all models, including the ones where we strangle the global economy.
It gets worse.
I did a little back of the envelope math (OK, OK, a spreadsheet, who has envelopes anymore these days?) and calculated that, assuming a linear warming starting today, we’d need to get to 1.58 degrees above the reference period to get an average of +1.0 over the course of the reference period itself. If my calcs are correct, extrapolating a straight line from end of current observations through 1.6 degrees in 2035 ought to just catch the top of that black bar showing the “Likely Range” in the centre of the graph:

Hah! Nailed it!
But now it is even worse for the IPCC. To meet the upper bound of their estimated range, the IPCC would need warming that (according to their own data) is below projections for all their models in all emission scenarios to suddenly increase to a rate higher than all their projections from all their models across all emission scenarios. In brief, the upper range of their estimate cannot be supported by their own data from their own models.
In fact, just based on their own graph, we’ve seen less than 0.4 degrees over the last 26 years or so, less than 2 degrees per century. That brown line I’ve drawn in represents a warming trend beginning right now and continuing through 2035 of 6 degrees per century, triple recent rates. Since the range in their own graph already includes scenarios such as drastic reductions in aerosols as well as major increases in CO2, there simply is no justification in their own data and their own models to justify an upper bound of 1.0 degrees.
That’s not to say it is impossible, I suppose it is possible. It is also possible that I will be struck by lightning twice tomorrow and survive, only to die in airplane crash made all the more unlikely by the fact that I’m not flying anywhere tomorrow, so that plane will have to come and find me. Of course with my luck, the winning Powerball ticket will be found in my wallet just to cap things off.
Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely?
Not according to their own data and their own models. The current version of IPCC AR5 Chapter 11 takes deception (intended or otherwise) to new heights. First, by hiding the fact that observational data lies outside the 95% confidence range of their own models, and second by estimating an upper range of warming that their own models say is next to impossible.

On May 18, the Environmental Protection Agency took sides with opponents of Pebble Partnership, a company exploring a copper deposit, some 200 miles west of Anchorage, Alaska. Pebble is probably the largest accessible aggregation of copper‐​bearing minerals in North America.



The Obama Administration has been under relentless pressure to stop Pebble—much more of the pressure emanating from hordes of bicoastal environmentalists as opposed to citizens of sparsely populated Alaska. EPA’s _Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska_ is designed as the first step to do just that, before the Pebble developers have even submitted one permit application.



All of this has very little to do with the welfare of Alaskans. It has much more to do with the President pleasing his environmental base. In fact, it seems that the less that one has been to Alaska, the more one knows what’s best for it. The dinosaur media, especially in northeastern cities, is particularly exercised about the stretch of desolate Alaska that is Pebble—land that was traded by the federal government to the State for mineral development, in exchange for the some land that became Lake Clark Park and Preserve.



EPA’s Assessment ignores this history and the positive economic impact $7 billion of new infrastructure would bring to a place without a diverse economy. The Assessment is designed to be used for regulation based upon the “precautionary principle”. This darling of the global left states that “if something has the potential to cause harm, it shouldn’t be done”. The UN’s a big fan and reports are that they have been sniffing around parts of Bristol Bay looking for a way to get in on the Pebble issue. In fact, its Framework Convention on Climate Change—the scaffold upon which the failed Kyoto Protocol on global warming was erected‐​is based on the precautionary principle, noting that a lack “full scientific certainty” should not provide grounds to preclude regulation.



In other words, if you can’t prove that something will not cause harm—pretty much a logical impossibility—you can’t do it. The precautionary principle is the opposite of the much more productive Song of the South, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.



Under the precautionary principle, there is simply no way that antibiotics would ever have been marketed, had scientists had known of the potential for bacteria to mutate into resistant strains. There would be no airplanes or cars (they can and will crash, you know). Even today, New Jersey and Oregon won’t let you pump gas because your car could explode (and the price of gas must therefore go up).



EPA did its Assessment in response to a petition by a collection of environmental groups requesting that the Agency pre‐​emptively prevent Pebble before it can present its plan and show how it will comply with environemtal laws. So far, that has cost those making the exploration investment about $500 million. The ostensible basis for EPA siding with the environmental opponents is an obscure section of the Clean Water Act that supposedly grants EPA the authority to assess environmental impacts of human activity on watersheds.



While the Agency says that its Assessment passes no judgment on whether or not Pebble proceeds, it is also clear that the document is precisely and specifically designed to be the basis for precautionary principle‐​based litigation. Evidence of this is that it launched the Assessment with a big press conference in Seattle, of all places.



The Assessment assumes a large open‐​pit mine, but Pebble has yet to decide between an underground, a pit, or some combination. When all is said and done, here’s what the Assessment takes hundreds of pages to say:



• An open‐​pit mine and associated tailings will obstruct or alter a exceptionally small percentage of small streams in the massive Bristol Bay watershed that supports the world’s largest natural sockeye salmon fishery.



• An infinitesimal portion of the region’s massive wetlands will be destroyed.



• Some fish will die.



• Some people in the indigenous cultures of Bristol Bay, and hungry bears, may therefore have fewer fish.



• The history of Alaskan mining shows that piles of rocks (tailings) do not go away.



Translation: There is some potential for a—perhaps detectable—effect on the culture and ecology of the Bristol Bay watershed. So, if you want to invoke the precautionary principle to stop Pebble, gentlemen, start your lawyers.



And when that occurs, people should ask, as they smugly drive their hybrids (and pressure the government to mandate millions more) where the copper that wires these vehicles is to come from? If price is any guide, supplies are increasingly tight. Wouldn’t it be a shame if the cost of slamming Pebble shut was to price hybrids even more out of the market?

Guest post b y Bob Tisdale
As we’ve seen in numerous model-data comparisons, there are few similarities between modeled and observed surface temperatures and precipitation.  See here, here, here, here, and here for examples.  We’ve compared satellite-era sea surface temperature to model outputs in past posts (examples here, here and here), but we used model outputs from climate models stored in the CMIP3 archive, which was prepared for the 2007 4th Assessment Report from the IPCC.  In this post, we’re using the outputs of newer CMIP5 models, prepared for the IPCC’s upcoming 5th Assessment Report.  Scenario RCP6.0 for the CMIP5 models is presented because it most closely matches the climate forcings of the scenario called SRES A1B, which was widely cited in the past.
Preliminary Note: We’re looking at the multi-model ensemble mean (the average of all of the individual simulations in the respective archives) because the model mean is the best representation of how the models are programmed and tuned to respond to man-made greenhouse gases. Phrased another way, if the sea surface temperatures were warmed by greenhouse gases, the multi-model mean presents how those sea surface temperatures would have warmed, according to the models. That’s what we’re interested in seeing.  More on this later.
A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CMIP3 AND CMIP5 OUTPUTS
In general, the multi-model mean of the CMIP5 simulations of global sea surface temperature anomalies have a slightly higher linear trend than the CMIP3 models.  See Figure 1. The CMIP5 models have a stronger and more prolonged dip in response to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. They also have a curious additional warming from 2000 to 2010 that almost appears to be an over-response, a kind of excessive rebound, from that volcano.

Figure 1
Two notes:  First, now consider that the observed trend in global sea surface temperature anomalies is almost half the trend shown by the CMIP5 models.  That’s a major difference, suggesting that researchers haven’t yet figured out how and why sea surface temperatures warm.

Second, when looking at the sea surface temperature outputs of climate models, keep in mind that different radiative forcings have different impacts on the oceans. First, let’s discuss downward shortwave radiation.  It’s also known as visible sunlight and penetrating solar radiation, the latter because sunlight penetrates the oceans to depths of 100 meters, decreasing in strength with depth. The dips and rebounds seen in Figure 1, beginning in 1991, are caused by the sun-blocking aerosols spewed into the stratosphere during the explosive volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. They are related to downward shortwave radiation. Downward shortwave radiation from the sun is not to be confused with downward longwave radiation, infrared radiation, from manmade greenhouse gases. Infrared radiation can only penetrate the top few millimeters of the ocean, and that’s where evaporation takes place, leading some oceanographers and physicists to believe that the increases in manmade greenhouse gases could not have caused the oceans to warm.  The data supports that.  In summary, the observed and modeled sea surface temperatures both show dips in responses to volcanic eruptions, which are responses to decreases in sunlight, but that doesn’t mean the modelers are correct in their assumptions that infrared radiation from greenhouse gases caused the warming of sea surface temperatures.
OCEAN BASIN TREND COMPARISONS ON A ZONAL-MEAN (LATITUDINAL) BASIS
Figures 2, 3 and 4 are model-data trend comparisons of sea surface temperature anomalies for the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively.  But they aren’t time-series graphs.  Looking from left to right along the horizontal (x) axis, “-90” represents the South Pole, “0” the equator, and the North Pole is at “90”. The units of the vertical (y) axis are degrees C per decade—based on the calculated linear trend.  Each data point represents the linear trend in degrees C per decade for a 5 degree latitude band, where, for example, the data point at -82.5 (82.5S) latitude represents the linear trend of the latitudes of 85S-80S. The data points representing the trends then work northward in 5 degree increments, 80S-75S, 75S-70S, and so on, using the same longitudes. The average temperatures of latitude bands are called the “zonal mean” temperatures by climate scientists, hence the use of that term in the title blocks.
Figure 2 shows the observed and modeled sea surface temperature trends for the Pacific Ocean (longitudes of 125E-90W) on a zonal-mean basis.  At and near the equator, observed sea surface temperatures cooled since November 1981, the start of the dataset. And the highest observed warming in both hemispheres occurred at the mid-latitudes of the Pacific.

Figure 2
The observed warming trends at mid-latitudes, with no warming near the equator, suggest that warm water was distributed poleward by ocean currents.  In the Pacific, that happens when El Niño events dominate, which was the case during this period, causing the excessive distribution of warm water toward those latitudes. Refer to this comparison of Pacific trends on a zonal-mean basis for the periods of 1944 to 1975 and 1976 to 2011.  It’s Figure 8-32 from my ebook Who Turned on the Heat? From 1944 to 1975, El Nino and La Niña events were more evenly matched, but slightly weighted toward La Niña. During that period, less warm water was released from the tropical Pacific by El Niños and distributed toward the poles. But from 1976-2011, El Niño events dominated, so more warm tropical waters were distributed to the mid-latitudes.
In looking at the unrealistic trends presented by the models, consider that climate models do not simulate the processes of El Niño and La Niña properly. See the discussion of Guilyardi et al (2009) here.
To overcome those failings, the sea surface temperatures in climate models have to be forced by greenhouse gases to create very high warming trends in the tropics, where observations show little warming.   Now consider that the Pacific Ocean stretches almost halfway around the globe at the equator and you’ll understand the magnitude of those failings.
Sunlight is intense in the tropics, and logically the sea surface temperatures (absolute) are warmest there. (That linked illustration is Figure 2.5 from Who Turned in the Heat?) And because sunlight is less intense at the poles, the sea surface temperatures are cold at high latitudes, to the point where the sea surface freezes at the poles. It almost appears as though the climate models show significant warming in the tropical Pacific over the past 31 years because the sea surface temperatures (absolute) are warm there.
Again on a zonal-mean basis, Figure 3 shows the modeled and observed trends in sea surface temperature anomalies for the Atlantic Ocean (longitudes 70W-20E).  The models overestimate the warming in the South Atlantic and underestimate it North Atlantic, especially towards the high latitudes.   In fact, the models show just about the same warming trends from 40S to 70N, while the trends of the observations change greatly over those latitudes.

Figure 3
The last trend comparison on a zonal-mean basis is for the Indian Ocean (20E-120E), Figure 4.  Basically, the models show too much warming at most latitudes.

Figure 4
GLOBAL TIME–SERIES MODEL-DATA COMPARISON
Note: The base period for anomalies is 1971-2000, the standard at the NOAA NOMADS website for the Reynolds OI.v2 data.
For the rest of the model-data comparisons in this post, we’re resorting to standard time-series graphs for the monthly anomalies, with time in years as the x-axis and sea surface temperature anomalies in deg C as the y-axis.
As illustrated in Figure 5, the models inidicate that if greenhouse gases warmed sea surface temperatures, they should have warmed globally at a rate that’s almost twice the observed warming.  In the Northern Hemisphere, Figure 6, the sea surface temperatures warmed faster due to multidecadal variations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Figure 10 from this post), so the models are exploiting the natural variations to acquire a better match.  But the sea surface temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere warmed at a much lower rate, Figure 7, so the disparity there is much greater.  Apparently, the modelers still have no idea how to simulate the warming of the oceans.  This will be even more obvious in individual ocean basins that follow.

CLOSING
About 70% of the planet Earth is covered by water: oceans, seas and lakes. As illustrated in this post, the manmade greenhouse gas-forced component (the multi-model mean) of the climate models prepared for the IPCC’s upcoming 5th Assessment Report shows no similarity to the warming of the sea surface temperatures exhibited by those oceans over the past 31 years.  In other words, the models show no skill at being able to simulate the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans for the past 3+ decades—and since the start of the 20th Century, that’s the period when climate models perform at their best.
One of the biggest problems facing the climate science community is the fact that ocean heat content and satellite-era sea surface temperatures indicate the oceans warmed naturally. This was illustrated and discussed in detail in my essay titled “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge”.  The introductory blog post is here and it can be downloaded here (42MB). This was also presented in my 2-part YouTube video series titled “The Natural Warming of the Global Oceans”. YouTube links: Part 1 and Part 2.  And it was illustrated and discussed, in minute detail, in my ebook Who Turned on the Heat? which was introduced in the blog post “Everything Your Ever Wanted to Know about El Niño and La Niña”.   Who Turned on the Heat? is available for sale only in pdf form here.

ON THE USE OF THE MODEL MEAN
We’ve published numerous posts that include model-data comparisons. If history repeats itself, proponents of manmade global warming will complain in comments that I’ve only presented the model mean in the above graphs and not the full ensemble. In an effort to suppress their need to complain once again, I’ve borrowed parts of the discussion from the post Blog Memo to John Hockenberry Regarding PBS Report “Climate of Doubt”.
The model mean provides the best representation of the manmade greenhouse gas-driven scenario—not the individual model runs, which contain noise created by the models. For this, I’ll provide two references:
The first is a comment made by Gavin Schmidt (climatologist and climate modeler at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies—GISS). He is one of the contributors to the website RealClimate. The following quotes are from the thread of the RealClimate post Decadal predictions. At comment 49, dated 30 Sep 2009 at 6:18 AM, a blogger posed this question:

If a single simulation is not a good predictor of reality how can the average of many simulations, each of which is a poor predictor of reality, be a better predictor, or indeed claim to have any residual of reality?

Gavin Schmidt replied with a general discussion of models:

Any single realisation can be thought of as being made up of two components – a forced signal and a random realisation of the internal variability (‘noise’). By definition the random component will uncorrelated across different realisations and when you average together many examples you get the forced component (i.e. the ensemble mean).

To paraphrase Gavin Schmidt, we’re not interested in the random component (noise) inherent in the individual simulations; we’re interested in the forced component, which represents the modeler’s best guess of the effects of manmade greenhouse gases on the variable being simulated.
The quote by Gavin Schmidt is supported by a similar statement from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). I’ve quoted the following in numerous blog posts and in my recently published ebook. Sometime over the past few months, NCAR elected to remove that educational webpage from its website. Luckily the Wayback Machine has a copy. NCAR wrote on that FAQ webpage that had been part of an introductory discussion about climate models (my boldface):

Averaging over a multi-member ensemble of model climate runs gives a measure of the average model response to the forcings imposed on the model. Unless you are interested in a particular ensemble member where the initial conditions make a difference in your work, averaging of several ensemble members will give you best representation of a scenario.

In summary, we are definitely not interested in the models’ internally created noise, and we are not interested in the results of individual responses of ensemble members to initial conditions. So, in the graphs, we exclude the visual noise of the individual ensemble members and present only the model mean, because the model mean is the best representation of how the models are programmed and tuned to respond to manmade greenhouse gases.

"DJIBOUTI  —   The 10:24 a. m. train out of Djibouti’s capital drew some of the biggest names in the Horn of Africa last month. Serenaded by a chorus of tribal singers, the crush of African leaders, European diplomats and pop icons climbed the stairs of the newly built train station and merrily jostled their way into the pristine,   carriages making their inaugural run. “It is indeed a historic moment, a pride for our nations and peoples,” said Hailemariam Desalegn, the prime minister of Ethiopia, shortly before the train  —   the first electric transnational railway in Africa  —   headed toward Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. “This line will change the social and economic landscape of our two countries. ” But perhaps the biggest star of the day was China, which designed the system, supplied the trains and imported hundreds of engineers for the six years it took to plan and build the   line. And the $4 billion cost? Chinese banks provided nearly all the financing. Having constructed one of the world’s most extensive and modern rail networks at home, China is taking its prodigious resources and expertise global.   subway cars will soon appear in Chicago and Boston, Beijing is building a $5 billion   rail line in Indonesia, and the Chinese government recently christened new rail freight service between London and Beijing. Another ambitious system in the works, the     Railway Network, would link China to Laos, Thailand and Singapore. But few places are being reshaped by China’s overseas juggernaut like Africa, a continent that has seen relatively little new railroad construction in a century. Despite years of steady economic growth,   Africa remains hobbled by an infrastructure deficit, according to the Africa Development Bank, with only half of its roads paved and nearly 600 million people lacking access to electricity. Chinese companies, many of them   and grappling with an economic slowdown at home, have stepped unto the breach, earning about $50 billion a year on new ports, highways and airports across the continent, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Many of the projects are part of Beijing’s new Silk Road initiative, a $1 trillion effort intended to deepen ties between China and its trading partners in the developing world. Much of that spending has been directed at rail projects that planners hope will transform the way Africans travel and do business with one another, and the rest of the world.   and   projects include a      system in the Ethiopian capital a $13 billion rail link between the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa that will open later this year and an ambitious rail modernization project in Nigeria that includes an urban transit system for Lagos. “For the longest time, railroads across Africa were limping along and in decline, but with the Chinese, that’s definitely changing,” said Andrew Grantham, the news editor at Railway Gazette International, a trade publication. China’s enthusiasm for constructing railroads, schools and stadiums in Africa stands in marked contrast to the role of the United States, which has largely shied away from financing infrastructure on the continent. One of the few exceptions, Power Africa, a $9. 7 billion initiative announced by President Barack Obama in 2013, has fallen far short of its goal of providing electricity to 20 million households within five years. When it comes to trade, China surpassed the United States in 2009 to become Africa’s biggest trading partner. It remains unclear how that calculus might change under the Trump administration. President Trump has questioned the benefits of free trade agreements, and a questionnaire from his transition team that was sent to the State Department last month expressed skepticism for foreign aid and development efforts in Africa. That worries some African officials and longtime experts, who fear the loss of American influence and largess  —   and the good will that is often produced by desperately needed infrastructure projects. Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said the United States was also missing opportunities to cultivate loyal customers. “If you’re looking for new markets, Africa is the place to be,” he said. “But right now, the U. S. is not leveraging Africa’s huge potential. By contrast, the Chinese are there, and they are willing to take risks. ” China is placing more than $14 billion worth of bets here in Djibouti, a geopolitically strategic speck of a country beset by soaring poverty and unemployment. The projects include three ports, two airports and a pipeline that will bring water from Ethiopia, its landlocked neighbor and a regional economic power that depends on Djibouti’s ports for 90 percent of its foreign trade. Also on the drawing board are a series of     power plants that would ease summertime electricity failures and help fuel a new   manufacturing zone that officials hope will turn Djibouti into a Hong   entrepôt and international shipping hub. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, said he hoped the new railway linking his country to the Ethiopian capital would be just the first leg of a     route, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic. “The train is already a ” he said, noting that it will cut to 12 hours what until now had been a grueling   or   trip by truck. Mr. Hadi praised the Chinese for going all in after Western banks declined to help finance the nation’s glaring infrastructure needs. “We approached the U. S. and they didn’t have the vision,” he said. “They are not thinking ahead 30 years. They only have a vision of Africa from the past, as a continent of war and famine. The Chinese have vision. ” Not everyone is comfortable with China’s vision. Some worry about the leverage China wields and what happens when countries fall behind on loan payments. For Djibouti, the debt is especially daunting, amounting to 60 percent of its gross domestic product. But Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh, the country’s finance minister, dismissed such concerns, saying Djibouti’s heady 6. 7 percent growth rate would allow it to meet its loan payments. “If we don’t take this risk now and develop our infrastructure, we will remain stuck in poverty,” he said. “Come back in a few years, and you will find that Djibouti has become the logistics hub of the continent. ” Others worry about the Djiboutian government’s lack of transparency, its authoritarian impulses and a vexing legacy of official corruption. Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a leader of Djibouti’s embattled opposition and a former presidential candidate, said the lack of information about the terms of China’s loans raised questions about potential malfeasance. “We’re talking about billions of dollars and complete opacity,” he said. “Have there been kickbacks to government officials? There is no way to know. ” Others wonder what will happen to the system after the Chinese leave. European imperialists in Africa built a skein of lines, most of which fell into disrepair in the decades after their colonies achieved independence. Jamie Monson, the author of “Africa’s Freedom Railway,” a book documenting the legacy of the   train linking Tanzania and Zambia, said   maintenance could be more challenging than initial construction. Built during the Cold War and hailed as a symbol of   friendship, the train, the Tazara Railway, has struggled to maintain regular service, prompting talk of a Chinese takeover. “Without proper maintenance comes problems, which can have a huge impact on a regional economy and local people’s livelihoods,” she said. For now, however, much of nation is euphoric over the completion of Djibouti’s first modern railway, which follows the path of a creaky   line, completed in 1917, that met its demise several years ago after generations of neglect. Although workers from China did much of the technical and engineering work, thousands of Djiboutian and Ethiopian laborers were hired to lay tracks and dig tunnels, helping to head off some of the local resentment that has dogged other Chinese projects in Africa. The system will be operated by Chinese conductors for five years and then turned over to local citizens, many of them trained in China. After a boisterous opening day ceremony in the broiling sun, only the   attendees were allowed to board the train, which filled with applause and song as it glided out of the station. Daha Ahmed Osman, 34, a tech specialist who works for the Djiboutian government, displayed a wide grin as he watched the arid, harshly beautiful landscape spill across the train’s picture windows. He predicted that the new train would transform Djibouti and Ethiopia, and eventually all of Africa. “For this, we have the Chinese to thank, because they shared with us their money and their technology,” he said. “More than anything we thank them for showing confidence in us. ”"

The northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula is Warming Fast   
\-- BBC, August 23, 2012



No, it’s not. When BBC reported this, the Northern Peninsula hadn’t on average warmed a lick in thirty years.   
  
In the 1990s and early part of this century, news reports about the dramatic warming of the northernmost Antarctic Peninsula—the tip of the 800-mile dagger pointed at the heart of Tierra del Fuego—were a common staple. And, while scientists wouldn’t write this in the literature, they were happy to blame it on dreaded carbon dioxide on television, as paleoclimatologist Robert Mulvaney did in the 2012 BBC feature.   
  
The story has become increasingly curious. Marc Oliva of the University of Lisbon recently examined the high quality weather stations over the northern peninsula and the nearby South Shetland Islands. There is a decent warming trend, averaging around 1.5⁰C, from the beginning of the data in 1957 (the year when Antarctica was instrumented as a part of the International Geophysical Year) to the early 1980s, or about a quarter-century. That’s a warming, if it continued (and surely it would!), of 6⁰C per century. The warming that gets huge attention is actually only from a single station, Faraday (now renamed Vernadsky), which warmed roughly 2.5⁰C during the same period. If that continued (and surely it would!), that’s 10⁰C/century!   
  
Oliva et al. wrote that the “Faraday/Vernadsky warming trend is an extreme case, circa twice those of the long-term records from other parts of the AP.” The variability in the Faraday/Vernadsky record is also huge—around three times as much as other stations in the area, probably because it is often at the edge of the sea-ice.   




Satellite data show that sea-ice around Antarctica grew from when satellite data began in 1978 through early 2016, especially after 2000. Last April, the satellite’s sensor started sending back bizarre data. The University of Illinois people who archive this at _Cryosphere Today_ have been using backup sensors that are giving completely strange stuff, such as a huge crash in Antarctic sea ice—larger and faster than anything in the record—followed by an even larger gain. That seems impossible, so recent sea ice data are just plain suspect.   
  
The data shown below are from Olivia et al. What is obvious is since the early 1980s—over three decades ago—there’s no net change of which to speak. And if you want to be picky about it, there a net decline in temperature that begins in the late 1990s, the same time the infamous “hiatus” in global warming started.   
  
Last year, John Turner published a paper in _Nature_ providing evidence that the lack of recent warming is consistent with natural variability _as well as the previous warming_. To wit:   




Therefore all of these [nearby ice-core] studies suggest that the rapid warming on the AP [Antarctic Peninsula] since the 1950s and the subsequent cooling are both within the bounds of the natural decadal-scale variability of the region. 







But that’s not what the public hears.

The Highway Trust Fund is about to run out of money. The federal gasoline tax is set to expire in September. Too many federal transportation dollars have gone to ridiculously expensive projects that do little to support the movement of people and goods.



All of these facts point to one conclusion: It is time for Congress to get out of the transportation business and return highway and transit funding to state and local governments. At the very least, Congress should simply give federal transportation dollars to the states with no strings attached and let them decide how to spend them.





Return highway and transit funding to state and local governments.



In 1956, Congress approved the construction of the Interstate Highway System and funded it by dedicating federal gas taxes to those roads. This led to construction of one of the greatest and the most successful public works projects in history.



The Interstate Highway System was successful because it gave the states a simple mission: build interstate roads. Moreover, that mission was funded out of user fees on a pay‐​as‐​you‐​go basis, meaning that if no one drove on the roads there would be no gas taxes to pay for building them. Today, the interstates make up just 2.5 percent of the lane‐​miles of roads in this country, yet they provide 20 percent of all passenger travel and 15 percent of all freight movement.



The highway bill was written to sunset after six years, requiring Congress to periodically reauthorize it. In 1982, when the interstate highways were largely complete, instead of sunsetting the gas tax, Congress celebrated by raising the tax and dedicating a share of that increase to non‐​highway projects.



Today, gas taxes go to everything from bike paths to transit boondoggles to the writing of urban plans designed to reduce people’s mobility. Meanwhile, the costs of traffic congestion have nearly quintupled since 1982, when Congress began diverting gas taxes to other programs.



The simple mission of building an interstate highway system has been replaced by a complex and often contradictory set of missions: maintaining infrastructure, enhancing mobility, reducing air pollution, discouraging driving, supporting transit, building expensive rail lines, promoting economic development, stimulating the economy, stopping climate change, and ending urban sprawl, among others.



“Government will malperform if an activity is under pressure to satisfy different constituencies with different values and different demands,” wrote management guru Peter Drucker. “Performance requires concentration on one goal.”



In funding nonhighway projects with gas taxes, Congress departed from the pay‐​as‐​you‐​go user‐​fee system that worked so well for the interstates. Moreover, in its infinite wisdom, Congress mandated a minimum level of spending each year even if gas tax revenues didn’t come in. Since the 2008 financial crisis, Congress has had to top off the Highway Trust Fund with $55 billion in general funds to make up for its overspending.



Congress continues to overspend, which is why we’re set to go over what some call a “transportation cliff” in August. The Obama administration has proposed a massive increase in spending with no idea where the money will come from in the long run. Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Bob Corker (R-TN) have proposed to raise gas taxes by 12 cents a gallon, but this will just give Congress more money to waste.



Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) proposes to extend the current law by three months to give members of Congress time to write a new bill. But they had six months six months ago and didn’t do anything about it then. Hardly anyone in Congress or the administration has seriously considered reducing spending to be no more than actual revenues.



Our transportation system is vast and complicated, and there’s no reason to think Congress can know where every dollar should be spent any more than it knows what clothes you should wear today or what you should have for dinner tonight. It is time for Congress to say what it should have said in 1982: The Interstate Highway System is finished, and new transportation projects, including bike paths, transit routes and bridge repairs, are of state or local interest and should be funded by state or local governments.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMedia scientist Sebastian Vehlken: climate models have developed a life of their own, where hard measured data only disrupt
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Media scientist Dr. Sebastian Vehlken works on the theory and history of computer simulation, and studies crowd research and super-computing. In the radio show “Voices of the Sciences” he made very critical statements on computer models’ capability to make prognoses. Quentin Quencher put up a part of the interview at vimeo. In a blog posting at Glitzerwasser, Quencher sorted out an interesting part:
[Vehlken in interview]:
Computer simulations are not necessarily based on sound data that I then project. Here there is always the difference: projections are not prognoses. When I’m dealing with the future with respect to computer simulations, it’s always about generating projections, scenarios – which are always in plural. They are not the future in the system. Here, for example, we can look at climatology.
Recently there was a presentation at our institute. It was about, okay, the claim about climate models is always: ‘Your database isn’t broad enough.’ And then the scientist who made the presentation told us: ‘On one hand the simulators tells that the models run very well, and then we put in data from some sensor in Antarctica…and suddenly it just doesn’t fit.’  Why doesn’t it fit in? Often it’s because the sensor was defective, or the measured data are simply faulty. And so that means I often have systems that are hardly able to produce reliable data.
Yet, I need, so to say, models. And in the meantime, with 20 -30 years of climate research that are simulation-based, the models have become so complex that they have in a sense developed a life of their own – and sometimes measured data simply just disrupt them. In the models there at times assumptions that simply cannot be physically validated. That is they have articifical factors, parameterizations without end. For these there are no empirical databases for them. There is…a complex system..and then there is experimentation with this complex system, which is what my climate model is. And then one sees, okay, when I implement this parameter, which I don’t even know whether or not it really exists.”

In the comments that follows the blog article a friend of models comments and attempts to convince Quencher of their supposedly great use for them. Very amusing. Read for yourself.
==================================
At his Glitzerwasser site here, Quencher sums up what Vehlken says above:
In short, the models, especially the climate models, may be good tools but for making prognoses they are not worth anything, and the projections are fraught with so much uncertainty that they absolutely should not be used as a basis for making policy decisions.”

If nothing else gives away the truth about climate alarmism, the propensity of its adherents to resort to denunciation, witch-hunting and lawfare in order to silence sceptics should remove all doubt.



Michael “Hockey Stick” Mann has launched (and lost) a series of vexatious court actions against his critics. Climate alarmists in the US argued for using anti-organised crime laws to prosecute doubters. Sceptics are vilified, smeared and sued.



These are not the actions of scientists. These are the actions of apparatchiks and despots.



One of their biggest victims in Australia has been Professor Peter Ridd. As [already covered in the BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/they-thought-it-was-good-ridd-ance/), for daring to point out that claims about the threat of climate change to the Great Barrier Reef are alarmist nonsense with little basis in fact, Ridd was sacked from his position at Australia’s James Cook University. Ridd took his former employer to court and won.



But the university is determined to waste no end of taxpayers’ money in order to burn down the heretic.



Back in April, Judge Salvatore Vasta delivered a withering judgment against James Cook University, which he concluded had abused Peter Ridd from pillar to post. Before reading on, it is worth reviewing his criticisms of JCU, especially this one:



 **The manner in which JCU trawled through his emails, to try and find some more evidence of breaches of the Code of Conduct, was reprehensibly unfair to Professor Ridd, especially since he was entitled to write everything that he wrote.**



And this:



 **It would seem that the only way in which Professor Ridd could potentially mitigate his loss is if there were a changing of the guard at the University and [Vice-Chancellor Sandra] Harding and [Provost Chris] Cocklin were no longer in their positions. There is no evidence this will happen any time soon.**



This a shocking verdict on JCU. The judge is openly stating that its most senior management deserve to be sacked.



One might think the judgment’s 34-page flogging would be enough to see JCU lick its wounds, write some cheques and hope that the education minister, formerly Simon Birmingham and currently Dan Tehan, had not been paying too much attention to the disgraceful state of academic freedom on the North Queensland campus.



Which is not much different to most of the other campuses in Australia. The campuses where, for instance, anti-Semitic movements are not just allowed, but openly encouraged; or staff pursue spurious vendettas against students for years in the laughably-named “Human Rights Commission”. As is typical, JCU is pillaging the public purse to keep up its anti-science witch-hunt.



JCU […] is tapping what amounts to a bottomless pit of public money to mount an appeal. Professor Ridd isn’t so well-heeled, so must once again rattle the cup. At his fund-raising site he writes:



‘On hearing that JCU was appealing, Cheryl and I seriously considered just walking away. After all, why should I ask donors for $1.5M to fight a pointless battle that the State or Federal education ministers could settle with a phone call to JCU. $1.5M is a crazy amount that could be used for much better things.’



‘JCU will use its infinite financial resources – effectively government money – to appeal. They have hired three or four senior barristers, one of which we are told charges over $20K per day and between them must be over $40K per day.’



‘Last week JCU also stayed the judgement and capped my access to the compensation for legal fees.’



‘So I must very regretfully ask again for help. We need the best legal assistance to ensure a win. My fabulous legal team led by Stuart Wood AM QC has greatly discounted their costs so far. But appeals are horribly expensive and we need to be prepared to ultimately go to the High Court.’



  
This is the absolute state of modern academia: vindictive apparatchiks wield state power and money in order to hunt down dissenters.



Trofim Lysenko must be laughing in Hell.

"Lady Gaga went for one big, glittering, diverse party with her Super Bowl halftime show. “We’re here to make you feel good,” she declared  . At her N. F. L. news conference, she had promised a statement of “inclusion,” an upbeat and uncontroversial stance, and she made good on it as she began her set, singing a few lines each of “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” and reciting the “one nation indivisible” conclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance. Wearing a shiny, silvery,     bodysuit and matching   boots, with a glittery mask painted around her eyes, Lady Gaga was lowered through the air, on suspension cables, into NRG Stadium in Houston, showing off a   flip. And she started belting her hits, with a nod to the local audience: “Poker Face” announced, “I want to hold ’em like they do in Texas. ” One of those hits was “Born This Way,” her   anthem of   for all kinds of people. “You’re black, white, beige, chola  ’re Lebanese, you’re orient,” she sang, and later, “No matter gay, straight, or   transgendered  ’m on the right track   was born to survive. ” It was doubtless the first time the word “transgendered” had been sung at a Super Bowl halftime show. Dozens of dancers of multiple skin tones and genders joined her, matching her moves in exultant line dances and embodying her message of empowerment as a shared celebration. But most of the show was simply about   pop fun: songs like “Telephone,” about dancing at clubs, and “Bad Romance,” about falling in love and lust. It was a megamix of her songs spanning her career, from her 2008 debut single, “Just Dance,” to “Million Reasons,” the power ballad from her 2016 album, “Joanne. ” She sang “Million Reasons” from a piano as people waving orange electric torches made patterns that radiated across the football field that was her relatively still point in a fiercely athletic performance. “The Super Bowl is what champions are made of,” she declared as “Bad Romance” revved up. Lady Gaga has proudly presented herself as the continuation of generations of    showbiz troupers, a tradition of fervent effort and   spectacle delivered with joy. She sang with hardworking gusto throughout the set, even as she covered considerable yardage strutting and kicking, prancing and gesticulating, pumping her hips and shaking hands with fans. It was a show of shiny costumes and big smiles, of a huge group of dancers all sharing the same moves, an outpouring of energy that was eager to please everybody. Lady Gaga ended it with one last strut, up a ramp, and a   gesture that has been used by both rappers and an  : a microphone drop, earned with sweat."

The online Swiss Berner Zeitung here has an article reporting on how scientists have underestimated the role on climate that the globe’s semi-arid regions are playing. According to the report, climate change has lead to the Nullarbor Plain of southern Australia to be the greenest it has ever been in 30 years.

CO2 is greening up the Nullarbor Plain of southern Australia. Photo credit:  Yewenyi. the GNU Free Documentation License.
Not only is the greening up surprising the scientists, all the new vegetation is also absorbing huge quantities of CO2 from the air…something the models forgot to account for. The article in the Berner Zeitung cites a study recently appearing in journal Nature.
Scientists have noticed that the man-made share of atmospheric CO2 has remained constant recently despite increasing emissions. As a reaction to man-made CO2, the planet has been greening up. The Berner Zeitung writes: “Possible reason: The higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and an additional take-up in atmospheric nitrogen have boosted plant growth.”
The Berner Zeitung describes how scientists once initially believed tropical rainforests would do most of the CO2 absorption, and are now surprised to see that semi-arid lands are are “playing a more important role”, one the never anticipated.
Time to go back and fix the models again.

Berner Zeitung writes:
2011 was extreme: 51 percent of the global CO2 intake on land was by vegetation on semi-arid deserts in three regions in the southern hemisphere. […]
…Since 1981 vegetation coverage in Australia has grown by 6%.”
Other recent studies based on satellite imagery and on-site observations show that the same is true in the African Sahara, which is adding thousands of square kilometers of vegetation every year.
At the end of the report the Berner Zeitung frets that the greening of semi-arid regions may in the end just be harboring a danger because such semi-arid areas are highly prone to bush fires and so the CO2 will wind up back in the air. The Berner Zeitung concludes:
The scientists believe that this hazard will probably increase in the future.”
Just goes to show: No matter what the planets does, pessimism and gloom always win in climate science and media!

"**Visitors to a spa town's seafront are not adhering to coronavirus safety measures, councillors have complained.**
Craig Hannaway, who represents Saltburn on Redcar and Cleveland Council, said there were crowds and most were not socially distancing.
Signs on the seafront and promenade were ""very clear, but they are mainly being ignored"", he said.
The council said it had hired seven coronavirus ""ambassadors"" to provide a public presence and give advice.
Another Saltburn councillor, Philip Thomson, said last month he had received numerous reports from residents about people not following the rules.
""Enforcement should be used to make it clear that this is a serious situation,"" he said.
Current guidance is for people to avoid travelling into and out of areas in tier three, which includes Saltburn.
The ambassadors have no enforcement powers, but can report issues to the authority and other agencies, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Cabinet member for health Steve Kay said the ""vast majority of residents and visitors"" had followed the rules.
""However, the fight is not over and while I absolutely understand people heading to Saltburn, we must remember to socially distance, wear masks at the right time and wash or sanitise our hands,"" he said.Â
The council had put up stickers and signs, he added.
Meanwhile, health bosses at South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust have said they believe it has ""passed the peak"" in this latest spike of cases.
The trust is treating 95 Coved-19 patients as of Tuesday, with 12 in critical care, down from 128 patients and 20 in critical care nine days ago.

"That was fast. Two weeks after her “America First” fashion statement at the inauguration, Melania Trump emerged last weekend from the relative seclusion of her life in New York to join her husband at     a. k. a. the winter White   golf club in Florida. And as far as her sartorial language went, America was  —   well, pretty much last. On Friday, greeting the president as he disembarked from Air Force One in Palm Beach, the first lady wore a short red Givenchy cape dress. On Saturday, at a Red Cross ball, she wore a long   gown from Christian Dior (both brands connected, by the way, to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault, the only foreign luxury mogul to have made a postelection pilgrimage to Trump Tower). But on Sunday, for a Super Bowl party at Trump International Golf Club, she wore leather pants from the Row, the brand of   Olsen and Ashley Olsen, and a thin knit sweater by Derek Lam, both names at New York Fashion Week. Does it matter? On one hand, Mrs. Trump has been explicit about her desire to eschew, at least for the moment, the Washington spotlight. Perhaps her clothes are a part of that, and thus the point was simply to look elegant and not to bother with more complicated billboarding. If so, she achieved that aim. However, Mrs. Trump has also said that she intends to meaningfully inhabit the role of first lady, and certainly this appearance was part of that goal. The choice of the red dress  —   which made for a compelling visual next to President Trump’s red tie as the two walked together along the tarmac  —   was consciously symbolic, according to Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, Mrs. Trump’s senior adviser, who said it was in honor of “National Wear Red Day, which is to highlight the importance and raise awareness about heart disease. ” So it’s not like they haven’t been thinking this through. Or that they aren’t aware of the symbolic value of dress, especially when it comes to a first lady who prefers to let her clothes do the talking. If so, there is a contradiction implicit in her choices of clothing, given her husband’s promise in his Inaugural Address that “Buy American” would be a tenet of his administration. But the    dress requirement for first ladies, historically held dear, was largely taken off the table during the Obama administration and transformed into a vehicle for   outreach. It was Mr. Trump who made it an issue again, and in a forum arguably more public, and permanent, than Twitter. When asked about the issue, Ms. Winston Wolkoff emailed the following statement: “Mrs. Trump is a proud and longtime supporter of American fashion. She appreciates fashion as art. As a former model, she has always been a patron of the world’s most distinguished designers both here and abroad. Mrs. Trump buys from an international mix of brands because that is what reflects her uniquely American life experience and style. She is more excited than ever to make a platform for American designers as she did on one of the most important weeks in history, the Inauguration, showcasing the extraordinary talents of American designers. ” In other words: Buying European is a reflection of the American shopping experience. For anyone who has walked down any main shopping street in a big American city  —   such as Fifth Avenue in New York, where Mrs. Trump lives  —   it’s hard to argue with that. Though it also seems like something of a contorted rationale, and one that could be exploited by companies seeking to relocate some factories overseas. That choice is, after all, also a part of the American industrial story. In any case, it’s worth noting that Givenchy and Dior have been playing possum since the weekend, another indication of fashion’s   relationship with Mrs. Trump. Neither fashion house issued the de rigueur news release trumpeting the first lady’s appearance in one of their dresses. Asked whether the brand had worked with the first lady on the red dress, a spokesman for Givenchy said that the company had no comment and that the dress had been purchased from a store, without any interpersonal discussion. (It is for sale on the Neiman Marcus website, among others, for $2, 095.) Dior simply did not respond. As for Mr. Lam, who in November told the fashion magazine WWD, “I really don’t see myself getting involved with the Trump presidency,” the situation pretty much shows the problem with that stance. After all, the first lady is free to buy his product, whether he wants to get involved or not. Which is another American story, of sorts."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline engineering news magazine Ingenieur.de here writes how Germany’s largest offshore wind park, Bard 1, hasn’t delivered any power since March due to “baffling faults” in the power transmission system.

The sub-heading states:
Baffling faults in the transmission systems have shut down Germany’s largest wind park in the North Sea. Since March experts have been searching for the bugs in the unreliable electrical technology, with no success up to now.”
Eighty 5 MW turbines sitting idle
Experts believe the problem could be in the HVDC transmission, which could be fault-prone. Ingenieur.de writes that the mega-sized wind park Bard 1 consists of 80 units 5-MW turbines. The immense losses incurred due to the shutdown with each passing aren’t difficult to fathom.

Ingenieur.de adds that the engineers don’t appear to be anywhere close to a long-term solution:
Up to now no one knows the cause of the transmission problems. The windpark hasn’t been delivering any power since March.”
The engineering magazine writes that the power generated offshore by the 80 turbines first flows to a collector station, where it is transformed to 380,000 volt AC power and sent to the BorWin 1 Platform before being sent onshore as 150,000 volts HVDC. Ingenieur.de writes: “However, this is not functioning.”
If the problem is indeed rooted in the HVDC technology, then Germany’s dream of supplying its demand with wind power will be in serious jeopardy. Ingenieur.de writes that should this be the case, “then the complete concept of the power providers, producers, grid operators and the German government is in danger.”
Poorly engineered
Ingenieur.de writes, however, that it is unlikely that the problem has to do with the HVDC technology, as it is successfully being used all over the world. The engineering magazine believes the problems likely stem from the technology that is placed just before the HVDC platform, which “was designed by Bard itself, and not by an experienced company like ABB, Siemens or General Electric.” (One can almost sense the schadenfreude).
Ingenieur.de notes that Bard is now financially insolvent, and that in the meantime grid operator TenneT is scrambling to find a solution, hoping the faults will be rectified in August.
Anyone following Germany’s man-on-the-moon-scale offshore windpark project will tell you that it is currently quite a huge mess. So much so that things can only get better.

"MOUNT VERNON, Va.  —   The costumed characters at George Washington’s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries, whether about   privies or the first president’s teeth. So when a visitor recently asked an     in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn’t miss a beat. Judge’s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been “a great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,” the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter. “Ona was born free, like everybody,” she said. “It was this world that made her a slave. ” It’s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington’s death, when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington. But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons’ dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story  —   and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  —   is having its fullest airing yet. Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in “Lives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington’s Mount Vernon,” the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,” by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Most scholars who have written about Judge’s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington’s evolving ideas about slavery. But “Never Caught,” published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage. “We have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,” Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon’s    food court. “But decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story. ” Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced   tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. “Lives Bound Together,” which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one    room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts. “We had so much material, and it’s such an important story,” Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. “We realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them. ” The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the   estate. But integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of Washington  —   “a leader of character,” as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  —   remains unfinished work, some scholars say. “He’s a much more mythic figure than Jefferson,” said Annette   the author of “The Hemingses of Monticello” and a Harvard professor. “Many people want to see him as perfect in some way. ” But his determined pursuit of Judge, she said, as much as his will freeing his slaves, reflects the basic   of slave owners. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’” she said. Ms. Dunbar, the author of “Never Caught,” first came across Ona Judge in the late 1990s, when she was a graduate student at Columbia researching free black women in Philadelphia. One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of “a light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair” who had “absconded” from the president’s house. “I said to myself: ‘Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don’t I know about her? ’” Ms. Dunbar recalled. Since then, Judge’s story has inspired several children’s books, and even an episode of “Drunk History. ” But “Never Caught” is the first   nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous. “There’s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,” Ms. Dunbar said. It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see Ona Maria Judge, who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington’s personal maid. When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community. Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge’s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington’s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N. H. where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons’. In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had “never received the least moral or mental instruction,” she said. Judge’s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of “privileged” house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  —   and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  —   is described in detail. Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania’s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the “ingratitude” of Judge, who fled “without any provocation,” the president wrote. After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been “enticed away by a Frenchman,” discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed. When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha’s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as “totally inadmissible. ” However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only “reward unfaithfulness” and give ideas to others “far more deserving of favor. ” In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared. Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property. Ms. Dunbar calls Washington’s act “no small thing,” but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story. “When it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,” she said. “He dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That’s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road. ”"

Mariana Mazzucato’s _The Value of Everything_ is premised upon her previous research into debunking myths about lone entrepreneurs and startups and ignoring a key actor of “first resort” — the state. Because of this “glaring omission,” she believes that our economic theory of value creation is flawed, and this conceptual flaw is a major reason for the growing problem of wealth inequality in Western nations. Her question? Are we sure that much of what is passing for “value creation” is not just “value extraction” in disguise? She argues that this blurring of two different economic concepts is precisely what has occurred in post‐​World War II industrial economies.



According to Mazzucato, understanding the history of the “production boundary” — and specifically what lies inside this boundary and outside of it — is critical to understanding how theories of value have evolved over the last 300 years. Inside this boundary has included all productive activities generated by the wealth creators, while outside the boundary lay the rent seekers. Such rent seekers benefit due to their monopolistic behavior or because wealth from the productive side is redistributed to them (“wealth extractors”). As Mazzucato explains in the early part of her book (Chapters 1 and 2), the boundary (“production frontier”) between the “makers” and “takers” has not been fixed but has shifted due to social, political, and economic forces. These forces have influenced the development of government measures of growth of the economy. More important, Mazzucato argues that the production boundary began to blur in the latter half of the 19th century so that almost anything that could attract a price in the marketplace could successfully claim value, including financial services (but, interestingly, not government).



Chapter 3 reviews the arcane world of national income accounts. Today’s national accounts include decisions about what constitutes value by blending any goods and services priced and exchanged legally. Mazzucato’s criticism of this approach is that it now includes “politically pragmatic decisions” such as accommodating technological change in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry or new services and products offered in the overinflated financial sector. This, however, leads to a flexible production boundary that allows former nonmembers of the “wealth creators” to lobby (“rent‐​seek”) to move from the “unproductive” to the “productive” side, and their formerly value‐​extracting activities are then counted in national gross domestic product (GDP) (with few noticing this transition).



In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, Mazzucato evaluates the rapid growth in the financial services sector in the late 20th century. For example, economists viewed this sector as rather “unproductive” — simply transferring existing value — through the 1960s. Yet, by the later part of the century, it had evolved to a “productive” status. Today, in its 21st century reincarnation, the financial services sector is widely recognized as earning profits from a wide variety of services. Mazzucato, however, remains unconvinced that this transformation is inherently productive rather than the result of political expediency and the success of rent‐​seeking activities by this industry. Moreover, she questions how the expansion of financial intermediaries (the asset management industry) and the actual risks they have taken on justify the lucrative financial rewards they accrue. Her analysis finds that fund management and private equity have contributed far less to the productive economy than what the industry asserts.



Mazzucato argues that, until activities in the financial sector are accurately accounted for in national income accounts (are they rents or profits?), no serious debate on financial reform can take place. She believes that, if we can properly address this issue, society can better understand the dynamics of value destruction in the 2008-09 world financial crisis. Mazzucato also evaluates the financialization of the whole economy. She drills down on the concept of maximizing shareholder value (MSV), a short‐​term perspective that arose in the 1970s as a way to revitalize floundering corporate profits. Allegedly, following the Friedman maxim, MSV invoked the main purpose of the firm: creating value for shareholders. Mazzucato argues that MSV has been detrimental to long‐​term economic growth, rewarding shareholders (identified as the biggest risk takers) with short‐​term gains (and increasing the influence of fund managers) at the long‐​term expense of companies (who should be reinvesting in research and development and employee skills development). Alternatively, Mazzucato proposes a stakeholder management approach sharing risks and rewards among multiple company risk takers over the long term.



In Chapter 7, Mazzucato directly addresses risk taking and the process of capturing radical technological innovation. While innovation is one of the riskiest and uncertain activities in capitalism, she acknowledges such efforts often fail. Mazzucato identifies the prevailing biased view of public‐​sector risk taking as generally ignored in the technological innovation narrative, with the state seen as merely facilitating and reducing risk for private‐​sector initiatives. This narrative has resulted in ongoing policy reforms strengthening the existing intellectual property rights (IPR) system, which in turn has strengthened the power of incumbents, thereby limiting innovation and creating what Mazzucato calls “unproductive entrepreneurship.” She further argues against the false presentation of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as the most dynamic actors in modern capitalism and as wealth creators. Offering their platform technologies in the sharing economy, the tech giants claim value in their innovation, but Mazzucato argues that they are less about genuine innovation and much more to do with facilitating value extraction through rent capture.



Chapter 8 focuses on what Mazzucato calls the “underestimated” public sector. She argues that, in the same way and in the same period (the 1980s) that finance emerged as productive, the public sector shifted to an unproductive status. According to modern neoclassical economic theory, government’s role is to fix private‐​sector market failures rather than actively creating and shaping markets. This fundamentally affects how government views itself — that is, inefficient, ineffective, and careful of not being accused of crowding out innovation or of “picking winners.” Mazzucato notes that government remains unaccounted for in GDP accounting, and she suggests a societal debate of a “new and deeper understanding of public value.” Such public value, she argues, should be a product of the whole society and is a goal useful to “shape markets.” Mazzucato wants public institutions to “think big” and play a major role in the transformations to come, including the “issues of climate change, ageing populations, and the need for twenty‐​first century infrastructure and innovation.”



Chapter 9 concludes the book with the “economics of hope.” Triggered by criticisms of the modern, “dysfunctional” capitalist systems — ranging from it is too “speculative,” to it rewards “rent seekers” over “wealth creators,” to encouraging rampant growth of finance over job creation — has led to a series of proposed reforms. These reforms include focusing the financial sector on long‐​run investments, new corporate governance structures less focused on quarterly returns, taxing speculative trades more heavily, and curbing excess executive pay.



Mazzucato, however, offers her own set of policy prescriptions. First, policymakers should be “emboldened” to negotiate symbiotic public‐​private partnerships, such as in the financial services sector, where new mission‐​oriented, state investment banks can provide strategic, long‐​term finance necessary for high‐​risk investments required for the R&D for real value creation. Second, patent law should be encouraged to foster research into needed essential drugs rather than for blocking competition and innovation through the application of strong and wide patents. Mazzucato further suggests granting fewer patents upstream, allowing the tools for biopharmaceutical research to be open access for all competitors. Third, more thinking in the ICT and digital sectors is necessary concerning the appropriate tax system for companies like Uber and Airbnb, which Mazzucato argues would never have existed without publicly funded technologies such as GPS and the Internet. Fourth, public investment cannot be limited to traditional infrastructure projects and should be extended to “green transformation.” Says Mazzucato: “A green revolution will require deliberate and conscious changes in social values; a redirection of the entire economy, transforming production, distribution and consumption in all sectors.”



Crucially, it is imperative that the reader understands that Mazzucato takes issue with the modern neoclassical economics position that price is the determinant of the value of products and services. She believes that the modern price system distorts the historically traditional view of value creation where specifically identified human, physical, and intangible resources produce new goods and services, rather than by individuals who decide what is valuable to them (and signaling such “wealth‐​creating value” by paying the price for such products or services). In other words, socially constructed value results in a price, rather than price designating value. To this end, Mazzucato spends little time emphasizing individual liberty and market freedom. Instead, most of her intellectual efforts are geared to explaining institutional examples of societal collective choice.



She argues that many activities, such as many of those found in the financial services sector, simply move existing resources around without creating any new value, resulting in value extraction. Is there evidence of this in the financial services sector? Certainly, but the financial services market has been adjusting in recent years, specifically with the growth in low‐​cost asset management services (now accelerating with the emergence of fintech) capturing an increasing share of this market. Moreover, Mazzucato’s view of venture capitalists as being far from real risk takers is strangely naïve. The data show that venture capitalists are likely to invest in a successful venture once or twice among every 10 invested projects. On average, a 15 percent success rate still leaves an 85 percent failure rate — a high‐​risk endeavor in most people’s opinion.



The biopharmaceutical industry is also a target for Mazzucato. As an example of value extraction, she points to Gilead’s Harvoni, an effective treatment for hepatitis C first commercially available in 2014. According to Mazzucato, the drug’s $94,500 initial list price for a 12‐​week treatment plan had no basis in the true cost of developing and manufacturing this pharmaceutical (regardless of the astronomical commercial failure rates in this industry). Most important, says Mazzucato, given the high public subsidies in basic research for this industry, “drug prices are not falling.” In fact, competitors of Gilead had driven the drug list price for Mavyret, a comparably effective treatment, down to $26,400 for an eight‐​week treatment plan in 2017, a 72 percent decline in cost to the consumer or health insurance provider. Moreover, annual growth in U.S. retail prescription drug spending did slow in 2016 (to 1.2 percent), following two years of strong growth: 11.1 percent in 2014, and 9.2 percent in 2015. By 2018, U.S. consumers were purchasing 90 percent of their pharmaceuticals as low‐​cost, price competitive generic drugs — a major contributor to holding the line on pharmaceutical price increases.



Mazzucato’s progressive approach to “solving” the maladies of modern capitalism suffers from many of the same weaknesses exhibited in previous attempts at state central planning. For example, the R&D state investment bank concept harkens back to the good old days of industrial policy. This contrasts with presenting a more realistic, market‐​based approach to encouraging development of an industrial strategy — one where basic, nonappropriable R&D funding by government meets the constitutional needs of critical national security and economic competitiveness (including that of protecting domestic IPRs from foreign infringement and widespread industrial espionage). Moreover, her support for a “green revolution” all but dooms fossil fuels (regardless of how “clean”), as this redirection of the economy will employ the coercive power of the state regulatory apparatus imposing its transformative will on all industrial sectors. Likewise, growing national budget deficits are of little long‐​term economic concern to Mazzucato. Such public “investments,” however, need to be effectively spent by government on proper “wealth‐​creating” activities.



Mazzucato does concern herself with a lack of competition among certain industries, but surprisingly does not recognize recent competition policy scrutiny of tech giants’ alleged anti‐​competitive business practices in Europe, as well as recent antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. For example, since 2010, the European Union (EU) has launched three separate antitrust investigations into Google for violating the EU’s competition law. By encouraging greater competition (and investment in technological innovation), such policies will go a long way in creating wealth, rather than diverting company resources into (societally) unproductive rent‐​seeking lobbying activities and legal strategies in the public policy arena.



Yet, while the tech giants are painted by Mazzucato as 21st century rent seekers and wealth extractors, Ama​zon​.com in July 2019 unveiled plans to retrain a third of its U.S. workforce — or 100,000 workers — by 2025 to help its employees move into more advanced jobs or find new careers. The planned program is among the biggest corporate retraining initiatives ever announced, at a cost of roughly $7,000 per worker, or a voluntary $700 million expenditure into human resource training.



Nevertheless, while Mazzucato recognizes the importance of education to society, she spends little time on how effective public education has been in many Western societies. An assessment of this important publicly mandated “wealth‐​creating” activity (especially in the United States, which is perpetually globally ranked in the mediocre middle among Western countries in science, math, and reading comprehension in grades K-12 — and not for a lack of per pupil expenditure) would have provided a more balanced approach to understanding real long‐​term value creation for society. Yet examples of such gaps in the analysis are what ultimately defines this book and leaves the reader intellectually unfulfilled with more questions than answers.



For example, it’s an oversimplification to say that “corporate leaders are not telling the whole truth when they say that shareholders are the only risk takers and hence deserve the lion’s share of the gains from doing business.” Anyone familiar with a basic balance sheet knows that labor expenses make up the largest category of cost to a modern service business. Employee salaries and benefits are paid before shareholders receive dividends. “Investments” made by schools, public agencies, etc. are funded by these same businesses through taxes and fees. Taxes to various levels of government are paid before shareholders are compensated. Corporate investment in capital equipment and new information technology systems are a requisite for long‐​term success of firms. This helps to satisfy market analysts who are interested in the long‐​term viability of firms. Mazzucato’s accusation that companies put “financial markets and shareholders first” and “offer as little as possible to other stakeholders” reveals a lack of true understanding of how important other stakeholders are to the long‐​term success of private firms. Perhaps a better understanding of how firms actually operate in the real world would better inform Mazzucato’s insights and recommendations.

So the little ones managed to tag an extra day onto their school holidays, no doubt with the blessing of their so-called teachers who have decided that climate change is a subject within the curriculum that deserves to be politicised. This is a tool whereby students can be brainwashed to the point of fear through hysteria emanating from many teachers’ mouths purely to suit and promote their left-wing U.N. agenda. No doubt there were thousands more pupils who simply took the day off.



It is most unfortunate that the Prime Minister is leading the charge in the dissemination of this willfully misleading information. The nonsense being spouted to students that the planet, and indeed they themselves are going to perish because of the climate within their lifetimes, is but one part of a broader push for the implementation of the UN dream of a one-world government controlled by the Socialist left. This is not unlike [the goal Hitler had ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-fourth-reich-marches-to-victory-at-last/)when he instigated World War Two. The likes of Ardern and her dangerous ilk who like to call themselves progressives are in fact nothing of the sort. They are all comrades stuck in the past, running around with their cloth caps on and waving their hammers and sickles.



The EU view of Brexit is a good example Aside from the fact that they need Britain more than Britain needs them (something they wouldn’t admit to), Britain leaving is the end of their dream of a European Empire. This has been articulated by Mr Verhofstadt of the European Commission and he is very angry. The real objective is to get a number of similar groups around the globe such as the one we have joined. Like the EU they start off as a trading arrangement and then the political angle is introduced. The end result is all the groups become one single entity and there’s your world Government.



The other arrant nonsense Jacinda is promoting is one where we live in a borderless world as one people being kind and hugging each other. This is all part of the plan. It is however completely devoid of reality. Where, for example, do Maori and the Treaty of Waitangi fit in that scenario? As a country do we just forfeit our sovereignty? If that is Jacinda’s true aim then she should immediately stand aside and hand over the reins to someone who is prepared to put New Zealand’s interests first.



These dangerous conspiracies are being driven and funded by the likes of George Soros and others of similar warped thinking. Wherever or whenever there’s trouble, the name Soros seems to pop up; Greta Thunberg being a recent example. If Jacinda was smart enough she’d realise she is fraternising with people who have undesirable aims for both the planet and its inhabitants. They are only interested in pushing their own barrows with the end result being of benefit to no one but themselves.



I, for one, do not wish the sovereignty of my country to be lost at the behest of lunatic socialist dictators. Nationalism and patriotism are what this country needs along with a political party which is prepared to show similar intent. I have yet to be convinced that we have one.

So much for Endurance…

From Louise Gray at The Telegraph:
Wind turbine collapses in high wind
A controversial 115ft wind turbine has collapsed after being hit by heavy winds.

The £250,000 tower, which stood as tall as a ten storey building, was hit by gale force gusts of 50mph.


The structure then collapsed at a farm in Bradworth, Devon, leaving a “mangled wreck”.


Margaret Coles, Chairwoman of Bradworthy District Council, said hail storms and strong winds have hit the area and the turbine, installed just three years ago, simply could not withstand the wind.  


“The bolts on the base could not withstand the wind and as we are a very windy part of the country they [the energy company] have egg on their face,” she said. “There are concerns about safety.”
The Bradworthy Parish Council, who opposed the turbine, expressed concern that there was “nothing exceptional” in the speed of the winds.
Installed by renewable energy company Dulas it was supposed to have a life expectancy of 25 years.
Full story here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/windpower/9837026/Wind-turbine-collapses-in-high-wind.html
==============================================================
Of course, Ms. Gray calls a 50 mph wind a “high wind”, but that sort of wind isn’t an unusual event for the area. Besides, the specs for the Endurance E-3120 wind turbine say:

Given its, ahem, endurance, one wonders if the council will allow it to be reconstructed. I’m thinking no.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne website here directs our attention to a story appearing at the www.zukunft-skisport.at website.
It writes that by every measure winters in the European Alps have gotten “considerably colder” over the last 26 years.

Alps have gotten colder and snowier over last 26 years, data show.
Not long ago, “renowned scientists” were predicting that much of the ski industry would soon be disappearing in the European Alps and that vineyards would be moving in their place. Other scientists predicted that snow in the winter would soon be “a thing of the past“.
But according to data presented by zukunft-skisport.at, precisely the opposite is actually taking place.
Figure 1 at their site shows winter temperatures at the Hahnenkamm station at Kitzbühel (1790 m). Clearly the trend here is dramatic cooling (7.5°C per century) taking place over the last 20 years! Moreover 8 of the coldest winters occurred in the last 11 years alone.
Figure 2 shows the development of winter temperatures at the Ostalpen (East Alps) summit since 1970/71. The chart is the average of three stations: Säntis, Zugspitze and Sonnblick. Here as well the trend since 1988 is sharply downwards, thus causing global warming scientists’ eyebrows to hit the ceiling. In fact there hasn’t been any warming in 43 years, i.e. almost half a century!
Well, maybe the data being used are not really reliable. Banish the thought. Zukunft-skisport.at writes:
The measured data come from each of the official national institutions: ZAMG (Austria), DWD (Germany) and MeteoSwiss (Switzerland).”
And as many of us know, nobody measures things more precisely than these guys and gals do.
Figure 3 shows the temperature development for Ostalpen since 1988. On temperatures, Zukunft-skisport.at summarizes:

All measurements show that it has gotten colder in the mountains of the Ostalpen over the last 26 years. Emeritus Univ. Prof. Dr. Michael Kuhn, for years on the board at the Institute for Meteorology Innsbruck, formulated in a personal interview: ‘The fact is that winters in Tirol have gotten colder over the last 15 years.'”
No change in snow amounts in over four decades!
Not only temperatures have been rapidly declining. Also snow amounts in the European Alps have been rising, thus contradicting claims of warming. Zukunft-skisport.at:
Analogous to winter temperatures, also the snow amounts in the last 4 decades have not changed significantly, as they had been predicted to do.”
Figure 4 shows the development of snow depth at Saalfelden (800 m) since 1970/71. Year-to year variation is substantial. The 30-year moving average shows a slight decline. However, a substantial increase is shown since 1998.
Figure 5 shows the development of ski-lift operation days at Kitzbühel since 1992/93. Here as well we see a trend of more ski-days. The last two years have set new record highs!
Zukunft-skisport.at asks what should we expect for the future, and reminds its readers:
Currently 97.4 percent of the climate model simulations cannot correctly reproduce global climate reality. The ZAMG (2013, www.zamg.ac.at) therefore concludes in its essay ‘Temperature-Hiatus’: The research results of the last years are showing us more and more often that natural fluctuations in climate are considerable. The current temperature hiatus shows that the climate system is still not understood with regards to its full complexity and that the global climate models are still not adequate.“
So much for the myth of warming in the Alps of Europe. Global warming scientists have got to be embarrassed and humiliated. You couldn’t be more wrong if you tried.
=======================
EIKE here also pointed out last year that temperatures in Germany have been cooling over the last quarter century.

During the last three years, since 2011, the ice around Antarctica has been growing, in most seasons, more than during any similar periods of the satellite era where we have that data.
At first, the climate catastrophists ignored this phenomenon. When that became embarrassingly inconvenient, they began to blame it on instrument problems.
They detected a step-change in the data in 1991, but couldn’t decide which side of the step was the correct data, and the fault only excused about 5% of the increase. The step change supposedly occurred in 1991. 
Figure 1 is from the paper as described above. The step occurs at the end of 1991.
 Figure 2 is the satellite (RSS) lower troposphere temperature data for the southern hemisphere south of 20° South.
Note the step in July 1991. The step in temperature occurs in July 1991. What happened in the summer of 1991? Mount Pinatubo blew up on the 15th of June. How long does it take for volcanic equatorial cooling to reach 70° South? About six months. Can you see the step in the ice data? I can’t. It doesn’t show in the annualized ice date (Figure 4) either

Figure 3: Hemisphere sea ice anomaly data in the satellite era. Source 
If a real step was detected in the ice anomaly data, it coincides with a cooling step in the southern hemisphere temperature, and is real, not an instrumental artifact. To make it easier to see the trends, the next figure is annualized data, sea ice anomaly and temperature anomaly from satellite (RSS) for the latitudes of coastal Antarctic, 70°south to 60°south, with the trends. Temperature has been inverted to match the ice.

Figure 4: Plot of the ice anomaly (annualized) and the temperature anomaly (also annualized) for the latitudes of coastal Antarctica.
It is apparent in Figure 4 that most of the changes in the ice anomaly plot match changes in temperature. Keep in mind that the temperature plot is inverted, cold is upward, warm downward, to match the behavior of the ice. The recent increase in ice is because it has gotten colder.
Though the temperature trend in the last 35 years is only slightly cooler, the ice has increased dramatically. Here are trend maps of the temperature changes in the polar regions in the last ten years from GISS. Compare the temperature changes along the coast of Antarctica to the ice anomaly map.

Figure 5 is a map of the global temperature change over the last ten full years from GISS.
Note that the Global temperature trend from 2003 to 2013 in Figure 5 above, (top right corner) matches the 70° to 60° South decade trend in Figure 4.

Figure 6 (right) is the current ice anomaly map for Antarctica. I turned it 90° counter clockwise to match the Antarctic as seen in Figure 5.
There is more ice where it has been colder. There are many gaps in the temperature data around Antarctica, especially ocean data. But even on the continent, station data is quite sparse and subject to UHI (Urban Heat Island) problems for the larger stations. That large orange spot in Antarctica in Figure 5 is due to McMurdo Station, the largest and most populous base on the continent.
The next largest heat source is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
The ice around Antarctica is not increasing due to global warming. It is increasing due to global COOLING!

"**Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol.**
An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer
Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday.
Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday.
Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday.
The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions, including from its own backbenches.
Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday.
That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said.
Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"".
He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here.
""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament.""
Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday.
""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said.
Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"".
Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland.
He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"".
""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said.
""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers.
""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work...
""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion.""
Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules.
""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said.
""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all.
""It's frustrating.""
Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low.
Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later.
Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"".
The petition showed more than 18,000 signatures on Wednesday afternoon.
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol.
""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said.
""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus.""
Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter.
Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK.
Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added.
The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, has called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.
Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme.
The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus.
A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown, after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches.
Under the highest, tier three, all hospitality venues must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services."
"LINCOLN IN THE BARDOBy George Saunders343 pages. Random House. $28. George Saunders’s   first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” is like a weird folk art diorama of a cemetery come to life. Picture, as a backdrop, one of those primitively drawn   mourning paintings with rickety white gravestones and   monuments standing under the faded green canopy of a couple of delicately sketched trees. Add a tall, sad mourner, grieving over his recently deceased son. And then, to make things stranger, populate the rest of the scene with some Edward   ghosts, skittering across the landscape  —   at once menacing, comical and slightly   . “Lincoln in the Bardo” takes, as its   point, the death of Abraham Lincoln’s beloved    son, Willie, who succumbed to typhoid fever on Feb. 20, 1862, and the   president’s visits to the crypt where his son was interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery in nearby Georgetown. Saunders intercuts facts and   (culled from books and news accounts) in a   narrative with some ghost stories of his own imagining, allowing a chorus of disembodied spirits to describe Lincoln’s visits, while babbling on about their own regrets and misplaced dreams. “Bardo” is the Tibetan Buddhist name for a transition period between death and rebirth and seems to indicate, in this case, the bizarre purgatory inhabited by these ghosts. The supernatural chatter can grow tedious at times  —   the novel would have benefited immensely from some judicious pruning  —   but their voices gain emotional momentum as the book progresses. And they lend the story a choral dimension that turns Lincoln’s personal grief into a meditation on the losses suffered by the nation during the Civil War, and the more universal heartbreak that is part of the human condition. The ghosts are a motley lot, reminiscent of the dispossessed and disenfranchised characters in Saunders’s short stories. They include a soldier, a murderer, a disgraced clerk, a rape victim, a hunter who’s killed more than 30 bears and hundreds of deer, an aggrieved scholar, a mother of three girls, a young man who tried to kill himself after the man he loved spurned his affections, and an older man who was struck in the head by a falling ceiling beam and died before he could consummate his marriage to his pretty young wife. Together, these voices create a kind of portrait of an American community  —   not unlike the one in Edgar Lee Masters’s 1915 classic, “Spoon River Anthology,” which was set in a fictionalized version of a small Illinois town. The poems in “Spoon River” were narrated from beyond the grave by the dozens of souls “sleeping on the hill” in the local cemetery. One of those characters was Anne Rutledge, rumored to have been Lincoln’s first love, and whose untimely death  —   reportedly of typhoid at the age of 22  —   was said to be a source of his often melancholy outlook on the world. The similarities between “Spoon River” and Saunders’s new novel extend well beyond the Lincoln association and the graveyard confessions. Like Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio” (1919)  —   itself a notable influence on Saunders’s early short stories  —   and Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” (1938) “Lincoln in the Bardo” appropriates Masters’s multivoiced approach, using it to create a story that unfolds into a meditation on the dreams and disappointments of ordinary people, longing for connection but often left feeling isolated and alone. Saunders’s short stories  —   “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,” “Pastoralia,” “In Persuasion Nation” and “Tenth of December”  —   tend to vacillate between two impulses: satire and black comedy, reminiscent of Nathanael West and Kurt Vonnegut and a more empathetic mode, closer to Anderson and William Trevor. Though there are moments of dark humor in some of the ghost stories here, “Bardo” definitely falls into the more introspective part of that spectrum. In these pages, Saunders’s extraordinary verbal energy is harnessed, for the most part, in the service of capturing the pathos of everyday life  —   as experienced by the spirits of the dead, remembering missed opportunities by Willie, as his life slips away and he enters the limbo of the bardo and by Lincoln, as he struggles to come to terms with his son’s death and the devastation of a war that is ripping the country apart. Saunders’s novel is at its most potent and compelling when it is focused on Lincoln: a grave, deeply compassionate figure, burdened by both personal grief and the weight of the war, and captured here in the full depth of his humanity. In fact, it is Saunders’s beautifully realized portrait of Lincoln  —   caught at this hinge moment in time, in his own personal bardo, as it were  —   that powers this book over its more static sections and attests to the author’s own fruitful transition from the short story to the   form of the novel. “His mind was freshly inclined toward sorrow,” Saunders writes of Lincoln, “toward the fact that the world was full of sorrow, that everyone labored under some burden of sorrow that all were suffering that whatever way one took in this world, one must try to remember that all were suffering (none content all wronged, neglected, overlooked, misunderstood) and therefore one must do what one could to lighten the load of those with whom one came into contact that his current state of sorrow was not uniquely his, not at all, but, rather, its like had been felt, would yet be felt, by scores of others, in all times, in every time, and must not be prolonged or exaggerated, because, in this state, he could be of no help to anyone and, given that his position in the world situated him to be either of great help or great harm, it would not do to stay low, if he could help it. ”"
"**The Debenhams website has been overwhelmed by shoppers searching for bargains**after the department store chain collapsed **.**
The firm launched a stock clearance sale on Wednesday at 07:00 as non-essential retailers in England reopen after a four-week lockdown.
But high demand led to long, virtual queues of thousands and by mid morning the site had crashed altogether.
""We have been seeing unprecedented levels of visits,"" a spokesperson said.
In a bid to keep up with the additional demand, the retailer was forced to implement a queuing system for its website, which promised customers: ""We will get you onto the site as soon as possible.""
On Tuesday, the company spelled out how many shoppers were on its site, at one point queues stretched into many hundreds of thousands, but on Wednesday Debenhams was no longer displaying that information.
Some social media users reported as many as 900,000 other customers in the queue for the website.
The company had already been running a 14-day ""Black Friday"" sales event, with discounts of up to 70% from Wednesday onwards in-store and online across clothes and homeware.
For other customers, the website crashed completely on Tuesday evening, either before reaching the virtual queue or having reached the checkout stage for their purchases.
One social media user wrote that they had been given only 30 minutes to complete their shopping online.
""Only problem is once you get in there the homepage keeps crashing. No wonder they've gone bust,"" they wrote.
Twitter user Danielle Harmer said: ""Finally get onto the website, start adding to my basket and then an error message pops up saying my queue number has been rejected and I have to join the back of the queue again! Actually livid.""
All of Debenhams' 124 UK stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain.
It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the shops cease trading, unless the administrators do a deal for all of parts of the business.
Some social media users expressed sympathies for those staff members now facing uncertainty. Heather Angus wrote: ""If you're planning to go raid Debenhams with the announcement of them selling off stock, please be kind to their staff. This is awful.""
Debenhams had been in administration since April. It is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company.
The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat.
Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder for the company, JD Sports, withdrew.
There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales.
Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them.
Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into Debenhams stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock.
Shoppers will still be able to buy items in-store and on the Debenhams website, until all of it is sold.
Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during the Black Friday sales, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them.
The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid.
However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund."
"A fiery meteor streaked across the Midwest sky early Monday morning, seen as far west as Nebraska and as far east as New York. Unfortunately for scientists who would like to study where it came from and how it got here (although perhaps fortunately for people living in the vicinity) all of the surviving bits of rock plopped into Lake Michigan. The American Meteor Society has received more than 350 reports from witnesses of the green fireball, which occurred around 1:25 a. m. local time. William B. Cook, a NASA meteor expert, reported in a email to NASA headquarters that the fireball originated about 60 miles above West Bend, Wis. moving about 38, 000 miles an hour toward the northeast before disintegrating about 21 miles above Lake Michigan. As the meteor fell apart, it emitted   sounds that were recorded in the Canadian province of Manitoba, about 600 miles away. The blast released energy that was equal to at least 10 tons of TNT, Dr. Cook said, suggesting that the object that entered the atmosphere was at least 600 pounds and two feet in diameter. Most of the reports came from Wisconsin and Illinois. Michael Hankey of the American Meteor Society said such fireballs happen every day somewhere, but only rarely  —   perhaps four a year  —   do they occur over populated areas of the United States where the light show can be captured by dashboard cameras, security cameras and night owls carrying cellphones. “There were just a ton of videos,” Mr. Hankey said. “That was unique. ” Marc D. Fries, another NASA scientist, said that weather radar captured the shower of meteorites and that he was analyzing the data to estimate the masses of the meteorites and where they fell. From the multitude of reports, scientists should be able to calculate the trajectory of the object, which most likely originated in the asteroid belt. (An asteroid is a rock orbiting in the inner solar system, usually between Mars and Jupiter. A meteor is the streak of light as an asteroid enters the atmosphere. A meteorite is an asteroid remnant that makes it to the ground.) Philipp R. Heck, a scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said the fireball seemed comparable to one that fell over a southern suburb of Chicago in 2003. Meteorites as heavy as several pounds hit the ground, some damaging homes. With the asteroid remnants, scientists could study the mineralogy in detail, even estimating how many million years it took for the asteroid to cross paths with Earth. But it is unlikely that anyone will find pieces of Monday’s meteor. Mr. Hankey said the biggest meteorites were probably the size of baseballs, sunk in the sediments at the bottom of Lake Michigan. “Good luck finding that,” he said."

Under the universal declaration of human rights, everyone has the right to hold opinions and the right to express them, including in writing – so we are informed by Jeremy Wells on Seven Sharp.



It is a little hypocritical for TVNZ to tell us this as TVNZ “free speech” does not apply to anyone exposing a contrary view on the supposed climate crisis; but I digress. 



The [segment](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/university-otago-professor-has-book-free-speech-banned-uk-publisher) was about Otago University Emeritus Professor Jim Flynn. Jim has written many books and even has an effect named after him, so he is a bright lad. See the [Flynn Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).



 **However, his latest book, ironically on the defence of free speech, has been turned down by his UK publishers on the grounds that someone might object under UK hate speech laws.**



The publishers were afraid that someone might take portions out of context and use them to stir people up. As Flynn points out, that is true of any book ever written in the history of mankind.



Seven Sharp asked him, “What do think this says about the current state of free speech if you can’t publish a book, […] debating free speech?”



I think it is a sad reflection. When I was young, during the McCarthy period, it was people like me on the left that were fired from universities and I always thought that as universities get more liberal, they will get more tolerant. 



And now on many campuses, where the students are predominantly left-wing, they even want these books banned from libraries. That is, rather than arguing with their opponents they want to make it a test of might-makes-right. 



Well all that they are demonstrating is that they are more powerful than their opponents, not that they have more evidence on their side. 



**Once you make might-makes-right take over, free speech is dead.** It just depends on who has the biggest battalions.



A few days ago, another leftie was also lamenting the state of play.



I’m a bit of a leftie but can generally have a conversation with people on the right without things getting personal or abusive.



Not so with the hard left, it’s got totalitarian.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).



Greenhouse‐​effect theory has predicted—first written by Svante Arrhenius in 1895—that lower atmospheric warming from increasing carbon dioxide would preferentially warm high latitude (polar) regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A hundred years later, computer models still predict the same, and it is a fact that this region has warmed much more than the rest of the globe.



Back‐​of‐​the‐​envelope reasoning (usually not a good idea when addressing the incendiary minefield of global warming) suggests that this should produce weaker midlatitude storms. These are the garden‐​variety low‐​pressure systems (cyclones) that form as a result of bursts of kinetic energy (motion) supplied by the jet stream. The jet is a fast‐​moving current in the mid‐​and‐​upper troposphere that is nature’s way of dissipating the potential energy difference between the (hot) tropics and the (cold) poles. Warm the poles preferentially and this temperature contrast declines, and so does the energy for cyclones. Less energetic cyclones generally means less severe weather, like floods, tornadoes and other pestilences.



Well, maybe not.



There is a new paper about to be published in _Geophysical Research Letters_ that claims a positive relationship between the “Arctic amplification” of global warming and extreme weather outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere mid‐​latitudes. This is a significant finding if it proves to be true. However, the authors, Jennifer Francis and Steven Vavrus—despite being very enthusiastic—fail to convincingly make their case in light of other previous publications in the climate literature.



In their paper “Evidence Linking Arctic Amplification to Extreme Weather in Mid‐​Latitudes” Francis and Vavrus argue that the differential rates of warming between the Artic and the mid‐​latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere cause a slowdown in the eastward progression of weather systems driven by the jet stream, “which may lead to an increased probability of extreme weather events that result from prolonged conditions, such as drought, flooding, cold spells, and heat waves.”



(This statement is reminiscent of the infamous phrase in the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change _Second Assessment Report_ in 1995 that moved global warming from science to what the philosopher Karl Popper called “pseudo‐​science.” The difference is that science (example: classical physics) can be “falsified” by critical observations, and pseudo‐​science purports to explain everything. As the IPCC said, “Warmer temperatures will lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle; this translates into prospects for more severe droughts and/​or floods in some places and less severe droughts and/​or floods in other places.” So much for falsifiability.)



The jet stream circumnavigates the North Pole, and “waves” move along it, such that its shape in not perfectly circular, but rather more meandering and ever changing. Like waves on a stretched string, short‐​wavelength ones (of about 400 miles from peak‐​to‐​peak) move through the jet stream faster than long waves (which can cover thousands of miles). In fact, long waves can get ”stuck,” for various and sundry reasons, with little net movement. This is a situation known as “blocking,” and results in the same type of weather occurring over a particular region for a prolonged period of time. If that’s good weather, don’t look for scientists to blame greenhouse gases (where’s the incentive for that?); but if it’s bad weather, well, global warming!



Francis and Vavrus prefer the latter approach. From their conclusions:



Can the persistent weather conditions associated with recent severe events such as the snowy winters of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 in the eastern U.S. and Europe, the historic drought and heat‐​wave in Texas during summer 2011, or record‐​breaking rains in the northeast U.S. of summer 2011 be attributed to enhanced high‐​latitude warming? Particular causes are difficult to implicate, but these sorts of occurrences are consistent with the analysis and mechanism presented in this study. As the Arctic sea‐​ice cover continues to disappear and the snow cover melts ever earlier over vast regions of Eurasia and North America (Brown et al, 2010), it is expected that large‐​scale circulation patterns throughout the northern hemisphere will become increasingly influenced by Arctic Amplification. Gradual warming of the globe may not be noticed by most, but everyone — either directly or indirectly — will be affected to some degree by changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Further research will elucidate the types, locations, timing, and character of the weather changes, which will provide valuable guidance to decision‐​makers in vulnerable regions.



Hello, Karl Popper!



Francis and Vavrus hypothesize that two processes are involved in slowing the progression of the weather; 1) a weakening of the mid‐​level atmospheric winds; and 2) increased amplitude of the waves moving through the flow in jet stream.



To demonstrate a weakening of the winds in the mid‐​levels of the atmosphere, Francis and Vavrus take the difference between a measure of integrated temperature of the lower atmosphere (called the “1000–500mb thickness”) in the latitude zones 60–80°N and 30–50°N.



The “1000–500mb thickness” is related to the distance that a weather balloon must rise in order for its onboard barometer to read one‐​half of an atmosphere. Thanks to the ideal gas law (pv=nRt), the volume of the atmosphere varies proportionally with temperature (p, pressure, is constant at ½ an atmosphere, R is a constant, and, in this case so is n, the number of molecules). So all that is left is v (volume, or “thickness”) being scaled by t (temperature). Izzat clear?



The difference in the thickness in these two regions is therefore a direct measure of the atmospheric temperature difference which is directly related to the strength of the mid‐​atmospheric wind. However, the difference between the average temperature in two rather large areas is a very gross estimate of the average wind speed.



Further, it is really not the _average_ wind speed that drives weather systems along, but rather the wind speed in the jet stream—a much narrower and closer defined region of fast flowing air that is usually located somewhere in the general region that Francis and Vavrus are averaging over. But just because the average wind speed in the region between 60–80°N and 30–50°N may be slowing down, doesn’t mean that the winds in the region of fastest flow have declined.



In fact, my former colleague Bob Davis at the University of Virginia as worked with several of his grad students through the years to investigate changes in the Northern Hemisphere jet stream and circumpolar flow. And the general finding from that research is that the speed of the jet stream flow has been increasing over the past several decades (after a period of decreasing flow ending in the early, to mid‐​1970s).



For instance, from research published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (Frauenfeld and Davis, 2003), they found that:



“During the early period [1949–1969] when the vortex was expanding, the westerly flow was therefore weaker, and during the later period [1970–2000] when the vortex was contracting, the westerly flow across the Northern Hemisphere has been much stronger.”



And from more recent research published in the _Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society_ (Strong and Davis, 2007), they reported:



[Jet stream] core speed… increased over the midlatitudes (40–60 °N), with changes as large as 15%.…



The reason that the jet stream winds have increased despite a weakening mid‐​latitude to polar temperature gradient is that the width of the jet stream has contracted somewhat. Davis and co‐​researchers have found that during cooler periods the jet stream is located further south, but that it is also wider in spatial extent (with lower wind speeds), and that during warmer periods, the jet stream is located further north and is contracted (with high wind speeds).



While the north/​south migration of the jet stream is in accordance with the findings of Francis and Vavrus concerning the arctic amplification of a general warming of the hemisphere, the more detailed research of Davis et al. shows that the behavior of the jet stream flow is the opposite to that which was reported by Francis and Vavrus who used a less detailed methodology—a methodology which Strong and Davis suggest “can generate false, or mask actual, variability patterns including trends.”



So when it comes to Francis and Vavrus’s first explanation for more extreme weather events—a weakening of the mid‐​level atmospheric wind—it turns out that a more detailed and comprehensive analysis finds that the speed of the winds of import (those in the jet stream) are in fact, speeding up.



When it comes to Francis and Vavrus’s second mechanism—increased amplitude of the waves moving through the flow—the Davis and colleagues’ work gives mixed results. Fraunfeld and Davis (2003) reported that over North America (the primary region examined by Francis and Vavrus), that the changes to the position of the jet stream “can also be argued to represent and enhancement of the PNA pattern.”



The PNA, or the Pacific‐​North America pattern, is a typically winter atmospheric flow pattern that is characterized by the jet stream flowing northeastward towards Alaska and then southeastward to the eastern U.S. Such a pattern can lead to frequent cold outbreaks and snowstorms in the eastern portions of the country and protracted pleasant and mild conditions in the western half of the country. If the PNA pattern is enhanced, it would tend to exacerbate these conditions.



However, in Strong and Davis (2007), not only was an enhancement of the PNA pattern much less pronounced but it also was somewhat dependent on which upper‐​air data set was being analyzed. (just like the situation with the surface temperature, there are several different research groups producing compilations of upper‐​air data).



The dataset with a slight PNA enhancement (produced by the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCAR) was the one used by Francis and Vavrus. The other dataset (produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts, ERA-40) showed a tendency for reduced PNA conditions and instead of an amplified wave pattern, and the general flow flattened from west‐​to‐​east, which moves storms quickly across North America and produces weaker cyclones, contrary to Francis and Vavrus’s assertion.



So where does this leave us? When the new paper by Francis and Vavrus comes to the attention of the mainstream press (the paper is still in the “in‐​press” stage at _Geophysical Research Letters_ ), it’ll play as if a warming Arctic and declining sea ice—an asserted consequence of human greenhouse gas emissions—has been definitively tied‐​in to all sorts of weather extremes across the U.S. No mention will be made to the fact that other research, which is many cases is more robust and detailed, has concluded nearly the opposite.



As with most issues related to climate science, the truth is significantly more complex than what is in the media. To increase your chances of getting “the rest of the story,” check your monthly “Current Wisdom”.

"**Vaccines in general have saved more lives than almost anything apart from clean water. They have been shown to**pay for themselves and much more **.**
The easiest way to imagine the impact of an approved vaccine in economic terms is to imagine the board meetings happening in companies up and down the country right now.
Weary executives, finance directors in particular, will be signing off on investment plans for the fiscal year starting in April 2021.
The very basis of those calculations will now alter, with the reasonable chance that most of that year could resemble a situation more normal than abnormal, thanks to at least one approved vaccine.
It is the shot in the arm required for medium-term confidence, and could prevent a self-fulfilling spiral of negativity, closure and joblessness.
Nothing is certain, but those planning on the basis of some sort of normal, will feel confidence to take risks, that keep more people employed, and the economy growing. Clearly an approved, rolled out, effective and well-used vaccine will eventually reduce the need for lockdowns and severe social restrictions.
In a March study from the Resolution Foundation, which accurately predicted the double digit hit to the economy and the public finances from the pandemic, Covid-19 was best thought of as following the economic path of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa or Spanish flu in 1918-19, with multiple peaks and troughs.
We have never had a vaccine arrive in the middle of a pandemic before, so the benefits could be extremely large. It could be the equivalent of the East Asian countries' which, through effective public health measures (rather than a vaccine), dodged the long-term fiscal and economic impact of SARS in 2003, and Covid-19 over the past year.
In other words it could, in economic terms, make up for the relatively sluggish response at the beginning of the pandemic.
The author of that paper, Richard Hughes, is now the chief executive of the Office for Budget Responsibility.
This approval pushes the fate of the economy a little closer to the ""upside scenario"" set out in the OBR's forecasts for the UK economy last week. This assumers there would be ""widespread"" vaccine availability by Spring, bringing back a more normal economy at the time the furlough scheme is due to end, and therefore causing only a small increase in unemployment.
Two notes of caution. The very short-term impact might work both ways. The restrictions could stay in place, and perhaps be stricter than they otherwise would have been.
Also the key voluntary social distancing - where the public simply decides not to go to restaurants, pubs and shops - may be maintained at a higher level through to the spring.
Why? Because, as the government itself is advising, with the scientific cavalry on the way, and light at the end of the tunnel, why take risks right now? Also the early direct beneficiaries of vaccination will be concentrated among the most elderly and at risk, as well as health workers. It will not be the public at large.
Three months of patience might weigh on the social side of the economy at the same time as fundamental changes to trade affect the manufacturing and service sectors.
And then there is the fact that the success of the scheme is now baked in to asset prices. Any plausible deviation or setback, either to rollout or in the science, risks precipitating a quick downside for stock markets and house prices.
Risks aside, the development, approval and acquisition of an effective vaccine stands to offer an incalculable boost to people's lives, but livelihoods too, over the next year.
This is the first approved vaccine for human use for any coronavirus ever. It's also the first ever vaccine to be available in the middle of a pandemic. And that could offer an economic stimulus far greater than anything the Bank of England and HM Treasury could provide."

The behaviour of virtue-signallers is always marked by hypocrisy and ignorance. Hollywood eco-crites jet from mega-mansion to climate summit in their fleets of private planes. A British study found that the most ostentatiously “green” lifestylers tend to have the biggest ecological footprints, mostly on account of their addiction to overseas holidays.



Food is the ultimate virtue-signal. From ostentatiously posing with their hemp shopping bags at farmer’s markets, to endlessly fretting over how “heirloom” their quinoa is, almond-fussing elites constantly use their food choices to virtue-signal their superiority to the Maccas-guzzling plebs.



 **Yet, they’re flocking like sheep to shovel the ultimate factory-made gunk into their smug gobs.**



The new food guide has advised Canadians to eat less meat and more plant-based proteins, to avoid the health risks associated with eating red and processed meats, like cancer and heart disease.



But [Jim] Thomas says that if consumers are choosing meatless burgers as an alternative, they need to think again.



“These are what we call ultra-processed foods,” he said. “You’re talking about a very processed bean protein basically that’s being mixed in with various other ingredients.”



“The latest Canada Food Guide says very clearly, ‘keep away from highly-processed foods.’ And some of these burgers have something like 19 different ingredients and they’ve been massively processed.” 



Thomas also raised concerns about the nutritional profile of these meat alternatives.



“Not only is the saturated fat pretty much the same but actually … [there is] a lot more sodium than you would have in normal meat.”



The same people who fret endlessly about GMOs are nonetheless happily gobbling fake meat burgers just chock-full of GMOs. Most notably, fake “blood” created by genetically engineering yeast.



Fake meat companies have also relied heavily on marketing themselves as being better for the planet […] But the ecological claims of the fake meat industry have drawn skepticism from those who say that highly-processed plant-based products are still taxing on the environment. 



“These fake meats only really address one part of the problem in the food system,” Thomas said. “They’re still drenched in pesticides. They are still produced in monocultures. None of that gets shifted […]Soybean production, for example, is massively problematic in the Amazon which is burning right now partly because of the clearances and the impact that’s had on the climate,” he said.



So, burning down rainforests in Malaysia to produce palm oil is **bad, mmkay?** But burning down rainforests to make fake meat is just fine?



Fake meat is the ultimate “frankenfood”.



“We’re moving into the idea of food being something that’s produced in a lab, in a factory really, away from the sort of food produced in nature that I think most people want. 



“I think when most people think of the kind of food they would like to feed their family, it grows on a farm and it’s grown by farmers and it’s in the environment and it works with bees and pollinators. That’s 180 degrees from the vision of food of these companies.”



If the almond-fussers really want to consume meat that’s ethically sourced, pasture-grown, and free from hormones, it’s time they wrapped their laughing gear around some [Whale Meat](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) from [The Whale Meat Company](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) which is 100% fake blood free!

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with $ being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Waitemata & Gulf Ward**



Waitemata & Gulf is one of the smaller Council wards, stretching from Western Springs in the west, stopping at Parnell in the east including the CBD area. It also includes Waiheke and Great Barrier Island. I had a crack at it in 2013 getting narrowly beaten by blank votes. Mike Lee has been a councillor since 2010 and was widely expected to retire but is putting himself forward for a fourth term.



Most recent voter turnout figures show that voting is down 19.6% on 2016 and the Waitemata local board area is 24.5% behind.



[ **Pippa Coom – City Vision**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=29e1d0f3-cc64-4360-94c5-2d443552df93&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) ****



Pippa topped the voting totals in Waitemata Local Board elections in 2016 and probably viewed herself as heir apparent for the ward seat until Mike Lee decided to run again. Pippa has been on the local board for 3 terms and is currently the Chair.



Coom is on the radical left end of the spectrum; a cycle lanes and bus fanatic with a commitment to social justice and ownership of public assets. She will continue the anti-car mantra of former Auckland design champion Ludo Campbell, seeking to slash urban speed limits, increase traffic-free zones throughout the CBD and try to [achieve the UN Agenda 2030 goals](https://www.pippacoom.co.nz/news/call-for-vision-zero-to-be-adopted-for-nz-to-bring-down-road-toll/). She is also on the steering committee for Grey Lynn 2030, preparing Auckland for the challenges of [peak oil and climate change](https://good.net.nz/article/pippa-coom).



Climate Action features very highly on Pippa’s priorities saying “A just transition to a low-emissions and climate-ready city; every decision of Auckland Council must contribute to fighting the climate and ecological crisis.” Unfortunately, there is very little impact she can make on the climate but she is determined to make a horrendous economic impact trying. Worse, whatever the condition of Auckland’s climate in a decade, there is no way of knowing if she succeeded or didn’t try hard enough. Whatever the result she will put her foot to the floor, full speed ahead as long as Auckland keeps electing her.



[ **Mike Lee – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9eb2938f-19f2-4d1c-8995-e8462fd9ca2e&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$**



After 27 years in local body politics, starting with being elected to the Auckland Regional Council in 1992 and representing Waitemata & Gulf for 9 years, Lee has decided there is still life in the old bugger yet and wants another term. Mike is a bit of an enigma, far-left politically but stubbornly independent and outspoken. He ditched the City Vision grouping several years ago, opposes Phil Goff’s Mayoralty and is critical of the Council’s wasteful spending culture.



Lee is also a heritage-warrior, advocating stronger protections on heritage scheduled buildings and historic townscapes, caring little for the property rights of the owners. It is incredibly arrogant and totalitarian to think that subjective opinions on kilometres of views justify onerous regulations on what you can do with your own home.



Mike Lee opposes the current plan for trams to the Airport, he wants heavy rail to the airport instead! The wasteful Wynyard waterfront tram system, which is isolated from the rest of the rail network should also be linked to Britomart according to Lee. I’d rather send it to the scrapyard.



Mr Lee also opposes the sale of any and all council ‘assets, including the asbestos riddled, Category A heritage-listed Auckland Council Civic Administration Building. Asbestos removal alone is forecast to cost $5-10m and the heritage status that Lee is such a big proponent of makes it a very expensive building to modify. Phil Goff believes the building could cost the ratepayer $80m to refurbish. Panuku Development Auckland is flicking it off for $3m which is ridiculously cheap for an office block and land in the middle of the CBD. Perhaps they should scrap the heritage status to improve the price.



He has his good sides though, especially regarding AT’s [ideological transport crusade,](https://twitter.com/greaterakl/status/960284306370211840?lang=en) and the [predictable cost blowout](http://cubic.co.nz/mike-lee-city-rail-link-billion-dollar-blow-out-twyford-goff-asleep-at-the-switch/) building the CRL. But I’m hesitant to think that good is enough to offset the bad.



Lee says of his decision to stand for a fourth term, “I am dismayed at the situation Auckland is in. I firmly believe the ‘Super City is the worst thing that has ever happened to Auckland.



“The people of Auckland have to endure an arrogant, overbearing council/CCO bureaucracy, appalling financial mismanagement and waste.”



The Super City has got that way on your watch, Mike. You’re not doing anyone a favour hanging around longer.



[ **Allan Matson – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=1a5645cf-acca-4bc2-accf-25a7fa388771&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) ****



Ladies and Gentleman, radical left candidate number 3. If this was an episode of Blind Date, you’d be poking both eyes out. I don’t quite recall the name or face, but seeing the candidate photo alone was enough to detect pretentious, nosey, central planner. I guess tan jackets must be their unofficial uniform. I’ll never wear one again.



Matson was a merchant banker for 10 years but I guess it didn’t make him feel sufficiently important so he retrained as an architect and has worked the last 15 years as a heritage consultant. Mike Lee and Pippa Coom are the sort of politicians that sustain people like Matson, who appreciates “the complexity of dealing with Council processes, but somehow I have developed the patience for it.” 



Matson is standing for Council because “I love Auckland and do not want its future growth to be characterised by ugly development.”



Who the hell does he think he is? Who defines ugly and why is their opinion more important than the person who owns and pays for it?[ As far back as 2004,](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3565774) Matson has been interfering in other people’s business driven by a zealotry that is as dangerous as it is self-important. If he values these buildings so much, the right thing to do is stump up his own cash and do nothing with them. 



Allan’s entire reason for standing is to stop you doing what he doesn’t like on your property. He has no other policies. Few politicians could possibly be any more morally empty or parasitical. 



Matson is so self-absorbed that reading his pitch for your votes is far more damaging than anything else I could say about him.



 _“I think I could usefully bring my considerable knowledge and experience to the table, and further more my membership of Council’s Heritage Advisory Panel and various boards including the former NZ Historic Places Trust have provided me with insights and governance experience that would also be useful._



 _“After living here for 25 years, studying architecture and specialising in heritage, I’ve built up a great knowledge of the fabric of the city and the fascinating stories that reside in the environment built up here over the years.”_



[ **Will Maxwell-Steele – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=4ed02ad8-b655-4dbf-a4cf-1603f5354691&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$$$$**



If you’ve driven around the CBD, you may have seen some small red signs with a cartoon of Trump on them but no time to read anything else as you continued on your journey. Will is the candidate behind those signs, pointing out Trump’s victory in the Presidential elections was the result of 47% of Americans not voting.



Will has a few things to learn about retail politics, such as the KISS principle. (Keep it Simple Stupid). Will probably despises retail politics, having been a self-employed contractor most of his life before joining the family property investment and development business. He is standing out of pure frustration at dealing with the Council. 



_“The Council hired a fire engineer to sign off work, who ran a competing fire engineering business, based in Christchurch, and only came to Auckland one day a month! The manager’s reply when I questioned this… “I know it’s a conflict, but what can you do?”_



I think I’m going to like Will. Have a look at Will’s[ website](http://www.waitemata.co.nz/?fbclid=IwAR22E-nr4epzodLwNmw9VqfCVtdpTWQ0h9z2zzjFPeElDEiUds6TcI_ZrTk) because I think you will too. Will is also one of the few Council candidates to sign Auckland Ratepayer’s Alliance pledge promising not to vote in favour of rates increases exceeding 2%.



It’s unfortunate that he isn’t really a contender in this race. Hopefully, he has another shot at standing for Council and thrashes the 2022 incumbent



[ **Sarah Trotman – C &R – Communities and Residents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=439641ff-d6ee-4198-9e49-979c6828d72d&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$$$**



Trotman models herself as a no-nonsense CEO who won’t tolerate incompetence from bureaucrats but I’m not 100% convinced. While she has received a ONZM for services to business and the community in 2017, she has also been chair of AUT’s Women on Campus which hints at liberal wetness.



As Chief Executive of Business Mentors New Zealand, she supervises free business mentoring for over 3,000 small businesses. She also mentors young women under the YWCA Future Leaders Programme and is a supporter of the Auckland Foundation’s Women’s Fund.



Other projects Trotman has helped establish include the Lifewise Big Sleepout and Spend My Super, a charitable trust that facilitates wealthy retirees donating their unwanted super addressing child poverty.



Her candidate profile is big on her story but virtually policy-free. I suppose C&R are planning to get her elected based on her affiliation but I need to see more.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Smoke emitted by simple wick lamps, similar to the one shown here, was found to be a significant but previously overlooked source of global black carbon. These lamps are used by hundreds of millions of households, and can be replaced by cleaner, affordable alternatives. (Ajay Pillarisetti photo)
Interesting point, but I wonder how such a change would come about when people often can’t afford an alternative?
Let there be clean light: Kerosene lamps spew black carbon, should be replaced, study says
By Sarah Yang, Media Relations BERKELEY —
The primary source of light for more than a billion people in developing nations is also churning out black carbon at levels previously overlooked in greenhouse gas estimates, according to a new study led by researchers at UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois.
Results from field and lab tests found that 7 to 9 percent of the kerosene in wick lamps — used for light in 250-300 million households without electricity — is converted to black carbon when burned. In comparison, only half of 1 percent of the emissions from burning wood is converted to black carbon.
Factoring in the new study results leads to a twentyfold increase in estimates of black carbon emissions from kerosene-fueled lighting.

The previous estimates come from established databases used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others. One kilogram of black carbon, a byproduct of incomplete combustion and an important greenhouse gas, produces as much warming in a month as 700 kilograms of carbon dioxide does over 100 years, the authors said.
“The orange glow in flames comes from black carbon, so the brighter the glow, the more black carbon is being made,” said study principal investigator Tami Bond, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “If it’s not burned away, it goes into the atmosphere.”
The findings, published online this month in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, are coming out at the same time that the United Nations Climate Change Conference kicks off in Doha, Qatar. While officials from around the world are seeking effective policies and guidelines for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the study authors note that the simple act of replacing kerosene lamps could pack a wallop toward that effort.
“There are no magic bullets that will solve all of our greenhouse gas problems, but replacing kerosene lamps is low-hanging fruit, and we don’t have many examples of that in the climate world,” said study co-author Kirk Smith, professor at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health and director of the Global Health and Environment Program. “There are many inexpensive, cleaner alternatives to kerosene lamps that are available now, and few if any barriers to switching to them.”
Smith pointed to lanterns with light-emitting diodes that can be powered by solar cells or even advanced cookstoves that generate electricity from the heat produced. Such technology, said Smith, is already available in developing countries.
The researchers used kerosene lamps purchased in Uganda and Peru and conducted field experiments there to measure the emissions. They repeated the tests in the lab using wicks of varying heights and materials, and kerosene purchased in the United States as well as in Uganda.
The study authors noted that converting to cleaner light sources would not only benefit the planet, it would help improve people’s health. A recent epidemiological study in Nepal led by Smith and other researchers at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, for example, found that women who reported use of kerosene lamps in the home had 9.4 times the rate of tuberculosis compared with those who did not use such lamps.
“Getting rid of kerosene lamps may seem like a small, inconsequential step to take, but when considering the collective impact of hundreds of millions of households, it’s a simple move that affects the planet,” said study lead author Nicholas Lam, a UC Berkeley graduate student in environmental health sciences.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, U.S. Agency for International Development and Environmental Protection Agency helped support this research.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The Syrian government has executed 5, 000 to 13, 000 people in mass hangings in just one of its many prisons since the start of the    uprising against President Bashar   Amnesty International contends in a new report. The report on the Saydnaya military prison, which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there, prison employees, judges and others, accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes. Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal  —   including regular, severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, medicine and basic sanitation  —   that they amount to deliberate extermination, defined under international law as a crime against humanity, the report said. While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades, the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details  —   not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date  —   about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them, including approvals by   officials. “We now know where, when and how often these hangings are taking place, as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them,” said Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report’s authors. Mr. Assad, in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year, insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system. But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria, detailing regular torture and deprivation. It also echoes reports from families of detainees that the government has refused to provide even basic information such as where they are and whether they are alive. According to former officials cited in the report, detainees  —   most of them accused of nonviolent offenses, such as participating in demonstrations  —   are tortured into giving confessions, then taken to   military field courts, where they undergo trials lasting two to three minutes. At regular intervals, the Amnesty report said, they are gathered in the middle of the night from their cells and taken blindfolded to an execution room on the grounds of the prison near Damascus, where they are hanged. Some prisoners have managed to stand on toilets to look out windows and see bodies carted away, and the number of slippers left lying on the ground. “If there were 30 slippers, then we knew that 15 people had been executed,” Abu Osama, a former military officer detained in the prison, was quoted as saying. “There were usually between 30 and 80 slippers outside. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately I’ve been reading up a lot on nutrition, and I’m finding out that the riff-raff and fraud that are rampant in the food and pharmaceutical industry is even more cold-blooded than the playground kind of stuff we see in “climate science”. It really is that bad.
Recall how George Clooney once asked (paraphrasing) “if 99% of doctors tell you’re sick and only 1% say you’re fine, who are you gonna hang out with?” Turns out that taking Clooney’s advice is a good way to long, painful death.
Right now I’m reading “Wheat Belly” by Dr. William Davis. This is a must read for anyone over 30.
When you get down to it, the pharmaceutical industry is not interested in making you healthy, rather they are all about making you sick while dragging out your life in order to reap maximum profits through a lifetime of drugs sales and expensive treatments. It turns out that many of the diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, skin diseases, asthma, arthritis, bone degeneration, etc., etc., etc.) are easily preventable (and even reversible) just by making adjustments in your diet: reducing the intake of carbohydrates, eliminating glutens, and avoiding plant-based fats and oil. But what good is a healthy patient to Big Pharma’s bottom line?
What follows is a short excerpt of Wheat Belly that depicts the cold-blooded advice that supposedly respectable professional organizations like the America Diabetes Association (ADA), American Dietetics Association, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) all have been feeding the public for decades:
Years ago, I used the ADA diet in diabetic patients. Following the carbohydrate intake advice of the ADA, I watched patients gain weight, experience deteriorating blood glucose control and the increased need for medication, and develop diabetic complications such as kidney disease and neuropathy. Just as Ignatz Semmelkweis caused the incidence of childbed fever in his practice to nearly vanish just by washing his hands, ignoring ADA diet advice and cutting carbohydrate intake leads to improved blood sugar control, reduced HbA1c, dramatic weight loss, and improvement in all the metabolic messiness of diabetics such as high blood pressure and triglycerides.
The ADA advises diabetics to cut fat, reduce saturated fat, and includes 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrate – preferably ‘healthy whole grains’ in each meal, or 135 to 180 grams of carbohydrates per day, not including snacks. It is, in essence, a fat-phobic, carbohydrate-centered diet, with 55 to 65 percent of calories from carbohydrates. If I were to sum up the views of the ADA toward diet, it would be: Go ahead and eat sugar and foods that increase blood sugar, just be sure to adjust your medication to compensate.”
My, what a wonderful way to milk the patient for years until he dies. Davis continues:
But while ‘fighting fire with fire’ may work with pest control, and passive aggressive neighbors, you can’t charge your way out of credit card debt and you can’t carbohydrate-stuff your way out of diabetes.
The ADA exerts heavy influence in crafting national attitudes toward nutrition. When someone is diagnosed with diabetes, they are sent to a diabetes educator or nurse who counsels them on ADA diet principles. If the patient enters the hospital and has diabetes, the doctors orders an ‘ADA diet’. Such ‘dietary guidelines’ can, in effect, be enacted into health ‘law’. I’ve seen smart diabetic nurses and educators, who coming to understand that carbohydrates cause diabetes, buck ADA advice and counsel patients to curtail carbohydrates consumption. Because such advice flies in the face of ADA guidelines,  the medical establishment demonstrates its incredulity by firing these rogue employees.”

Here too we see how “skeptics” of “consensus science” are harshly dealt with.
Davis continues, listing the ADA recommended foods for diabetics:
– whole grain breads, such as whole wheat or rye
– whole grain high-fiber cereal
– cooked cereal such as oatmeal, grits, hominy, or cream of wheat
– rice pasta, tortillas
– cooked beans and peas, such as pinto beans or black-eyed peas
– potatoes, green peas, corn, lima beans, sweet potatoes, winter squash
– low-fat crackers and snack chips, pretzels, and fat-free popcorn
In short, eat wheat, wheat, corn, rice, and wheat.”
Boy that’ll sure help your diabetes to improve, won’t it! This is like trying to cure an alcoholic with Jack Daniels, or a gunshot wound with a shot gun.
Recall the diet to help diabetics cope with their illness is recommended by the quintessential 97% of all real doctors and experts. Why, you’d have to be crazy not to hang out with them if you’re a diabetic!
Paging George Clooney.
William Davis’s Wheat Belly is chock-full with examples of such riff raff in the fields of food, nutrition and pharmaceuticals.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online Novo Argumente  here features an interview with Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore. Today he is one of the environmental organization’s harshest critics.
Photo right: Partick Moore, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license.
Moore tells readers how things have run amok at the activist organization, claiming it has changed from one that “not only cared about the environment, but also about people” to one that has since transformed to today’s radical organization “that characterizes people fundamentally as enemies of the earth.” He continues:
I believe that its refusal to make demands that are scientifically based combined with a leftist, anti-American and anti-market-economy attitude has led the environmental movement into an ideological dead-end in which it finds itself today.”
Later in the interview Moore says that today’s biggest environmental challenge facing the earth today is poverty.
Poor people today cannot afford to treat wastewater, to clean the air, to reforest, etc. Poverty is a problem for man and for the environment. Fighting poverty helps both. There’s no contradiction.”
Moore says he left Greenpeace because the organization opted to follow a course based on confrontation and anti-development. He also believes that the organization’s popularity is because the environmental movement has indeed become a religion.

Radical environmentalists he says are hypocritical and confused in that they don’t understand that the gadgets that they themselves love using, like mobile phones, bicycles and rapid transport, buildings and wind turbines, come from the very things they protest. “It’s an absolute dream world.”
He illustrates further:
To demonstrate against fossil energies, Greenpeace attacked a Russian offshore drilling rig with a large boat equipped with diesel engines. […] When we sailed to Alaska to protest nuclear testing, we had no atomic weapons on board. They act like their new 32 million dollar boat is powered by sails when in reality it has a 5000 horsepower diesel engine. […] I just want to underscore what a dream world these people live in.”
Moore thinks that that fear and guilt play a big role in the religion. “This works the best with the global warming issue.”
At the end, Moore blasts Greenpeace’s opposition to approving golden rice.
Two million children die annually from diseases related to Vitamin A-deficiencies. If I take the precautionary principle seriously, then I can only demand that golden rice be immediately approved. If Vitamin A deficiency were a disease like malaria and someone discovered a medicine to heal the disease, it would not be long before people would use it.”
The whole interview is well worth reading and it hopefully it will appear soon in English.

"While many Super Bowl advertisers chose to be silly or sentimental with their commercials on Sunday, it was the few that ventured  —   or appeared to venture  —   into political territory that attracted the most attention. Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb, which had decided just last week to run an ad. In the ad, the company promoted its view of an open, multicultural world, reflecting its commitment to housing refugees.   revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of “America the Beautiful. ” It managed to strike a new chord with viewers, given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity, and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter. “I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it,” said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York. It was a smart move from the brand to   an old message, she added, given that “you can’t say it’s a reactionary thing. ” In an interview before halftime during the game, Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA’’Chiat’’Day New York, said, “If there’s anything that’s screaming out here, it’s diversity. ” He added: “People are saying, ‘Is this trolling Trump?’ I don’t think it’s trolling. It’s a big smack in the face of ‘dude, this is America. ’” Still, for the most part, overtly political statements were few and far between  —   by design. A   advertiser, 84 Lumber, had its initial proposal for a commercial rejected by Fox last month for being “too controversial” because it showed a   mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The company edited its spot to remove the wall and directed users to see the end of its commercial online. Budweiser spent days telling the news media that its ad was not a response to President Trump’s recent immigration crackdown. The company’s commercial featured the journey of one of its founders to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and the discrimination he overcame on his way to success. The hashtag #BoycottBudweiser trended on Twitter early on Sunday evening, apparently started by people who disliked the ad. But it was then used by others to defend Budweiser and mock the people who were boycotting the ad. Carl Marci, chief neuroscientist at Nielsen, the TV ratings company, said, “If you make people think too much or get too serious during a game where people are really looking to be entertained, you’re taking a risk. ” That risk can pay off, though. Audi’s ad went viral before the game, having passed five million views on YouTube as of Friday. It was narrated by a father asking pointed questions about what to tell his young daughter one day as she competed in a cart race, such as, “Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?” As she won the race, he reflected that perhaps he would be able to “tell her something different. ” The commercial ended with text including a line saying that Audi of America is “committed to equal pay for equal work. ” But escapism and sentimentality were the strategy for many advertisers as brands tried to provide an antidote to the weighty issues facing the country this year. Mr. Clean was unexpectedly portrayed as something of a sex symbol. Michelob Ultra used the theme song from “Cheers” in its ad, which presented the label as a   beer. Justin Bieber showed off his dance moves for   while Avocados From Mexico jokingly used subliminal messaging to urge more avocado consumption. “Very often on the Super Bowl, we see emotional advertising, or we see   advertising,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He added, “All the controversy in the country is making advertisers nervous about addressing big, significant issues, and in a polarizing time, it is safest to stick to the product and stick to lighthearted humor. ” Advertisers were willing to pay, on average, about $5 million for   spots during the Super Bowl this year  —   or around $167, 000 per second  —   and even more in promotional costs to reach the game’s more than 100 million viewers. Many released the full ads or teasers online before Sunday while brands such as Snickers and Hyundai went the opposite route, producing their commercials during the game itself, which aired on Fox. Some were not impressed by the bulk of the ads that aired on Sunday, particularly given the rising cost of the commercials. “Comedy, celebrities and anthropomorphic creatures seem to be the   schtick,” said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises and a former C. E. O. of the creative agency Droga5. “After 50 years, half a century, it’s all feeling a little formulaic,” he added. “I find myself, as someone who’s not doing this anymore, wondering if this is the single greatest act of economic immolation on the planet. ” Others felt that the ads delivered. “People want to see lighthearted things in the Super Bowl, especially at a time when there are so many big issues in the country,” Mr. Calkins said."

"WASHINGTON  —   Emboldened by weeks of protests across the country, congressional Democrats are digging in as Republicans try to swiftly remake a government shaped by the Obama administration. Tensions over President Trump’s early efforts to deliver on a long menu of campaign promises have spilled into the halls of Congress, turning   debates into a proxy battle over a combative president. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Let us get you up to speed. ■ Vice President Mike Pence could well be needed to break a   tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. ■ Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed by the end of the week. ■ Republicans in Congress will also vote to roll back   regulations. Mr. Pence may be summoned to the Capitol early this week to cast the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary over vociferous, now bipartisan objections. The Senate could vote on her nomination as late as Tuesday. Congressional trivia buffs, take note: It would be the first time that the vice president has been forced to cast a tiebreaking vote on a cabinet nomination, said Betty K. Koed, the Senate historian. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska thrust Ms. DeVos’s nomination into question last week when they became the first two Republicans to declare their opposition. Should the Democratic caucus vote as a bloc, their votes would set up a   tie that Mr. Pence would have to settle in his capacity as president of the Senate. The Capitol has been flooded with thousands of constituent calls and messages, many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos. Still, it looks unlikely that any more Republicans will defect, and that would be enough to confirm her. Once the Senate deals with the DeVos nomination, it will move on to the nomination of Mr. Sessions to be attorney general. First comes a procedural vote that sets the timer for up to 30 hours of debate before the final vote. That means Mr. Sessions’s confirmation vote should come later this week, at which point the Senate will start the process over with the nomination of Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, followed by a vote on the nomination of Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Of course, just because Democrats may not have the votes to block Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees does not mean they will go quietly. Having stacked up as many parliamentary roadblocks as they could find last week, Democrats are expected to take advantage of the mandatory debate time, probably to air their concerns about Mr. Trump’s picks as well as grievances against their Republican counterparts, who they believe have stymied a thorough examination of some nominees. That could be bad news for senators with plans on Saturday: Republican leaders may keep the Senate in session over the weekend to get the job done. After dusting off  the Congressional Review Act last week, the House will use that momentum to continue rolling back recently finalized   regulations. On Tuesday, the House is scheduled to vote to toss out three rules: an Interior Department rule intended to increase transparency and public input on the use of public lands an Education Department rule that spells out provisions of a recent education law regarding accountability and another Education Department rule that sets the parameters for gathering and sharing data on teacher training programs. The Senate began taking up these regulations between nomination votes last week, and it is likely to continue this week, voting after the House to roll back each rule one by one before it is sent to the president. Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the federal appeals court judge nominated by Mr. Trump for the Supreme Court, will continue his courtesy meetings with senators. Judge Gorsuch is expected to meet on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, after having sat down last week with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ms. Feinstein has expressed reservations about Judge Gorsuch, as has Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who said Mr. Trump’s propensity for flouting “the rule of law” demanded “an independent jurist. ” Two weeks after congressional Republicans and Senate Democrats ducked out for their policy retreats, the House Democratic caucus will slip away on Wednesday for its summit meeting in Baltimore. While Republicans spent part of their retreat debating  —   and occasionally fretting  —   about how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democrats seem likely to strategize their response. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, has seized every recent opportunity to condemn Republican plans to get rid of the health care law, as Democrats continue to transmit a simple message across the aisle about the nation’s health care system: If you break it, you buy it."

Guest Post by Joe Bast
In a December 28 post, blogger Greg Laden, a self-described “biological anthropologist and science communicator,” ranked The Heartland Institute’s efforts to expose global warming alarmism as one of the “top climate stories of 2012”. I suppose we should be flattered, but his error-filled explanation for including us in the list requires some corrections:

Heartland isn’t a “climate denial ‘think’ tank.” Last time I checked, no Heartland spokesperson ever denied the existence of the climate, or even climate change.


Heartland didn’t “implode” or “suffer major damage” in 2012. In fact, we increased receipts by about 15% from 2011, increased the number of donors nearly four-fold, more than doubled the number of policy advisors (to 237), and set records for press attention and online traffic for our sites. 2012 was a breakthrough year for us, thanks in no small part to the attention generated by our work on global warming/cooling.


We have never tried to “prove that cigarette smoking was not bad for you.” We do argue that taxes on smokers are too high and second-hand smoke is not the public health threat that anti-smoking zealots claim.


We were not “caught red handed trying to fund an effort explicitly (but secretly) designed to damage science education in public schools.” That description is based on a fake memo circulated by disgraced water scientist Peter Gleick. We announced the curriculum project in our members newsletter and explained there that our intent is to help de-politicize the issue. How is that a bad thing?


We did run a billboard about global warming, but it did not “equat[e] people who thought the climate science on global warming is based on facts and is not a fraud with well-known serial killers.” The billboard simply pointed out that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, still believes in global warming, and asked viewers if they do, too. We know why lefties went nuts over it – Kaczynski, after all, is one of their own – but it wasn’t inaccurate or offensive.


We lost a few corporate donors who couldn’t stand the heat when liberal advocacy groups, using a donor list stolen by the aforementioned Peter Gleick, circulated online petitions demanding that they stop funding us. But as already mentioned, we gained many more donors than we lost and had an exceptionally good fundraising year.


Laden ends by saying The Heartland Institute, “which never was really that big, is now no longer a factor in the climate change.” He’s right that we aren’t very big – about $6 million a year – but he’s wrong about the role we continue to play in the international debate. Our Eighth International Conference on Climate Change, held in Munich on November 31-December 1, 2012, was a huge success. We’ve got projects on climate already lined up for 2013 that make 2012 look like a dress rehearsal.

In short, Heartland played a major role in shaping the debate over global warming in 2012, and we expect to play an even larger role in 2013. Sometimes it takes a little controversy to break through media bias and public indifference. Heartland achieved this in 2012.
Joe Bast is the president of the Heartland Institute

Note to get a window into the strange and hateful mind of Greg Laden, all you need to do is read his about page here and scroll down. Pity the soul that lives in Texas or West Virginia.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel reports that a recent storm blew the beach sand away at Cardigan Bay in Wales, uncovering something unusual: a prehistoric forest from 4500 years ago. Apparently the forest had become the victim of sea level rise back at the time.
Spiegel writes:
The trees died more than 4500 years ago. Once the forest covered an area of several miles between the Welsh locations of Borth and Ynyslas. With climatic changes the sea level rose and peat, sand, and salt water swallowed the trees. The forest disappeared.”
Imagine that. Flat-temperature-earthers would like to have us believe that climate of the Holocene was more or less constant and that sea levels are higher than ever today. Turns out in Wales sea level is lower.
Obviously things were probably even warmer back then and sea levels were indeed higher. This is confirmed by NASA here, which discusses sea level findings for Northern England and Scotland, and possible implications for the UK:

Since the end of the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago, land and sea-levels around the UK coastline have changed in response to the retreat of the ice sheets. As the ice melted, the release of this enormous weight resulted in the landmass slowly tilting back up in the north or down in the south, a process called isostatic adjustment. […]
The action of the Ice Age on our landmass has been like squeezing a sponge which eventually regains its shape. The earth’s crust has reacted over thousands of years and is continuing to react. […
]The new map shows how the UK and Ireland are responding to the ice sheet compression of the earth’s core and the current rate of land tilt across the UK. In Northumberland, researchers found sediments from 7,000 years ago five metres below, and others from 4,000 years ago at 1 metre above the present sea level. This indicates that the sea level rose above present levels from around 7,500 years ago to 4,500 years ago, and then dropped and is continuing to fall.”
But North Cumberland is much further north than Cardigan, where the ice sheets were likely much thinner, and so isostatic adjustment at Cardigan Bay should be less.
The uncovered forest remnants tell us one thing: Wales is higher today than 4500 years ago and it’s going to take long time, if ever, for Cardigan Bay to return to where it’s been before. Climate change is normal and there is nothing we can do to re-establish and preserve the climate we had 50 years ago. It’s going to change by itself.

William Felt



At the beginning of the year, Jacinda returned from 7 weeks holiday. 7 weeks you may say sounds like an awful lot! But anyway, she attended her first press conference on that day and it did not go well.



  
Tova Obrien:  




‘Her first press conference (after 7wk break) she was on the defensive, shutting things down, not wanting to talk about things or engage’



  
Andrey Young:  




In the substance of the press conference, Ardern sounded exasperated at questions about the failure of KiwiBuild to meet its first milestone of 1000 houses by July, and by questions about the capital gains tax report.  
Ardern’s tetchiness perhaps reflects a raft of challenging issues facing the Government.  
Ardern became impatient when questions turned to the undisputed veto that NZ First will have on any capital gains tax  
She also became exasperated when questioned about the failure of KiwiBuild targets — so much so that she could not bring herself to actually say “No” when repeatedly asked if the July target would be met



Most of us could only dream of a seven-week break and then we would be fresh, calm and ready for the new year.  
But Jacinda returned in a mood so gloomy that her very first day back when she should have been fresh, she was the opposite.



She had come to the realisation over the break that data just doesn’t stick in her mind as stories do. These stories have emotions that can get people to do all type of things good or bad. She had emotional appeal, trust with these people. The Labour people, Winston, lots of voters and the international observers. But things were falling apart at the end of 2018. Internal staffing issues, staff turnover, Ardern walking out of meetings in tears and so on. The strain of constant work was too much for her and she was physically ill and mentally exhausted.



What Ardern was seeing was that her stories, her dreams, her ideologies were not turning into reality. She had realised over the holidays that she simply did not have the skills to do the role of PM. She had lost her own confidence and this came out in that very first press conference of the year.



We all have periods of self-doubt. Some of us never get over these periods, some of us fight, the best of us put our heads down and grind out the problems. Jacinda did not have the ability to do this. She does not have the mental stamina to read, to understand, to analyse – she only does stories!



She was lonely and distant (as any PM is) from her colleagues. She had Grant Robertson but he was very busy in Finance an area that she (and Grant) had little understanding of. It was interesting on the eve of the launch of Grant’s and Jacinda’s ‘welfare budget’ that when there were ‘hacks’ and ‘leaks’ rather than round up the team on the 9th floor and get to the bottom of it, Jacinda went home early to give Neve a bath.



She was out of her depth, lonely and helpless at the top. Her close minders isolated her from the rigours of work and sent her to visits at schools, kindergartens and protected her constantly from hard questions. She would light up when talking about climate change and other areas of interest to her. But ask her outside of that, and as Mike Hosking finds weekly, she simply umms and arghs her way through interviews without actually answering the questions.



March 15 Christchurch, hit her very hard. Whilst many were positive about her dress up and kindness towards the victims in the aftermath of the shootings, some thought she went too far. I disagree that she was play-acting to gain support. Instead my view is somewhat more serious. Her reaction was over the top because she was already struggling with her own coping mechanisms and March 15 provided her with another matter which she had no choice but to confront. The sad glum faces she showed over the next few weeks/months was in some part for the families and victims but more importantly, it was for her.



During the mid-year break her minders managed to stretch out her break from the 9th floor by first having a ‘fishing break’ then a brand Jacinda excursion to socialist Melbourne and then a trip to Tokelau. This resulted in the now-familiar ‘Part-Time Prime Minister’ slogan coined by Simon Bridges.



Whilst this is a catchy term and was picked up by the Jacinda doubters, it was actually true and worthy. Jacinda was being managed. Her workload was managed, her visits were carefully managed so she would come across as knowledgeable in those areas of her interest, but would not need to know about the areas she was not interested in.



Importantly, some key areas of her responsibilities were kept from her. The most visible of these were the sex assaults from within her own office. This controversy alone struck more against everything she had portrayed herself to stand for. Women in her very own office were not protected and she was (or was not) complicit in its cover-up. Complicity or not, she had responsibility, a concept she has yet to develop a mature understanding of.



We can see Ardern now. Thin, gaunt, irritable, pale and whilst I am no medical person, others have pointed out the suggestion of medication to assist her in day to day life.



And still every day the hits keep coming. Failure after failure, non-performance in her so called ‘year of delivery’. There are wins, and they are celebrated, but a realistic analysis of these shows that these are small wins and will not help New Zealand any more than provide some token virtue signalling.



New Zealand’s economy is slowing, all the indicators that matter are negative, we have a weak and failing PM who has no real answers to help New Zealand.



It is going to be a very very long 12 months for Jacinda and her Government which I would give a 50/50 chance of surviving full term.

Since we’ve been discussing smoothing in datasets, I thought I’d repost something that Steve McIntyre had graciously allowed me to post on his amazing blog ClimateAudit back in 2008.
—————————————————————————————–
Data Smoothing and Spurious Correlation
Allan Macrae has posted an interesting study at ICECAP. In the study he argues that the changes in temperature (tropospheric and surface) precede the changes in atmospheric CO2 by nine months. Thus, he says, CO2 cannot be the source of the changes in temperature, because it follows those changes.
Being a curious and generally disbelieving sort of fellow, I thought I’d take a look to see if his claims were true. I got the three datasets (CO2, tropospheric, and surface temperatures), and I have posted them up here. These show the actual data, not the month-to-month changes.
In the Macrae study, he used smoothed datasets (12 month average) of the month-to-month change in temperature (∆T) and CO2 (∆CO2) to establish the lag between the change in CO2 and temperature . Accordingly, I did the same. [My initial graph of the raw and smoothed data is shown above as Figure 1, I repeat it here with the original caption.]

￼Figure 1. Cross-correlations of raw and 12-month smoothed UAH MSU Lower Tropospheric Temperature change (∆T) and Mauna Loa CO2 change (∆CO2). Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width of 12 months (brown line). Red line is correlation of raw unsmoothed data (referred to as a “0 month average”). Black circle shows peak correlation.
At first glance, this seemed to confirm his study. The smoothed datasets do indeed have a strong correlation of about 0.6 with a lag of nine months (indicated by the black circle). However, I didn’t like the looks of the averaged data. The cycle looked artificial. And more to the point, I didn’t see anything resembling a correlation at a lag of nine months in the unsmoothed data.
Normally, if there is indeed a correlation that involves a lag, the unsmoothed data will show that correlation, although it will usually be stronger when it is smoothed. In addition, there will be a correlation on either side of the peak which is somewhat smaller than at the peak. So if there is a peak at say 9 months in the unsmoothed data, there will be positive (but smaller) correlations at 8 and 10 months. However, in this case, with the unsmoothed data there is a negative correlation for 7, 8, and 9 months lag.
Now Steve McIntyre has posted somewhere about how averaging can actually create spurious correlations (although my google-fu was not strong enough to find it). I suspected that the correlation between these datasets was spurious, so I decided to look at different smoothing lengths. These look like this:

Figure 2. Cross-correlations of raw and smoothed UAH MSU Lower Tropospheric Temperature change (∆T) and Mauna Loa CO2 change (∆CO2). Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width as given in the legend. Black circles shows peak correlation for various smoothing widths. As above, a “0 month” average shows the lagged correlations of the raw data itself.
Note what happens as the smoothing filter width is increased. What start out as separate tiny peaks at about 3-5 and 11-14 months end up being combined into a single large peak at around nine months. Note also how the lag of the peak correlation changes as the smoothing window is widened. It starts with a lag of about 4 months (purple and blue 2 month and 6 month smoothing lines). As the smoothing window increases, the lag increases as well, all the way up to 17 months for the 48 month smoothing. Which one is correct, if any?
To investigate what happens with random noise, I constructed a pair of series with similar autoregressions, and I looked at the lagged correlations. The original dataset is positively autocorrelated (sometimes called “red” noise). In general, the change (∆T or ∆CO2) in a positively autocorrelated dataset is negatively autocorrelated (sometimes called “blue noise”). Since the data under investigation is blue, I used blue random noise with the same negative autocorrelation for my test of random data. However, the exact choice is immaterial to the smoothing issue.
This was my first result using random data:

Figure 3. Cross-correlations of raw and smoothed random (blue noise) datasets. Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width as given in the legend. Black circles show peak correlations for various smoothings.
Note that as the smoothing window increases in width, we see the same kind of changes we saw in the temperature/CO2 comparison. There appears to be a correlation between the smoothed random series, with a lag of about 7 months. In addition, as the smoothing window widens, the maximum point is pushed over, until it occurs at a lag which does not show any correlation in the raw data.
After making the first graph of the effect of smoothing width on random blue noise, I noticed that the curves were still rising on the right. So I graphed the correlations out to 60 months. This is the result:

￼Figure 4. Rescaling of Figure 3, showing the effect of lags out to 60 months.
Note how, once again, the smoothing (even for as short a period as six months, green line) converts a non-descript region (say lag +30 to +60, right part of the graph) into a high correlation region, by the lumping together of individual peaks. Remember, this was just random blue noise, none of these are represent real lagged relationships despite the high correlation.
My general conclusion from all of this is to avoid looking for lagged correlations in smoothed datasets, they’ll lie to you. I was surprised by the creation of apparent, but totally spurious, lagged correlations when the data is smoothed.
And for the $64,000 question … is the correlation found in the Macrae study valid, or spurious? I truly don’t know, although I strongly suspect that it is spurious. But how can we tell?
My best to everyone,
w.

Since the beginning of the Great Uncertainty – the period that began with the “stimulus,” the auto bailout, the push for another major entitlement program, Dodd-Frank, the regulatory dam burst, the subsidies for favored industries, and the proliferation of distinctly anti-business rhetoric from the White House – President Obama has appeared puzzled by the dearth of business investment and hiring. Go figure.



Nonresidential fixed investment fell off a cliff in 2009, and has yet to recover even in nominal terms. As a share of GDP and relative to the trend in investment growth prior to the 2008 recession, the picture is more troubling still. If tomorrow’s wealth and living standards are functions of today’s investment – and they are – reversing the decline in investment should be the economic priority of U.S. policymakers.   
  
Instead, the administration has been cavalier about the problem and aloof to real solutions, choosing to view investment as a casualty of partisan politics, as though business is intentionally holding back to sully the economy on this president’s watch. Such narcissism has obscured the White House’s capacity to grasp the power of incentives.   
  
It’s not just domestic investment that is lagging. Foreign direct investment in real U.S. assets is also on the decline. The United States is part of a global economy, which means that U.S. and foreign based businesses can invest, hire, develop, produce, assemble and service almost anywhere they choose. And that means the United States is competing with the rest of the world to attract and retain investment. Of course, the implication of this – whether policymakers know it or not and whether they like it or not – is that globalization is serving to discipline bad public policy. Policies that are hostile to wealth creators chase them away, while smart policies attract them and harvest their fruits.   
  
Business investment is ultimately a judgment about a jurisdiction’s institutions, policies, human capital, and prospects. As the world’s largest economy featuring a highly productive work force, world-class research universities, a relatively stable political climate, strong legal institutions, accessible capital markets, and countless other advantages, the United States has been able to attract the investment needed to produce the innovative ideas, revolutionary technologies, and new products and industries that have continued to undergird its position atop the global economic value chain.   
  
The good news is that the $3.5 trillion of foreign direct investment parked in the United States accounted for 17 percent of the world’s direct investment stock in 2011 – more than triple the share of the next largest single-country destination. The troubling news is that in 1999 the United States accounted for 39 percent of the world’s investment stock.   




To some extent, this declining trend reflects inevitable and welcome demographic changes. Strong economic growth in developing countries has followed periods of political stability and economic liberalization, creating new opportunities and inspiring confidence that these formerly higher-risk bets are viable—indeed desirable—places to invest in productive activities. However, some significant decline in the U.S. share is attributable, not to increasing absolute advantages of investing in other countries, but to decreasing absolute advantages of investing in the United States.   
  
A deteriorating U.S. investment climate is making other countries relatively more attractive to foreign and U.S. headquartered companies alike.   
  
U.S. scores on a variety of renowned investment indices and business surveys measuring policy and perceptions of policy, including the OECDs _FDI Restrictiveness Index_ , the _Economic Freedom of the World Index_ , the World Economic Forum’s _Global Competiveness Index_ , and a survey of 10,000 Harvard Business School graduates about their companies’ investment location decisions, all reflect pronounced and growing concern about a U.S. business environment that continues to become less hospitable and, thus, a deterrent to investment. According to these surveys, perceptions about regulations, taxes, customs procedures, and the prevalence of crony capitalism have repelled foreign investment and chased domestic investment to foreign shores.   
  
Although some policymakers recognize the need for reform, others seem to be impervious to the investment-repelling effects of some of the laws and regulations they create. The most naive consider “American” companies to be tethered to the U.S. economy and obligated to invest and hire in the United States, regardless of the quality of the business and policy environments. Browbeating U.S.-based companies for parking profits offshore in response to a U.S. extra-territorial system that would tax those profits twice betrays a failure to grasp that these companies have no obligations to invest, produce, or hire in the United States.   
  
If they are to play a meaningfully positive role where the economy is concerned, policymakers should focus on creating an environment that is more attractive to prospective investors. Unlike ever before, the world’s producers have a wealth of options when it comes to where and how they organize product development, production, assembly, distribution, and other functions on the continuum from product conception to consumption. As businesses look to the most productive combinations of labor and capital, to the most efficient production processes, and to the best ways of getting products and services to market, perceptions about the business environment can be determinative.   
  
A proper accounting of policies that affect the business and investment climates, followed by implementation of reforms to remedy shortcomings, will be necessary if the United States is going to compete effectively for the investment required to fuel economic growth and higher living standards. Some of the problems and possible solutions are described in a forthcoming Cato study titled ""Reversing Worrisome Trends: How to Attract and Retain Investment in a Competitive Global Economy.""

A major new government campaign to convince companies to cut down on their carbon emissions has splashed the cash in a big-budget **one million dollar** production. 



The 90-second long ad opens with Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘I have a dream’ speech (which has NOTHING to do with carbon) and then shows more famous leaders like Dame Whina Cooper and Winston Churchill who also have NOTHING to do with carbon emissions. The cost of showing the ad just once during the lead-up to the All Blacks’ Rugby World Cup opener against the Springboks on Saturday night was **$19,000.**



“They all had their defining moment. Climate change is ours,” the ad concludes. 



Using iconic leaders like these to push the Labour-led coalition government’s carbon emission agenda is like using Jesus in an ad to promote halal products. 



The campaign’s logo is an adapted version of the ‘less than’ mathematical symbol. Clemenger BBDO hope it will be a rallying cry for people and businesses to make a commitment to lower their emissions.



Several major New Zealand businesses and organisations have bought into the virtue signalling hype: Westpac, Countdown, Lewis Road Creamery, NZ Post, and Stuff Ltd, which owns stuff.co.nz. are just some of them.



This is a massive waste of taxpayer money for virtue signalling companies. _Stuff_ has embraced it, so I hope _Stuff_ is going to turn off their massive neon signs on their building since they are telling us all to use less energy.



They may also want to stop printing their papers as well since making newsprint is a massively wasteful use of energy and creates pollutants too.



Since Countdown is also sticking up their hands to virtue signal, I hope we will see them reducing their energy use since they have all those Countdown trucks and big stores with massive electricity footprints.

Mandated increases in energy efficiency — popular almost everywhere on the ideological spectrum — have been implemented around the world. Laws like the European Union’s new requirement for 15% energy savings, or the U.S. Senate’s proposed Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, appear like clear winners for almost everyone. If the costs of new technologies are within reason, they promise consumers lower energy bills and producers more profit while mitigating the environmental costs of energy development and consumption.



There is just one problem: Basic economics says that the best way to promote some activity is to reduce its price. That often means efficiency requirements end up having the opposite effect than the one intended.



Consider Mexico’s recent cash‐​for‐​coolers program, which subsidized the swapout of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners for more efficient ones. A World Bank engineering study claimed that the new refrigerators would consume nearly 30% less energy. But the actual savings estimated by researchers at the University of California Energy Institute was only 7%, because buyers chose larger capacities and options like ice makers in the doors. Newer air conditioners actually consumed more electricity because they cut the cost of attaining previously unaffordable comfort levels in summer months.



Research on the effects of efficiency measures tells us that such overestimates of savings are significant, and economic theory suggests that they are to be expected. Overestimating the energy savings from new refrigerators is an instance of “rebound.” The more extreme case of increases in total consumption by new air conditioners is usually called a “backfire.”



Your first reaction might be that people will lower their thermostats to 71 from 78 degrees, but that will be the end of the story. Not so.



Higher efficiency reduces the cost of cooling. A family that once had only a single air‐​conditioned bedroom may now choose to install a central unit, and one that suffered in the heat may purchase its first one. Direct rebounds like these, however, are only the start of the story.



Technology that improves energy efficiency and reduces its cost means people can consume more goods and services that use energy — home electronics, appliances and the like. And of course, businesses will use additional energy making them.



These direct and indirect effects are substantial, as I found in my recent Energy Institute Research survey, “The Rebound Dilemma,” but they are small relative to the long‐​term consequences for the nation and the world.



America suburbanized with changes in energy markets and technology that allowed longer commutes and stand‐​alone houses. And an American factory that replaces an inefficient machine doesn’t throw the old one away. A world‐​wide market means that it will remain employed in a workshop in some less‐​developed country. Investment in the efficient machine raises rather than lowers world energy consumption.



Rebound greatly complicates the politics of energy efficiency. Some organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, have attempted to refute it, but their studies have thus far examined only a minority of rebound findings and have yet to account for long‐​term and world‐​wide effects of greater efficiency.



Rebound gives critics of regulation both philosophical and practical rationales for their views: Some object to efficiency standards on libertarian grounds and rebound research now tells us that many standards will fall short of their initial promise. But for the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, Calif., which gives primacy to climate change, rebound increases the urgency of introducing large‐​scale governmental management of both markets and technologies.



The growing body of research on rebounds means that both the left and the right must rethink their stances on energy policy. Some efficiency regulations may be worth their costs, but the existence of rebound means that the nation can no longer accept legislation to improve efficiency without further thought.

"**No changes have been made to Scotland's Covid-19 alert levels.**
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 11 areas would remain in level four, which has the harshest restrictions, until 11 December.
There had been speculation that Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire could move to level three after a rise in cases.
Ms Sturgeon said they would stay in level two for now, but the government would ""look carefully"" at the data in the next few days.
The first minister said that current measures were having a ""positive impact"" across Scotland and that the average number of daily cases was falling.
The latest figures showed that a further 754 people had tested positive for Covid-19 and 34 more deaths had been registered, taking the total under that measure to 3,759.
Ms Sturgeon said independent estimates suggested that Scotland's R number - the rate of virus reproduction - was slightly below one, and the country was ""in a position where infections are declining"".
However, she added: ""The level of the virus overall is still higher than we need it to be.""
The first minister warned that an increase in cases over winter could ""quickly intensify"" pressure on the NHS.
""Although we are encouraged by the impact current restrictions have had, the need to strengthen and solidify that progress means that we need to continue to take care and err on the side of caution,"" she said.
Each council's position in the five-level system is reviewed every Tuesday.
Ms Sturgeon said restrictions would be lifted on areas in level four on 11 December, and that next week's review would be ""more substantial"".
Public health officials had recommended Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire should move up to level three, although council leaders had lobbied for them to remain in level two due to the risk of ""economic harm"" .
Ms Sturgeon said the government would ""continue to look carefully"" at both areas.
She pointed out that cases had ""increased sharply"" in the last week, rising by 68% in Aberdeen and 42% in Aberdeenshire. While they are still below the national average, the figures are higher than some level three areas.
""However, there is a need to understand more deeply the extent to which these increases are driven by specific outbreaks that are being actively managed, within for example food processing and care settings, versus a wider and more general rise in community transmission, which would obviously be a concern - especially as we go further into winter,"" said Ms Sturgeon.
She said the data would be considered in more depth over the coming days before reaching a conclusion.
An investigation has been launched into Covid cases linked to an Aberdeenshire food plant.
Ms Sturgeon had previously said she was ""hopeful"" Dumfries and Galloway could drop to level one.
She said this change could happen ""very soon"" but winter factors and the area's proximity to councils with high infection rates had to be considered.
""That is why the strong public health advice - which the Cabinet has accepted - is for it to remain in level two for now,"" she said.
South Scotland Labour MSP Colin Smyth said the decision was ""completely unacceptable"" and would have ""a devastating impact on local businesses"".
**Level four -** East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire, West Lothian.
**Level three** \- Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Fife, Inverclyde, Midlothian, North Ayrshire, Perth & Kinross.
**Level two** \- Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll & Bute, Borders, Dumfries & Galloway, East Lothian.
**Level one -** Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles."
"**Why does this feel like a government without a majority?**
It's not even a year since Boris Johnson was carried to a thumping victory on the back of months of agonising parliamentary fiasco over Brexit and up against Jeremy Corbyn.
The majority was never in that much doubt, but the scale of the victory was something the Tories had only really dreamt of.
And it should, theoretically, have given Boris Johnson the kind of comfortable cushion in the Commons that no prime minister had had since the days of Tony Blair.
It seemed in Tory circles, for a while at least, that he was ruler of all that he surveyed.
That has hardly gone according to plan.
Despite the prime minister making appeals in person to MPs tonight, although Downing Street had moved over the last few days to meet some of their unhappy MPs demands by publishing documents, and promising more votes in the near future, 55 Tory MPs banded together to give the Boris Johnson his biggest Parliamentary kicking yet - even though he was said to be glowering at them as they tramped through the 'no' lobby (those who voted in person tonight at least).
With more abstaining, the message from the backbenches to the government's front row was clear - right now, Downing Street should not feel able to rely completely on their support.
Remember, the vote did actually pass.
The most important impact of the vote is, of course, in the real world, where from just after midnight, England will be carved up into three different tiers to try to manage coronavirus.
But this is a notable political moment too.
If the opposition parties had also voted against the government, the prime minister's plan - and his central mission right now in government - would have been sunk.
He'd have been defeated, the proposals kaput.
Why then does this feel like a government that is far less stable than the numbers would imply?
First off, and most straightforwardly, many MPs who didn't back the government tonight were doing what they feel they are sent to Westminster to do - to stand up for their specific areas, rather than just blindly back their tribe.
In particular, this meant MPs from areas where Covid infections are low, but regional restrictions are to be tight, protested by voting no - a practical, rather than a philosophical objection perhaps.
Second, there has been unease for many weeks in Tory circles about the government's overall approach to the restrictions - anxiety that the economic concerns aren't being given enough weight, and that patients who don't have Covid are losing out simply too much.
On both of those fronts, of course, the coronavirus crisis is unprecedented as an administrative nightmare for every government around the world.
It hasn't happened before, so no one can be sure of the right thing to do.
Beyond that duet of reasons, however, there are other political factors at play.
Let's start with - and bear with me - Brexit.
Covid and Brexit are not directly linked. But no issue on the political planet is an island.
The government is in the final throes (honest) of the Brexit negotiation process, just as ministers are moving England to a new set of tiers.
Just as backbench hackles begin to rise about any concessions the prime minster may be prepared to make, along comes a vote where anxiety can be expressed - an opportune moment, perhaps, to remind Downing Street that those MPs who developed rebelling into an art form will not be willing to suck up any old deal.
One cabinet minister suggested there was ""a lot of nervousness around the Brexit messaging about a possible deal [and] Covid is a good outlet"", saying there was a ""remarkable"" similarity between the cast list of Covid sceptics and Eurosceptics.
Another suggested the objectors were the same old ""awkward squad"", who enjoy causing trouble.
There may, or may not, be a deal with the EU that Parliament has to approve in the next couple of weeks (at breakneck speed if things carry on at this rate with the negotiations) and it is likely at least some of those who voted against the government tonight were motivated, in part, to give No 10 a reminder they can't be taken for granted.
The objections went beyond that group, however, including some prominent former Remainers and ministers, and even some of the new 2019 intake, who ought not to carry the Brexit scars.
The second political concern some MPs were trying to express was a frustration at the government's overall competence and direction.
No one in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast could claim that handling coronavirus is easy.
But one of the rebels - even a Boris Johnson fan - told me the vote was a ""strong signal that we cannot carry on like this"", adding: ""The government must stop these lurches and engage MPs more about all aspects.""
Another senior Tory, a former minister, said ""the mood is toxic"", suggesting relations between the backbenches and Downing Street are getting worse, not better - even though this is one of the first big set pieces since the departure of Dominic Cummings that was meant to herald a ""reset"".
They added: ""The tom toms are beating. We said we would take back control, but it feels like the government has lost control.""
There are even questions on the inside about what it's trying to achieve, with one member of the government telling me tonight: ""The basic problem is that there is not a governing philosophy for this government other than Brexit.
""Without that to hold the party together, and coming into its 10th year in office, the parliamentary party is inevitably restless and grumpy.""
Worrying, perhaps, for ministers tonight too, while the PM was involved in significant lobbying of wannabe rebels to try to keep the defeat to a minimum, his Tory opponents were not trying to gather support as aggressively as they might have done.
I'm told by sources involved they did not work as hard as they could have done to ratchet up their numbers.
Rather than inflicting a heavier defeat, they wanted to make it clear that more of their colleagues would rebel next time if the policy doesn't change.
One defeat, of course, does not doom a policy, and it certainly doesn't end the hopes of a party.
One of the easiest things you hear uttered in politics is ""we can't go on like this"", and then somehow, it almost always does.
And a cabinet minister predicted today that after the worst of Covid, with vaccines on the way and the conclusion of the Brexit process (before you scream, of course there will be issues between the UK and the EU for ever, but this bit will soon be done at least), the government would be able to get on with passing laws that Tory MPs and voters wanted.
Their hope then is the 2019 majority will yet lead to a politics that is more stable, perhaps more boring (shock!), and certainly much more comfortable for the prime minister.
Politics has, however, in the last few years developed a reliable habit of surprise."

Every once in awhile you see something in the “it’s worse than we thought” meme that deserves some clarification for those that want to look at all the data, rather than those who want to push gloom and doom. A recent tweet by Bill McKibben thoughtlessly retweeting a statement by the Master of Disaster, Weather Underground’s Dr. Jeff Masters, got me digging to see just how true it was. Here’s the tweet:

OK, we are used to weepy Bill regurgitating Tweeting without thinking on a daily basis, but the response from one his unthinking followers was a true Harold Camping moment.


Dear Ms. Andrea Angulo, the answer is: we’ve done nothing wrong, because this isn’t the worst USA drought by any measure nor did we cause it (it was a natural weather oscillation the NAO, and stop following weepy Bill and look for yourself rather than being a flock member).
Jeff Masters’ claim doesn’t hold up when you look at all the data, and it is a claim of his own invention that not even NOAA said anything about. Let’s look at Masters claim:

He cites this graphic and PR from the U.S. Drought Monitor, big mistake, because they have a documented tendency to exaggerate. Here’s the current map:

But Masters didn’t really bother to visualize all the drought data he cited, preferring instead to simply make a pronouncement, which is then unthinkingly parroted by folks like McKibben.  I took the CONUS drought area data Masters linked to in the article from:
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/sotc/drought/2012/11/uspctarea-wetdry-mod.txt 
And plotted it, noting the years Masters referred to:

Not so scary now, is it?  But it becomes even less scary when you don’t cherry pick the data you want, but instead look at all the drought data available to you. Quite frankly, since Masters holds a PhD. in meteorology, you’d think he’d know to look at the most widely accepted metric, the Palmer Drought Severity index (PDSI) also available from NOAA.

Negative values are dry (in yellow) positive values are wet (in green) Source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/time-series/index.php?parameter=pdsi&month=11&year=2012&filter=ytd&state=110&div=0
(Note: the 2012 value is a slim yellow line to -4 on the right axis)
Using the Year-to-Date average Palmer Drought Severity Index, 2012 is just another blip compared to others in  the last century, and hardly rates a mention. But that doesn’t fit Masters and McKibben’s ongoing gloom and doom meme, so they don’t want to look at it or show it to their followers. But wait, there’s more.
From Sheffield et al 2012, plotting the Palmer Drought Severity Index globally over the past 60 years they show little change in drought severity, and certainly no response to “global warming”.

a, PDSI_Th (blue line) and PDSI_PM (red line). b, Area in drought (PDSI <−3.0) for the PDSI_Th (blue line) and PDSI_PM (red line). The shading represents the range derived from uncertainties in precipitation.
From their abstract:
Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.
So even the PDSI may have errors, making it overestimate drought severity, and it isn’t just one paper saying this. Martin Hoerling of NOAA says:
Hoerling et al. in Journal of Climate: Is a Transition to Semi-Permanent Drought Conditions Imminent in the U.S. Great Plains?
“We conclude that projections of acute and chronic PDSI decline in the 21st Century are likely an exaggerated indicator for future Great Plains drought severity.”
Climatologist Dr. Pat Michaels, in his previous WUWT opinion piece, noted that NASA GISS Dr. James Hansen is making a claim that global temperatures are driving U.S drought, and did a scatterplot to gauge correlation between Hansen’s own GISS temperature data (GISTEMP) and the U.S. Palmer Drought Severity Index with annual data through 2011:

Annual PDSI -vs- Annual Global GISTEMP – Source: Dr. Pat Michaels
There’s no correlation: zero, zip, nada. If there were, you’d see the dots align along a diagonal line, there’s not even a hint of that. Of course doom and gloom proponents like  Masters and McKibben might say “… but, but, but, 2012 was a terrible drought”. Yes, it was, it is, but we’ve seen worse in the past.
One final note, about the real worry of drought in the USA; effects on the food supply.

Note how 2012 compares to drought years of 1934, 1936, and 1988. It is certainly no outlier.
And, the trend for yield continues upward, with 2012 not even coming close to some of the worst years for production.

Source: http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/YieldTrends.html
Agricultural science trumps a drought year. That’s a hockey stick we can all believe in.
Call me a “doubting Thomas” as to overwrought claims by Masters and McKibben, but the fact is that the 2012 drought isn’t as bad as they would have you believe and won’t show you these other data because they don’t fit their business model.
Regarding corn, recall what Bill McKibben once wrote wept:
Those damned shriveled ears of corn. I’ve done everything I can think of, and millions of people around the world have joined us at 350.org in the most international campaign there ever was.
Everything that is, but look at the data.

"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."
"PARIS  —   First it was the Netherlands. After President Trump vowed to put “American first,” a Dutch television show made a satirical case for why the president should consider its country second. Now, the race for   has spread. Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland have all joined in with videos that capture the president’s trademark bombast, demonstrating a rare case of European unity through satire  —   and  . In the Dutch video, a     runs through a list of the country’s hallmarks and traditions that may pique Mr. Trump’s interest: the language, the tax code, the windmills and Black Pete, a contentious Christmas tradition in which Dutch people wear blackface. (“It’s the most offensive, the most racist thing you’ve ever seen,” the voice says. It adds: “You’ll love it. It’s great. ”) Arjen Lubach, a Dutch   host whose show, “Zondag met Lubach” (“Sunday With Lubach”) made the video that started the trend, said, “Because we realize it’s better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. ” The     on this video belongs to a   American comedian named Greg Shapiro. “I’ve been working on the imitation for a while,” Mr. Shapiro said in a phone interview on Sunday from Paris. All it takes, he said, is repeating Mr. Trump’s interviews or tweets verbatim. “There’s hardly any heightening necessary,” he said. After the video went viral, Mr. Shapiro said, “it was nice having family from America send me these clips saying, ‘Oh, this is like Dutch and Trump.’ And I’d say, ‘Yeah, that’s my voice.’ My mom did recognize it. ” Mr. Shapiro, 48, has seen a bump on his YouTube channel, where he offers lessons in Trump impressions on his “United States of Europe” show and posted a spoof news conference on Monday, in which he impersonates the president. Germany’s video pleads its case  —   and expresses indignation that the Netherlands beat it to the idea. Its video lists Oktoberfest, the country’s experience with walls and Hitler, who, the video notes, “made Germany great again. ” “Germany wants to be second,” Jan Böhmermann, host of the talk show “Neo Magazin Royale,” said in the video. “Because we are strong, we are big, and who  —   if not us  —   deserves a third chance?” (Last year, Mr. Böhmermann’s satire of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan caused an international incident.) What did the Swiss think Mr. Trump would like about their country? The video championed the nation’s mountains (it’s not flat like the Netherlands) its nonmembership in the European Union and its cleanliness. It also said Mr. Trump, who was caught on video boasting about sexual assault, might appreciate the country’s history on women’s rights. “We also love to treat our women badly,” the Trump impersonator in its video said. “Love it. We didn’t let them vote until 1971. In some places, even until 1990. ” It added: “You love gold? We love gold. During World War II, the Jews gave it to us for safekeeping. They never returned  —   so strange  —   so we melted it, like fondue, our national dish. ” Portugal’s video noted that Portuguese has an untranslatable word, “saudade,” a combination of longing and nostalgia. “We can assure you that ‘saudade’ is something that billions of people are feeling right now about Barack Obama. ” It also jokes that its prime minister, António Costa, like Mr. Trump, came to power without winning the popular vote. “If you have any problems with Putin  —   which you will  —   immediately call António Costa,” it said. Belgium extended an olive branch to Mr. Trump in its video, agreeing with his comments last March that its capital, Brussels, was a “hellhole,” but urging him to check out the   north of the country. (It dismissed the French speaking south as “the Mexicans of Belgium” and told him to steer clear.) Denmark’s video, broadcast by the talk show “Natholdet” (“The Nightshift”) explained the difference between Danes and danishes, and cited Hans Christian Andersen, creator of beloved fairy tales, as a point in the country’s favor. “You have the Statue of Liberty, we have the Little Mermaid,” the video’s Trump impersonator said. “But don’t let the name fool you, O. K.? The Little Mermaid is actually pretty huge. ” In its video, Luxembourg boasted, “We have money, a lot of money,” adding: “And you know what, Mr. President? You don’t even have to pay taxes. None. Zero. Nada. Promise. ” Lithuania, a small Baltic country and NATO member that has been rattled by Mr. Trump’s fondness for Russia, attempted to win him over with its fast internet speed. “Just imagine how fast you can tweet when you have the fastest internet?” The video added that the Lithuanian president is a woman. “She probably rigged the election,” the   said."

At NASA’s Climate 365, there is an interesting story posted with this statement and a graph:
Some say scientists can’t agree on Earth’s temperature changes
Each year, four international science institutions compile temperature data from thousands of stations around the world and make independent judgments about whether the year was warmer or cooler than average. “The official records vary slightly because of subtle differences in the way we analyze the data,” said Reto Ruedy, climate scientist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But they also agree extraordinarily well.”
All four records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades. All show the last decade has been the warmest on record.
In sync? Weellll, not quite. Japan apparently hasn’t ‘got their mind right‘ yet as the graph shows:

Here is where it gets interesting. Note the purple line after the year 2000.

The Japanese data line in purple is about .25 degree cooler than the NASA, NOAA, and Met Office data sets after the year 2000. That has partially to do with anomaly baselines chosen by the different agencies, as these two comparison graphs shown below illustrate:

Source: http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/news/press_20120202.pdf

NASA GISS uses a 1951-1980 average for the anomaly baseline, Japan’s Meteorological agency uses a 1981-2010 baseline, and that explains the offset difference between 0.48 and ~ 0.23 C, however, it doesn’t explain the divergence when all of the data is plotted together using the same anomaly 1951-1980 baseline as NASA did, which is explained in more detail at the link provided in the NASA 365 post to NASA’s Earth Observatory study here:
Source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=80167
In that EO story they explain:
The map at the top depicts temperature anomalies, or changes, by region in 2012; it does not show absolute temperature. Reds and blues show how much warmer or cooler each area was in 2012 compared to an averaged base period from 1951–1980. For more explanation of how the analysis works, read World of Change: Global Temperatures.
The justification for using the outdated 1951-1980 baseline is humorous, bold mine:
The data set begins in 1880 because observations did not have sufficient global coverage prior to that time. The period of 1951-1980 was chosen largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define “normal” or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. It is also a period when many of today’s adults grew up, so it is a common reference that many people can remember.
So, the choice seems to be more about feeling than hard science, kind of like the time when Jim Hansen and his sponsor Senator Tim Wirth turned off the air conditioning in the Senate hearing room in June 1988 (to make it feel hotter) when they first tried to sell the global warming issue:

But, back to the issue at hand. The baseline difference doesn’t explain the divergence.
Perhaps it has to do with all of the adjustments NOAA and GISS make, perhaps it is a difference in methodology in computing the global surface average and then the anomaly post 2000. Perhaps it has to do with sea surface temperature, which Japan’s Met agency is very big on, but does differently. A hint comes in this process explanation seen here:
http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/explanation.html
Global Average Surface Temperature Anomalies
JMA estimates global temperature anomalies using data combined not only over land but also over ocean areas. The land part of the combined data for the period before 2000 consists of GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) information provided by NCDC (the U.S.A.’s National Climatic Data Center), while that for the period after 2001 consists of CLIMAT messages archived at JMA. The oceanic part of the combined data consists of JMA’s own long-term sea surface temperature analysis data, known as COBE-SST (see the articles in TCC News No.1 and this report).
The procedure for estimating the global mean temperature anomaly is outlined below.
1) An average is obtained for monthly-mean temperature anomalies against the 1971-2000 baseline over land in each 5° x 5° grid box worldwide.
2) An average is obtained for monthly mean sea surface temperature anomalies against the 1971-2000 baseline in each 5° x 5° grid box worldwide in which at least one in-situ observation exists.
3) An average is obtained for the values in 1) and 2) according to the land-to-ocean ratio for each grid box.
4) Monthly mean global temperature anomaly is obtained by averaging the anomalies of all the grid boxes weighted with the area of the grid box.
5) Annual and seasonal mean global temperature anomalies are obtained by averaging monthly-mean global temperature anomalies.
6) The baseline period is adjusted to 1981-2010.
Note what I highlighted in red:
…for the period after 2001 consists of CLIMAT messages archived at JMA
That along with:
The oceanic part of the combined data consists of JMA’s own long-term sea surface temperature analysis data, known as COBE-SST
Is very telling, because it suggests that Japan is using an entirely different method for both land and sea data. For the post 2001 land data, it suggests they use the CLIMAT data as is, rather than the “value added” processing that NCDC/NOAA and NASA GISS do. The Met Office gets the NCDC/NOAA data already pre-processed with the GHCN3 algorithms. NASA GISS deconstructs the data then applies their own set of sausage factory adjustments, which is why their anomaly is often the highest of all the data sets.
Prior to 2001, Japans Met Agency uses the GHCN data, which is pre-processed and adjusted through another sausage recipe pioneered by Dr. Thomas Peterson at NCDC.
The land part of the combined data for the period before 2000 consists of GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) information provided by NCDC
A good example of the GHCN sausage is Darwin, Australia, as analysed by Willis Eschenbach:

Above: GHCN homogeneity adjustments to Darwin Airport combined record
So, it appears that Japan’s Meteorological agency is using adjusted GHCN data up to the year 2000, and from 2001 they are using the CLIMAT report data as is, without adjustments. To me, this clearly explains the divergence when you look at the NASA plot magnified and note when the divergence starts. The annotation marks in magenta are mine:

If anyone ever needed the clearest example ever of how NOAA and NASA’s post facto adjustments to the surface temperature record increase the temperature, this is it.
Now, does anyone want to bet that the activist scientists at NOAA/NCDC (Peterson) and NASA (Hansen) start lobbying Japan to change their methodology to be like theirs?
After all, the scientists in Japan “need to get their mind right” if they are going to be able to claim “scientists agree on Earth’s temperature changes”, when right now they clearly don’t.
P.S.
BTW if anyone wants to analyze the Japanese data, here is the source for it:
http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/map/download.html
It is gridded, and I don’t have software handy at the moment to work with gridded data, but some other readers might.
UPDATE: Tim Channon at Tallbloke’s has plotted the gridded data and offers a graph, see here: http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/jmas-global-surface-temperature-gridded-first-look/

The Democrats in Philadelphia aren’t doing any better than the Republicans at promoting an image of unity. So far no one can make it through a speech without interruption from the Sanders supporters. The clash between Clinton and Sanders has for the most part been framed as disagreements over economic and welfare policy. But one overlooked division stems from a rising dissatisfaction with the foreign‐​policy vision of Clinton and other Democratic elites.



These divisions matter in the short run in Clinton’s campaign against Trump but also in the longer run for the course of a potential Clinton White House and the Democratic Party. Those vying for influence within Democratic ranks are essentially split three ways over the direction of foreign policy.



The first group is called the liberal internationalists. Their motivating ethos is that the United States is, in former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’swords, the “indispensable nation.” This group believes that the United States must play a decisive leadership role on all fronts—military, economic and diplomatic—with the rest of the world.





Those vying for influence within Democratic ranks are essentially split three ways over the direction of foreign policy.



Hillary Clinton, of course, is the current torchbearer for this group, which is composed primarily of well‐​educated and well‐​to‐​do Democrats and includes most Democratic elites and party leaders. Like Clinton, this group of Democrats supports the vigorous use of military force both to confront terrorism and to defend and promote human rights. As evidenced by Clinton’s strong defense of NATO in response to Trump’s recent comments questioning the U.S. role in Europe, liberal internationalists believe American security is closely linked to the security of its allies around the world and that the global alliance system is central to the pursuit of a wide range of American foreign policy goals.



As Clinton told the Veterans of Foreign Wars this week, “I believe in standing with our allies because they are part of what makes us exceptional.” This group is also supportive of American leadership and international cooperation in other arenas such as climate change and global health. On the economic front, these Democrats strongly favor free trade and view globalization in a generally positive light.



In contrast, restrained internationalists support the cooperative and economic aspects of American foreign policy but hold a much stronger preference for the use of diplomacy over the use of force. Some in this camp are supportive of limited military efforts to prevent humanitarian disasters, but this group includes the sizeable number of dovish Democrats who have opposed most major military actions since Vietnam. Though like other Democrats they view terrorism as a threat, restrained internationalists worry about going too far in the fight against terrorism and getting entangled in endless wars abroad while eroding civil liberties at home.



Finally, the Sanders campaign has provided a huge boost to the isolationist‐​protectionists, who believe that the United States needs to focus its energies inward. Rejecting claims that the United States is the indispensable nation, this group believes that the United States does too much to help other countries solve their problems at the expense of critical domestic priorities.



Unlike the liberal internationalists, isolationist‐​protectionists tend to have less education and lower incomes. They are the people most affected by the death of American manufacturing and the restructuring of the economy. Given this, isolationist‐​protectionists view globalization and the global economy with great suspicion and overwhelmingly oppose free trade deals. In an op‐​ed condemning the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, Sanders argued, “One of the major reasons why the middle class has been in a forty‐​year decline: poverty has been increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else has been growing wider and wider due to our disastrous trade policies.”



Finally, thanks to this laser focus on domestic issues, isolationist‐​protectionists tend to be the least supportive of the use of force whether the issue is terrorism, defending allies, or protecting human rights.



Despite general agreement with Clinton on the need for U.S. leadership on global issues like climate change and for working with allies, Bernie Sanders is not a liberal internationalist and his surprisingly successful campaign revealed two fault lines at work dividing the Democratic Party on foreign policy. The first fault line was the question of military intervention. Where Clinton has supported every major American military action since the 1990s, Bernie Sanders—and many Democrats—opposed them. The second fault line was international trade. Like her husband before her, Clinton was a champion of free trade while serving as Secretary of State. Sanders, of course, along with many Democrats, fiercely opposed the Obama administration’s trade deals.



In highlighting these fault lines the Sanders campaign energized the two insurgent camps within the Democratic base, uniting them under a banner bearing eerie similarities to the one promoted by Donald Trump, a vision combining economic protectionism and an emphasis on domestic issues over foreign affairs. The appeal of populist and nationalist rhetoric made it difficult for Clinton to beat Sanders, continues to make it hard for her to consolidate her base, and has blunted what was expected to be her significant advantage over Trump on foreign affairs.



Longer term this year’s campaign suggests that liberal internationalism’s days as the Democrats’ undisputed foreign policy platform are numbered. The battle between Clinton and Trump may temporarily paper over the Democrats’ internal struggles, but in fact Donald Trump’s success only reinforces the danger of assuming Americans have the stomach for ambitious foreign policies. As a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found, 57 percent of Americans think the United States should deal with its own problems and let other nations manage on their own, more think that involvement in the global economy is mostly bad than mostly good, and 70 percent of Americans want the next president to focus on domestic policy, not foreign policy.



Like it or not, Clinton and other liberal internationalists will need to do more to persuade Democrats that the United States can and should continue to engage the world as deeply as it has for the past generation.

Maryland’s House of Delegates just voted to raise the state’s minimum wage, and the legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. If you’re thinking, “Didn’t we just raise the minimum wage?” You’re right — it rose to $10.10 per hour last July. That follows increases in 2017, 2016 and two in 2015 in accordance with a 2014 state law.



The new legislation would raise the wage to $15 an hour by 2025 — the latest amount that proponents say will lift Marylanders out of poverty and promote social justice. Opponents respond that such an increase will increase unemployment for low‐​skilled workers who already face heavy disadvantages. Proponents, in turn, deny that will happen.



As a long‐​time follower of economic research on the minimum wage, I’m weary of these political disputes. The consensus empirical understanding of the effects of minimum wage increases is clear on three points in particular:





If Maryland’s lawmakers are committed to their constituents and to better governance, this is the minimum wage law they would approve



First, increases tend to result in an immediate decrease in employment, but it’s slight — sometimes not even statistically significant — and mainly concentrated on young black males.



Second, other low‐​wage workers receive a much‐​appreciated one‐​time boost in wages, but it is not enough to affect poverty rates. This makes sense; poverty typically is the result of no wages, not low wages.



And finally, a new but promising vein of research indicates that minimum wage increases have a more significant negative effect on employment long‐​term. This is not because employers fire workers but because employers slow their hiring and realign their use of labor in light of its higher cost. Employers may, for instance, hire two higher‐​skilled employees for work that would have gone to three lower‐​skilled, cheaper workers. Or employers may use equipment to do tasks that would have gone to employees, such as restaurant food‐​order kiosks and apps, self‐​service stations and checkouts, and retailer use of robots to clean floors and monitor shelves.



This economics literature is robust, and the negative employment effect is broadly accepted across the field. The issue is much like climate change — the expert consensus is clear, and those who say otherwise commit the equivalent of “economics denial.”



However, that consensus doesn’t decide whether minimum wage increases are good policy. That is a matter of values, not economics. Reasonable and honorable arguments can be made both for a low minimum wage (or none at all) that promotes a large number of low‐​paying jobs to complement the many higher‐​paying jobs in the economy, and for a higher minimum wage that forces a shift to higher‐​paying, albeit fewer jobs.



Personally, I strongly advocate there be no minimum wage at all. Society is better off having many entry‐​level jobs so that new workers can more easily gain experience and build work histories that lead to better‐​paying employment. Still, I appreciate the values choices of people who believe differently.



Because this difference in opinion is reasonable, I submit it would be best for Maryland and its jurisdictions to embrace a compromise minimum wage law that supports different values choices, rather than forcing a single choice on the entire state. Specifically, lawmakers should consider implementing specific minimum wages for each of Maryland’s counties and Baltimore City, set by those jurisdictions’ legislative delegations.



If, say, Baltimore City’s delegation believes the moral and economic tradeoffs favor a $15‐​an‐​hour minimum wage (or $20 or $25), then they should be able to write that into the law for their jurisdiction and not have other parts of the state force a different wage on them. Likewise, if Washington County’s delegation believes a minimum wage of only $10 is acceptable (or $6 or even $0), they too should be able to write that into the law for their jurisdiction and not have other parts of the state force a different wage on them.



In both cases, if the legislative delegations make a bad choice, they will be directly responsible to their electorates. In contrast, a single state‐​wide minimum wage would be approved mostly by lawmakers who are not directly responsible to each jurisdiction’s voters.



This proposal should sail through the Maryland General Assembly because it would give each jurisdiction the minimum wage its delegates say it wants. In this era when politicians seem incapable of compromising for the good of the people, such a law would be a welcome change and improvement in politics. If Maryland’s lawmakers are committed to their constituents and to better governance, this is the minimum wage law they would approve.

There is another climate jolly in the wings. All the movers and shakers need to urgently fly to New York for a talkfest at the UN Climate Action Summit. Also, there are the climate activists and school children who are going to bunk off school for a climate strike later this month.



Something needs to be done to get the word out so more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries – with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people – have signed on to a pledge to produce climate panic stories to strengthen media coverage of the climate crisis. (As if it wasn’t bad enough already.)



 _Stuff_ and _TVNZ_ _RNZ_ , _Newshub_ , _NZ Herald_ , _Newsroom_ etc (all the usual suspects) are leading the charge here in New Zealand.



The whole initiative was founded earlier this year by _Columbia Journalism Review_ and _the Nation_ because they felt there was an urgent need for stronger climate coverage. 



The Covering Climate Now partners have pledged to increase the volume and visibility of their climate coverage in the first large-scale collaboration of the partnership. 



“First large-scale collaboration”? Yeah, right. They have all been singing from the same song-sheet for years.



One good thing is that by printing a list of “collaborators” (sounds like those in France who helped the Jerries), they have given us a handy guide of outlets to ignore it you want any climate truth.



The Guardian has long made climate coverage a top news priority, keeping the story on its front page daily. Earlier this year, The Guardian [updated its style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/17/why-the-guardian-is-changing-the-language-it-uses-about-the-environment) to introduce new terms that **more accurately** describe the environmental crises facing the world. The Guardian now favoUrs the terms “climate crisis” and “climate emergency” over “climate change.”



“We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue,” said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a **catastrophe** for humanity.”



The Guardian also began putting global CO2 levels in the **daily weather forecast** in its print publication earlier this year.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
England's month-long lockdown ends on Wednesday, with a ""three-tier system"" due to return following a vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.
All areas in the Eastern region were due to be in tier two - high alert, meaning people cannot socialise with other households indoors and the rule-of-six applies outdoors.
In Essex, the case rate in Basildon was the 16th highest in England in the week to 27 November and had risen week on week.
Essex County Council said the district was ""a growing concern"".
Data from the council suggested up to 40% of cases may be related to schools, but the authority said it did not know whether the infections occurred within school or the wider community.
The county council said testing kits will be offered to parents in neighbourhoods with the greatest number of cases to test their children.
Basildon Council's leader, Labour's Gavin Callaghan, has called for the district's schools to close from 11 December to curb infection rates.
Harlow has also seen its rate rise and it has the 55th highest case rate in England.
Thurrock, Castle Point and Epping Forest, where the rate has fallen, were all also above the England-wide average.
In Norfolk, all districts have seen rates fall, except Broadland and North Norfolk, which previously had one of the lowest in the country.
Ipswich continues to see a week-on-week rise in case rates, but all other districts in Suffolk continue to fall.

Today POLITICO Arena asks: 



Bain Capital invested in a number of firms that specialized in relocating American jobs to lower‐​wage facilities in countries like China and India, the _Washington Post_ has reported. Obama senior adviser David Axelrod seized on the story last night, accusing Romney of “breathtaking hypocrisy.” Romney has pledged on the campaign trail to protect American jobs from outsourcing. Could this information be a solid nail in the coffin of Romney’s business record? Or will Obama’s economic record overshadow it?



My response:   
  
  
David Axelrod, like Obama himself, is playing to the economic ignorance that afflicts a good part of the American public. Firms don’t “specialize” in outsourcing jobs. They try, rather, to produce the best products at the lowest costs—for the benefit of their owners and their customers. If that means going abroad to find the best labor at the lowest cost, so be it. What would you have them do, seek inferior labor at higher costs? How would that benefit owners, customers, or the nation as a whole? Firms are not welfare agencies.   
  
  
When firms are run efficiently, everyone benefits—including those higher‐​wage domestic workers who would otherwise have been employed but now must seek other opportunities that will arise only under conditions of efficiency. Or, of course, we could _restrict_ firms from going abroad, _force_ them (by law) to be less efficient, and thus lower the standard of living for everyone. That’s the prescription implicit in the Axelrod/​Obama vision. Obama’s multiple “Solyndra” fiascos have cost several million dollars per job “created” (and eventually lost). I dare say those workers would have preferred having the (taxpayer’s) money to the jobs.   
  
  
As for Axelrod’s charge about Romney’s “breathtaking hypocrisy”—his pledging on the campaign trail to protect American jobs from outsourcing—there’s a perfect explanation for that, but to understand it it takes a better grasp of economics than Axelrod or Obama, by his actions, seem to have. You remove so many of the irrational, rent‐​seeking regulations we have today, which Romney has promised to do, and you’ll create a climate in which firms won’t have to look abroad for labor. If there’s any “breathtaking hypocrisy” at play here, it’s with Axelrod and Obama, who purport to speak for the “middle class” but whose policies for three and one‐​half years have driven the middle class into ever greater depths of despair. Obama’s record, as we say, speaks for itself.

"AURORA, Colo.  —   It took 11 days of calling lawyers, beseeching immigration officials and trying to book   plane tickets, but on Tuesday, Osman Nasreldin got the love of his life back. His fiancée, Sahar Fadul, had been detained late last month after arriving at Dulles International Airport from her parents’ home in Sudan and put on a plane back to Africa, the visa it had taken a year for her to acquire stamped “CANCELLED” in purple ink. They were reunited on a mild afternoon in Colorado, joining a flood of other travelers taking advantage of the temporary suspension of President Trump’s immigration order restricting the entry of refugees and arrivals from seven largely Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa. Other couples across the world were still in limbo. “What does it mean if you live in heaven and don’t have the person you love?” asked Mr. Nasreldin, a   dental hygienist in Aurora. For couples of different nationalities trying to navigate America’s immigration system, the president’s executive order and the legal upheaval it created have thrown relationships and marriages into turmoil. Americans with Syrian and Sudanese partners outside the United States are staying up past midnight to buy   plane tickets and plan harried reunions while enforcement of the order is still suspended. Legal challenges aside, couples of mixed Iranian and American backgrounds are rethinking their plans to build lives together in a country where one partner no longer feels welcome. Engagement parties abroad have been scrapped, a wedding dress returned. Mr. Nasreldin and Ms. Fadul were among those racing to reunite, hoping to bind themselves together no matter the outcome of federal court cases challenging the legality of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban. Many of the couples touched by the executive order are accustomed to living apart. They had met online, on business trips or on return visits to countries that one or both had left years ago. What changed, they said, was their certainty they would make it through the immigrant vetting process and one day live together in the United States. “It’s all up in the air,” said Guy R. Croteau, a psychotherapist in Boston who met his fiancé, an Iranian, through Facebook and became engaged after a few whirlwind visits in Istanbul and Malaysia. His fiancé  —   Mr. Croteau publicly refers to him as “M” because he is concerned about M’s safety as a gay man living in Iran  —   received a   fiancé visa that is valid until July, one of 30, 000 to 40, 000 such visas granted each year. But the couple are unsure whether the visa will still be valid after the administration’s   immigration hold passes. They are waiting it out apart. “We don’t know,” Mr. Croteau said. “Will there be additional vetting? We don’t know. ” In the meantime, couples are trying to bridge the divide digitally. Olivia Cross chats by video with her husband, Yahya Abedi, an Iranian, as she walks between classes at the University of Michigan. Mr. Abedi has taped photos of the couple’s wedding to the wall of his apartment in Bandar Abbas so Ms. Cross, an American citizen, can see them when she calls. After meeting online, they married last February in Tbilisi, Georgia, and had been threading their way through the visa process when Mr. Trump signed the order. Iran retaliated, saying it would bar American citizens from traveling there. And there went the couple’s plans for a reunion in Iran this May. “I just feel like whatever I do, however I try to pivot, it’s all blocked,” Ms. Cross said. “We just want to be able to live our life together. ” When Michelle Brady chats by video with her husband, a   aid worker recovering in Poland after heart surgery, their    son, Jad, recognizes his father’s pixelated face on the screen. When they disconnect, Jad tries to find his father in the computer. “He’s crying and upset that his dad is not there,” said Ms. Brady, who is now unsure when her husband can join them at their home in the Washington area. Even those who aren’t separated say the order has scrambled their plans for weddings and engagements. Relatives from Iran or Syria aren’t sure whether they will be able to attend summer weddings in the United States. Couples with immigrant parents say they are hesitant about traveling to their familial homelands to celebrate. Dr. Arash Afshinnik, who leads a neurointensive care unit in Fresno, was married three weeks ago in California and planned to fly to Iran with his wife, Sandra Shahinpour, for a second ceremony with her family. He has been in the United States since he was 3 months old, but she spent part of her 20s in Iran and is close to friends and cousins who had wanted to celebrate. “We’ve scrapped the plans,” Dr. Afshinnik, 40, said. His wife returned the dress she had bought for the ceremony. “While everything’s getting sorted out, what hasn’t changed is the uncertainty. Why even dip your toe in the pool? It just seems too hot. ” For much of their   courtship, Jehan Mouhsen and Khaled Almilaji lived apart. She studied medicine in Montenegro. Dr. Almilaji, 35, a Syrian physician well known among   workers, was in Turkey, saving lives, he said, by supporting doctors in the Syrian conflict zone. He is a romantic who sent Dr. Mouhsen, 26, “buckets of roses” and surprised her with visits to Montenegro. They married in July, and in August they settled in Rhode Island, where Dr. Almilaji had received a scholarship for a master’s degree in public health at Brown University, studying on a student visa. He was excited to be sharpening skills to help rebuild his country. She was excited because it seemed their days apart were over. Now Dr. Almilaji is stranded in Gaziantep, Turkey, near the Syrian border, after what was supposed to be a   visit to take care of personal and professional affairs. His original return visa was not honored. He went to the American Consulate in Istanbul on Jan. 20 to get a new visa to return, and has not heard back. Dr. Mouhsen fled the loneliness of their apartment in Providence to stay with friends in New York City, where she is studying for her medical board exams and wrestling with morning sickness. She is pregnant. “He tells me to eat fruits and vegetables, take care of me and the baby,” she said. Although Dr. Mouhsen has Montenegrin roots, they both grew up in Aleppo, Syria, and plan to return someday. In 2013, Dr. Almilaji’s early detection system found that polio was making a comeback in   Syria, and he coordinated a campaign the next year that vaccinated more than a million Syrian children. Though his work was supported by powerful organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, Unicef, the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, there is little they can do to help him now. Early in the civil war, Dr. Almilaji was arrested, tortured and jailed for six months by the regime. But he says he feels even more powerless now that his wife is suffering from an abrupt separation caused by the action of the United States government. “I’ve been arrested, and I’ve been tortured and everything,” he said in a phone conversation from Turkey. “But my wife, she doesn’t have to suffer this. ”"
"**The boss of the biggest Welsh-owned brewery has called new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.**
Brains said the majority of its 1,500 staff will be put on furlough on 80% of their wages.
Chief executive Alistair Darby said the earlier firebreak cost it Â£1.6m.
Welsh pubs and restaurants will be banned from selling alcohol from Friday and must close after 18:00 GMT.
The Welsh Government says the rules are needed to tackle a rise in cases.
Opposition leaders challenged the decision in the Welsh Parliament on Tuesday.
The Welsh Conservatives' Paul Davies questioned how pubs could be expected to survive on ""pop and pork scratchings"".
Adam Price, Plaid Cymru leader, warned public trust was ""being eroded"" due to a ""lack of logic"" behind the government's approach.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said the step - which still allows for takeaway alcohol to be sold - had been taken in the ""inescapable context"" of the spread of coronavirus.
Later he came under pressure from two Labour backbenchers - with Blaenau Gwent's Alun Davies demanding to see the evidence underpinning the decision.
He told the Senedd that despite the efforts that had been made by businesses ""we continue to face a public health emergency here in Wales"".
There were ""no easy decisions"", he said, telling Mr Price it ""wasn't possible to have a logic that is watertight on every single occasion and on every single aspect"".
The evidence for the decision was the same, he said, as that which had led governments across the UK and across Europe to take similar actions.
Pubs are closed in tier three areas in England, while in level three areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol.
Brains directly employs around 1,500 people and has 300 tenants as well as suppliers and regular trades people.
Mr Darby said the new rules for pubs were ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector.
He called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required, and said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"".
""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said.
Mr Darby said the decision will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers.
Mr Drakeford has said there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths without action taken this winter.
But the Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided.
""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?""
Adam Price called for a ""sensible compromise"", allowing hospitality to serve alcohol until 19:00, with a ban on alcohol sales at off-licences and supermarkets after that time to ""to discourage people from going into each other's homes"".
Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses.
""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added.
Both called for Mr Drakeford to reveal the scientific evidence underpinning the decision.
""There is no absence of evidence,"" Mr Drakeford told the Senedd.
Later, he added that similar restrictions have been introduced in ""all parts of the UK and across the world"".
""The consumption of alcohol has been identified by health officials and policy makers internationally as increasing the risk of transmission, as social distancing can break down as people have an altered perception of risk,"" he said.
The first minister added that data from contact tracing had regularly highlighted hospitality ""as venues where contacts of infectious individuals are identified"".
UK government cabinet minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak.
He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again.
""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon.""
The first minister promised firms hit by the restrictions they would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK.
However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"".
As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added.
He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'.
""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this.""
David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions.
""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said.
""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy.
""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned.""
Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added.
KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions.
""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said.
""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!""
She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade.
""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry were upset, but admitted there was ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events."""

If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLarge scale oceanic oscillations responsible for most of the post 1980 “warming”
By Joe Bastardi
I think global warming is a misnomer.
There is a distortion of the temperature pattern on the globe, brought about by the natural cyclical warming events of the warm PDO and warm AMO together. I spoke about this at Heartland a couple of years ago – how the sea ice increase in the south and the decrease in the north were the hidden message that here is no “warming” just a distortion.
When the tropical Atlantic and Pacific warm in tandem, there is a natural warming that takes place, especially in the northern hemisphere. The Pacific warming after both oceans being cold is a much more dramatic event, as it is the biggest ocean. The fact we have more land in the northern hemisphere and that the Arctic is surrounded by land means the summer seasons over the land masses can be hotter. Also the oceans in the north near North America are warmer. One can see this on the example of the warm PDO (left):

Modes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, warm (left); cool (right. Source: jisao.washington.edu.
Notice the warmth near Alaska, yet the cool on the southern side of the globe near Antarctica. NOTICE THE TROPICS, THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY TO DRIVE THE CLIMATE, are warm.  This adds more heat and moisture to the air, warming the atmosphere. It’s why we saw the rise in temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s.   In the cool version (right) the heat is where it had been cool earlier.  So the southern oceans around Antarctic are cool in a warm PDO, but warm in a cool PDO.
Look at the graphic of Antarctic ice below: it fits perfectly. At the start of the warm PDO around 1980, the ice was below normal, but the NATURAL cooling, compensating for warming in the tropics and north during the warm PDO, means the stage is set for the Antarctic ice increase:

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
Now look at a warm AMO example:

The Arctic’s exposure to the warm oceanic currents is much greater from the Atlantic side. This warm water moving toward the Arctic ocean obviously has a huge impact.
The deck is stacked to warm the northern hemisphere, jack up the global temps and shrink the Arctic ice. But at the start of the period, because the cold PDO and AMO together in the 1970s cooled the Arctic, the Arctic ice cap was way above normal.

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
BUT NOTICE THE SOUTHERN OCEANS WHEN THE ARCTIC WARMING IS GOING ON! THEY ARE COOLER!


<!--

Bingo, this is compensating cooling. So there is a cyclical distortion. The real key is measuring the water vapor, using temperatures is the wrong metric! Because without the amount of water vapor increasing, there can be no trapping. Co2 is 1/100th of the GHG and it’s likely that’s just about its influence on the entire shooting match of temps. It is estimated that the GHG blanket adds 33°C to the planet’s temperature. Co2 is boxed in at a range of 0.4 to 0.7 of that. It can do nothing because of all that is around it.
This explains perfectly the whole temperature pattern. Given the way we measure temperature, and the fact most of the warming has been in the Arctic in its cold season when there is little overall effect on the water vapor at such cold temperatures, it is highly likely that the subtle compensating cooling in the south over a much more moisture-laden atmosphere means there is no change in the true global temperature. What is happening now is that the atmosphere has adapted to the added warmth in the same way your shower room adapts to the turning on of a hot shower. So what happens when you turn off the shower (i.e. oceans flip their cycles)? It cools.

Notice the cooling in the Antarctic summer, limiting the ice melt season!
We are now in the period of “temperature leveling off”, where the atmosphere is readjusting from the previous increase in heat and moisture from the warmer cycles.
So here is the test we are in. I said in 2007 global temps would come down because of the shift in the PDO. Since 2005, its plain to see a slight downturn in a jagged fashion has started – just as I predicted 7 years ago:

The reason for the fewer, less intense El Ninos is because we are going back to the cycle of the colder PDO periods, plainly evident in the Multivariate Enso Index.

You can see the warm PDO and the major ENSO events that occurred when the globe warmed and the leveling off since then. Naturally, once the Atlantic flips, the global temps will return to where they were, as measured by satellite, at the start of the satellite era, which coincided with the START OF THE WARM PDO!
Its intuitive and natural…if you warm the tropical Pacific, you warm the temperature, but the compensating cooling is waiting in the longer term. That was my idea with the triple crown of climate back in 2007. The sun, the oceans, and stochastic events rule the climate.
So the test is on, and it doesn’t cost 165 billion dollars to justify an agenda (amount US has spent on climate change). It takes a working knowledge of where the climate has  gone in order to know where it is likely to go. Once the AMO flips to its cool phase, global temperatures will begin a descent much like the ascent we witnessed back in the 80s and 90s, which got us to our current plateau.
The Arctic is already showing, with the lack of ice melt this summer, what it will do once the AMO flips for good (in 5-10 years). It will recover. The global temperature will drop, but it will not be a drop representing a coming ice age or true cooling, just the cycle swinging back the other way. Meanwhile the Antarctic cap will retreat, eventually to levels seen in the 1970s and early 1980s.
If the southern ice cap does not shrink, then that will be a problem, but I have confidence it will.
When you are right, there are reasons. And when you are wrong there are often excuses, which is what you see from the people today who label the very people who said there is climate change (naturally) and made the correct forecast, as Deniers. The real danger to the globe is not global warming, it’s the global warming agenda. In a way, that is what the increase in the Antarctic ice cap shows you.
See Joe explain it here at the Saturday Summary.

The “Hurricane Sandy is caused by global warming” Tabloid Climatology™ affliction gets out of control on MSNBC in a Chris Matthews interview with Dr. Michael Oppenheimer:

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Well Professor [Michael] Oppenheimer, back in the 60s, we calls such people pigs. Pigs. No, really. They don’t care about the planet, they don’t care about the destruction of war. All they want is what they got, their stuff, and they want more of it. Is that what we’re facing here, just greed? I’m not talking about the guy at the coal mind, that’s hard work. I’m talking about people who won’t listen to you, won’t listen to science because they want more stuff.
OPPENHEIMER: Listen, Chris, I’m not into name calling here. I think —
MATTHEWS: Well I am.
The hate is extraordinary. I wonder if Chris Matthews realizes that he just insulted a good portion of the USA populace that is skeptical about AGW?
And, with a salary of $5 million, I wonder how much “stuff” Chris Matthews has compared to the average viewer he foams to.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Well, folks have been asking me about my autobiography. It’s not done. Dunno what to say except that writing about my life is a long and slow task, partly because of the variety in my life, partly because there’s no surprises ’cause I’ve heard the whole thing so it gets boring at times, and mostly because far too often my monkey-mind sees something shiny and goes haring off after it, leaving autobiographical scribing for a future date.
So anyhow, to fill in the time until the autobiography is finished, here’s part of the story of my looney life. This was something that occurred back in 1984, and it has nothing to do with weather or climate at all. A friend and I had been hired to go to Fiji, with my lovely ex-fiancee of over 30 years now, to install a blast freezer on a beautiful 60-foot (18 metre) steel sailboat called the Askoy II. We just called her “the noble Askoy”, we lived on her while we did the work. My wife was ship’s nurse and cook, my friend and I built and installed the freezer.

Figure 1. The noble Askoy under sail off of Suva Harbour, 1984.
A few years after the crew and I finished installing the blast freezer and we left the boat, the Askoy was later bought by smugglers, used in some illegitimate ventures, and subsequently seized in Fiji. There she sat at the dock for a few years, eventually sinking and being refloated there, still tied to the dock. A friend of mine named Lindsay bought her at auction for a thousand bucks. He fixed her up and went to take her to his home, New Zealand. Just as he arrived, the engine died and she went up on the beach …


where she sat for years before being rescued by some Belgians. Turns out the boat was once owned for a few years by Jacques Brel, one of the few Belgian stars, and before that, she was the pride of the Royal Belgian Yacht Club, so a bunch of Belgican folks put together a foundation and salvaged her from the beach and took her back to Belgia, her ancestral home, as you see below

where she’s now been refitted and is almost ready for sea again. Lindsay’s story of the Askoy and the wreck and the subsequent salvage is here. … but dang it, the story of the noble Askoy, that’s another story, not the story I set out to tell. See, that’s the problem with writing an autobiography, you get side-tractored all over the dang place, it’s hard to hold a fixed course in that kind of weather. Anyhow, the noble Askoy now looks like this, hooray, she lives again,

and is slated to put to sea again in the New Year, 2013. The history of the Askoy is here, and of Harlow Jones, her erstwhile captain that I worked for at the time, and the Harlow Island Packet Trading Company … but there it is, I’m getting diverticulated again, that’s enough about a marvelous boat returned Lazarus-like from death on a distant beach. Here’s the story I started to tell you, a story of modern piracy, from the time when my gorgeous ex-fiancee and I were living on the noble Askoy and working on the blast freezer, anchored up just offshore from the Royal Suva Yacht Club.
==================================================
“Piracy?? … You boys don’t know what piracy is these days …”
I was in a group of sailors sitting in the bar at the Royal Suva Yacht Club, some of us from the Askoy crew and some off other boats, watching one of those lovely Fijian sunsets and talking over stories we’d heard about recent acts of piracy — yachts lost in the Southern Philippines, Vietnamese boat people savaged by Thai ‘fishermen’, rape and murder in the Straits of Singapore. This was back in the eighties, before the Somalis pretty much got a lock on that particular sector of the black economy.
Old Bill sat next to the group of us, about six beers into his usual evening. Bill was an Englishman, who usually bored everyone with his highly doubtful story that he was married to Samoan royalty. He must have been listening in on our conversation, because he said “I had the bad luck to find out about modern piracy. You think it’s all pistols and eye patches? Well, that was in the old days. Modern piracy’s different, let me tell you.”
We waited for him to ‘tell us’, but he just sat quietly looking at the bar. After a while, the message got through, and we asked Waisaki to bring him another beer. “Better make it a Black Russian,” Bill said. Waisaki brought the Black Russian, smiled, didn’t say anything, just listening to the story. Bill drank it in one swallow. “Black Russians lubricate the throat, y’know. Medical fact … now, where was I?”
“Modern piracy.”
“Oh, yes. Well, this all started when I was fishing up in Samoa. Tuna fishing on my own boat, as sweet a boat as you might ever want to see. Fifty-six foot long, all the modern gear. Name of the ‘White Star’. I was making good money fishing it, I was sitting pretty. Fridays, I would come back into Apia, spend the weekend with my young wife. Did I ever tell you I was married to Samoan Royalty?”
We allowed that yes, he had indeed told us that.
“They must have been watching me and knew my schedule, because one Monday morning, I came down to the docks, and my beautiful boat was gone! … Gone, dammit! When I asked around, some people said that three guys had come down on Friday night, gone on board, started it up, and drove it out of the harbor.
“I called the authorities, we put the word out, I even hired a helicopter, but that was a thousand bucks an hour for nothing. I was furious, all my money was tied up in that boat, gone …”
The word “gone” reminded him of his glass, and he looked at it until we signaled to Waisaki to fill it up again. Waisaki smiled. “Make it a double,” Bill said. When it came, he drank it in one swallow … “Where was I?”
“Gone.”
“No I wasn’t, I was telling a story.”
“Modern piracy.”
“Oh, right. Well, we didn’t find the boat. I was in a blue funk. Then, about three weeks later, I flew from Samoa to Fiji on some business, and damned if the ‘White Star’ wasn’t sitting at the dock in Suva, looking pretty run down. I went to the police, filled out the forms, and had the boat impounded.”
“What luck!”, someone said, “did you get it back?”
“I’m coming to that. The guys on board claimed to be the real owners of the boat … said they had a Bill of Sale from me, with what they claimed was my signature at the bottom. Bunch of damned forgers, they were. So I filed a complaint and took ‘em to court. The court said the calendar was crowded, it would be a couple of weeks until the case would be heard, so they put a guard on the boat and we all settled down to wait.”
“Who were these guys?”
“Well, they claimed that they were part of some corporation called ‘Deep Sea Limited’, out of Australia.”
“Couldn’t you prove it wasn’t your signature on the Bill of Sale?”
“I figured I might, but I talked to a barrister and found out how that one goes. You get an expert to say it isn’t your signature, they get two experts to say it is, you get three experts, they get four … it goes on forever.” The word ‘forever’ seemed to send him into a brown study … or perhaps it was a Black study, so we gave Waisaki the high sign again. “Make it two doubles,” Bill said. I doubted very much if one of them was for any of us. He drank the first one in a single swallow. … “Where was I?”
“Signatures.”
“Right … Turned out the signature didn’t mean a damned thing anyhow, ‘cause one morning I was driving down the hill into Suva, you know the road by the old cemetery with the view of the harbor, and I saw the ‘White Star’ heading out the channel past the wreck of the old ‘Nam Hai’ … sonsabitches had gotten the guard drunk, and made off with my boat again. I drove like hell over to the Fiji Navy Base. The Commander got their boat fired up, guys were running all around, the Commander said ‘How fast does your boat go?’ I said ‘Eleven knots’ … all the activity died down. ‘Let’s go, they’re getting away,’ I shouted. The Commander said ‘Our fastest boat only does 10 knots …’”
“A trifle slow for a stern chase,” I commented.
“Modern piracy,” Bill said, and drank down the second double.
“What did you do?” There was another long pause, and another nod to Waisaki … “Make it a pitcher,” he said, “saves trouble in the long run.” Waisaki brought the pitcher of Black Russians and smiled, a big easy knowing Fijian kind of smile. He’d heard all of Bill’s stories more than once. “Where was I?” Bill asked.
“Moving a little bit slow to catch the boat.”
“Oh yes. Well, they had let slip that the ‘Deep Sea Limited’ corporation was based out of Brisbane. I’d be buggered if I’d let them get away with it, and the boat was worth about two hundred thousand dollars, so I flew down to Oz, and started searching the harbors. Before too long, a little harbor north of Brisbane, bingo, there she was. Repainted, with a different name, but the same boat, same hull number welded over the bulkhead. I went down to the Australian authorities, swore out a complaint, and had the boat impounded again.
“Just like in Fiji, the Aussies told me that the court calendar was a bit crowded … only the Aussies said that it would be fourteen months before they could hear my case, guess there’sa lotta pirates in Australia. Anyhow, they put a guard on the boat, and said that the two parties to the case had to share the cost of the guard. And the Australians had a real guard service, not another alky like in Fiji.”
“How much did that cost?”
“Fourteen hundred Australian a month.”
“Not cheap, but I guess it’s worth it. So what happened?”
“Well, nothing’s happened yet, that was all only seven months ago … no, no, something has happened. The goddam corporation filed for bankruptcy. They said that I had tied up their only asset, that they had no money … of course it was all a scam to get out of paying for the guard. So now, I’ve either got to drop the case, or pay for the guard by myself, fourteen hundred a month … I’ll be bankrupt for real myself before the goddamn case even gets to court, and if I can’t pay for the guard service, then the case is dropped and I’ve lost my boat. Now that, boys, is what I call modern piracy. No AK-47 machine guns, no eye patches, no rape and pillage, no walking the plank … just courts and writs and signatures and impoundments and guards and you get a bill from the pirates for fourteen hundred a month to guard your own damn boat … real modern, all right.”
By this time, we had all started helping ourselves to Black Russians from the pitcher, and we were young and full of fire, so we started to figure out how we might be able to help old Bill get his boat back. He assured us that yes, the Australian Navy definitely did have boats that would do more than eleven knots, so no, we couldn’t just drive the boat away. However, he had a complicated plan that involved getting the boat out of the harbor and then painting it at sea, and using some plywood to make a false superstructure which might pass inspection from a distance, and sailing it back to Samoa where his relatives in the Government would keep the boat safe … but by that time, the velvety tropical russian blackness had started to close in around everyone’s brain, and the rest of the evening is unfortunately lost to history.
In the morning we all went back to our boats or our jobs or both. The plan to save the ‘White Star’ from the modern pirates remained, though, and it was discussed with old Bill, and improved on for a few days. But then new interests came up, and it gradually faded, and eventually was not heard of again.
And that might have been the end of it, except that it was such a good story to tell.
I told people about the modern pirates with their writs and their court cases on various occasions, and one day a few years later in the ’90s, through a series of misunderstandings and coincidences I chanced to be sitting once again in the very same bar of the Royal Suva Yacht Club. Waisaki was still behind the counter. There I met an interesting man and we got to talking about piracy back in the ’80s.
“The best story about piracy I’ve heard was the story of old Bill and the ‘White Star’,” I said.
“Yeah, I heard all about that,” he said.
“Oh, you heard the story?”
“I knew Bill,” he said. “In the end, the whole thing drove the corporation bankrupt.”
“Of course, that was all a scam,” I said.
“Yes, that was finally proved in court,” he said.
“Oh, it finally went to trial?” I asked. “Did he get his boat back?”
“Whose boat?”
“Old Bill’s boat. The ‘White Star’.”
There was a long pause, and then in a slightly incredulous tone of voice he said “Old Bill’s boat?” I nodded assent.
“What’re you talking about? Bill never owned that boat in his life!”, he said scornfully. “The ‘White Star’ belonged to three Australian farmers who’d had a good year and figured they would buy a boat. But the poor buggers didn’t know anything about fishing, so they set up a corporation to fish it, looked around for somebody to run it for them, and had the bad luck to find old Bill.
“He took the lease on the boat all right, ran it up to Samoa, and then he had a Bill of Sale made out and forged the signatures on it. When they heard about it, they went to the Samoan authorities, but the Samoans just laughed. Did he tell ever you he was married to Samoan royalty? Turns out he was. He used his connections to hold on to the boat. In desperation, they finally had to steal it themselves, and he chased those poor farmers around half the Pacific trying to steal it back again. He knew that if he could just get it back to Samoa, he and his relatives would make sure that it would never be lost again. I even heard rumors at one point that he’d recruited a bunch of young studs with more balls than brains, he’d conned them with some story, the fools were going to go down to Australia and help him steal the boat away from the Australian courts, but I guess that never came to anything …”
Since his tale was in full spate, I considered it an act of mercy not to increase the burden of his store of knowledge on that particular point … he continued:
“In the end, the farmers almost lost the court battle when Bill came up with two bullshit experts to claim that the signatures on the Bill of Sale were real. The case went right down to the wire before the farmers won, and even then all they got was their own boat back, never mind all the time and money they had lost, and their corporation bankrupt … yeah, you’re right, that is about the best story of modern piracy that I’ve heard.” We both laughed. His laugh was somewhat more hearty than mine. I didn’t press the subject after that, and in a bit he left the bar.
I sat there in the lovely Fijian warmth … I thought about all of that for a while as I watched the sunset … asked Waisaki to bring a couple of Black Russians. He brought the drinks … smiled … didn’t say a word. He’d heard all the stories. I lifted the glass, and I drank one of the Black Russians straight down in one swallow as a toast, and then sat and nursed the other one until the bar closed, gazing out over the night-time harbour toward the mooring spot where my love and I had once lived and worked with Harlow and the crew on the noble Askoy.
w.
PS—Of course, the South Pacific being a tiny place in some ways, it was fated that I would run into old Bill again, when he managed to sink an sixty foot (18 m) barge in Lautoka Harbour in Fiji, and my friend and I had to get out the scuba tanks and the underwater welding gear and go down and refloat it from where it was sitting, 30 feet (9 m) down on the bottom of the briny blue … but again, that’s another story, and I’m out of Black Russians.
Bill was a classic character of the South Pacific, though, and a con artist through and through. A friend of Bill’s once told me “Most con artists, their problem is they can tell you a story that is so good, so well crafted, that you’ll believe it without question. But Bill’s worse than that, he’s got it so bad he can’t escape—that poor boy tells his stories so damn well that he’s ended up believing all of them himself”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading financial daily Handelsblatt here writes that the Spanish Andasol 3 parabolic solar power generation plant in Spain “is producing foremost one thing: losses“.
The Andasol 3 solar power station is owned by a consortium of German power companies RWE, Rheinenergie and Stadtwerke Munich and is located in the Spanish province of Granada. When the first of its kind (Andasol 1) was built in 2009, the technology was hailed as a model to the world on how solar energy could successfully replace fossil fuels. US president Barack Obama said Spain was the way to go in terms of energy policy.
And when Andasol 3 went online in 2011, Stadtwerke München director Kurt Mühlhäuser boasted:
Andasol 3 is the the best example that we have to achieve the transition to renewable energies at the European level.”
According to Wikipedia, Andasol 3 was completed at a cost of 315 million euros and generates approximately 165 GW-hr each per year. The plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can generate electricity even when the sun isn’t shining. The site has an annual direct insolation of 2200 kWh/m² per year.
But today the Handelsblatt writes the plant is losing money and cannot operate profitably. Stadtwerke München has had to write off 64 million euros, Rheinenergie 17 million, and RWE has admitted that the write-offs will be “considerable”.
Corporate lawyers to the rescue
The losses stem from the Spanish goverment rolling back subsidies to green energies as the country reels from its debt crisis. The Handelsblatt writes that the three German companies have sent over their lawyers “who are suing against the changed subsidy rules in Spain“. Now that the guaranteed feed-in tariffs are no longer guaranteed and in fact will no longer be paid, green energies are no longer able to operate profitably.
Solar energy was always only possible with generous subsidies from the state. During the boom years more than 13 billion euros flowed into renewable energies in Spain thanks to generous subsisidies by the state, the Handelsblatt writes. But now the solar gold rush days are over. The collapse is unstoppable.
All three German investor companies involved in Andasol 3 blame the scale back in Spanish subsidies for the losses. The Handelsblatt writes that the legal wrangling will persist for years as green energy investors sue the Spanish government.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s and Weatherbell Analytics’ latest Saturday Summary brings us some interesting climate and weather details, along with some well-deserved harsh words for the desperate global warming alarmists as they get nuttier and nuttier as the cold gets more intense.
Joe says, “It’s incredible watching these people making up excuses. […] It’s astounding how I’m hearing these things. […] Just shows you what they don’t know.”
Here are a couple of the highlights. Most of the global land-masses for February are colder than normal (see 1:40 mark). February 2014 global temperature measured by NCEP is 0.10 °C below normal:

At the 3:59 mark, Ryan Maue’s chart from NCEP shows that global temperatures have been dropping over the last 5 years:

Joe Bastardi: “Unmistakable trend, down with the temperatures.”
As far as March goes for the USA, it looks like the deep freeze is set to continue and could be the coldest in over 50 years.
By now we suspect the global warmist alarmists have pretty much written off this winter and surely now have their eyes set on the coming spring…tornado season.

"You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva. But then, who even knew that frogs could play electronic games? So let’s start with that. Alexis C. Noel, a Ph. D. student in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, and her supervisor, David L. Hu, were watching a viral YouTube video in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an   game. It appears to be winning. They started wondering how  —   in reality  —   frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them, and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying. “It’s been an adventure ever since,” Ms. Noel said. First, the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye, requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot   video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta. Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue. Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university. “I needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva,” she said. With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction, the viscosity  —   or stickiness  —   of the saliva, and the softness of the tongue tissue, they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on. What they found was that frog saliva, which is normally 50, 000 times stickier than human saliva, flows freely when it hits an insect. That makes the saliva a   fluid, which means that the speed at which it flows (to be precise, its shear rate) changes how viscous it is. In the case of frog saliva, the faster it is forced to flow, the looser it gets. When the frog tongue hits a cricket, the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice. By the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back, in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack, the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket. There is one more step. The frog has to get the cricket unstuck and into its stomach. What helps here is that frog swallowing involves retracting its  eyeballs  —   so violently that it loosens up the saliva again. The researchers published their findings in Royal Society Interface. Dr. Hu said the detailed understanding of how the process worked had obvious applications for the growing field of soft robots made of very flexible materials. Not that they will have tongues, but they may need to grab and release  —   who knows what  —   with appendages more like tongues than metal claws. Ms. Noel said her research was “all about how you grab things with very soft surfaces. ” She is also studying cat tongues, for instance. They are covered in tiny little curved spikes, like claws, which, oddly enough, are very good at detangling snarls in fur."
"**With up to 1.4 million people in line to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales in the months ahead, officials say it will be one of the biggest health programmes ever mounted.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe for use.
But how will it be rolled out?
Preparations in Wales started in June and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
To start with, everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
Here we ask those behind the rollout what we should expect.
There could well be seven different vaccines, eventually.
The first available is the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTec. The UK government has bought 40 million doses.
Each person getting this vaccine will need two doses, three weeks apart. Wales will get a share of around 4.8% based on its population.
The next will be the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and there will be many more doses of this available, with the UK government having ordered 100 million doses.
The mRNA vaccine has to be stored at -75 C and also transported at that sub-zero temperature to the central locations where it will be used.
There may be some transportation possible at normal refrigerated temperature, which would enable it to be taken to care homes, but otherwise it will require those on the priority list to get to special vaccination centres.
The vaccines - in nearly 1,000 doses per package - have to be used within five days once opened. And the thawing and preparation process can take up to five days from when they arrive.
""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer and a system in place to offer them,"" said Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales.
""Some will be able to travel but some we would want to stay where they are - a care home for example. If we can solve that problem of transporting the vaccine but when the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine comes online, that's a vaccine which we store in the fridge, we can move it around and it lasts six months.""
Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be among the first to receive it. The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority, based on advice form the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).
The order of priority is set to be:
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
For context, around 900,000 flu vaccines were given over a period of 10 to 12 weeks last year - there are 1.4 million in the priority groups for the Covid vaccines.
""Although more complex because community locations are being used and the logistics with the vaccine, if we can match volume of delivery that we achieve with flu, then it will mean we will be able to roll out as quickly as possible,"" said Dr Roberts.
You will be told.
In the Cardiff and Vale health board, for example, Fiona Kinghorn, executive director for public health, said: ""We are already planning how we might vaccinate those in sequence, and different groups at the same time, and we'll call them, so when we are ready to vaccinate, they will receive a letter, and then in Cardiff and Vale, they will be able to ring our booking centre and book an appointment that is convenient for them.""
Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be kept a very low temperatures.
Cardiff and Vale health board has already said its mass vaccination centres will be at Splott and at leisure centres in Pentwyn and Barry.
Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken.
Gill Richardson, chief adviser to the chief medical officer, said: ""It's been an incredible logistical exercise - we tested our pharmaceutical logistics colleagues but they've worked tirelessly to ensure there's an effective and safe vaccine across Wales.
""The vaccine can't be transported once it's diluted, it has to be used on the site. This is a vaccine that needs to be made up. It's not like the flu vaccine, where it comes ready-made and in single doses. It will be in vials which can serve five doses and it will be delivered so it can be used at those mass centres.""
Health officials would like to see ""thousands rather than hundreds"" vaccinated in the first few weeks. It's likely those vulnerable and shielded people and those with chronic conditions, who would normally get the flu vaccine, will also be slotted in too as it is rolled down the age groups.
""It's on the scale of the smallpox vaccination campaign [in the 1960s],"" said Dr Richardson.
There is hope that the take-up will be at least 75%.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated though, according to the Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Frank Atherton.
""It's fantastic news that we're going to be able to be starting this as soon as next week but everything else depends on when we get stocks and how quickly we can start to roll it out.""
There is a balancing act in staffing the programme from within the NHS, to ensure not too many people are taken away from where they are needed.
In the early stages, those who are already registered to vaccinate - with oversight by senior pharmacists and specialists - will be used to administer the vaccine.
More people, including those that have not administered vaccines before, will be trained up in the coming months.
Health boards are already recruiting retired nurses, midwives, pharmacists and therapists to train up.
Those being given the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine will receive two doses, three weeks apart.
But the effectiveness of the vaccines will be studied to determine what form of immunity the vaccine gives and how long it might last.
That in future could determine whether people need to be vaccinated again in future. The different vaccines might well have different characteristics on this.
But Dr Richardson said they offered a ""fantastic message of hope""
Public health experts say you will still need to keep to guidelines around social distancing, hand-washing and using masks. Not everyone will be able to have vaccine and certainly not in the first phase. It will take some time to get back to normal.
""While vaccines are part of the answer, they are not the whole part"", said Swansea Bay health board's public health director Keith Reid.
He is worried that people might think ""we are all saved and this will all soon be over"".
You will not be able to mix and match between the vaccines - once you have received the first dose you must stick to it.
It is also not recommended you get the jab within 28 days of testing positive or from when you first have onset of Covid symptoms.
Beyond that, it is worth noting that previous exposure to Covid will not affect your eligibility for the vaccine or position within the priority list."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"ISTANBUL  —   Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday, in what constitutes one of Turkey’s largest operations against the jihadist group on the country’s soil. Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day. At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process, according to Anadolu. The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer’s failed coup, and on members of the country’s political opposition. More than 130, 000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts, according to government data. Sunday’s raids were the latest salvo in a   conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the early years of the Syrian revolution, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria, where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar  . But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria, where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab. Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014, most recently in the early hours of this year, when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city. The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, that killed more than 100 people, and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul’s main airport last summer. This weekend’s raids occurred across an unusually wide area, with suspects seized in 18 provinces. The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police, who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat, and an analyst who focuses on Turkey for Carnegie Europe, a think tank. But the detentions may not necessarily lead to court cases. “Over all, Turkey’s efforts to combat the influence and network of the Islamic State at home is still handicapped by discrepancies between the different arms of the Turkish state,” Mr. Ulgen said. “An effort led by law enforcement is sometimes handicapped by the decisions of the Turkish judiciary, which as we have seen in the recent past has let go people associated with the Islamic State. ” Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey and a critic of the Turkish government, also questioned the effectiveness of such a large raid, which he argued could overwhelm the capacity of the counterterrorism police. Officers may not be able to properly handle the paperwork, interrogations and bureaucracy associated with processing more than 50 suspects, said Dr. Yayla, who headed counterterrorism operations in a southeast Turkish province from 2010 to 2012. “It is impossible to process that many terrorists in one operation,” said Dr. Yayla, who now lives in the United States, and who began to publicly criticize the Turkish government after his teenage son was jailed on suspicion of a connection to the coup attempt."

A Great Freeze Over the Great Lakes
Ice cover on North America’s Great Lakes reached 88 percent in mid-February 2014—levels not observed since 1994.

Photo: NASA
The average maximum ice extent since 1973 is just over 50 percent. It has surpassed 80 percent just five times in four decades. The lowest average ice extent occurred in 2002, when only 9.5 percent of the lakes froze.
The image above shows the Great Lakes in natural color in the early afternoon, when ice covered 80.3 percent of the lakes, according to NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.

“Persistently low temperatures across the Great Lakes region are responsible for the increased areal coverage of the ice,” said Nathan Kurtz, cryospheric scientist NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Cold air and winds remove heat from the fresh water until it reaches the freezing point, at which point ice begins to form on the surface. “Low temperatures are the dominant mechanism for thickening the ice, but secondary factors like clouds, snow, and wind also play a role.”
“We had an early ice season this year, owing to cold temperatures in the fall and early winter,” added George Leshkevich of NOAA’s Great Lakes lab. “Ice was reported on bays and harbors of the Great Lakes as early as the end of November, as opposed to the normal timing of mid-December.”
The frozen lakes have implications well beyond the water surface and the winter. Extensive ice cover on the Great Lakes can change the patterns and amounts of the famous “lake effect” snowfall in the region, explained Walt Meier, a cryospheric scientist at NASA Goddard. When the lakes are mostly ice free, cold west or north winds blow over the warmer water, pick up moisture, and then drop snow on the lee side of the lakes (usually eastern and southern shores). When the lakes freeze, the effect generally shuts down. However, the region is still receiving a fair amount of snow this winter due to other weather patterns, Meier noted.
Lake levels could be affected in the summer. Winter ice cover generally reduces evaporation during winter months. If that turns out to be the case in 2014, it would be “good news for local water supplies, as well as for shipping and recreational use,” Meier said.
A 2012 study published in the Journal of Climate by scientists from NOAA’s Great Lakes lab found that winter ice cover on Lake Superior decreased 79 percent from 1973 to 2010. The study also showed that ice cover on the lakes is highly variable and difficult to predict.

Donald Trump expressed interest in New Zealand’s gun buyback scheme during his meeting with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern […] a conversation around our buyback […]the work that we had done to remove military style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles […] Ardern told reporters. […] during their ‘pull-aside’ discussion […], which Ardern described as “ **perfectly productive”.**



If you cut through all the jibber-jabber and useless waffle about President Trump politely showing an interest in PTPM Ardern’s gun “buyback” scheme, we need to ask what exactly Jacinda achieved for New Zealand? The answer, of course, is NOTHING!



We didn’t send her over there to womble on about her useless pet project the Christchurch Call, or to do a Greta Thunberg lecturing the President about the Fake Climate Emergency, or even to talk to him about how she is doing her best to disarm New Zealand’s law-abiding population. Her job was to secure a steel deal for New Zealand by getting the tariffs removed and to secure a Free Trade Agreement.



Her “Pull-aside” meeting was much like the contraceptive “Pull-out” method. Completely unsatisfactory and rarely successful.



[…]The meeting has been highly anticipated, not only because the New Zealand Prime Minister has been painted as an [**anti-Trump** figure](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11994876), but also because the Herald understands that it was **Trump who** **sought the** **meeting** and was particularly interested in meeting Ardern in person.



Well, how do you like them apples? The meeting didn’t happen because Jacinda Ardern had asked for it in order to try to advance New Zealand’s interests. The meeting only happened because Trump was curious about the PM who was handed her job by a minor party and who has shown no diplomacy whatsoever, calling him orange and a professional arsehole as well as joining in a march against him being democratically elected by the American people. If I were he, I would want to have a closer look at a **political clown** too.



I bet he was fascinated to hear her rabbit on about how she has made New Zealand safe from terror attacks by forcibly confiscating evil looking guns from law abiding citizens. I bet he stared with morbid curiosity while she told him how her Christchurch call would stop video of terror attacks being shared online. I wonder what he was thinking while listening to her? I would have been thinking, “My god, this woman is nuts! She is focused on stopping people watching a terror attack instead of being focused on stopping it happening in the first place.”



As for Jacinda herself the spin she put on her **perfectly pathetic** pull-aside meeting with Trump was that he is supportive of the Christchurch call but will not be signing up to it. That is like saying that I am supportive of the Labour party but will not be voting for them!



Seriously, who does she think she is kidding? I have some new shoes for her because she has earned them.

“Y’know you’re soaking in it; global warming that is”



 _“But Madge, it’s water. Global warming is carbon, or something.”_



“Carbon dioxide? No; it’s not. It’s dihydrogen monoxide. That’s just a fancy way of saying water. Water is responsible for the greenhouse effect on our little planet, anywhere from seventy to ninety five percent of all our wonderful warming is due to water, otherwise the planet would be unliveable, and we’d freeze to death. Water vapour actually; it’s a gas and makes up to four percent of our atmosphere; all the other warming gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and fluorocarbons, all of them combined only make up one-tenth of one percent.”



 _“Well, then why is everybody belting on about carbon?”_



“Beats me, I guess it would be completely stupid if ninety-seven percent of scientists droned on about reducing water emissions. They’d sound a right bunch of drongoes. Almost all water vapour is naturally produced by evaporation. Humans only contribute an extremely tiny amount: just a wee bit from irrigation, y’know like watering the lawn, and another bit from all our industrial activity and burning fossil fuels and what-not, but that bit’s even tinier than the irrigation bit. In total we make an awfully small impact on the amount of water vapour around us, less than one-hundredth of it.”



 _“But water evaporation makes clouds eventually, that’s what we learned at school, and somebody said they’re not much fun, they block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.”_



“They do block the sun, they have high albedo”…



 _“Like my Murray?”_



“Not exactly; albedo is the ability to reflect solar radiation back to space, reducing the energy available to warm us here on Earth.”



 _“I get it – if the world warms up more evaporation happens, more clouds are formed and they cool us down again, like setting a thermostat. Madge, that’s so simple I don’t believe your water story. If it’s true then why aren’t scientists saying so?”_



“They are, even the IPCC says ‘ **Water vapour is the most abundant and important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere**. **However, human activities have only a small direct influence on the amount of atmospheric water vapour**.’ That’s straight from a chapter called The Physical Science Basis.”



 _“But what do they say about clouds?”_



“They fudge it; they say they don’t know”



 _“You’re joking. Madge, you’re pulling my leg, stop it!”_



“Nope. True story. Of course they don’t come right out and say y’know ‘we haven’t got a bloody clue’, they say it in their jargon – here, look at this:



“The modelling of cloud processes and feedbacks provides a striking example of the irregular pace of progress in climate science. Representation of clouds may constitute the area in which atmospheric models have been modified most continuously to take into account increasingly complex physical processes.”



 _“Well, blow me down with a feather, that does sound like a fancy way of them pretending they haven’t got a bloody clue_.



“ _Cough, ‘irregular pace’…too ‘complex’, it’s not complex, it’s so simple even I can understand it; more water, more clouds, more cooling, and if the models are so correct then why the hell do they have to keep continuously modifying them? They told us the science was settled! Cripes, my kids went on school-strike for that load of rubbish? I’m grumpy now.”_



“Don’t get grumpy, get even. Just ask the kids to tell you, since they’re so clued-up, what the most powerful and abundant greenhouse gas is, and tell them every time they get the answer wrong you’re confiscating their phones for an hour, that’ll smarten them up real quick, and calm them down a bit.”



 _“Madge, you’re a genius.”_



“I know.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt write here how German online flagship daily Die Welt here published an alarming article about Antarctic sea ice melt some two weeks ago. Die Welt wrote:
Giant Antarctic glacier melting unstoppably
The Pine Island Glacier in the Antarctic is melting irreversibly according to a study. Scientists expect that sea level will rise enormously because of the melting of this glacier. […] International scientists from the University of Grenoble expect the shrinking glacier could allow the sea level to rise 1 centimeter in 20 years. The shrinking of the glacier is ‘irreversible’. The glacier is located in western Antarctica. Since the beginning of this century it has gotten about 10 km shorter, the scientists of the Institute for Glacier Research and Geophysics write. The melting has accelerated over the last decades. On average for the years 1992 to 2011 20 billion tonnes of ice have melted. In total until today the western Antarctic ice sheet has reduced about 20 percent.”
All of course this sounds quite dramatic and alarming.
But unfortunately, the media neglect to mention another study appearing in the Journal of Geophysical Research. In it a team of scientists led by L.H. Beem of the University of California in Santa Cruz studied another Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) glacier: the Whillans ice stream Ice Plain. Much to their surprise, the scientists discovered that the melting of the glacier actually had decelerated over the last 50 years.
Die Welt also could have checked another study from the Geophysical Research Letters from October 2013 titled: “A 308 year record of climate variability in West Antarctica”. The study’s authors discovered that the warming rate seen at the Pine island Glacier since 1950 was nothing different from what had been observed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Elizabeth Thomas told the press:
“The new record captures climate variability in this globally important region and suggests that the warming observed here since the 1950s is not the largest in the past 300 years.”
The abstract states:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The record shows that this region has warmed since the late 1950s, at a similar magnitude to that observed in the Antarctic Peninsula and central West Antarctica; however, this warming trend is not unique. More dramatic isotopic warming (and cooling) trends occurred in the mid-nineteenth and eighteenth centuries, suggesting that at present, the effect of anthropogenic climate drivers at this location has not exceeded the natural range of climate variability in the context of the past ~300 years.”
In February 2014 yet another study led by Alexandra Witus of Rice University appearing in the Quaternary Science Reviews found three episodes where ice had melted rapidly at the Pine Island Glacier over the last 10,000 years. In summary: the melt that has taken place over the last decades at the WAIS is nothing new, and it even now appears to be decelerating.
So what does all this say about the wild claims made by Die Welt that a “dramatic” ice melt is taking place at the Pine Island Glacier, i.e. 20 billion cubic meters per year resulting in a 20% ice mass reduction? Die kalte Sonne checks the numbers, which I’ve corrected using figures from Wikipedia:
1) West Antarctica Ice Shelf (WAIS) has an estimated volume of 2.2 million cubic kilometers.
3) When 20 billion tonnes has melted every year over the last 20 years, it means a total of 400 billion cubic meters (400 cubic kilometers) has melted.
3) So what percent is 400 cubic km from the total of 2.2 million? It’s certainly not 20% – rather it is only 0.0182%. Less than the concentration of trace gas CO2 in our atmosphere!
We know that alarmists love to announce exaggerated disasters, but Die Welt really overdid it this time. Die Welt exaggerated the ice melt by a factor of 1100!

If you were expecting this to be a detailed post‐​mortem on the demise of the USA Freedom Act, you will be disappointed. As others have covered that ground, I want to focus on the consequences of the failure to rein in NSA to date, and what a failure to do so in 2015 will mean for this country.



In the absence of real reform, people and institutions at home and abroad are taking matters into their own hands. In America, the NSA’s overreach is changing the way we communicate with and relate to each other. In order to evade government surveillance, more and more Americans are employing encryption technology. 



The veritable explosion of new secure messaging apps like Surespot, OpenWhisper’s collaboration with WhatsApp, the development and deployment of open source anti‐​surveillance tools like Detekt, the creation of organizationally‐​sponsored “surveillance self‐​defense” guides, the push to universalize the https protocol, anti‐​surveillance book events featuring free encryption workshops— are manifestations of the rise of the personal encryption and pro‐​privacy digital resistance movement. Its political implications are clear: Americans, along with people around the world, increasingly see the United States government’s overreaching surveillance activities as a threat to be blocked.





The failure of the Congress and the courts to end the surveillance state is only fueling the growing resistance movement.



The federal government’s vacuum‐​cleaner approach to surveillance—manifested in Title II of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Amendments Act, and EO 12333—has backfired in these respects, and the emergence of this digital resistance movement is one result. Indeed, the existence and proliferation of social networks hold the potential to help this movement spread faster and to more of the general public than would have been possible in decades past. This is evidenced by the growing concern worldwide about governments’ ability to access reams of information about people’s lives with relative ease. **As onemeasure, compared to a year ago, 41% of online users in North America now avoid certain Internet sites and applications, 16% change who they communicate with, and 24% censor what they say online.** Those numbers, if anywhere close to accurate, are a major concern for democratic society.



But it’s unclear that the privacy technologies offered as solutions will prove effective over the long‐​term. In the ongoing cat‐​and‐​mouse game between digital defenders and surveillance practitioners, it will only be a matter of time before someone finds a way around today’s latest defenses, which will prompt the creation of fresh defenses. This very interaction can also chill freedom of expression and association. That is, one can imagine that every turn in this game, including each launch of a new counter‐​surveillance technology, will be another reminder to individuals that their digital transactions are potentially being monitored by a government they no longer trust—and why continued efforts to keep the government out are necessary.



Even if commercially available privacy technology proves capable of providing a genuine shield against warrantless or otherwise illegal surveillance by the United States government, it will remain a treatment for the symptom, not a cure for the underlying legal and constitutional malady.



In April 2014, a Harris poll of US adults showed that in response to the Snowden revelations, “Almost half of respondents (47%) said that they have changed their online behavior and think more carefully about where they go, what they say, and what they do online.” Set aside for a moment that _just the federal government’s collection of the data_ of innocent Americans is itself likely a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Harris poll is just one of numerous studies highlighting the collateral damage to American society and politics from NSA’s excesses: segments of our population are now fearful of even _associating_ with individuals or organizations executive branch officials deem controversial or suspicious. Nearly half of Americans say they have changed their online behavior out of a fear of what the federal government might do with their personal information. **The Constitution’s free association guarantee has been damaged by the Surveillance State’s very operation.**



Also at risk is the First Amendment’s guarantee of a free press able to investigate potential government abuses of power in the national security arena without reporters fearing that its communications are being monitored and potentially used to unmask sources.



We now live in an age where the federal government is willing to prosecute journalists in an effort to compel them to reveal their sources in national security leak cases. The most recent example is the Justice Department’s multi‐​year legal assault on _New York Times_ national security reporter James Risen. Even at the height of the Pentagon Papers case four decades ago, the Nixon administration did not go as far as the Bush 43 and Obama administrations have gone in trying to intimidate journalists into revealing their sources in national security leak cases. Since Snowden’s revelations in June 2013, the climate for journalists working issues like the NSA surveillance scandal has only become more hostile.



In the preface to his new book, @War, Shane Harris notes how the executive branch’s war on leakers meant that his sources



“…risked criminal prosecution in talking to me. The Obama administration has historically been hostile to government employees who share information with journalists. The Justice Department has prosecuted more people for disclosing classified information than all previous administrations combined. Simply put, it is a dangerous time to talk to journalists. And this risk extends to former government employees and military personnel. Several former intelligence officials have told me that within the past year they were explicitly told by the intelligence agencies where they’re still employed as contractors that they should stop talking to journalists if they want to continue doing business with the government.”



The failure of the Congress and the courts to end the surveillance state, despite the repeated efforts by a huge range of political and public interest actors to effect that change through the political process, is only fueling the growing resistance movement. Federal officials understand this, which is why they are trying—desperately and in the view of some, underhandedly—to shut down this digital resistance movement. This action/​reaction cycle is exactly what it appears to be: an escalating conflict between the American public and its government. Without comprehensive surveillance authority reforms (including a journalist “shield law” and ironclad whistleblower protections for Intelligence Community contractors) that are verifiable and enforceable, that conflict will only continue.

"Returning home on Saturday night after a dinner in Manhattan with some longtime friends, Gregory Locke boarded a No. 1 subway train and was confronted with an ugly sight. The car’s windows and posters were covered in   graffiti, according to accounts from Mr. Locke and another passenger in the car, Jared Nied. Messages like “Jews belong in the oven” and “destroy Israel, Heil Hitler,” had been written over subway maps, as shown by photographs taken on the train. Swastikas were drawn in black marker on the doors and windows. Mr. Locke, 27, a New York lawyer, said in a phone interview that his first reaction was shock, “especially once I realized how many instances of graffiti were on the train car. ” “But the shock quickly subsides and turns into a sort of a realistic horror,” he said. “You realize it’s appalling but it’s also not surprising at the same time. ” Neither man reported the graffiti to the police, and neither the New York Police Department nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had a record of any report. Mr. Nied, 36, was returning home from his work as a   around 7 p. m. and boarded the train at 42nd Street. He said in a phone interview that his reaction to the graffiti, which he noticed immediately, must have been written on his face, and he soon attracted the attention of another commuter. “There was a lady sitting across from me under the map, and she said, ‘Oh that’s absolutely horrible,’” he said. “‘Do you think there’s any way we can erase it? ’” Mr. Nied had many times used a Sharpie when he had meant to use a   marker, and he knew from experience that alcohol would work to erase the graffiti. “A light bulb went on, and I just asked, ‘Does anyone have hand sanitizer? ’” he said. Mr. Nied and several other commuters began to wipe away the graffiti, their actions captured in photographs taken by Mr. Locke, who wrote on Facebook about his experience. By late Sunday afternoon, more than 518, 000 people had reacted to the post on Facebook, and the post had been shared more than 354, 000 times. “I’ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purell,” Mr. Locke wrote. “Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone. ” Mr. Nied said that the episode had lasted less than five minutes and that the passengers were able to erase the graffiti before the train reached 96th Street. He returned a bottle of hand sanitizer to one of the riders, apologizing for having used most of it. “We sat down and glanced around at each other and settled back into the commute,” he said. Both men said they understood that there might be skepticism about their accounts. “I understand the criticism, but unfortunately, I don’t have an answer for it,” Mr. Locke said. “I would probably be suspicious, too, if I didn’t take the pictures. ” Detective Ahmed Nasser of the New York Police Department said that while the episode had not been reported on Saturday, other reports of   graffiti had been logged recently: A recycling container downtown was reportedly defaced with the words “Jews are a virus” in black ink in January, and swastikas were found etched on a northbound F train this month. A separate episode, in which a passenger on a B train saw that a swastika on an American flag had been transformed into a message of love, drew a comment from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday. On Saturday night, Mr. Nied sent a text to his wife, Jacquline, and to a friend with a photograph of the graffiti, but he did not consider the prospect that someone else might have taken photos. He said it had not even crossed his mind until more than an hour later, when his wife looked at her phone. “She said, ‘Dude, you’re going viral,’” he recalled. He added: “It was a very New York moment in that we all came together, we all teamed up, and then we settled back down. I don’t think any of those people really spoke, truth be told. Everyone kind of just did their jobs of being decent human beings. ”"
"

Earlier this month, I detailed at some length why claims about the purported economic harms of piracy, offered by supporters of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT-IP Act (PIPA), ought to be treated with much more skepticism than they generally get from journalists and policymakers.



My own view is that this ought to be rather secondary to the policy discussion: SOPA and PIPA would be ineffective mechanisms for addressing the problem, and a terrible idea for many other reasons, even if the numbers were exactly right. No matter how bad last season’s crops were, witch burnings are a poor policy response. Fortunately, legislators finally seem to be cottoning on to this: SOPA now appears to be on ice for the time being, and PIPA’s own sponsors are having second thoughts about mucking with the Internet’s Domain Name System. 



That said, I remain a bit amazed that it’s become an indisputable premise in Washington that there’s an enormous piracy problem, that it’s having a devastating impact on US content industries, and that _some_ kind of aggressive new legislation is needed _tout suite_ to stanch the bleeding. Despite the fact that the Government Accountability Office recently concluded that it is “difficult, if not impossible, to quantify the net effect of counterfeiting and piracy on the economy as a whole,” our legislative class has somehow determined that—among all the dire challenges now facing the United States— _this_ is an urgent priority. Obviously, there’s quite a lot of copyrighted material circulating on the Internet without authorization, and other things equal, one would like to see less of it.



But does the best available evidence show that this is inflicting such catastrophic economic harm—that it is depressing so much output, and destroying so many jobs—that Congress has no option but to Do Something immediately? Bearing the GAO’s warning in mind, the data we _do_ have doesn’t remotely seem to justify the DEFCON One rhetoric that now appears to be obligatory on the Hill.



The International Intellectual Property Alliance—a kind of meta‐​trade association for all the content industries, and a zealous prophet of the piracy apocalypse, released a report back in November meant to establish that copyright industries are so economically valuable that they merit more vigorous government protection. But it actually paints a picture of industries that, far from being “killed” by piracy, are _already_ weathering a harsh economic climate better than most, and have far outperformed the overall US economy through the current recession. The “core copyright industries” have, unsurprisingly, shed some jobs over the past few years, but again, compared with the rest of the economy, employment seems to have held relatively stable at a time when you might expect cash‐​strapped consumers to be turning to piracy to save money.



 **Decreasing creative output?**



Since the core function of copyright is to incentivize the production of creative works, it’s also worth looking for signs of declining output associated with filesharing. Empirically, it’s surprisingly hard to find an effect. Rather, a recent survey study by Felix Oberholzer‐​Gee of the Harvard Business School concluded that “data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers” from producing more works, at least in the US market.



So, for instance, Nielsen SoundScan data shows new album releases stood at 35,516 in 2000, peaked at 106,000 in 2008, and (amidst a general recession) fell back to mid‐​decade levels of about 75,000 for 2010. That’s against a general background of falling sales since 2004—mostly explained by factors unrelated to piracy—which finally seems to have reversed in 2011. The actual picture is probably somewhat better than that, because SoundScan data is markedly incomplete when it comes to the releases by indie artists who have benefited most from the rise of digital distribution.



If we look at movies, the numbers compiled by the industry statistics site Box Office Mojo show an average of 558 releases from American studios over the past decade, which rises to 578 if you focus on just the past five years. The average for the _previous_ decade—before illicit movie downloads were even an option on most people’s radar—is 472 releases per year. (As we learn from a recent Congressional Research Service report, it’s weirdly hard to detect a strong overall correlation between output and employment in the motion picture industry, which actually fell slightly from 1998 to 2008, even as profits and CEO pay soared. One reason is the growing trend in recent decades for “Hollywood” features to actually be produced in Canada or Australia.)



That’s all very nice, one might object, but wouldn’t these heartening numbers be _even higher_ if labels and studios could recapture some of the revenue lost to illicit downloads? Well, they surely _might_ —but it’s not nearly as clear as you’d think.



One reason is that they already _are_ recapturing much of that revenue through “complementary” purchases. As Oberholzer‐​Gee observes, recording industry numbers show large increases in concert revenues corresponding to the drop in recorded music sales. That suggests that, as people discover new artists by sampling downloaded albums online, they’re shifting consumption _within_ the sector to live performances. In other words, people have a roughly constant “music budget,” and what they don’t spend on the albums they’ve downloaded gets spent on seeing that new band they discovered. For the firms that specifically make their money from the sale of recordings, that may seem like cold comfort, but if we’re concerned with the _music_ industry as a whole, it’s a wash. Something similar might occur with respect to purchases of merchandise based on licensed film properties.



Another factor is that, notwithstanding projections of a “long tail” effect resulting from lower search and distribution costs in the digital era, most entertainment industries continue to operate on a “tournament” or “lottery” model, where a few hits generate jackpot revenues, sufficient to make up for losses on the majority of new products. Unsurprisingly, the most heavily pirated movies each year tend to be the ones that are also highly successful at the box office and in DVD sales, with similar patterns in album downloads. In other words, bleeding revenue to piracy is going to be a problem to the extent that your product is a hit, in a market where the core uncertainty about this crucial fact (at the time when the decision whether to greenlight production is made) looms a lot larger than the marginal loss from illicit downloads if you _are_ successful.



It’s a tricky but more or less tractable problem to estimate roughly how many full‐​time jobs you’ll need regionally to support one additional $150 million movie production next year. It’s a totally different question how aggregate sectoral employment in a volatile and evolving industry changes based on investor responses to a $150 million across‐​the‐​board drop in the size of the total film jackpot, especially given that arcane financial arrangements are one place Hollywood does show a genius for constantly adapting its business model. If you want to know how many people are getting laid off when McDonald’s revenues drop, it makes a difference whether it’s each of 13,000 franchises earning $100 less per year, or one franchise earning $1.3 million less, even though the total reduction is the same.



Finally, _more demand for content_ being captured by the content industries is not always the same thing as _demand for more content_ , in the sense of “a greater variety of output.” I noted earlier that the past few years have seen a significant spike in the number of movie titles released annually. But as the _Los Angeles Times_ reported in 2008, studio executives soon began complaining about a “glut” of new movies, many of which were targeted at the same demographics, and therefore cannibalizing their own audiences. As one executive suggested, that meant that (at least in a market dominated by a few huge distributors) releasing _fewer_ titles could yield higher profits—and, indeed, the number of titles released in the following two years dropped back to mid‐​decade levels.



The key point here is that shifting some portion of the pirate audience to some form of legal viewing doesn’t necessarily change this basic calculus, because there’s an upper bound to the number of hours most people are going to spend watching (say) racing movies, whether they’re paying for the privilege or not. Rising demand can just as easily, for instance, bid up star salaries for a fixed number of films.



 **Still seeking a real, quantifiable link**



The point here isn’t that piracy by American consumers is somehow completely independent from output or employment rates in the content industries—though, again, that’s not at all the same thing as the _overall US employment rate_. Obviously, at _some_ level it has to have some effect. But the link is, to use the technical economic term, _weirder_ than in many other sectors of the economy. In many industries, the relationship between consumer spending and job creation is _relatively_ straightforward. If demand for widgets or restaurant meals rises, satisfying that demand requires a roughly linear increase in widget factories and restaurants, in hiring of widget‐​makers and cooks and waiters, and in purchases of the raw material inputs for those goods. Distribution of copyrighted content—and in particular digital distribution over the Internet—is a bit more complicated, for precisely the same reason piracy is an issue: once the first copy of a work has been created, an unlimited number of additional units (of the digital product) can be produced at effectively zero cost.



Let’s imagine, implausibly, that a measure like SOPA _did_ manage to reduce online piracy by US consumers by some meaningful amount. A small portion of that reduction, the minority of downloads representing legal purchases displaced by file sharing, would translate into sales for the content industries. What form would these take? It seems reasonable to suppose that the majority of people who were previously getting their music and movies from The Pirate Bay are not typically lining up to buy shiny plastic discs at Wal‐​Mart. Rather, they’re probably disproportionately displacing _legal digital downloads_ from venues like iTunes and Amazon, or subscription services like Netflix and Spotify, which are pretty clearly where the overall market is quickly going anyway. (Apparently, literal thieves don’t even bother stealing physical media anymore.) For movies, there’s probably also some displacement of theatrical ticket sales, though as the theatrical experience is in many ways a distinct good, it’s hard to say how much substitution it’s reasonable to expect.



In the very short term, increased legal purchases of digital content wouldn’t seem likely to generate many additional jobs. If spending in the physical retail sector jumps 20 percent, shops need to hire more clerks, and their suppliers more manufacturing workers, to meet the increased demand. If spending in the iTunes store jumps 20 percent, Apple probably needs to pay a few bucks more for bandwidth and electricity, but basically everyone just gets to smile and pocket the extra profit. The jobs effects estimates we’re seeing tossed around, however, are coming from a 2007 study that would have had to employ, at the most recent, adjustments made several years before _that_ to the benchmark multipliers the Bureau of Economic Analysis developed in 2002.



Even leaving aside its many other problems, then, the job impact estimates in that study would have been largely based on legacy assumptions from a brick‐​and‐​mortar economy. (The loss estimates relied on would also, necessarily, fail to account for the recent rise of popular, legal streaming services that have likely lured many consumers back from the pirate market. There is, alas, no very good data here, but I’d wager Hulu and Netflix have done exponentially more to reduce piracy losses than enforcement crackdowns ever will.) In any event, you’d expect the most _immediate_ effect of consumer spending shifts from widgets and restaurants to digital downloads would be, if anything, fewer _net_ jobs. The output and employment effects, rather, would show up in the longer term as lower returns reduce incentives to produce new content—and hire the workers needed to support that production. For some of the reasons discussed above, though, empirically there’s just not much evidence for a dramatic effect of this kind.



No doubt piracy is costing the content industries _something_ —or they wouldn’t be throwing so much money at Congress in support of this kind of legislation. If we could wave a magic wand and have less piracy, obviously that would be good. But in the real world, where enforcement has direct costs to the taxpayer, regulation has costs on the industries it burdens, and the reduction in piracy they’re likely to produce is very small, it seems important to point out that the credible evidence for the _magnitude_ of the harm is fairly thin.



As a rough analogy, since anti‐​piracy crusaders are fond of equating filesharing with shoplifting: suppose the CEO of Wal‐​Mart came to Congress demanding a $50 million program to deploy FBI agents to frisk suspicious‐​looking teens in towns near Wal‐​Marts. A lawmaker might, without for one instant doubting that shoplifting is a bad thing, question whether this is really the optimal use of federal law enforcement resources. The CEO indignantly points out that shoplifting _kills one million adorable towheaded orphans_ each year. The proof is right here in this study by the Wal‐​Mart Institute for Anti‐​Shoplifting Studies. The study sources this dramatic claim to a newspaper article, which quotes the CEO of Wal‐​Mart asserting (on the basis of private data you can’t see) that shoplifting kills hundreds of orphans annually. And as a footnote explains, it seemed prudent to round up to a million. I wish this were _just_ a joke, but as readers of my previous post will recognize, that’s literally about the level of evidence we’re dealing with here.



In short, piracy is certainly one problem in a world filled with problems. But politicians and journalists seem to have been persuaded to take it largely on faith that it’s a uniquely dire and pressing problem that demands dramatic remedies with little time for deliberation. On the data available so far, though, reports of the death of the industry seem much exaggerated.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Emeritus Nils-Axel Mörner, one of Sweden’s most distinguished climate scientists, has published a paper in the now forbidden Pattern Recognition Physics journal (PRP). His paper warns that the earth may see little ice age conditions by 2030. No wonder the climate establishment mobilized to shut down the PRP special edition! The peer-review uproar is nothing but a diversion.
The paper, titled Planetary beat and solar-terrestrial responses, looks at the sun’s well-documented cyclical behavior and the mechanisms that could be driving solar cycles, which have a proven impact on the Earth’s climate. The paper’s abstract concludes:
The centennial changes between grand solar maxima and minima imply that we will soon be in a new solar minimum and, in analogy with past events, probably also in Little Ice Age climatic conditions.”
In the paper, Mörner also adds:
At around 2030–2050, we will be in a new grand minimum situation (as evidenced by a large number of authors: e.g. Mörner, 2010, 2011; Cionco and Compagnucci, 2012; Casey and Humlum, 2013; Salvador, 2013). The driving forces seem to be the planetary beat and its effects on the solar activity, and the effects of the solar wind upon the Earth (Fig. 6). During previous solar minima, the Earth experienced Little Ice Age climatic conditions. Therefore, we may once again experience such climatic conditions when the new grand minimum occurs.”
In the paper’s conclusion he reiterates the warning:
At the next solar minimum, to occur around 2030–2050, there might be a return to Little Ice Age climatic conditions (as was the case during the Dalton, Maunder and Spörer minima).”
Mörner’s paper looks at the sun’s impacts on the Earth’s climate through solar cycles, whose history has been reconstructed for the entire Holocene through the analysis of 10Be and 14C isotopes. The impacts of solar cycles on the Earth’s climate is very well documented. It is undeniable.
For example there’s a strong link between solar activity and European winters, see here. Also NoTricksZone recently listed over 120 recent papers showing that solar activity have a clear impact on the earth’s climate. The body of scientific literature out there is massive.
So what causes the sun to undergo cyclic changes? In his paper Mörner asks what could be driving the cyclic changes in the sun, and theorizes that it is the planetary motion and the gravitational forces exerted through the planets on the sun’s dynamic mass. The idea is not new, and there is a growing body of scientific literature that evidences it.
Mörner’s paper writes:



<!--

Solar activity changes with time in a cyclic pattern. The origin of those changes may be caused by planetary motion around the Sun, affecting the position of the Sun’s motion with respect to the centre of mass and subjecting the Sun to changes in angular momentum and gravitational tidal forces. […]
Abreu et al. (2012; cf. Steinhilber et al., 2007) were able to show that there is an “excellent spectral agreement between the planetary tidal effects acting on the tachocline and the solar magnetic activity”. This is illustrated in Fig. 3. It implies a benchmark in the planetary–solar research. The planetary hypothesis took an important step towards a planetary theory.”


Source: www.pattern-recogn-phys-2013.pdf
This is plausible because something connected to the sun has to be causing the sun’s cyclic activity. And what more obvious explanation could there be than the 8 planets (plus Pluto) orbiting around the sun? All planets exert a gravitational force on the sun that is hardly negligible. Mörner writes:
The multi-body interaction of the planetary motions on the Sun’s motion is so large that the Sun’s motion around the centre of mass is perturbed by up to about 1 solar radius. The planetary beat also includes the transfer of angular momentum and tidal forces.”
This all has an impact on the sun’s interior and hence its cycles.
Mörner is not alone in claiming we are headed for a low-solar-activity induced cooling. He joins a growing number of scientists who warn the earth should prepare for cooling, and not warming.
Nils-Axel Mörner completed his Ph.D at Stockholm University in Sweden with postdoctoral studies at Western University in London, Canada. He was the head of Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics at Stockholm University. He was an IPCC author and has published more than 500 papers in reputed journals and several books. He has presented some 550 papers at international conferences. He is a world expert on sea level changes.

How much pressure would it take before you would sell out your intellectual integrity? Those who are given responsibilities for developing and promoting sound public policy are subject to never‐​ending pressure by those in the political class to serve them rather than the public.



An extraordinarily well‐​researched and provocative paper has just been released, tracing how the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a major international organization, descended from promoting trade‐ and job‐​creation policies among the nations of the world to one that is supporting job‐​destroying tax cartels for the benefit of the high‐​tax countries. The paper, “Cartelizing Taxes: Understanding the OECD’s Campaign Against ‘Harmful Tax Competition,’ ” was clearly and interestingly written by law and economics scholar Andrew Morriss of the University of Alabama and Swedish economic researcher Lotta Moberg of George Mason University. The authors conducted many interviews and used primary and secondary sources to support their disturbing conclusions.



The paper documents how the OECD drifted from its original goals into an organization that is undercutting the rationale for its existence. Mr. Morriss states, “The puzzle we set out to explore is why the OECD, an organization devoted to promoting economic growth for much of its existence, would start promoting tax policies that reduce economic growth.” The paper shows that “central to the OECD critique of tax competition was the claim that attracting investment was an illegitimate criterion for evaluating tax policy, even though creating an attractive investment climate was treated as a legitimate goal in other policy areas by the OECD.” The authors note, “The most objectionable feature of the OECD’s expansion of its mission was its effort to impose its standards on jurisdictions that had no voice in the creation of the standards through the blacklist.” Again, Mr. Morriss comments: “There is something particularly galling about people sitting in Paris, getting hefty tax‐​free salaries [also true of those working for the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other international organizations] paid by the rest of us, spending their time telling the rest of the world to pay higher taxes.” Finally, perhaps most frightening of all, as Ms. Moberg notes, “The ongoing project against tax competition can be seen in a larger perspective of international organizations moving into areas of international regulation, if not by legal means then by peer pressure and norm setting.”



What we are seeing is the growth of international, non‐​elected bureaucracies that hack away at our liberties and economic freedoms, destroying jobs and opportunity, all in the name of redistributionist and “tax‐​fairness” schemes. In the case of the OECD, the United States is funding approximately a quarter of its budget. Citizens ought to be asking members of Congress why their precious taxpayer dollars are being wasted on an organization that is now promoting and mandating destructive economic policies.



But international organizations aren’t the only ones that are destroying jobs and economic opportunity in the name of tax fairness. The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service are considering regulations that could cost Americans millions of jobs. One of the regulations being developed stems from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was passed by Congress in 2010. FATCA would impose a 30 percent tax on the investment in the United States of any foreign financial institution, including a bank, if it had any unreported U.S. citizen or green card holder contributing to the pool of money invested. Furthermore, the foreign financial institution’s officers could be subject to civil and criminal charges for making such an investment. In an era of common dual citizenships, it is impossible for a foreign financial institution to know for certain whether any of its clients is a U.S. taxpayer (i.e., citizen, green card holder, etc.). Thus, foreign financial institutions in Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere are pulling their investments out of the United States right at the time when the U.S. needs all of the job‐​creating foreign investment it can get.



Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat, and the other economic‐​know‐​nothings who proposed these measures claim — without any basis in fact — that the United States is losing $100 billion annually because of foreign account tax avoidance or evasion. Private foreign investment in the U.S. is about $14 trillion. So $100 billion is less than 1 percent of the private foreign investment, yet the mental midgets in Congress and the administration are willing to risk trillions of dollars in job‐​creating foreign investment in exchange for a phony $100 billion. Well over 10 million American jobs are at risk because of this foolishness.



It gets worse. The Treasury and IRS have yet to do a cost‐​benefit study of FATCA, but final regulations are being developed. In the private sector, executives who so failed at their fiduciary responsibilities would be fired, perhaps fined or even sent to jail. But members of Congress and the executive branch are most unlikely to pay any penalty for risking perhaps 20 to 40 jobs for each job they might, theoretically, save. By the way, many of the senators and congressmen who brought you FATCA are the same ones who want to continue to fund the OECD. Mr. President, if you really care about jobs in the way you say you do, why are you not calling for the repeal of FATCA and reining in Mr. Levin, his colleagues and your own Treasury secretary, who are in the process of endangering far more existing jobs than any of your questionable jobs proposals could possibly create?

Apparently Mr. Connolley has edited 5428 Wikipedia articles, most about climate. Die Kalte Sonne:
Unbelievable but true: The Wikipedia umpire on Climate Change was a member of the UK Green Party and openly sympathized with the views of the controversial IPCC. So it was not a referee, but the 12th Man of the IPCC team.
I’m not sure how accurate the translation is, but it suggests he was somehow part of the IPCC “short list” team. See it here at Die Kalte Sonne via this Google Translate link:

With over 5000 articles he’s edited, it makes you wonder if Mr. Connolley was employed by someone or some organization specifically for the task.

There has been a great deal of concern lately about rising partisanship and tribalism in the American political and cultural dialogue. Magazines, cable networks, and friends on Facebook line up with the Red Team or the Blue Team (which, lately, means pro‐ or anti‐​Trump) and present very different views of the world.



In times of polarization, think tanks seek to model civil discourse and respectful disagreement. Scholars at think tanks — more formally, public policy research organizations — may disagree, but they do so on the basis of facts, logic, and analysis.



But think tanks increasingly find themselves pressured to join a team and face off with the opposition. U.S. think tanks across the political spectrum report more pressure from donors and allies to be part of the red or blue team.



Meanwhile, increased partisan competition means more focus on think tanks, their activities, and their funding. Journalists and activists demand more transparency about funding sources and donor relations. The _New York Times_ blasted several major think tanks for seeming to give foreign‐​government donors what they want. Yahoo! News reported in 2018, “Think tanks reconsider Saudi support amid Khashoggi controversy.” The Cato Institute has not been mentioned in these stories — not because we’re lucky, but because we don’t seek or accept money from governments. That course of action proves wiser every year.



There are legitimate arguments for transparency about funding. But we have also seen an uptick in efforts by political opponents and even by officeholders to pressure or punish donors. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) has urged the Justice Department to bring a lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against Exxon Mobil and its purported “network” of “conservative policy institutes” that disagree with the senator on climate science. And in 2013, Cato received a letter from Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) demanding to know, among other things, “Has Cato Institute served as a member of ALEC American Legislative Exchange Council or provided any funding to ALEC in 2013?” The answer to that question was no, but then‐​CEO John Allison’s answer to Senator Durbin was more blunt: “Your letter … represents a blatant violation of our First Amendment rights.”



All think tanks need to resist this sort of intimidation, no matter at whom it is directed, and insist on our institutional independence.



Red‐​blue polarization is tough for those of us who don’t line up with either side, who try to talk to people of good will across the political spectrum, and who seek to defend principle while holding politicians accountable. There have certainly been policy improvements that were driven by the left (gay marriage, marijuana reform), the right (tax cuts, regulatory slowdown, repealing the health care mandate), and both (criminal justice reform). But politicians and parties have an incredible propensity to let us down even when we supposedly agree. Democrats pay lip service to civil liberties but do little to defend them, while for all the talk of fiscal conservatism by Republicans, spending and debt grow regardless of which party is in charge. Cato must defend these values and be willing to call out either side as necessary. This stance is particularly necessary as the attitudes of both parties have hardened and polarized in unfortunate directions. Although his tax and regulation policies are laudable, President Trump has shifted the GOP’s focus from smaller‐​government Reaganism to protectionism, anti‐​immigration hysteria, and cultural issues, often racially charged ones. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party has moved sharply left on all the wrong things — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and a wealth tax. Those changes make Cato’s role all the more important, and we’ve developed some projects to fight back against tribalism, such as our recent art exhibit and a high school teachers’ conference this summer.



Most think tanks are committed to liberalism in the broad sense — to rule of law, freedom of conscience, toleration, limited government, markets, democracy, and, perhaps especially, free speech and the value of truth. With rising tides of illiberalism on left and right, here and elsewhere, we have a common purpose to defend liberalism, even though we argue a great deal about policy details.

The gaga greenies of Europe are about to charge you for flying here in America. 



In a stunning slap at the sovereignty of everyone on the other six continents, the European Court of Justice last week said it was just fine and dandy for the European Union to levy fees on planes flying elsewhere. 



As the Europeans see it, global warming is so bad that they have to tax … us. 



Here’s how it works: You take off from London for Los Angeles; your flight route runs north‐​northwest over Scotland and out of European air space pronto. You pay a tax for this, which, while annoying, isn’t much different than a highway toll. 



But as your flight continues on — clipping south of the North Pole, then swooping over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Alberta and into the United States and LAX — the EU will tax you for each one of _those_ miles, too.



Starting next year, the EU will tote up all the miles a plane flies to or from any European city, factor in the fuel usage and charge a “carbon levy” for all emissions that are more than 85 percent of 2002 levels. No airline is going to eat that cost, so you’ll get the bill, perhaps listed as an “environmental surcharge.” 



Like most taxes, it starts out small, maybe $20 or so (no one really knows yet) — and then the fine folks in Brussels will start jacking up the price. By 2020, it could be $60 — the sky’s the limit.



And the EU’s not just _planning_ to hike the tax — it’s already mandated it. By 2020, it will tax planes for using more than half their 2002 fuel, and while newer planes are more fuel efficient, they’re not making gains close to that level. 



According to Fitch, United, Continental, Delta and American are likely to get hit the most, because about 20 percent of their revenue comes from European travel.



Things could get pretty ugly. China is already making noise about pulling its order for 10 double‐​decker A‐​380s from Europe’s Airbus (probably pretty good news for Boeing). Other countries may jack up landing fees or inflict similar taxes on foreign carriers. 



Until now, Europe and the United Kingdom have been content to go it alone with their silly climate taxes, smugly thinking (along with Chevrolet Volt drivers) that they are somehow saving the world. No more.



All of this seems downright silly. Here in America, the last (overwhelmingly Democratic) Congress refused to pass an anti‐​warming bill that would’ve ordered the country to cut carbon‐​dioxide emissions an impossible 83 percent by 2050. 



The bill actually passed the House, with President Obama’s support. But Obama’s public approval plummeted, while Republican poll ratings jumped, so the Senate punted the business of impoverishing us over to the president and his Environmental Protection Agency.



One reason that the bill was so unpopular was that it demonstrably did nothing about climate change — even if Europe, Australia, Canada and other industrialized nations adopted the same policy. That’s because the massive emissions from China, India and other developing nations will dwarf ours. 



In 2009, the last year for which we have good data, China emitted 142 percent of the US total of “greenhouse gases” — up from just 51 percent 10 years earlier.



But the Europeans aren’t willing to let futility stop them from launching a perfectly disastrous crusade — or even from exporting it to America.

 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**



State governments have been in an expansionary phase in recent years. Even though U.S. economic growth since the last recession has been sluggish, general fund revenues of state governments have grown 33 percent since 2010. Some of the nation’s governors have used the growing revenues to expand spending programs, while others have pursued tax cuts and tax reforms.



That is the backdrop to this year’s 13th biennial fiscal report card on the governors, which examines state budget actions since 2014. It uses statistical data to grade the governors on their taxing and spending records—governors who have cut taxes and spending the most receive the highest grades, while those who have increased taxes and spending the most receive the lowest grades.



Five governors were awarded an “A” on this report: Paul LePage of Maine, Pat McCrory of North Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida, Doug Ducey of Arizona, and Mike Pence of Indiana. Ten governors were awarded an “F”: Robert Bentley of Alabama, Peter Shumlin of Vermont, Jerry Brown of California, David Ige of Hawaii, Dan Malloy of Connecticut, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Kate Brown of Oregon, Jay Inslee of Washington, and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania.



With the growing revenues of recent years, most states have balanced their short‐​term budgets without major problems, but many states face large challenges ahead. Medicaid costs are rising, and federal aid for this huge health program will likely be reduced in coming years. At the same time, many states have high levels of unfunded liabilities in their pension and retiree health plans. Those factors will create pressure for states to raise taxes. Yet global economic competition demands that states improve their investment climates by cutting tax rates, particularly on businesses, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers.



This report discusses fiscal policy trends and examines the tax and spending actions of each governor in detail. The hope is that the report encourages more state policymakers to follow the fiscal approaches of the top‐​scoring governors.





  
Governors play a key role in state fiscal policy. They propose budgets, recommend tax changes, and sign or veto tax and spending bills. When the economy is growing, governors can use rising revenues to expand programs or they can return extra revenues to citizens through tax cuts. When the economy is stagnant, governors can raise taxes to close budget gaps or they can trim spending.



This report grades governors on their fiscal policies from a limited-government perspective. Governors receiving an A are those who have cut taxes and spending the most, while governors receiving an F raised taxes and spending the most. The grading mechanism is based on seven variables, including two spending variables, one revenue variable, and four tax-rate variables. The same methodology was used on Cato's 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 fiscal report cards.



The results are data-driven. They account for tax and spending actions that affect short-term budgets in the states. But they do not account for longer-term or structural changes that governors may make, such as reforms to state pension plans. Thus the results provide one measure of how fiscally conservative each governor is, but they do not reflect all the fiscal actions that governors make.



Tax and spending data for the report come from the National Association of State Budget Officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Tax Foundation, the budget agencies of the states, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources. The data cover the period January 2014 through August 2016, which was a time of budget expansion in most states.1 The report covers 47 governors. It excludes the governors of Kentucky and Louisiana because of their short time in office, and it excludes Alaska's governor because of peculiarities in that state's budget.



The following section discusses the highest-scoring governors, and it reviews some recent policy trends. The section after that looks at the outlook for state budgets, with a focus on the longer-term burdens of debt and underfunded retirement plans. Appendix A discusses the report card methodology. Appendix B provides summaries of the fiscal records of the 47 governors included in this report.





  
Table 1 presents the overall grades for the governors. Scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for each governor based on seven tax and spending variables. Scores closer to 100 indicate governors who favored smaller-government policies. The numerical scores were converted to the letter grades A to F.



 **Table 1. Overall Grades for the Governors**







  
The highest-scoring governors are those who supported the most spending restraint and tax cuts. Here are the five governors who received grades of A:



Paul LePage of Maine has been a staunch fiscal conservative. He has held down spending growth, and state government employment has fallen 9 percent since he took office. LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011 he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate and simplified tax brackets. In 2015 he vetoed a tax-cut plan passed by the legislature partly because the cut was not large enough. The legislature overrode him, and Maine enjoyed another income tax reduction. In 2016 LePage pushed for more reforms, including estate tax repeal and further income tax rate cuts.



Pat McCrory of North Carolina came into office promising major tax reforms, and he has delivered. In 2013 he signed legislation to replace individual income tax rates of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.75 percent with a single rate of 5.8 percent. That rate was later reduced to 5.75 percent. The law also increased standard deductions, repealed the estate tax, and cut the corporate tax rate from 6.9 to 4.0 percent, with a scheduled fall to 3.0 percent next year. In 2015 McCrory approved a further individual income tax cut from 5.75 to 5.5 percent. McCrory has matched his tax cuts with spending restraint. The general fund budget will be just 8 percent higher in 2017 than it was when the governor took office in 2013.



Rick Scott of Florida says that he wants to make Florida the best state for business in the nation, and tax cuts are a key part of his strategy. In 2012 Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, which eliminated the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2014 he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees. In 2015 Scott approved a cut to the state's tax on communication services and reductions in sales taxes and business taxes. In 2016 he approved the elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment, which is an important pro-investment reform. Scott also scored well on spending, and he has trimmed state government employment by 4 percent.



Doug Ducey of Arizona was the head of Cold Stone Creamery, and he has brought his business approach to the governor's office. He has overseen lean budgets, with general fund spending on track to rise just 2 percent between 2015 and 2017. He approved major pension reforms, including trimming benefit costs and giving new state employees the option of a defined contribution plan. Ducey has approved substantial tax cuts, including ending sales taxes on some business purchases, reducing insurance premium taxes, increasing depreciation deductions, and indexing Arizona's income tax brackets for inflation.



Mike Pence of Indiana has been a champion tax cutter and fairly frugal on spending. In 2013 he signed into law a cut to Indiana's flat individual income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent. He also approved a repeal of Indiana's inheritance tax. In 2014 he cut the corporate income tax rate, which has fallen from 7.5 percent to 6.25 percent since 2014, and is scheduled to fall to 4.9 percent in coming years. Pence also reduced property taxes on business equipment to spur increased capital spending. Indiana's ranking on the Tax Foundation's business competitiveness index has risen to eighth-highest in the nation.





  
Supporters of smaller government lament that politicians of both major parties tax and spend too much. While that is true, Cato report cards have found that Republican governors are more fiscally conservative, on average, than Democratic governors. In the 2008 report, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 46, respectively. In the 2010 report, they had average scores of 55 and 47. In the 2012 report, they had average scores of 57 and 43. In the 2014 report, they had average scores of 57 and 42.



That pattern continues in the 2016 report card. This time, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 54 and 43, respectively. And, on average, Republicans received higher scores than Democrats on both spending and taxes.



Three of the 10 F grades on this report went to Republicans, but none of the five A grades went to Democrats. When states develop budget gaps, Democratic governors often pursue tax increases to regain budget balance, while Republicans tend to pursue spending restraint. And when the economy is growing and state coffers are full, Democrats increase spending, while Republicans tend to both increase spending and pursue tax cuts.





  
Figure 1 shows state general fund spending since 2000, based on data from the National Association of State Budget Officers.2 Spending soared between 2002 and 2008, and then it fell during the recession as states trimmed their budgets.3 Spending has bounced back strongly in recent years, growing 4.1 percent in 2013, 4.6 percent in 2014, 4.1 percent in 2015, 5.6 percent in 2016, and a projected 2.5 percent in 2017.



 **Figure 1. State General Fund Spending**  




A key driver of state spending growth is Medicaid. This giant program pays for health care and long-term care for 67 million people with moderate incomes.4 The program is funded jointly by federal and state taxpayers. It is the largest component of state budgets, accounting for 26 percent of total spending.5



Medicaid has grown rapidly for years, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) expanded it even more.6 For states that implement the ACA's expanded Medicaid coverage, the federal government is paying 100 percent of the costs of through 2016, and then a declining share after that. As the federal cost share declines, state budgets will be put under more stress. But aside from the federal portion of Medicaid, the state-funded portion of the program is also growing quickly and stressing budgets. State-funded Medicaid spending grew 6.0 percent in 2015 and an estimated 8.3 percent in 2016.7



On the revenue side of state budgets, policymakers have been enacting a mix of tax cuts and tax increases. Overall, the states enacted a modest net tax cut in 2014 and 2015, but they swung to a net tax increase in 2016.8 Cigarette tax increases have been common, with a dozen states enacting them since 2014.9 Gasoline tax increases have also been common, with about half the states enacting them since 2013.10



There is also a trend toward reductions in individual and corporate income tax rates. There have been substantial rate cuts in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma in recent years. In some states, the revenues from income tax cuts have been partly offset with revenue increases from higher retail sales taxes.



These income tax reforms are good news, and they should help spur growth by making states more attractive for investment. However, there is also bad news regarding state efforts to attract investment, which is the proliferation of narrow tax breaks and subsidies for particular companies and industries. The classic example of such ""corporate welfare"" is the film production tax credits that most states now offer.



The 2014 Cato governors report card discussed why narrow business tax breaks and subsidies are bad policy, and research for this 2016 report confirmed that such breaks are rampant. Consider Nevada's recent tax policy. Governor Brian Sandoval imposed a huge $600 million per year tax increase on businesses, including higher license fees, an increase in the state's Modified Business Tax, and the imposition of a new Commerce Tax. At the same time, Sandoval has been eagerly handing out narrow tax breaks to Tesla, Amazon, data center companies, and other favored businesses. So Nevada's tax policy entails large increases for all businesses, but special breaks for companies favored by the politicians. That is a prescription for corruption, not long-term economic growth.





  
This report card focuses on the short-term taxing and spending decisions of the governors. But a full assessment of a governor's performance should also examine his or her policies affecting long-term fiscal health. This section looks at state debt levels, unfunded pension obligations, and unfunded retirement health obligations, and ranks the states based on those fiscal measures.





  
State and local governments are major investors in infrastructure, including highways, bridges, and schools and other facilities. A portion of this investment is financed by long-term borrowing, or the issuance of state and local bonds. The interest and principal on government bonds is paid back over time from either taxes or user fees. State and local governments have been issuing debt for infrastructure since at least 1818, when New York floated bonds to finance the Erie Canal.



However, debt is not the only way to fund infrastructure. Indeed, most state infrastructure investment is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis.11 That approach entails governments looking ahead and planning to construct needed facilities over time with an allocated portion of annual tax revenues.



Pay-as-you-go financing is generally preferable to debt financing. The Erie Canal was a big success, and it is thought to have generated positive economic returns. But that success spurred many other states at the time to borrow heavily and spend lavishly on their own, more dubious, canal schemes. State politicians in the mid-19th century overestimated the demand for canals and underestimated the construction costs. It turned out that the Erie Canal was a uniquely high-return route, while most state-sponsored canals in the 19th century were money-losing failures.12



The failures of many debt-backed state projects in the 19th century led to sweeping budget reforms. Nineteen states imposed constitutional limits on state debt issuance between 1840 and 1855.13 Further constitutional limits on state and local debt were passed in the 1870s. The limits took numerous forms, including requiring voter approval of debt issuance, limiting overall quantities of debt, and limiting the purposes for which state debt can be issued.



Today, all state governments operate within statutory and/or state constitutional limits on debt. Limits make sense because politicians have an incentive to issue debt in excess: debt-financed investment is not constrained by the unpopular need to raise current taxes, as it is for pay-as-you-go investment. Political incentives to deficit-spend can create severe economic damage if debt reaches high levels, as we have seen recently in Greece, Puerto Rico, Detroit, and other jurisdictions.



U.S. state and local government debt totaled $3 trillion in 2016.14 Table 2 shows that state and local debt per capita varies widely by state.15 The most indebted states by this measure are New York, Massachusetts, Alaska, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.



Governments in some states, such as Idaho and Wyoming, issue very little debt. They finance most of their capital expenditures on a pay-as-you-go basis. These states have per capita debt loads only one-quarter as large as the highly indebted states, and thus governments in these states are imposing much lower costs on future taxpayers.



California's budget this year discusses how the state is painting itself into a corner with debt: ""Budget challenges over the past decade resulted in a greater reliance on debt financing, rather than pay-as-you-go spending. . . . The increasing reliance on borrowing to pay for infrastructure has meant that roughly one out of every two dollars spent on infrastructure investments goes to pay interest costs, rather than construction costs. . . . Annual expenditures on debt service have steadily grown from $2.9 billion in 2000-01 to $7.7 billion in 2015-16.""16 To politicians, debt might seem like an easy way to fund infrastructure, but the servicing costs eventually eat away at current budgets.



Debt financing costs more than pay-as-you-go financing because of the interest payments, but also because governments pay substantial fees to the municipal bond industry. State and local borrowing creates an overhead cost in the form of thousands of high-paid experts in underwriting, trading, advising, bond insurance, and related activities. A study by economist Marc Joffe found that fees average about 1 percent of the principal value of municipal bonds.17 Since municipal bond issuance has averaged about $350 billion a year recently, fees are about $3.5 billion a year. That is taxpayer money that is not going toward building highways or schools.



A further cost of borrowing is the risk of corruption. The municipal bond industry has suffered from many scandals related to political influence. If you Google ""municipal bond market"" and ""pay-to-play,"" you will find story after story about bond underwriters using bribes and campaign contributions to win bond business from state and local officials.



Debt financing also makes government budgeting less transparent. Capital budgets that rely on debt are difficult for citizens to understand, especially given the myriad and complex ways that governments borrow these days. Also, citizens have less appreciation for the costs of new government projects if they do not feel the bite of current taxes to pay for them.



Perhaps the most important reason to worry about state debt is that other large fiscal burdens are looming over the states. Medicaid costs are growing rapidly, as noted. And retirement plans for government employees have large unfunded liabilities, as discussed next.



 **Table 2. State and Local Government Debt and Unfunded Pension and OPEB Liabilities (Dollars Per Capita, Ranked Highest to Lowest)**  






  
The largest component of state and local government spending is compensation for 16 million employees.18 Total wages and benefits for state and local workers was $1.4 trillion in 2015, which accounted for 53 percent of all state and local spending.19



State and local workers typically receive more generous benefit packages than do private-sector workers. On average, retirement benefits for state and local workers cost $4.80 per hour, compared to $1.23 per hour for private-sector workers. Insurance benefits (mainly health insurance) for state and local workers cost $5.43 per hour, compared to $2.59 per hour for the private sector.20 Most state and local workers receive retirement health benefits, whereas most private-sector workers do not.



The costs of government pension and retirement health benefits are expected to rise rapidly in coming years. Governments have promised their workers generous retirement benefits, but most states have not put enough money aside to pay for them. As a consequence, state and local governments will either have to cut benefits in coming years or impose higher taxes.



Let's look at pensions first. Most state and local governments provide their workers with defined-benefit (DB) pensions. Governments pre-fund their DB plans, building up assets to pay future benefits when they come due. Unfortunately, governments have overpromised benefits and underfunded their plans, creating large funding gaps. Total benefits paid by the nation's more than 500 state and local pension plans are $260 billion a year and rising.21



In a recent study, Stanford University's Joshua Rauh found that state and local pension assets in 2014 were $3.6 trillion, liabilities were $4.8 trillion, and thus unfunded liabilities were $1.2 trillion.22 State and local pension plans have only enough assets to pay 75 percent of accrued benefits.



A study by Alicia Munnell and Jean-Pierre Aubry found similar results.23 They found that the average funding level of pension plans grew during the 1990s, peaked at more than 100 percent in 2000, and then fell to just 74 percent today. That average is quite low, and there are many plans with dangerously low funding. The State of Illinois, Illinois Teachers, and Illinois Universities systems, for example, all had funding levels of 43 percent or less. For the State of Illinois, pension spending soared from $1.1 billion in 2000 to $7.7 billion in 2015, which was a substantial share of the state's $35 billion general fund budget that year.24 Major reforms are needed in such plans to reduce spending and bring liabilities in line with assets.



Pension shortfalls are actually larger than these figures indicate. Those are the officially reported figures, but financial experts think that the discount rates used to report pension liabilities are too high. Higher discount rates reduce reported liabilities and create an overly optimistic picture of pension plan health.



In his study, Rauh recalculated pension plan funding using a 2.7 percent discount rate, rather than the official average rate of 7.4 percent. His recalculated unfunded liability jumps from $1.2 trillion to $3.4 trillion. Similarly, Munnell and Aubry found that their unfunded pension liabilities jumped to $4.1 trillion if plans are estimated using a 4 percent discount rate.25 Under that assumption, the funding level of state and local pension plans averages just 45 percent.



Which states have the most underfunded pensions? Table 2 ranks the states on unfunded state and local pension liabilities per capita using the stated or official figures from Rauh. The level of pension liabilities varies widely. The highest liabilities are in New Jersey, Illinois, Alaska, Kentucky, and Connecticut. Note that using Rauh's recalculated figures at the lower discount rate, the unfunded liabilities are two or more times higher for most states.



Greater media focus on pension plans in recent years has prompted many state and local governments to trim their unfunded liabilities. But a pension report from Pew Charitable Trusts found that still only about half of the states are contributing the full ""actuarial required contributions"" to their plans, with the result that ""pension debt is continuing to increase in many states.""26



A good reform would be for states to scrap their defined-benefit (DB) pension plans for new hires, and instead offer them defined-contribution (DC) plans. Defined-contribution plans reduce risks for taxpayers and are the dominant type of retirement plan in the private sector. Alaska and Michigan have adopted DC plans for new employees, and a number of states have moved to systems that are hybrids of DB and DC.



In addition to pension liabilities, there is another type of liability that looms over state budgets: other post-employment benefits (OPEB). The main component of OPEB is retirement health care coverage, which includes benefits for early retirees before Medicare kicks in at age 65 and supplemental benefits after Medicare kicks in. California, for example, pays 100 percent of retirement medical costs for state workers after they have put in just 20 years of service.27 Very few private companies offer such generous benefits.



Total annual OPEB benefits nationwide are about $18 billion, and the costs are rising quickly as health costs grow and the number of retirees increases. In California, the share of the state's general fund budget spent on retiree health costs nearly tripled from 0.6 percent in 2001 to 1.6 percent by 2016.28



Unlike pension benefits, most state and local governments have not pre-funded OPEB at all. Annual benefits are simply paid from the general fund budget. A few states have started to prefund OPEB, but for the nation as a whole, the funding ratio — assets-to-liabilities — of state and local OPEB plans is less than 10 percent.29



Fortunately, this imprudent approach to financing OPEB has started to change. An accounting rule change in 2007 required governments to calculate and disclose unfunded OPEB obligations.30 Governments must now account for OPEB as they do their pensions, which is by estimating the future stream of promised benefits, discounting to the present value, and comparing those liabilities to plan assets.



How large are OPEB liabilities? A 2016 study by Alicia Munnell and coauthors estimated that unfunded state and local OPEB liabilities were $862 billion in 2013.31 Pew put the number at $627 billion, but the figure calculated by Munnell and coauthors captures a broader universe of plans.32 These figures are the costs of unfunded benefits that have been already accrued. But without reforms, OPEB liabilities will continue to rise as workers accrue more retiree benefits every year.



Table 2 shows that unfunded OPEB liabilities vary widely by state. The largest liabilities are in Alaska, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Hawaii. OPEB liabilities also vary dramatically across local governments. When Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013, people pointed to the city's $3 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, but finance expert Robert Pozen noted that it also had $6 billion of unfunded OPEB, which compounded the city's fiscal woes.33



To fix OPEB funding gaps, states are beginning to trim retirement health benefits. They can do so by increasing the age of eligibility, reducing the types of benefits provided, or increasing deductibles and copays for plan members. State and local governments have substantial legal flexibility in cutting health benefits for current workers and retirees, but less so with pension benefits.



Some local governments, and at least one state (Idaho), have ended retiree health benefits for new employees. Since the 2007 accounting change, the share of state and local government workers receiving retirement health benefits has fallen to about 70 percent.34 In the private sector, just 28 percent of medium and large businesses offer their retirees such benefits.35



In sum, state governments should reduce their retirement benefits to lighten the load on future taxpayers. Unfunded benefits are not just a problem for the future; they cause problems right now because credit rating agencies assign lower scores to states that have high debt and unfunded liabilities. Standard and Poor's says that they ""differentiate states' credit quality by the status of their long-term liability profile.""36 Lower credit ratings mean higher borrowing costs. So governors should make it a high priority to reduce their states' debt, pension, and OPEB liabilities.





  
This study computes a fiscal policy grade for each governor based on his or her success at restraining taxes and spending since 2014, or since 2015 for governors entering office that year. The spending data used in the study come from the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO), and in some cases, the budget documents of individual states. The data on proposed and enacted tax cuts come from NASBO, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources.37 Tax-rate data come from the Tax Foundation, but is updated by the author for recent changes.38



This year's report uses the same methodology as the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 Cato report cards. The report focuses on short-term taxing and spending actions to judge whether the governors take a small-government or big-government approach to policy. Each governor's performance is measured using seven variables: two for spending, one for revenue, and four for tax rates. The overall score is calculated as the average score of these three categories. Tables A.1 and A.2 summarize the governors' scores.



 **Spending Variables**



Average annual percent change in per capita general fund spending proposed by the governor.



Average annual percent change in actual per capita general fund spending.



 **Revenue Variable**



Average annual dollar value of proposed, enacted, and vetoed tax changes. This variable is measured by the reported estimates of the annual dollar effects of tax changes as a percentage of a state's total tax revenues. This is an important variable, and it is compiled from many news articles, budget documents, and reports.39



 **Tax Rate Variables**



Change in the top personal income tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the top corporate income tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the general sales tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the cigarette tax rate approved by the governor.



The two spending variables are measured on a per capita basis to adjust for state populations growing at different rates. Also, the spending variables are only for general fund budgets, which are the budgets that governors have the most control over. Variable 1 is measured through fiscal 2017, while variable 2 is measured through fiscal 2016. Variables 3 through 7 cover changes during the period of January 2014 to August 2016, or January 2015 to August 2016 for governors entering office in 2015.40



For each variable, the results are standardized, with the worst scores near 0 and the best scores near 100. The score for each of the three categories — spending, revenue, and tax rates — is the average score of the variables within the category. One exception is that the cigarette tax rate variable is quarter-weighted because that tax is a smaller source of state revenue than income and sales taxes. The average of the scores for the three categories produces the overall grade for each governor.





  
This report uses publicly available data to measure the fiscal performance of the governors. There are, however, some unavoidable problems in such grading. For one thing, the report card cannot fully isolate the policy effects of the governors from the fiscal decisions of state legislatures. Governors and legislatures both influence tax and spending outcomes, and if a legislature is controlled by a different party, a governor's control may be diminished. To help isolate the performance of governors, variables 1 and 3 measure the effects of each governor's proposed, but not necessarily enacted, recommendations.



Another factor to consider is that the states grant governors differing amounts of authority over budget processes. For example, most governors are empowered with a line-item veto to trim spending, but some governors do not have that power. Another example is that the supermajority voting requirement to override a veto varies among the states. Such factors give governors different levels of budget control that are not accounted for in this study.



Nonetheless, the results presented here should be a good reflection of each governor's fiscal approach. Governors receiving an A have focused on reducing tax burdens and restraining spending. Governors receiving an F have put government expansion ahead of the public's need to keep its hard-earned money. In the middle are many governors who gyrate between different fiscal approaches from one year to the next.





  






  






  
Below are highlights of the fiscal records of the 47 governors covered in this report. The discussion is based on the tax and spending data used for grading the governors, as well as other information that sheds light on each governor's fiscal approach.41 Note that the grades are calculated based on each governor's record since 2014, or since 2015 if that was the governor's first year in office.





  
Robert Bentley, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Robert Bentley dropped from a B in the last report card to an F in this one due to his support of major tax increases. In his first few years in office, Bentley generally opposed tax increases, but in 2015 he made a U-turn. He proposed a tax increase of more than $500 million a year, including increases on businesses, cigarettes, automobile sales, automobile rentals, and other items.



The governor's plan was opposed by the legislature, but after months of wrangling they reached a compromise on a $100 million tax package. Bentley signed into law a cigarette tax increase of 25 cents per pack, and higher taxes and fees on nursing facilities, prescriptions, and the insurance industry. In 2016 Bentley supported a gasoline tax increase, but that legislation did not pass.



On spending, Governor Bentley scored lower than average among the governors. He proposed substantial general fund budget increases the past two years.





  
Doug Ducey, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2015



Doug Ducey has a background in business and finance, and he was CEO of Cold Stone Creamery. As governor, he has overseen lean budgets, with general fund spending on track to rise just 2 percent between 2015 and 2017. In 2016 Ducey approved major pension reforms, which included trimming benefit costs and giving new hires the option of a defined contribution plan.



Governor Ducey has signed into law individual and business tax cuts. He approved legislation ending sales taxes on some business purchases, reducing insurance premium taxes, increasing depreciation deductions, and indexing Arizona's income tax brackets for inflation. Ducey has also been supportive of the corporate tax rate cut passed by the prior governor, which is being phased in over time. The corporate tax rate is falling from 7 percent in 2013 to 4.9 percent in 2017.





  
Asa Hutchinson, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Former U.S. Representative and federal official Asa Hutchinson entered the Arkansas governor's office in January 2015. Hutchinson campaigned on a middle-class tax cut, and he delivered soon after taking office. He signed into law a cut to tax rates for households with incomes of less than $75,000, providing savings of about $90 million a year.42 The governor said, ""Arkansas has been an island of high taxation for too long, and I'm pleased that we are doing something about that.""43 Enjoying substantial budget surpluses in 2016, Hutchinson has promised further tax cuts. On spending, Hutchison scored a bit better than average among the governors.





  
Jerry Brown, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Jerry Brown was graded as the worst governor in America on the 2014 Cato report card. Brown is not the lowest-scoring governor this time, but he is assigned another F based on his support of large tax and spending increases.



California's general fund budget increased 13 percent in 2015 and 2.7 percent in 2016, and it is set to increase more than 5 percent in 2017. The state has been on a hiring spree, with state government employment rising 7 percent over the past three years.44



Perhaps Brown's most wasteful spending project is on the state's high-speed rail system, which has a huge cost but will do little to reduce congestion. The projected cost of the project has doubled from $33 billion to $68 billion. An investigation in 2016 discovered that taxpayers will be on the hook not only for the project's capital costs, but also its operating costs.45 State officials had been promising that passenger ticket revenues would cover operating costs, but it is clear now that will not happen.



On taxes, Brown has pushed a transportation plan to raise $3 billion a year from higher gasoline and diesel taxes and a $65 per vehicle annual fee. Luckily for California motorists, the plan has not passed, although the legislature did approve a small vehicle registration fee increase in 2016.



Californians have been spared major tax increases the past couple of years because money has poured into state coffers from growth in Silicon Valley and other regions in the state. However, the next recession will cause the California budget to descend into crisis, as it has during past recessions. That occurs because California tax revenues are highly dependent on high earners and capital gains. As the stock market faltered earlier this year, for example, state revenue projections were slashed by $2 billion.46 If the California economy slumps, the budget will not be able to support the extra spending that Brown has added in recent years.



Brown recognizes these problems. In 2016 he noted of the state's tax system: ""We are taxing the highest income earners, and as you know, 1 percent of the richest people pay almost half the income tax. . . . That's fair, but it also creates this volatility. So in order to manage this budget, it's like riding a tiger.""47 Brown has favored building up the state's rainy-day fund, but he has not supported reforms to reduce revenue volatility, such as moving toward a more stable consumption-based tax system.



This November, voters will decide on various ballot measures on taxes. One measure would raise $1 billion a year from a cigarette tax hike of $2 per pack. Another measure would extend higher income tax rates on households earning more than $250,000 a year. And yet another measure will ask voters to legalize recreational marijuana. There would be a 15 percent excise tax on retail sales and a separate cultivation tax, which would together raise about $1 billion a year.48





  
John Hickenlooper, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



General fund spending has ballooned under Governor John Hickenlooper, rising 48 percent between 2011 and 2016. State government employment has soared 22 percent since Hickenlooper took office.49



Hickenlooper pushed for a large individual income tax increase on the ballot in 2013, which would have replaced Colorado's flat-rate 4.63 percent tax with a two-rate structure of 5.0 and 5.9 percent. That increase was rejected by voters, 65 to 35 percent.50 The governor has not pushed for major tax increases since then, but with a growing economy, revenues have poured into state government.



The state has a new source of revenue: marijuana. After citizens legalized the drug for recreational use on a 2012 ballot, Colorado has become ""the first state in history to generate more annual marijuana tax revenue than alcohol tax revenue. . . . The state collected $69.9 million from marijuana-specific taxes in fiscal 2015 and just under $41.8 million from alcohol specific taxes in the same period.""51



While not pushing major tax increases in recent years, Hickenlooper has opposed taxpayer interests by seeking to undermine the state constitution's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). TABOR requires voter approval of tax increases and requires the government to refund excess taxes above an annual revenue cap. Revenues have been exceeding the cap recently, which is ""prompting Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) and Democrats in the legislature to look for ways around the law.""52





  
Dan Malloy, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Dan Malloy received poor grades on prior Cato report cards due mainly to his enormous tax increases. In 2011 Governor Malloy raised taxes by $1.8 billion annually, which increased total annual state tax collections by 14 percent.



Malloy received an F on this report for his continued support of large tax increases. In 2015 he signed legislation increasing taxes more than $900 million annually. He increased the top individual income tax rate from 6.7 percent to 6.99 percent, and he extended a corporate income tax surcharge of 20 percent. He increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack and broadened the bases of the sales tax and income tax. He also increased health provider taxes and other taxes and fees.



Despite all the tax increases, Connecticut still faced a large budget gap in 2016 because spending keeps rising and growth is sluggish. Connecticut's economy has lagged the national economy, and the state's fiscal future is very troubled. It has some of the highest debt and unfunded retirement liabilities of any state on a per capita basis, as discussed above.



While neighboring New York has cut business taxes in recent years, Connecticut has raised them. In 2016 General Electric made headlines by moving its headquarters from Connecticut to Massachusetts. In 2015 GE head Jeffrey Immelt sent a letter to his employees saying that the company was looking to relocate ""to another state with a more pro-business environment.""53 GE announced in 2016 that it was moving to Boston, after being headquartered in Connecticut for more than 40 years.





  
Jack Markell, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2009



Former businessman Jack Markell is completing his second term as Delaware governor. He has scored fairly poorly on past Cato report cards. He signed into law large ""temporary"" tax increases in 2009, and then pushed to extend them in 2013. The top individual income tax rate was increased from 5.95 percent to 6.6 percent, where it remains today. In 2014 Markell signed into law a substantial increase in the corporate franchise tax, and he proposed a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase and a new tax on water service. In 2015 he approved increases in various motor vehicle fees. In 2016 Markell approved modest business tax reductions.





  
Rick Scott, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Rick Scott received an A on Cato's 2012 report, and he receives an A on this report for restraining spending and continuing to push for tax cuts. Scott often says that his goal is to make Florida the best state for business in the nation, and tax cuts are a key part of his strategy.



In 2012 Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, eliminating the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2013 he approved a temporary elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment. In 2014 he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees and proposed a further increase in the corporate tax exemption level.



In 2015 Scott approved a large cut to the state's tax on communication services and modest reductions in sales and business taxes. In 2016 he proposed more than $900 million in tax relief, including a cut to the sales tax on commercial rents and a full exemption for manufacturers and retailers from the corporate income tax.54 The legislature did not approve those two proposals, but it did pass Scott's plan to permanently eliminate sales taxes on manufacturing equipment, which is a solid pro-growth reform.



Governor Scott scored well on spending in this report. He has proposed low-growth general fund budgets the past three years. State government employment has been cut 4 percent under Scott.55





  
Nathan Deal, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Nathan Deal earned a D due to his poor performance on both spending and taxes. Georgia's general fund budget grew 27 percent between 2011 and 2016, and Deal proposed a substantial increase for 2017.



With regard to taxes, Deal supported a ballot measure in 2012 to increase sales taxes, but voters shot that plan down by a large margin.56 In 2015 Deal signed into law a large increase in gasoline taxes, hotel taxes, and other levies to raise more than $600 million a year. In general, Deal has favored raising broad-based taxes and shown little interest in major tax reform. Meanwhile, he has pushed narrow breaks for favored industries and companies, such as tax credits for the film industry and an exemption for major sports team tickets from the sales tax.





  
David Ige, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2015



Before being elected governor, David Ige was a state legislator and also an engineer and manager in the telecommunications industry. Ige defeated incumbent Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie in the Democratic primary in 2014. Abercrombie had received poor grades on Cato reports, and Ige pointed to his tax hikes as one of the causes of his political demise.57



Ige let expire temporary income tax increases put in place by Abercrombie, but he proposed increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees in 2016. However, it was the governor's excessive spending that pushed down his grade on this report. General fund spending rose 7 percent in 2016, and Ige proposed to increase it 12 percent in 2017.





  
C. L. ""Butch"" Otter, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2007



Former congressman Butch Otter is in his third term as Idaho governor. He has a moderately pro-growth record on taxes, but a poor record on spending.



In 2012 he signed legislation cutting the corporate tax rate from 7.6 to 7.4 percent and the top individual income tax from 7.8 to 7.4 percent. In 2015 he proposed cutting income tax rates further, to 6.9 percent, over five years. He also proposed ending property taxes on business equipment, which would have been a pro-growth reform. However, Otter did not push these cuts very hard, and they did not get passed.



In 2015 the governor approved a 7 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax. In 2016 Otter said that he was against tax cuts that were being considered by the legislature because they would jeopardize his spending priorities.58



Otter scores poorly on spending in this report. The general fund budget increased 5.6 percent in 2015 and 4.6 percent in 2016. He proposed a 7.3 percent increase for 2017.





  
Bruce Rauner, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Businessman Bruce Rauner took office as Illinois governor in January 2015 eager to fix his state's severe fiscal problems. Unfortunately, Rauner and the state legislature have been at loggerheads, and so budgeting has mainly ground to a halt the past two years.



The good news for Illinois is that Rauner replaced Pat Quinn, a repeated F governor on Cato reports. It is also good news that large personal and corporate income tax increases passed under Quinn have expired as scheduled. Furthermore, the budget standoff has meant that state general fund spending has been flat since 2014.



The bad news is that Illinois has not tackled its serious fiscal problems, including large structural deficits and unfunded pension obligations. Quinn's temporary tax increases had raised about $6 billion a year for the state, which the government quickly became dependent on as spending rose. When the extra tax revenue disappeared in 2015, large deficits reappeared.



In 2015 Rauner proposed a state budget that partly closed the gap between spending and revenues, and the legislature responded with an even more unbalanced budget. Rauner vetoed the legislature's budget, and the state was in a stalemate until June 2016, when a compromise deal was finally signed.



Rauner had said that he would not agree to higher taxes unless the legislature agreed to some of his Turnaround Agenda, which includes worker compensation reform and lawsuit reform. In a 2016 address, Rauner said, ""I won't support new revenue unless we have major structural reforms to grow more jobs and get more value for taxpayers. . . . I'm insisting we attack the root causes of our dismal economic performance.""59 In the end, a deal was struck that did not include Rauner's reforms, but it also did not give the legislature the extra taxes and spending that it wanted.60



During the budget standoff, the state built up IOUs to businesses providing services to the government. That fits with the state's pattern of pushing its costs to the future. Table 2, above, showed that Illinois is near the top of the 50 states in terms of per capita debt, unfunded pensions, and unfunded OPEB. These problems have been building for years — the underfunding of state pensions, for example, has roots two decades old.61 Rising pension spending is exacerbating budget gaps — pension spending soared from $1.1 billion in 2000 to $7.7 billion in 2015, which is a large share of the $35 billion Illinois general fund budget.62



Governor Rauner is trying to put the state on a more business-like posture, but he is receiving little help from the legislature. In his 2016 State of the State speech, he argued that Quinn's large tax increases hurt the state's economic growth, and he noted that the state's credit rating was downgraded five times during the high-tax Quinn years.63





  
Mike Pence, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Mike Pence has been a champion tax cutter and fairly frugal on spending. In 2013 he signed into law a cut to Indiana's flat individual income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent. He also approved a repeal of Indiana's inheritance tax.



In 2014 he cut the corporate income tax rate, adding to the reductions made by prior governor Mitch Daniels. The rate has fallen from 7.5 percent to 6.25 percent since 2014 and is scheduled to fall to 4.9 percent by 2021.64 Pence also targeted property taxes on business equipment for reform, and in 2014 he signed off on a plan to allow local governments to cut these anti-investment levies. These and other changes have helped Indiana increase its ranking among the states on the Tax Foundation's competitiveness index to 8th-highest this year.65



At the same time, Pence has restrained state spending growth. The general fund budget increased 2.6 percent in 2015 and 1.1 percent in 2016. It is set to grow 3.0 percent in 2017. Under Pence, Indiana has maintained the top credit rating from the three main credit rating agencies.





  
Terry Branstad, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Terry Branstad was governor of Iowa for 16 years between 1983 and 1999, and he returned to the governorship in 2011. His main pro-growth fiscal reform was a large property tax cut in 2013. The reform created a growth cap for agriculture and residential assessments, reduced assessment levels for commercial and industrial property, and cut property taxes for small businesses.



In recent years, Branstad has cut some taxes and increased others. He cut sales taxes on inputs to manufacturing and approved other modest business tax breaks. He also created a system of income tax rebates for years with budget surpluses. However, Branstad also approved a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase, which raised more than $200 million annually.



On spending, Branstad has performed poorly. He came into office promising to cut the size of state government by 15 percent, but instead general fund spending has soared. Spending has increased 11 percent in the past two years, and has increased 34 percent since he took office in 2011.





  
Sam Brownback, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Sam Brownback signed into law major income tax reforms his first few years in office. In 2012 he replaced individual tax rates of 3.5, 6.25, and 6.45 percent with rates of 3.0 and 4.9 percent. The reform increased standard deductions and eliminated special-interest breaks. In 2013 Brownback cut income tax rates further, while reducing income tax deductions and raising the sales tax rate from 5.7 to 6.15 percent.66



Brownback's tax cuts have become controversial. The problem is that the governor and legislature did not fully match the reduced revenues with reduced spending, which created chronic budget gaps. The fairly slow-growing economy in Kansas has not helped matters.



The governor has taken steps to reduce budget gaps. In 2015 he raised the sales tax rate from 6.15 percent to 6.5 percent, increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack, and reduced deductions under the individual income tax.67 The 2015 package raised about $300 million a year.



Those large tax increases pushed down Brownback's grade on this report, but his relatively frugal spending kept his grade out of the basement. Kansas general fund spending increased less than 10 percent between 2011 and 2016, and is expected to increase just 1 percent in 2017.68



Brownback's reforms do not illustrate that state tax cuts are a bad idea, as some pundits have suggested. In most states in most years, government revenues grow as the economy grows. Well-designed reforms, phased in over time, let taxpayers keep some of that growth dividend, and that can be achieved within a balanced-budget framework if spending is trimmed. Brownback's basic reform idea — to cut income tax rates in exchange for sales tax increases — should strengthen the Kansas economy over the long term since sales taxes are less harmful than income taxes.



The challenge for tax-cutting states is to ensure that policymakers fully match tax cuts with spending cuts. Both strengthen the economy, and both are needed to meet state balanced-budget requirements. Brownback has worked to close budget gaps, and in 2016 he proposed various savings options, including across-the-board spending cuts.





  
Paul LePage, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Paul LePage has been a staunch fiscal conservative. He has held down general fund spending in recent years, and he has cut state government employment 9 percent since he took office.69 LePage has signed into law cost-cutting reforms to welfare and health programs, and he has decried the negative effects of big government: ""Big, expensive welfare programs riddled with fraud and abuse threaten our future. Too many Mainers are dependent on government. Government dependency has not — and never will — create prosperity.""70



LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011 he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate, simplified tax brackets, and reduced taxes on low-income households. He also increased the estate tax exemption, cut business taxes, and halted automatic annual increases in the gas tax.



In 2013 LePage vetoed the legislature's budget because it contained tax increases, including an increase in the sales tax rate from 5.0 to 5.5 percent. However, his veto was overridden by the legislature.



In 2015 the Maine budget process broke down. LePage proposed a plan to reduce the top individual income tax rate from 7.95 to 5.75 percent, reduce the top corporate tax rate from 8.93 to 6.75 percent, eliminate narrow tax breaks, repeal the estate tax, and raise sales taxes.71



When the legislature rejected the plan, LePage said that he would veto any bills sponsored by Democrats. In the end, the legislature passed a budget that included substantial tax cuts over the veto of LePage, who wanted larger cuts. The plan cut the top personal income tax rate from 7.95 to 7.15 percent, reduced taxes for low-income households, increased the estate tax exemption, and made the prior sales tax rate increase permanent.



In 2016 LePage pushed for more tax cuts. In his State of the State address, he proposed reducing the individual income tax rate to 4 percent over time and repealing the estate tax. Over the years, he has also called for abolishing the state income tax altogether.



While LePage is a strong fiscal conservative, his political combativeness sometimes gets the better of him. In 2016 he even challenged one legislator to an old-fashioned duel, although he later apologized. Surely, the governor would better accomplish his fiscal policy goals by putting aside his anger and trying to work cooperatively with state lawmakers.



On the November ballot, Maine voters will face two questions affecting taxes. Question 1 would legalize marijuana and impose on it a sales tax of 10 percent. Question 2 would impose higher income taxes on households earning more than $200,000 a year. LePage opposes both ballot initiatives.





  
Larry Hogan, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2015



Larry Hogan won an upset victory in November 2014 in this Democratic-leaning state. Governor Hogan has gained a high favorability rating in polls, and he has nudged Democrats in the legislature toward spending restraint and tax relief. In one popular move, he repealed the ""rain tax,"" which was a new stormwater fee enacted by the prior governor. Another popular move by Hogan has been to use his executive authority to cut highway tolls and fees for many state services.



In 2016 Hogan proposed a package of tax cuts for families and businesses. The plan would have reduced taxes on seniors and low-income families, and also reduced business fees. Furthermore, it would have cut taxes on manufacturers, but in a complex way. New manufacturing firms in some regions would be exempt from the income tax for 10 years, and employees of those firms would also get tax breaks. The legislature did not pass the plan, and such micromanagement of tax relief is misguided. Hogan should instead focus on cutting taxes broadly by dropping Maryland's 8.25 percent corporate income tax rate.





  
Charlie Baker, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2015



After a career in the health care industry and state government, Charlie Baker was elected Massachusetts governor in November 2014. The governor is viewed as being socially moderate and fiscally conservative, and he is enjoying high popularity ratings.



In running for office, Baker said that he would not raise taxes, and he has stuck to that promise so far. The state income tax rate dropped slightly in 2015 and 2016 after budget targets were met, and the governor was supportive of those reductions.



The Massachusetts constitution requires that the state income tax be levied at a flat rate, currently 5.1 percent. But the legislature has been talking about amending the constitution and imposing a ""millionaire tax."" Baker opposes that idea, and the public likely supports him. Residents of Massachusetts have voted against imposing a graduated income tax five times since 1960.72



A 2014 ballot measure repealed automatic increases in the state's gas tax. In supporting that change, Baker said, ""I'm not talking taxes, period. Not talking taxes, because as far as I'm concerned we have a long way to go here to demonstrate to the public, to each other and to everybody else that this is a grade-A super-functioning [highway department] machine that's doing all the things it should be doing.""73



The spending side of the budget is where Baker's grade is pulled down a bit. The general fund budget rose 6.1 percent in 2016.



This November, Massachusetts will vote on a ballot question to legalize recreational marijuana, and to impose the state sales tax plus a 3.75 percent excise tax on the product. Governor Baker opposes the initiative.





  
Rick Snyder, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



After a successful business career, Rick Snyder came into office eager to solve Michigan's deep-seated economic problems. The governor has pursued important reforms, such as restructuring Detroit's finances and signing into law right-to-work legislation. He repealed the damaging Michigan Business Tax and replaced it with a less harmful corporate income tax. In 2014 he pushed through a large reduction in property taxes on business equipment, which should help spur capital investment. The cut was approved by Michigan voters in August 2014.



In 2015 he signed into law a mechanism that will automatically decrease state income taxes whenever general fund revenue growth exceeds inflation by a certain percentage. Unfortunately, the mechanism does not kick in until 2023.



Snyder's grade was pulled down by his tax increases to fund transportation. In 2015 he increased gasoline taxes from 19 to 26.3 cents per gallon and vehicle fees by 20 percent. Those hikes will cost taxpayers about $600 million a year. Snyder and the legislature pushed through the package despite Michigan voters having rejected by an 80-20 margin a sales and gas tax increase for transportation on a May 2015 referendum (Proposal 1). That ""rejection was the most one-sided loss ever for a proposed amendment to the state constitution of 1963.""74 Yet later in 2015, Snyder and the legislature hiked taxes for transportation anyway.





  
Mark Dayton, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Mark Dayton has rebounded from his prior Cato grade of ""F."" His poor grade had stemmed from large tax hikes, including raising the top individual income tax rate and raising cigarette taxes. The cigarette tax rate is now indexed and rises automatically every year. In 2014 Dayton reversed course and signed into law tax cuts totaling about $500 million a year, including reductions to income taxes, estate taxes, and sales taxes on business purchases.



But during 2015 and 2016, Dayton proposed various options to raise about $400 million a year from increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees. Those proposed increases did not pass the legislature.



With a substantial budget surplus developing in 2016, Republicans in the legislature proposed major tax cuts. One reform would have substantially reduced property taxes on business equipment. It seemed as if Dayton might reach some compromise with the legislature on a package of cuts, but the bill that passed the legislature included a drafting error and Dayton refused to sign it.





  
Phil Bryant, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2012



Until this year, Governor Phil Bryant had been a modest tax cutter. He had trimmed some business taxes and repealed motor vehicle inspection fees. But in 2016 he signed into law major tax cuts for businesses and individuals that were initiated by the legislature. The most important reform was phasing out over 10 years the corporate franchise tax, which is imposed on businesses in addition to the state's corporate income tax.75 This reform was a priority of the Senate Finance Committee chairman, who said that the franchise tax ""puts us at an economic disadvantage [and] . . . is really an outdated form of tax.""76 Governor Bryant was hesitant to cut the franchise tax, but in the end he did sign this important reform.



The 2016 tax package included other reductions. It cut taxes for self-employed individuals and cut the bottom individual income tax rate from 3 percent to zero, which provided across-the-board savings. Bryant had wanted to swap income tax cuts for a gas tax increase, but the legislature did not go along with the gas tax idea.





  
Jay Nixon, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2009



Governor Jay Nixon has battled the legislature over taxes for years. In 2013 the legislature passed an $800 million tax cut that would have reduced corporate and individual income tax rates. Nixon vetoed the bill, and the legislature was unable to override. In 2014 the legislature tried again and passed a bill over Nixon's veto. The package of tax cuts reduced the top individual income tax rate from 6.0 to 5.5 percent, and it provided a 25 percent deduction for business income on individual returns. The cuts are to be phased in beginning in 2017. However, they are contingent on state revenue targets being met, and they had not been met as of mid-2016.





  
Steve Bullock, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Steve Bullock scored well on spending in this report. But his grade was pulled down by his repeated vetoes of tax reform plans passed by the legislature. One plan he vetoed in 2015 would have trimmed the corporate tax rate, reduced the number of individual income tax brackets, raised the standard deduction and personal exemption, and scrapped narrow breaks in the code to simplify the system.



Bullock has approved at least one substantial reform, which was a 2013 law that reduced property taxes on business equipment. Bullock's Republican challenger for the governorship in 2016 is calling for further reductions in property taxes on business equipment, as well as individual income tax cuts.





  
Pete Ricketts, Republican; Legislature: Nonpartisan



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Pete Ricketts is an entrepreneur and former executive with TD Ameritrade. He is a conservative who favors tax reductions and spending restraint.



In 2015 Governor Ricketts vetoed a 6 cent per gallon gas tax increase, arguing that the state should solve its infrastructure challenges without tax hikes. The legislature overrode him to enact the increase.



In running for governor, Ricketts campaigned on property tax reduction, and he signed into law relief for homeowners, businesses, and farms in the form of state credits for local taxes. In 2015 the legislature considered various proposals for major income tax reform. Governor Rickets is favorably disposed toward such reforms, but no plan has passed the legislature yet.





  
Brian Sandoval, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Brian Sandoval came into office promising no tax increases. But Governor Sandoval made a U-turn in 2015 and signed into law the largest package of tax increases in Nevada's history at more than $600 million per year. The package included a $1 per pack cigarette tax increase, extension of a prior sales tax hike, an increase in business license fees, a new excise tax on transportation companies, and an increase in the rate of Nevada's existing business tax, the Modified Business Tax (MBT).



However, the worst part of the package was the imposition of a whole new business tax in Nevada, the Commerce Tax.77 This tax is imposed on the gross receipts of all Nevada businesses that have revenues of more than $4 million a year. The new tax has numerous deductions and 27 different rates based on the industry, and it interacts with the MBT.



The Commerce Tax is complex, distortionary, and hidden from the general public. As a gross receipts tax, it will hit economic output across industries unevenly, and it will likely spur more lobbying as industries complain that their tax burdens are higher than other industries. Imposing the tax was a major policy blunder.



The Commerce Tax was imposed to increase funding for education. But Sandoval and the legislature had been directly rebuked by the public in 2014 for their effort to impose a new tax for education. In a November 2014 ballot, Nevada voters overwhelming rejected by a 79-21 margin the adoption of a new franchise tax to fund education.



Meanwhile, in recent years Sandoval and the legislature have been handing out narrow tax breaks to electric car companies, data centers, and other favored businesses. In 2014, for example, Sandoval approved a deal to provide $1.25 billion in special tax breaks and subsidies over 20 years to car firm Tesla. So Nevada's tax policy entails large increases for all businesses, but narrow breaks for the lucky few.



This November, Nevada voters will weigh in on a ballot question, Question 2, to legalize recreational marijuana and impose the state sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax on the product. Governor Sandoval opposes legalization.





  
Maggie Hassan, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Maggie Hassan received a middling grade on this report, as she did on the 2014 report. She performed below average on spending, highlighted by a 7 percent increase in the general fund budget in 2016. On taxes, Hassan has signed into law a mix of increases and cuts. In 2013 she proposed a cigarette tax increase of 30 cents a pack, and the legislature agreed to 10 cents. In 2014 she approved a gasoline tax increase of 4.2 cents per gallon.



In 2015 Hassan reversed course and cut taxes after she initially resisted. She approved small rate cuts to the Business Profits Tax and the Business Enterprise Tax, and she increased the research tax credit. Those changes were a compromise with the legislature after the governor's veto of an initial tax-cut package. The compromise plan includes a second round of tax cuts in 2019 if state revenues hit specified targets.



In 2016 Hassan signed bills increasing business depreciation deductions and repealing a tax that had been imposed on stock offerings.





  
Chris Christie, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2010



New Jersey has struggled with a sluggish economy, budget gaps, and a large unfunded retirement obligation for state workers. In 2016 the state had to deal with a budget gap when revenue projections were reduced by $1 billion. The state treasurer argued that revenues are volatile because they depend heavily on the incomes of high earners: ""Our progressive tax code makes us far too reliant upon extraordinary sources of income from our highest income earners.""78 To reduce volatility and spur economic growth, the state should move away from income taxes and toward sales taxes in its revenue base.



Governor Chris Christie has tried to reduce income taxes. He signed into law substantial business tax cuts in 2011, and he has proposed across-the-board individual income tax cuts. He has repeatedly vetoed income tax hikes passed by the legislature, insisting that ""income taxes being raised in any way, shape or form will not happen while I'm governor — under no circumstances.""79



In 2016 he said raising taxes would be ""insanity"" and called for lower taxes to ""stop people from leaving New Jersey.""80 The _New York Times_ profiled one New Jersey billionaire who moved to Florida in 2016 and single-handedly appears to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tax revenues.81 In his 2016 State of the State address, Christie called for elimination of the state's estate tax: ""Our tax structure incentivizes people to move to other states as they age, and when they do they take their businesses and capital with them.""82



Christie and the legislature struggled for months this year to agree on a deal to raise the gasoline tax 23 cents per gallon in return for cutting the estate tax and possibly the sales tax. As of August, Christie, the House, and the Senate could not come to an agreement.



Christie scored quite well on spending in this report, with below average increases in the general fund budget in recent years. State government employment has been cut 5 percent since Christie took office.83



Major fiscal problems loom for New Jersey. The state has one of the lowest credit ratings, partly as a result of its large unfunded retirement obligations. Reflecting on a negative assessment from Standard and Poor's in 2016, Bloomberg noted, ""New Jersey's mounting tab from its employee retirement plans are squeezing its finances because years of failing to set aside enough to cover promised benefits have caused the annually required contributions to soar.""84 To Christie's credit, he established a blue ribbon commission to propose reforms to the state's retirement systems.85 Unfortunately, the reforms have not been enacted.





  
Susana Martinez, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Susana Martinez scored above average on spending and taxes in this report. Her proposed budget increases have been modest, although the legislature has usually spent more. On taxes, Martinez has pursued reforms to make New Mexico more economically competitive. In 2012 she signed a bill reducing gross receipts taxes on inputs to construction and manufacturing. But her biggest tax policy success was in 2013, when she pushed through a cut to the corporate income tax rate from 7.6 to 5.9 percent, phased in over five years.





  
Andrew Cuomo, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Andrew Cuomo received a grade of B on the 2014 Cato report, and he repeats his B this time around for his impressive tax cutting.



In 2014 Cuomo signed into law a package of tax reforms for businesses. The package cut the corporate income tax rate from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent, reduced the corporate tax rate on qualified manufacturers from 5.9 percent to zero, ended a separate bank tax system, ended a surcharge on utility customers, and reduced the property tax burden on manufacturers.86



In 2016 Cuomo approved substantial individual income tax cuts in a compromise with Senate Republicans. The cuts will be phased in between 2018 and 2025, at which time they are expected to be saving taxpayers about $4 billion annually. The cuts will reduce statutory income tax rates on taxpayers with incomes below $300,000 a year. The deal did not include tax hikes on high earners, which Democrats in the legislature were promoting.



However, New York's spending is rising briskly. The general fund budget increased more than 8 percent in 2016 and is expected to increase more than 5 percent in 2017.87 Spending has been buoyed by an inflow of cash from legal settlements that the state has extracted from financial institutions. In 2015 and 2016, the state received more than $8 billion in settlements from 20 major companies.88 Cuomo's plan is to spend the money — mainly on capital projects — rather than using it to pay down the state's debt load, which is projected to continue rising.89





  
Pat McCrory, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Pat McCrory came into office promising major tax reforms and he has delivered. In 2013 he signed legislation to replace individual income tax rates of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.75 percent with a single rate of 5.8 percent. That rate was then reduced to 5.75 percent. The reform also eliminated the personal exemption and expanded the standard deduction. The 2013 law also cut the corporate income tax rate from 6.9 to 4.0 percent today, with a scheduled fall to 3.0 percent in 2017. The estate tax was repealed, and the sales tax base was expanded to cover more services.



In 2015 McCrory approved a further cut in the individual income tax rate from 5.75 to 5.5 percent, combined with an increase in the standard deduction. The 2015 law partly offset the revenue loss from income tax reductions with a broadening of the sales tax base. In 2016 McCrory approved another increase in the standard deduction.



McCrory has a good record on spending. The general fund budget will be just 8 percent higher in 2017 than it was when he took office in 2013. North Carolina retains the highest ratings on its debt from all three major credit-rating agencies.





  
Jack Dalrymple, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: December 2010



North Dakota's boom from energy production has turned into a bust, as the price of oil has plunged since 2014. The strong economy had created a government revenue gusher fueled by rising severance taxes on oil production. Governor Jack Dalrymple and the legislature increased state spending substantially during the boom years.



But now that the economy is stagnant and tax revenues are falling, North Dakota policymakers are retrenching. Dalrymple has ordered broad-based cuts, and one-time appropriations have fallen substantially in the current two-year budget compared to the last one. Also, during the boom years, policymakers transferred substantial revenues into budget reserve funds, and those funds are now helping the state weather the downturn.



Dalrymple has signed into law numerous tax cuts. In 2013 he cut the top individual income tax rate from 3.99 to 3.22 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 5.15 to 4.53 percent. In 2015 he cut the individual rate further to 2.9 percent and the corporate rate to 4.31 percent. Despite the large budget gap this year, Dalrymple has resisted the urge to raise taxes.





  
John Kasich, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



John Kasich has been one of the best tax-cutting governors of recent years. In 2013 he approved a plan that cut individual income tax rates by 10 percent, with the top rate falling from 5.93 to 5.33 percent. The plan also exempted a portion of small business income from taxation. To partly offset the revenue loss, the plan broadened the sales tax base and raised the sales tax rate from 5.5 to 5.75 percent. In 2014 the income tax rate reductions were accelerated and personal exemptions were increased.



In 2015 Kasich signed further income tax rate cuts into law. Individual rates were slashed across the board, with the top rate dropping to 5.0 percent. The 2015 legislation also expanded the small business exemption. Taxpayers can now exempt the first $250,000 of business income, with business income over that amount taxed at just 3 percent.



The revenue losses from the 2015 tax cuts were partly offset by a cigarette tax increase from $1.25 to $1.60 per pack. In his 2016 State of the State address, Kasich promised further tax reforms next year.



Kasich's score was reduced by his substantial spending increases, including a general fund increase in 2016 of more than 9 percent. State government employment is up 11 percent since the governor took office.90





  
Mary Fallin, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Mary Fallin's record on spending has been very good, which pushed up her grade on this report. Partly this is due to the tough budget situation faced by Oklahoma. The depressed energy industry has reduced government revenues, and so Fallin and the legislature have needed to restrain spending. The general fund budget fell 2 percent between 2014 and 2016, and Fallin proposed another reduction for 2017. Oklahoma's state government employment has been on a downward trend since 2013.



However, a large gap in the state budget this year prompted Fallin to pursue tax increases, which pulled down her Cato grade. She proposed hiking the cigarette tax by $1.50 per pack to raise $180 million a year, broaden the sales tax base to raise $200 million, and repeal an income tax deduction for state taxes to raise $85 million. The latter item was enacted.



This pro-tax stance is a reversal for Fallin, who came into office promising tax cuts. In past years, she pursued that goal, and in 2014 she cut the top individual income tax rate from 5.25 to 5.00 percent.



This November, Oklahoma voters will decide on a major tax change at the ballot box. They can support or oppose Question 779 to increase the state sales tax rate by 1 percentage point. As of this writing, Fallin appears to oppose the increase.





  
Kate Brown, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: February 2015



Kate Brown, an attorney and former legislator, became governor in February 2015 after Governor John Kitzhaber resigned during a corruption scandal. Oregon has enjoyed a strong economy in recent years, which has pushed up state revenues and encouraged spending. State government employment has soared, rising 12 percent over the past three years under Kitzhaber and then Brown.91



Even with state coffers filling up from the growing economy, Governor Brown has sought tax increases. She pushed tax and fee increases to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for transportation spending, but that effort did not succeed. She approved an extension of the state's hospital tax. And she signed into law a 17 percent tax on recreational marijuana in 2015, which is the state's first sales tax.



Oregon voters face a big tax decision in November. Liberal groups have placed a question, Measure 97, on the ballot to impose a gross receipts tax on Oregon businesses to raise $3 billion a year. At first, Governor Brown — who is up for election this November — hesitated on endorsing the increase, but in August she announced her support.92





  
Tom Wolf, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2015



Tom Wolf was elected governor in 2014 after a career running a family business. The thrust of Wolf's fiscal policy as governor has been to raise just about every state tax as much as he can. His score is the lowest of all the governors on this report.



In 2015 Wolf and the Republican-controlled legislature battled for nine months over how to close a budget gap, with Wolf pushing for large tax increases and Republicans opposing. One area of possible agreement was swapping a sales tax increase for a property tax cut. In the end, the budget passed with no major tax changes.



In 2016 Wolf's budget proposed many large tax increases. He proposed increasing the individual income tax rate from 3.07 to 3.4 percent to raise $1.3 billion a year. He pushed for a new severance tax on natural gas production to raise more than $200 million. He proposed raising tobacco taxes by more than $600 million, raising sales taxes by more than $400 million, and raising numerous other taxes. At $2.7 billion a year, it was one of the largest tax-increase plans of any state in recent years. In July the legislature agreed to more than $700 million in hikes, including a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax.



Wolf reduced his score on this report further by supporting hefty spending increases. General fund spending rose 4.8 percent in 2016, and Wolf proposed to increase it 7.1 percent in 2017. After falling for about 5 years, state government employment has jumped more than 5 percent in the year and a half since Wolf entered office.93



Pennsylvania has spent too much money for too long. On a per capita basis, the state is among the top 10 states for debt and unfunded pension liabilities. Pennsylvania has one of the lowest credit ratings from Standard and Poor's, and earlier this year the agency threatened to reduce its rating further for ""failure to pass a budget package . . . that addresses long-term structural balance.""94





  
Gina Raimondo, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Governor Gina Raimondo is the best-scoring Democrat in this report. Raimondo has a background in economics, law, and the venture capital industry. As Rhode Island's Treasurer in 2011, she made national headlines for successfully pushing through major reforms of the state's pension system, including benefit reductions.



As governor since January 2015, Raimondo has a fiscally moderate record. She has overseen below-average increases in the general fund budget. She has also signed into law a number of modest tax cuts, including reductions in taxes on Social Security and pension income, reductions in sales taxes and alcohol taxes, and reductions in the corporate minimum tax. However, she also signed into law a cigarette tax increase in 2015, and proposed another increase in 2016.





  
Nikki Haley, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Nikki Haley has championed tax cuts, but spending has risen quickly during her tenure. South Carolina general fund spending rose 38 percent between 2011 and 2016. Spending will rise at least 17 percent during the three-year period of this report (2014 to 2017). State government employment has edged up since Haley entered office.



On taxes, Haley has pushed for reforms, but the South Carolina legislature has not been cooperative. In 2012 Haley proposed collapsing the current six individual income tax brackets to three and phasing out the corporate income tax. The plan did not pass, but she did sign into law a cut in the tax rate on small business income from 5 to 3 percent.



In recent years, she has proposed reducing income tax rates in exchange for gas tax increases to fund transportation. One proposal was to swap a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase for a phased-in reduction of the top individual income tax rate from 7 percent to 5 percent. Unfortunately, the legislature has not moved forward with reform.





  
Dennis Daugaard, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Dennis Daugaard's poor grade is attributable to his large tax increases the past two years. Daugaard began his tenure opposed to tax increases, and he was a defender of South Dakota's low-tax environment. In 2012, for example, he came down on the side of voters who soundly defeated a ballot measure to raise the state sales tax rate from 4 percent to 5 percent.



But Daugaard has reversed course on taxes. In 2015 he signed into law substantial increases in gas taxes, excise taxes on vehicles, and vehicle fees. In 2016 he signed into law an increase in the state sales tax rate from 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent. That hike generated a large increase in overall state revenues because sales taxes are the dominant revenue source in South Dakota. Relative to total state tax revenues, this was one of the largest tax increases among the states in recent years, hence Daugaard's low grade on this report.





  
Bill Haslam, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Bill Haslam has received middling grades on prior Cato reports, but he scored better this year on both spending and taxes. His big fiscal achievement in 2016 was signing the repeal of the ""Hall tax,"" which was a 6 percent tax on dividends and interest. Tennessee has no broad-based income tax, but it has had this special anti-investment levy. Haslam had opposed repeal in the past, but in 2016 he agreed to phase it out over time. The reform reduces the tax by 1 percentage point a year until it is eliminated. Other than the Hall tax repeal, Haslam has approved a smattering of other modest tax cuts and increases in recent years.





  
Greg Abbott, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Greg Abbott was the Attorney General of Texas under Governor Rick Perry, who served 14 years in office. Abbott assumed the governorship in January 2015 with a reputation as a staunch conservative.



On tax policy, Abbott's reputation has been affirmed. He took aim against the state's damaging franchise tax, called the Texas Margin Tax, and signed into law a permanent 25 percent cut to save Texas businesses $1.3 billion annually. He also approved legislation to scrap needless annual licensing fees on doctors and other professionals, saving them $125 million a year.





  
Gary Herbert, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: August 2009



Governor Gary Herbert's low grade on this report stems mainly from his large spending increases. Utah's general fund budget increased almost 7 percent in 2015 and more than 9 percent in 2016. State government employment has soared under Herbert, growing a remarkable 20 percent since he took office in mid-2009.95



In 2015 Herbert approved a number of substantial tax increases. One was a restructuring of the gas tax from a cents-per-gallon levy to a 12 percent tax on the wholesale price, which raised the burden on motorists $75 million a year. He also approved a statewide property tax increase and a law to allow local governments to raise their sales taxes with local ballot approval. Herbert has also proposed raising taxes on e-cigarettes, but the legislature has rejected that idea.





  
Peter Shumlin, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Peter Shumlin has increased taxes and spending substantially, earning him an F on this report. Vermont's general fund budget grew 27 percent between 2011 and 2016 under Shumlin, even though the state's population has not grown at all. State government employment has risen more than 10 percent since he took office.96



Shumlin scored poorly on taxes. In 2013 he approved an increase in fuel taxes. In 2014 he approved an increase in cigarette taxes of 13 cents per pack, and in 2015 he approved another increase of 33 cents per pack. Also in 2015, he reduced income tax deductions, broadened the sales tax base, and increased property taxes. In 2016 Shumlin signed into law a package of tax and fee increases, including $20 million a year of new fees on mutual funds. He has also proposed numerous new taxes and fees to fund expanded health spending.





  
Terry McAuliffe, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2014



Terry McAuliffe is a businessman and long-time political operative. On this report, he scored below average on spending and above average on taxes. He has supported a smattering of tax increases and cuts. His best proposal has been to reduce the state's corporate income tax rate from 6.0 to 5.75 percent. The governor said that he was motivated to cut the corporate tax because of North Carolina's reforms: ""In order to build the new Virginia economy, we have to make the commonwealth competitive in the global market.""97 McAuliffe has also proposed increasing research tax credits and increasing personal exemptions under the income tax. Unfortunately, the tax reductions have not moved through the legislature. The governor has appeared to tie the tax cuts to his proposal for Medicaid expansion, which the Republicans do not support.





  
Jay Inslee, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: F Took; Office: January 2013



Governor Jay Inslee has pushed for numerous large tax increases, which pushed his grade down to the bottom on this report. Inslee originally campaigned on a promise not to raise taxes, but within months of taking office in 2013 he proposed more than $1 billion in higher taxes in the upcoming two-year budget.98 In 2014 he proposed a new 7 percent tax on capital gains, increases in cigarette taxes, and other hikes. In 2015 he approved a gas tax increase of 11.9 cents per gallon, as well as tax increases on businesses. In 2016 he pushed another package of tax increases, including broadening the sales tax base and increasing business taxes.



The past two years, Inslee has pushed various plans for a state cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, which would raise hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the government.99 Inslee's plans have not passed the legislature, but voters will decide on the November ballot, on Initiative 732, whether or not to impose a new carbon tax.



Inslee scores poorly on spending. The current two-year general fund budget is up 13 percent over the prior budget. State government employment has risen about 5 percent since Inslee took office.100





  
Earl Ray Tomblin, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: November 2010



Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was the highest-scoring Democrat on the 2014 Cato report. The general fund budget has been virtually flat in recent years, and Tomblin has approved a smattering of modest tax cuts. Tomblin recently signed into law a reduction in severance taxes to aid the struggling energy industry in his state.



However, as the state developed a budget gap this year, Tomblin threw in the towel on his moderate fiscal approach and proposed a range of large tax increases. He proposed a cigarette tax increase, a broadening of the sales tax base, and an increase in the sales tax rate by 1 percentage point. When the legislature passed the state budget without his hikes, he vetoed it. But then the legislature partly caved in and approved a 65 cent per pack cigarette tax increase to raise about $100 million a year.





  
Scott Walker, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Scott Walker has reformed retirement plans and union rules for government workers. Act 10, passed in 2011, imposed restrictions on collective bargaining and required increases in worker contributions for health and pension plans. The changes have saved state and local governments — and thus taxpayers — in Wisconsin billions of dollars over the years.101 In addition, Walker signed a law requiring a two-thirds supermajority in both legislative chambers to raise income, sales, or franchise tax rates.



Walker approved individual income tax cuts in 2013 and followed up with further cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers in 2014. Wisconsin's five income tax rates were reduced to four lower rates. The standard deduction was increased, a new deduction for private-school tuition created, and various modest breaks for businesses were passed. Walker has also approved substantial property tax relief. However, Walker has not reduced Wisconsin's high corporate tax rate, and he only made a tiny trim to the top individual income tax rate.



Walker's grade is pulled down a bit by his spending increases, as was his grade on the 2014 Cato report. The Wisconsin general fund budget is expected to increase 7.3 percent in 2017.102





  
Matt Mead, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



The Tax Foundation reports that Wyoming has the best tax climate for businesses in the nation.103 Wyoming has neither a corporate income tax nor an individual income tax. Governor Matt Mead has not tampered with that efficient tax structure, although he did raise gas taxes in 2013.



There have been no substantial tax changes since then. With the decline in the coal industry and low energy prices, the resource-dependent state is facing a tough economy and falling state revenues. But so far, Mead and the legislature are standing firm against tax increases.



Instead, as the energy boom in Wyoming has turned to a bust, Mead has been focused on closing a large budget gap with spending restraint. In 2016 the governor signed into law a package of spending reductions, combining specific program cuts with across-the-board reductions. He has also frozen state hiring, and total state employment has fallen since 2013. Wyoming general fund spending in the 2017-2018 biennium is expected to be down from the 2015-2016 level. Mead, however, has been a supporter of Medicaid expansion, but he has not convinced the legislature to go along with that spending increase.104

That suggests that less than half of state and local capital investment is financed by debt.

39\. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) compiles tax changes proposed by governors and the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) compiles enacted tax changes. However, these data sources have substantial shortcomings, and so I examined hundreds of news articles and state budget documents to assess major tax changes during each governor's tenure. Tax changes seriously proposed by governors, tax changes vetoed, and tax changes signed into law were taken into account. It is, however, difficult to measure this variable in an entirely precise manner. Legislation creating temporary tax changes was valued at one-quarter that of permanent tax changes. Unemployment compensation taxes and local property taxes were generally excluded. Also, earned income tax credits were excluded because they mainly increase spending, rather than reduce taxes.



40\. The tax rate variables also include changes already enacted in law to take effect by January 2017.



41\. For simplicity, all the general fund spending changes mentioned in the text are the overall increases. But the actual scoring was based on the per capita changes. Also note that all spending data refers to state fiscal years.

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Greenhouse Re-Visited: Vincent Gray, a five time expert reviewer of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has reassessed his earlier review of the origins “greenhouse effect.” Also, he addresses many errors that arise in the models. They are too highly simplified versions of the climate system and fail to incorporate important components of the earth’s heat transfer system.
The paper (22 pages including references) may become controversial, as it should be. If Gray is correct, then the entire IPCC program, and the ones that parrot it, such as the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the EPA’s endangerment finding, are built on false assumptions that must be revised.
According to reports from the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service, from 1993 to 2012 the US Government has spent about $140 to 150 Billion on global warming / climate change – creating the Climate Establishment. Based on continuing resolutions, current spending is about $20 Billion per year. This figure does not include subsidies for unreliable wind and solar, or Biofuels.
No doubt, the Climate Establishment will bitterly contest any major revision of their ideas and models, in which they have expressed great, if scientifically unfounded, certainty. The following is not intended to be a summary of Gray’s assessment, but just a brief list of some of the highlights.
· In postulating that carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas, Svante August Arrhenius used the wrong measurements – ones of water vapor, not carbon dioxide. He did not make the measurements, but used those by Langley.
· Arrhenius greatly over estimated the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere as compared with water vapor, by an average of 50 to 1.
· Guy Callendar, who continued the emphasis on carbon dioxide, ignored water vapor and believed that radiation was the only form of energy transfer in the climate system. He ignored the existence of conduction, convection, evaporation, and condensation as mechanisms of heat transfer.
· The IPCC has continued to emphasize radiation, ignoring the other mechanisms of heat transfer.
· The simplified model of the IPCC by Kiehl and Trenberth ignores the fact that the sun does not shine on the same place 24 hours a day. Measures of the average radiation from the earth are not suitable and measurements should include the difference between day and night.
· There are no estimates of the accuracy of the values of solar heating over oceans and land.
· The range in estimated values solar heating effects of oceans and land is significantly greater than the calculated values of warming effects from increasing carbon dioxide.
· Thus, the value of warming effects from increasing carbon dioxide cannot be calculated with scientific precision.
Gray differentiates between an actual greenhouse and the earth’s climate. For the earth, both ocean and atmospheric circulation are critical. The movements of fluids are chaotic, and have not been satisfactorily described by mathematics. He states that the IPCC falsely claims that the chaotic behavior is managed; pointing out that, based on their calculations, the energy subject to chaotic behavior is about 60 times greater than the estimate of the warming effect of increased carbon dioxide (97 v. 1.6 W/m squared).
Please see link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Cold Kills: After five cold winters in a row, northern European newspapers are carrying articles that express anger at politicians who have instituted policies “to fight global warming,” which are increasing energy prices to consumers. Granted, the cold winters are weather events, but so were warm spells previously claimed to prove global warming caused by CO2. For example, in Britain the 2003 heat wave was blamed for 2,000 deaths. The current cold spell is being blamed for upwards to 30,000 deaths. These are real deaths, with certificates, cause, and name; not imaginary deaths from questionable computer models, such as those used by the EPA. Green politicians and bureaucrats have lost touch with the public. Subsidies to consumers are not the same as affordable energy. Even the once-alarmist Economist is beginning the grasp the scope of the man-made problem. Please see links under Questioning the Orthodoxy, Questioning European Green, Changing Weather, and Health, Energy, and Climate
******************
Spend More, Save More: As with the US, the British government has adapted the marketing concept that the more you spend, the more you save. The bureaucrats admit that their policies are increasing energy costs, particularly electricity, but claim if consumers buy more energy efficient appliances that have been mandate, the consumers will save in energy costs. What the bureaucrats do not consider is labor costs. For example under the standard cycle, some modern dishwashers in the US take about two to three times as long as older ones, for a slight savings in electricity. The consumer may consider the time lost is far more than the savings mandated by the bureaucrats.
******************
Labeling: Proper labeling is important in marketing (propaganda). Many skeptics have studied the history of climate change and concluded that it is real, ongoing, significant, and natural; but, the human influence is minor. Many climate alarmists label these skeptics as climate change deniers, or science deniers. Similarly, it has become fashionable for some in the Climate Establishment to label the current era (say the past 250 years) as the Anthropocene, a geological epoch dominated by human activity.
With a touch of humor in a comment on Britain’s Climate Change Commission posted on Bishop Hill, James Evans suggests a label for latest period, (say last 50 years) – The Hubrisocene – an epoch dominated by ego that humans can control climate. Please see link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Character: Senator Inhofe stated he was proud to be one of those singled out in the film “Dirty Lying Bastards.” This attitude is contrasted by that of “I am a victim” Michael Mann, who claims that he was made a public figure by “science deniers” who severely criticized him. It is Mr. Mann’s hockey-stick that is the subject of intense criticism, because Mr. Mann’s study ignores significant prior studies with large amount of data that contradict the hockey-stick. Please see links under Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up and Oh’ Mann.
******************
Renewable Mandates: In the US, the battle over renewable energy mandates is moving to the several states (Renewable Energy Standards or Portofolio). Some politicians are becoming aware that many citizens do not wish to pay for unreliable, expensive wind power. One hot-bed is the state legislature of North Carolina, which is taking up the issue this week. Please see link under Subsidies and Mandates Forever.
******************
Save Energy, Move South? A new study estimates that the total energy use for indoor climate control is about 3.5 times more in the cold climate of Minneapolis, Minnesota, than in the warm climate of Miami, Florida. The study is quite interesting, but not exactly a fair comparison. Minneapolis is far inland and subject to intense heat and cold. Miami is on the east coast, and extremes in temperature are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean. A more valid study would compare cities distant from oceans, with approximately the same humidity, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tennessee may be appropriate. Please see link under Energy Issues – US.
******************
Keystone XL: The fate of Keystone XL pipeline remains in the hands of the Administration in Washington. Obviously, Canadians with an interest in oil sands are disturbed by the delay. These interests include the government of Alberta, which will receive increased royalties with increased development. Pipelines are the safest way to move oil and gas. Without the pipeline, the oil is moving by rail, and one accident occurred this week.
An interesting proposal is to convert one of the pipelines in Canada’s Mainline from natural gas to oil. The Mainline carries natural gas east from Alberta, over the Canadian Shield, to the eastern cities of Canada. The Canadian Shield is a formidable barrier with extensive exposed bedrock, some of the oldest in the world. As discussed by Robert Bradley, in From Edison to Enron, building the Mainline east was expensive, both financially and politically, rather than building it south into the US around the Great Lakes then back north again,. If the gas pipeline can be physically converted, or if an oil pipeline can be built adjacent to it, then that may be a more practical venture than dealing with Washington. Please see Article # 2 and links under Energy Issues – Non-US.
*****************
Number of the Week: 1200 million metric tonnes! (1323 million short tons) Petroleum engineer, and world class track cyclist and coach, Norm Kalmanovitch calculates humans exhale approximately 1200 million metric tonnes of CO2 every year. “I based the number on an average calorie intake of 1200 calories which gives about 180 kg/person of CO2 per year. Seven billion people times 180 kg/person comes to 1260 million tonnes which I rounded off to 1200 million metric tonnes!” Of course this is approximate, but it gives some sense of proportion compared to claimed CO2 savings by certain policy measures.
For example, according to an article by John Dawson, the carbon tax scheme of Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard boasts that by 2020 it would cut CO2 emissions by 160 million tonnes – about thirteen percent (13%) of human emissions from breathing. Perhaps Australians should ask Ms. Gillard: Is breathing polluting?

"**Shop prices are falling in the run-up to Christmas as retailers race to clear stock amid a ""deepening"" High Street crisis, a report has said.**
Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index.
Overall, it found prices of goods excluding food fell 3.7% in November.
Market researchers Mintel and Springboard say they see similar trends and expect further falls in December.
The BRC said the discounting reflected ""an extremely challenging year"" for retailers after trade was put on hold because of lockdowns.
""As we approach Christmas, consumers will be glad to see another month of falling prices,"" said boss Helen Dickinson.
""Where demand was weak for some products, discounting has followed, with many retailers trying to encourage more consumer spending, particularly those selling fashion and DIY goods.""
The BRC's Shop Price Index tracked the price of 500 of the most commonly bought High Street products from 2 to 6 November - a period that crossed into the start of England's second national lockdown.
Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said pre-Christmas discounts were not new, but that there would be more deals than usual this year as non-essential shops tried to make up for lost sales.
""Many retailers will have committed to orders, not had enough time to cancel and then ended up lumbered with stock,"" she told the BBC.
""They won't be able to sell things like seasonal gift sets and certain fashion lines in the new year, so we expect lots of discounts on those.""
Retailers are also trying to get people to do their Christmas shopping earlier, fearing a spike in online orders that will be hard to fulfil, said Nick Carroll, associate director of retail at Mintel.
This partly explains why this year's Black Friday sale had lasted longer than usual, with deals available as early as 1 November, he said.
""We've seen huge pressure on logistics operations and people not able to get their goods on time, so the more demand is spread out out, the easier it will be.""
The pandemic continues to batter retailers, putting thousands of jobs at risks.
This week Topshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, while Debenhams announced it would shut its 124 UK stores after last-ditch rescue talks failed.
The BRC's Ms Dickinson said businesses shuttered during lockdown had ""lost billions in sales and many are now in a precarious financial position"".
She called for more government support saying that ""without such interventions, we will see countless more store closures and job losses""."
"**First Minister Mark Drakeford has come under pressure from his own Labour backbenchers over his ban on the sale of alcohol in Welsh pubs.**
Alun Davies demanded to see evidence underlying the decision.
Meanwhile Hefin David said information from a group advising ministers should have been published when the decision was taken.
Mr Drakeford said the case for the need for the restrictions - aimed at easing a rise in cases - was ""compelling"".
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies said many businesses will ""not survive"" the decision.
Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was a ""mistake"", said the changes were ""not comprehensible"" and could damage public trust.
Earlier the boss of Wales' biggest brewery called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be shut from Friday.
During a debate in the Welsh Parliament, Mr Drakeford told Senedd members: ""If I have to make an unpopular decision because it is the right decision, I will make the right decision and not just the one that makes me popular.""
Wales is facing a ""public health emergency"", he told members, and that the Welsh Government was relying on evidence used to close pubs in other parts of the UK.
Blaenau Gwent's Mr Davies told the first minister that if he ""wants myself and others to support him in these regulations, he must provide the evidence and advice has received from his advisers"".
He said that was needed so members could ""explain those decisions to the people we represent"".
The Welsh Government has cited advice from UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), as well as its own Technical Advisory Cell (TAC).
Mr Drakeford told Mr Davies that when he ""has a chance to study what Sage has already said, what the TAC will tell him what the figures of positivity, transmission, hospitalisation and death in his part of Wales tell him, he will see very plainly why the actions we are taking are necessary and necessary now"".
Mr David was more supportive of the first minister, saying there was ""a logic behind what the government has done"", based on advice from Sage.
However he added: ""There is a lot of frustration and anger out there with regard to this decision.""
The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell usually publishes its latest Covid-19 advice on Thursdays.
""It should be when the decision is announced,"" Mr David said.
Mr Drakeford said ""we will do our best to expedite"" TAC advice but he said they ""provide it when they are confident that they've got it ready for publication, and it's very important that I do not attempt to try to influence them in the work that they do"".
Over the course of the day in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford faced calls from the opposition for the scientific basis of the decision to be published.
Mr Drakeford said the evidence is there ""in the public health emergency we are facing"".
""Two of our local authorities in Wales have rates of more than 400 per 100,000 of the population; seven of them rates of over 300; 11 of them rates over 200, and those rates are growing - growing across Wales.
""The evidence for the actions we are taking is there to be seen in the reviews published by Sage on 11 and 19 November, reviewing the measures that have succeeded across the United Kingdom, and we have drawn on that to put in place in Wales those steps that will reduce the flow of coronavirus and save lives that need not be lost.
""It's the same evidence that [the UK government] has drawn on to close pubs and prevent the sale of alcohol in tier 3 levels in England; it's the same evidence that led the SNP Government in Scotland to close pubs and to prevent the sale of alcohol in level 3 areas in Scotland. It's why hospitality is closed in Northern Ireland today.""
Pubs are closed in tier 3 areas in England, while in level 3 areas in Scotland they are not able to serve alcohol.
During First Minister's Questions, Paul Davies described the decision as ""catastrophic"" and ""devastating"" for businesses.
""Pubs and restaurants in areas where transmission rates are low will rightly feel upset that their businesses is being put at risk, through no fault of their own,"" he added.
Adam Price has called for ministers to allow alcohol to be served until 1900, with a ban on off-licence sales after that time, in what he said would be a ""sensible compromise"".
""Off licences and supermarkets should not be allowed to sell alcohol after this time to discourage people from going into each other's homes,"" he said."

There is no surer way to tell that you’ve crossed the border from NSW to the ACT than by the quality of the road. One minute you’re bumping along on a fairly ordinary stretch of bitumen, the next you’re gliding on air. Canberra must surely have the smoothest, best-maintained roads in all of Australia.



The public sector is no slouch at looking after itself. It should surprise not a single taxpayer that the ACT has the highest median income in Australia, by a country mile. Like so many rich people today, these public service fat cats are as addicted to virtue-signalling as they are to our money.



The last stage of South Australia’s Hornsdale wind farm comes online today. With that, the ACT, more than 1,000 kilometres away, will “officially” be powered by 100 per cent renewable electricity.



Except that that’s just another in the litany of green lies.



Only about five per cent of the territory’s electricity is generated within its borders, by a few solar farms and rooftop panels on Canberra homes.



The rest comes from the national electricity market — the grid that powers the eastern seaboard — and four-fifths of the grid’s power comes from non-renewable sources.



In other words, nearly 80% of Canberra’s electricity comes from dirty old coal and gas… and that’s on the days when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.



The “100 per cent renewable” claim is a typically deceitful green pea-and-shells game. Only watermelons can somehow spin a maximum 20% into “100%”.



The ACT funds five different wind farms around Australia to feed energy into the national grid to make up for what Canberra consumes.



Those investments, together with Canberra’s own solar, put a stop to about 40 per cent of the ACT’s carbon emissions […]the shortfall is made up by the ACT Government’s mandatory contribution to the national renewable energy target, where it buys the equivalent amount of renewable power for 21 per cent of its total consumption.



  
No matter how you spin that, it still doesn’t add up to 100%. And Canberra is **still** consuming fossil-fuel generated electricity.



As always, the climate change scam is 100% fuelled by bullshit and taxpayers’ money.

"**The number of residents to have died in a Covid outbreak at a south of Scotland care home has risen to eight.**
Dumfries and Galloway Health and Social Care Partnership reported the first cases at the Alma McFadyen Care Centre in Dalbeattie in early November.
A statement said there had now been a total of 42 positive cases associated with the outbreak.
The partnership said thoughts were with the families involved at this ""difficult time"".
It said the situation at the centre was now ""much improved"" but that did not mitigate the impact on residents and their relatives.
The partnership added that containing the spread of Covid was ""not at all easy - even when all the correct protocols are in place to address the virus""."

Dr. Michael Asten writes to alert me of this article in the Australian, with this advice:
Geologic time scale Climate Change (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
The overwhelming conclusion ought to be that cycles should be built into at least some of the climate models in order to explore scenarios.  But I fear we might still be another decade away from seeing that happen.
I suspect he is right, as I do Stephan Rahmstorf who says:
“if the system (is cyclic), we’d expect the opposite. In 30 years’ time we will know for sure.”
From:  The Australian 
Today’s global warming is well within historic range
by:  Michael Asten January 28, 2013 12:00AM


 US President Barak Obama vows action on climate change with the declaration “none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms”. 

It was an appeal using rhetoric and not science because the most severe impacts of these natural disasters come from the challenge of managing increased population or changed population demands, not changes in the events per se.

Great fires are a regular feature of North American and Australian landscapes, and their human impact is worst when they reach housing or infrastructure built among trees, on the edge of bushland that has not been cleared by “cool” burn-offs.
Civilisations have been hit by droughts since the Nile delta drought of 4200 years ago destroyed Egypt’s old kingdom, leaving the pyramids as witness.
As global citizens, we still have much to learn about the management of water, it seems, whether in our Murray-Darling backyard or in the Sahel of Africa.
The term “powerful storms” summons up graphic images of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated New York – except it was no longer hurricane-strength when it, like a dozen others in written history, struck.
But the Manhattan area it flooded contained huge areas of high-density development on reclaimed swamps, ponds and what was riverbed before civilisation drained, dozed and filled to provide for the population of one of the world’s greatest cities. When New York has absorbed the lessons from this, it will be able to pass on advice and technology to places such as Bangladesh.
…
A growing number of mainstream scientists agrees there is evidence for such cycles as drivers of climate change, although debate on causes and mechanisms is strong. By way of example, I note three recent papers that find evidence for long-term cycles influencing the Earth’s climate.
Weichao Wu of the Peking University and colleagues studied sea-surface temperature records preserved in deep-sea sediments near Okinawa in the Pacific Ocean, and found evidence for multiple cyclic temperature variations over the past 2700 years.
The most interesting temperature peaks correspond to medieval, Roman and possibly Minoan warming periods of about 900, 1800 and 2500 years ago.
The paper is significant in that it concludes that the current rate of global temperature change lies in the same range as that of those historical warming periods.
This suggests we have evidence that challenges current climate orthodoxy on two grounds, first by suggesting that such warming events were global not local European phenomena, and second that current warming is not unprecedented in the historical record.
While we read many claims by oceanographers of an increasing rate of rise in sea-levels associated with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, an alternative interpretation of observed data is made in a recent analysis by Don Chambers of the University of South Florida and colleagues.
Chambers poses the question: “Is there a 60-year oscillation in sea-level?” and shows evidence that the answer is probably yes.
I read his data and find it is arguable that the upswing of that oscillation is responsible for about half of the current 3mm/year rate of rise, leaving the background rate of rise at about 1.7mm, where it has been for 110 years.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead author Stefan Rahmstorf, writing in the climate scientists’ blogsite Real Climate this month, commented on whether the data supports an interpretation of cycles, or non-cyclic shifts associated with changes in aerosols and current increases in greenhouse gases.
Rahmstorf concludes in favour of the latter but ends with the objective and open-minded comment “if the system (is cyclic), we’d expect the opposite. In 30 years’ time we will know for sure.”
…
A third work that may eventually prove immensely important in understanding cycles in climate change is a study by JA Abreu of the prestigious Swiss university ETH, with co-authors including Australia’s 1995 Australia Science Prize winner Ken McCracken.
Abreu reconstructs a history of solar sunspot cycles over the past 10,000 years from elemental isotopes created by cosmic rays impinging on the atmosphere, subsequently preserved in Greenland ice-core records.
…
The mechanisms of sun-spot, solar magnetic field and cosmic ray interactions are complex and will be intensely studied, but the associations illustrated here demand consideration when we seek to model our future climate.
The devastating impacts of extreme climate events of which Obama speaks have always been with us, and we have to expect that the human tragedies they bring will be exacerbated by growth in global population.

"LONDON  —   In another era they could have been allies. Both vicars’ daughters and born just a few years apart, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots, and have made their way in the still largely man’s world of politics. But there could be so much more. At a time when President Trump is lashing out at friend and foe, and when the macho politics of strongmen is resurgent from Moscow to Manila, when not just the European Union but   Western values, free trade and security alliances are under attack, the two women might have worked together to defend the liberal global order. Instead, because of Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history, a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues. At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week, Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough. After lunch, when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe, Mrs. May was shown the door. Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Ms. Merkel, whose overriding strategic ambition as Germany’s leader is to save the European Union, has kept her distance from Mr. Trump. After his election, she firmly outlined the liberal values on which she was prepared to work with him, and she swiftly condemned his travel ban aimed at seven   countries. Mrs. May, whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country’s departure from Europe’s single market, rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office. Apparently pleased to be caught on camera holding his hand, she extended a speedy invitation for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. “Opposites attract,” she beamed. The invitation has since become a polarizing issue in Britain’s sharply divided political landscape, and reinforced a view on the Continent that as Britain cuts ties with Europe, it will become America’s lap dog. “It’s chalk and cheese,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford. “But none of this tells you very much about the contrasting character of the two women. It tells you about the contrasting positions of the two countries. ” If Ms. Merkel can still afford to be an idealist, Britain’s plan to leave the European Union, or “Brexit,” has turned Mrs. May into a calculating realist. Within hours of leaving Mr. Trump, she was on a plane to Turkey. Upon arriving, Mrs. May waffled in her judgment of Mr. Trump’s travel ban, later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry. She also negotiated a deal with Turkey involving the British defense company BAE Systems. Five days later, Ms. Merkel paid her own visit to Mr. Erdogan and looked far clearer in her resolve when faced with the autocratic Turkish leader, calmly noting that she had raised controversial issues like press freedom and Turkey’s future Constitution. Privately, German officials express some sympathy for Mrs. May’s sometimes clumsy diplomacy, understanding that she needs new partners if she is to make good on her promise of a “Global Britain. ” But only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been. In July, Ms. Merkel was almost effusive in welcoming Mrs. May, who chose Berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister. The German chancellor emphasized their countries’ “common values. ” During a news conference, both women stiffly answered questions about Brexit. Then a journalist asked about their first impressions of each other. Their body language visibly loosened. Ms. Merkel laughed, and Mrs. May said, “We have two women here who, if I may say so, want to get on with the job. ” Their shared gender has led to many lazy comparisons, said Rosa Prince, the author of a biography of Mrs. May that is to be published this month. “When you are a female political leader of a certain age, you are inevitably compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel,” she said. “Theresa May is nothing like Margaret Thatcher, but as it happens has quite a lot in common with Angela Merkel. ” Each cautious and deliberate, they are both childless, have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports. (Ms. Merkel knows soccer Mrs. May prefers cricket.) An Oxford graduate and lawmaker since 1997, Mrs. May was Britain’s   home secretary of modern times before taking over from Prime Minister David Cameron in the confusion that followed the Brexit referendum. As Ms. Prince put it, “She was the last woman standing after all the men got burned or ran away. ” Ms. Merkel, a scientist before she went into politics, is long used to being the only woman in the room. Evelyn Roll, a German biographer of Ms. Merkel, said that, on the advice of a German actress, the chancellor had deliberately lowered the pitch of her voice to deter men from talking over her. Both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose. Mrs. May has been called a “bloody difficult woman” by a fellow minister. Ms. Merkel’s predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl, patronized her as “my girl. ” Even after Ms. Merkel unseated Mr. Kohl as leader of the Christian Democrats amid a party financing scandal, Germany’s   news media belittled her as efficient but bland  —   until she took office in 2005 and gradually became “Mutti,” the mother of the nation. “The only way men can process that a woman is in power is apparently to liken her to their mother,” Ms. Roll said. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Germany’s former Communist east, has never branded herself a feminist. But on her watch Germany has introduced boardroom quotas for women and created a generous system of paid parental leave shared between mothers and fathers. Mrs. May once wore a   that read, “This is what a feminist looks like. ” In 2005, Mrs. May   a group called Women2Win to elect more women to Parliament and then nurture them, something that Mrs. Thatcher was often criticized for not doing. “They are both serious people who don’t grandstand, who don’t play for the gallery,” said Charles Grant, the director of the   Center for European Reform. But the few times the two women have met privately have been highly scripted affairs with little warmth on display, according to one person who was present at more than one of their meetings. “Theresa May is not good at small talk,” said Ms. Prince, the biographer. “She is not an easygoing, smooth person. She is not a natural diplomat. ” Ms. Merkel, however, is said to respect Mrs. May, considering her the “ ” in the British government, officials close to the chancellor say. For her part, Mrs. May has long expressed admiration for the German chancellor. “There are still people who don’t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,” Mrs. May said in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph. “What matters is, what has she actually done? And when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her. ” The two will soon be on the opposite side of the negotiations as Brexit talks commence. There is no wish in Berlin to “punish” Britain for leaving, said Peter Torry, Britain’s ambassador in Germany until 2007, who still lives in the German capital. But Berlin’s tone has grown more distant as Britain’s resolve to leave has hardened and their interests diverge. Mrs. May has said she will turn Britain into a   competitor if no favorable deal is offered by the European Union by the end of a   negotiation. But given her promises for a fairer society, that proposal is not considered credible or workable by many business and political leaders in Europe. Nor is her offer to be a bridge to the new American president. At a news conference in Malta after the European Union summit meeting on Friday, Ms. Merkel was asked whether Germany should lower its corporation tax in line with the reductions signaled by Mrs. May and Mr. Trump. “We have a tax system in Germany that is weathering challenges well,” Ms. Merkel said, suggesting that   societies rely on raising a fair amount of tax. One reason for the difference between the two women’s approaches may be that one is just starting out as head of government, while the other has been in office for over a decade. “May is like Merkel 10 years ago,” Ms. Roll said. Though sometimes accused of lacking a vision for Europe, Ms. Merkel is calm and strategic, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations’ research institute in Berlin. “That’s obviously helpful in a situation where we risk seeing a lot of provocations coming out of Washington over the next few years,” she said. By contrast, Ms. Schwarzer added, Mrs. May seems “more tactical at this point. ” One leader is consumed by preparing Britain’s departure from the European Union, and the other with keeping the bloc together. Could they develop a pragmatic relationship during the Brexit talks and beyond? “It won’t be a smooth ride,” Ms. Prince said, “but it certainly has a better chance of succeeding with these two levelheaded women at the top. ”"

Too many Taminos in Maine?
New Study Finds RPS Standards Hurting Maine’s EconomyGovernor LePage advocates for reforms in Maine’s energy lawsAUGUSTA – Today, Governor Paul LePage released the following statement in regards to the study, The Economic Impact of Maine’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, conducted by the Maine Heritage Policy Center and the Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research:“By 2017, this study predicts energy prices will increase by $145 million for consumers, costing the State of Maine about 1,000 jobs. We already pay a statewide total of approximately $220 million more per year for electricity than the national average. This study shows that special interests are hurting Maine’s economy and costing us jobs. We can no longer embrace the status quo. 

“Unfortunately, low cost, reliable, and green renewables, such as hydro power, are discriminated against in Augusta. Instead, those with powerful political connections have forced higher cost renewables onto the backs of Maine ratepayers. Common sense dictates that cost must be a factor when evaluating all new energy sources.
“Reforming our laws to optimize our renewable energy production will put more money in the pockets of Mainers, bring more jobs to our state, and improve our quality of life. I encourage the people of Maine to tell their legislators that we need to lower the cost of energy.”
Background:On September 26, 2012, the Maine Heritage Policy Center and Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research released a study which found that Maine’s current Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) Law, which mandates the minimum and maximum amount of energy consumers must purchase from various sources, will raise the cost of electricity in Maine by 8% in 2017. This 8% increase amounts to approximately $145 million in statewide consumption costs, and would cost Maine approximately 995 jobs, $85 million in real disposable income, decrease investment in the state by $11 million, and increase the average household electricity bill by $80 per year.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNothing to do with climate directly, but it is funny and to me it serves to remind us skeptics of the people we are dealing with and their hopelessly warped lens through which they view the world. Such are the people we often find in the climate change movement and at Earth Day celebrations.
The following comes from an apartment search website where we have a young lady searching for an apartment to share with others in Berlin.
Hat-tip Steffen Hentrich at FB.
Here’s how she describes herself and what she expects of her potential roommates:
I, 31, am a good-natured open leftist* and openly feminist student of history (HU) and am searching a cosmopolitan and anti-capitalistic apartment to share with others in Friedrichshain/Kreuzberg. You need to be open minded when it comes to other lifestyle models and tolerance should be among your top values. Moreover it would be super if there was already a washing machine that I could also use in the apartment. I don’t like aggressions and power games, and so I’m searching for an apartment that is 100% shared by women who are active against terror, war, racial madness, fascism, chauvinism and US cultural imperialism. I am myself a vegan and think that long-term living together makes sense when absolutely no animal-based products find a place in my apartment.
In general I am easy to get along with, but must also be able to say where the limits are and when I don’t want to see anyone. For me this is part of an honest cohabitation. In the past unfortunately I often have had to make the experience of putting up with people who stayed around even when I asked them to (temporarily) leave the apartment.
In return for a room (20-30 sqm) I offer work in the household, repairs and discussions (also therapeutic). Money is the lever of the powerful with which I cannot identify with. But because I respect other views, I would be willing to contribute to WLAN and electricity (even it belongs to the fundamental needs of a person and thus MUST be provided free of charge.)

I’m looking forward to the “casting”.
Mona
*Anarcho-syndicalism (but do not always agree with the International Workers Association)”
At the very top of the want ad, Mona writes that the maximum rent she is willing to pay is 5 euros. And it’s generous of her to offer to help out with the WLAN and electricity.
Note how she’s 31, and still a student. But that is not unusual in Europe. And she’s precisely the kind of “open-minded” and “tolerant” talent German liberal arts universities are putting out today.
So tell me folks, is it really possible to reason with such people? Talk about a failed upbringing. The first thing she needs to do is go on a meat diet.
I wonder why Mona isn’t staying with her parents?

Fifty years ago today, the actor Ronald Reagan gave a nationally televised speech on behalf of the Republican presidential nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater. It came to be known to Reagan fans as “The Speech” and launched his own, more successful political career.   
  
  
And a very libertarian speech it was:   




This idea that government was beholden to the people, that it had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique idea in all the long history of man’s relation to man. This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self‐​government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far‐​distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.   
  
  
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man’s age‐​old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward path. Plutarch warned, “The real destroyer of the liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties, donations and benefits.”   
  
  
The Founding Fathers knew a government can’t control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose.



Video versions of the speech here.   
  
  
For libertarians, Reagan had his faults. But he was an eloquent spokesman for a traditional American philosophy of individualism, self‐​reliance, and free enterprise at home and abroad, and words matter. They change the climate of opinion, and they inspire people trapped in illiberal societies. And these days, when people claiming the Reagan mantle push for wars or military involvement in Iraq, Iran, Syria, and other danger spots, we remember that Reagan challenged the Soviet Union mostly in the realm of ideas; he used military force only sparingly. George W. Bush, whom some call “Reagan’s true political heir,” increased federal spending by more than a trillion dollars even before the financial crisis. We watch the antigay crusading of today’s conservative Republicans and remember that Reagan publicly opposed the early antigay Briggs Initiative of 1978 (featured in the movie _Milk_ ).   
  
  
And in those moments libertarians are tempted to paraphrase the theme song of _All in the Family_ and say, “Mister, we could use a man like Ronald Reagan again.”   
  
  
Would that the current assault on economic freedom would turn up another presidential candidate with Reagan’s values and talents. More on Reagan here and here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNowhere have records been falling faster than in Antarctica. And what is shocking is that these records are all tied to cooling – and not warming.
Antarctica has been setting new maximum sea ice records almost daily, and never has Antarctic sea ice been so high for so long since satellite measurements began some 35 years ago. Sea ice anomaly has averaged over 1 million square kilometers for over one year.

Figure 1: Antarctic sea ice anomaly. The mean of the past three decades has been rising for 30 years. Approximate mean bars added by author. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
Almost daily observers of southern hemispheric sea ice have been hearing of a new record for ice extent for the date. The overall trend is not something that can be regarded as a recent anomaliy attributed to natural weather-like variability. Rather it really has to do with multidecadal trends that are unrelated to manmade CO2 emissions.
Iciest Antarctic decade ever
Figure 1 above shows how each south polar decade is icier than the one before. There is only one reason for this: There is less and less heat down there to prevent ice from forming, which seems to squarely contradict claims of a warming that is global.
In total the global (Arctic and Antarctic combined) sea ice mean for the last one and half years has been above the long-term mean. Scientists are scrambling to find out what has gone wrong with their model calculations. It wasn’t supposed to be so.
Figure 1 also shows how Antarctic sea ice has remained steadfastly above normal for more than two and half years, something that has never happened since satellite measurements began. Moreover, Anthony Watts here writes: “We are now on day 1001 of positive anomaly based on the 1979-2008 baseline.” Scientists who have long claimed the globe is warming are baffled and a few are even so shocked that they are denying it altogether.
The year of daily sea ice records
2014 for Antarctica has been especially icy. Figure 2 below shows how 2014 daily sea ice extent, depicted by the bold red curve, has been setting new record daily highs for the last 5 months.

Figure 2: Sea ice extent for 2014 depicted by red curve. Source: sunshinehours. 
Not only has the sea ice area expanded at the South Pole but so has volume, this according to Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute last October. In a German language press release the Bremerhaven-based AWI concluded that “from various studies the total volume of the Antarctic sea ice has grown over the last years.”

Record low temperatures
Not only record sea ice extent and volume are telling us that Antractica is cooling dramatically, but so are the thermometers. For example last year the National Geographic reported here that NASA had recorded the coldest temperature ever on the Antarctica continent: -136°F. Also the University of Wisconsin, Madison reported that the South Pole Station saw a new record low temperature of -73.8°C (-100.8°F) on June 11, 2012, breaking the previous minimum temperature record of -73.3°C (-99.9°F) set in 1966.
Just weeks ago CFACT reported that the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) saw a record cold of -55.4°C.
In 2010 the Neumayer III station, operated by Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, recorded the lowest temperature at their Antarctic location in their 29 years of operation. The mercury dropped to -50.2°C.
Antarctic freeze-up still being denied
Some global-warming-hypothesizing scientists are finding it difficult to cope with the reality of growing sea ice at the South Pole, some even insisting that it is shrinking, or that the expansion is a sign of warming and that the trend will reverse later in the future. But other experts (skeptics) think these scientists are being naive to think that a trace gas could control the entire global climate system. The climate system, they say, is far too complex and many other more potent factors are really at play. And so these experts aren’t at all surprised by what is going on.
Willie Soon, Professor of astrophysics and geosciences at the Solar and Stellar Physics (SSP) Division of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says, “The South Pole is in sharp contradiction against the CO2 global warming scenarios which were supposed to melt most of the ice masses of the world.” So much so, Soon says, that “it is still being denied by some professional scientists“. Soon says that the freezing of the South Pole is “one fact that shows how much more we need to understand about how the Earth climate system can vary naturally and how different regions are inter-related to each other rather than insisting that all changes and variations must be caused by rising atmospheric CO2 alone.”
Antarctic sea ice should retreat when PDO and AMO cool
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi, who specializes in providing commercial clients with short-term and seasonal forecasts, also thinks other major global factors are at play – for one: ocean surface temperature oscillations in the Pacific and Atlantic, i.e. the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Decadal Oscillation (AMO): “The southern oceans around Antarctic are cool in a warm PDO, but warm in a cool PDO.”
Bastardi believes that once the PDO is well into the cool phase, the Antarctic sea ice will retreat. “If the southern ice cap does not shrink, then that will be a problem, but I have confidence it will.”
But Arctic will recover
Conversely Bastardi thinks that as the AMO enters its cool phase, in about 5 -10 years, the Arctic will be well on its way to recovery. Already we see signs of that starting today. Joe has written an entire essay on this, and it will be posted tomorrow.
In summary: While scientists who have invested careers in tying climate change to CO2 are scrambling to explain the lack of cooperation by the sea ice at the South Pole, other experts think the anomaly is all part of longer term natural cycles which man is powerless to stop.

I would not have believed this if I didn’t see it in print. It’s another example of the playbook pioneered by the late Dr. Steven Schneider. Bolding mine.

“This is a Sophie’s Choice: If we respond to the moral imperative to raise public awareness and alarm about climate, we have to be deceptive.
If we are committed to truth and scientific accuracy, we have to talk in hedged, caveat-filled, probabilistic language that is utterly ineffectual in reaching and activating a tuned-out public.” -David Roberts, Grist

 @drgrist 





@wattsupwiththat I called it a “false dichotomy.” You presented it as my view. Don’t blame your hackery on me.



I replied that the article was misleading:

@drgrist then learn not to write misleading articles

@drgrist if you have a disclaimer, such as should have been with original, happy to add it. Post stays because your wrote those words, notme







  

David Roberts


 @drgrist 


@wattsupwiththat I didn’t do enough to prevent your misunderstanding, so you’re sticking with it?






  

Watts Up With That @wattsupwiththat

@drgrist just add disclaimer that you don’t endorse what u wrote in that para to ur article, assuming isn’t insult re: this, I’ll add it.







  

David Roberts


 @drgrist 


@wattsupwiththat It’s not my job to correct your posts. You know it’s wrong & misleading. You can choose to leave it up or not.



From my perspective, it looks more like he’s embarrassed about it after the fact, maybe because he was getting some flak. The problem with his argument is that his “false dichotomy” statement is three paragraphs above the one where he talks about the “Sophie’s Choice” and to me there’s not an obvious statement that he doesn’t believe what he wrote.
My offer is that if he wants to distance himself from that paragraph, he can add a disclaimer or clarification, and I’ll be happy to follow up with that here. I think it is a fair offer.
Why don’t I believe him about his “Sophie’s Choice” paragraph as not being his view? it has a lot to do with statements like this:
Grist Magazine’s staff writer David Roberts called for the Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” who were members of what he termed the global warming “denial industry.”
Roberts wrote in the online publication on September 19, 2006, “When we’ve finally gotten serious about global warming, when the impacts are really hitting us and we’re in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage, we should have war crimes trials for these bastards — some sort of climate Nuremberg.” (http://gristmill.grist.org/print/2006/9/19/11408/1106?show_comments=no )
Source: http://epw.senate.gov/fact.cfm?party=rep&id=264568
When a person has tendency to make such hateful and outlandish claims, one tends to believe that he’d make another similar claim, especially since he has not retracted his Nuremberg claim.
If Mr. Roberts does not believe what he wrote about “Sophie’s Choice” I’ll happily issue a correction here if he makes a caveat, disclaimer, or clarification to that effect on his own article.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the online Spiegel here, science journalist Axel Bojanowski writes about the 15-year pause in global warming, which Nature here calls “the biggest mystery in climate science.”
Bojanowski describes a situation where scientists have been taken aback by the unexpected pause, and are now scrambling for a way to explain it, or to deny that it even exists. Some “sense a campaign” behind the claims of a warming pause and say the media is overhyping it. The warming continues, some scientists insist. There’s been “a breakdown in the communication” of the science, Spiegel quotes other warmist scientists.
The problem that Spiegel describes seems to be one where the observed data was allowed to speak for itself to the public before the scientists ever got the chance to repackage it to their liking.
Spiegel writes, quoting Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading:
Since 1990 in its 5 reports the UN IPCC failed somewhat to provide clear details over the possibilities of a slowdown in warming. Studies on this were ‘first published after the pause’.”
Bojanowski looks into why this is so. In a nutshell: That a slowdown in warming was possible never even occurred to the scientists. Reality caught them with their pants down.

He writes:
Climate models had never expected the pause: Only 3 of 114 climate simulations were able to reproduce the trend of the past years, the IPCC concludes in its latest report. The reason for the deviation between models and observations is unclear.”
Bojanowski then presents some of the explanations now being floated for the “pause”: volcanoes, Pacific trade winds, heat hidden deep in the ocean, PDO, solar activity, Chinese air pollution, and even “faulty” methodology for computing the global temperature (it’s warming after all).
At the end he quotes University of Colorado environmental sociologist Maxwell Boykoff, who offers climate scientists a little advice on communicating the science:
Our studies have shown which strategies promise no success: vindictive, condescending and dogmatic lecturings.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a bid to protect consumers and investors. The Berlin-based consumer investor protection organization Verbraucherzentrale für Kapitalanleger (VzfK) has issued a press release here warning Deutsche Bank AG of the high risks of investments in “dubious renewable energy companies” and their projects after a string of spectacular insolvencies.
Hat-tip: EIKE.
What follows is the VzfK press release, translated to English:
The Verbraucherzentrale für Kapitalanleger [Consumer Agency for Investors] has sent an open letter to Jürgen Fitschen, the spokesman of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank AG, warning of engagement in the sector of renewable energies. The VzfK especially requests a critical review of customer relations to controversial project developer juwi AG based in Wörrstadt.
The VzfK argues that the spectacular insolvency of Prokon, Windwärts, Windreich, Solar Millennium AG and many other dubious renewable energy companies leads us to expect further damage not only to capital investors, but also to shareholders of credit institutes due to the sheer grievances in the sector of renewable energies. The VzfK requests the Deutsche Bank board of directors to assure that the damage to Deutsche Bank AG, its shareholders, and customers be minimized through appropriate portfolio measures and credit decisions. Especially requested is a critical review of the credit engagement that has come under fire because of the corruption scandal in Thuringia and controversial wind projects in the Hochtaunus nature reserve by project developer juwi AG.
Referring to the federal government’s Council of Expert Advisors the VzfK expects the EEG renewable energy feed-in system has to collapse and that economic damage of at least triple-digit billions are to be expected. Already today consumers are groaning and German industry are burdened by ludicrously high costs compared to other European countries and internationally. Energy prices are often more than 50% higher than those in neighboring countries or in the USA. In other words: German workers, as electric power customers, are paying for a gigantic job destruction program. The EEG system is only forcing the chemical industry and other energy-intensive industries to move abroad.
Dr. Martin Weimann, Chairman of the VzfK: “We ask the board to use the societal and political influence of Deutsche Bank AG to act to bring about a stop to the EEG feed-in system and to usher a fundamental reform for the interests of the stakeholders.“
In the letter itself, Weimann writes:
Should the renewable energy support continue to develop further and go on unbraked, burdens to the economy to the tune of over one trillion euros are to be feared.”

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s travel ban, arguing that a judicial block endangered national security and violated the separation of powers. Whatever the coming ruling, it will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court. The legal and political backlash from the rollout of the order and other missteps have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking their improvisational approach to governing. We got an inside look at the confusion within the White House, where aides sometimes confer in the dark because they can’t figure out the light switches. Above, a protest after the ban was announced. _____ 2. With the ban blocked, dozens of Syrian and Iraqi refugees boarded a plane in Amman, Jordan, and headed to the U. S. full of hope but also some trepidation. “Goodbyes are difficult,” said one man. “But we are going where there will be a future for us. ” _____ 3. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence could be called upon break a   tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed this week, along with Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Today’s episode of our new podcast, The Daily, focuses on Mr. Trump’s changes to   financial rules. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ 4. Ajit Pai, the new head of Federal Communications Commission, wasted no time. His first target was net neutrality. He released about a dozen actions in the past week, many buried on the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. _____ 5. Israel’s Parliament passed a provocative law that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land. It was an assertive move by the right wing  —   but the law will likely be struck down by the country’s high court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on his way back from a meeting with Britain’s leaders as the law was being debated. _____ 6. Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee, marking 65 years on the British throne, brought new coins, a stamp and gun salutes. The only thing missing? The queen, 90, who spent a private and reflective day out of the public eye. _____ 7. A    Syrian refugee in Germany whose selfie with Angela Merkel ended up on fake news websites is suing Facebook. The fake news articles linked him to terrorism, and he’s seeking to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image. “Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie,” he said. _____ 8. Some remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago. Not only are there extremely effective treatments, but a vaccine accepted by the W. H. O. is being stockpiled for epidemics. And soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. _____ 9. The story of Ona Judge, a slave held by Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington, reveals a great deal about the harsh reality of slavery under a founding father often praised for having freed his slaves upon his death. Hearing that she was to be given away, Ms. Judge escaped from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796, embarrassing the Washingtons. She got to New Hampshire, where she evaded George Washington’s dogged, sometimes illegal efforts to recapture her. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’ ” one historian observed. Above, Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the author of a new book about Ms. Judge. _____ 10. What a game, huh? The New England Patriots made a comeback for the ages (and the record books) in the fourth quarter of the 51st Super Bowl. No team had ever come back from such a gaping deficit in the big game. But there has never been anyone like Tom Brady, either. Our columnist calls him “unbelievable and unforgettable,” even if as many people seem to despise him as love him. And while he set the stage for a ratings bonanza, early numbers indicate the game was less watched than last year’s. _____ 11. Americans may be divided, but some things still bring them together. Like meatloaf. Two Times writers, the   columnist Frank Bruni and the Congressional correspondent Jennifer Steinhauer, were able to bypass all kinds of societal fractures as they collected material from celebrity chefs and politicians for a book of 50 meatloaf recipes (including a vegetarian one) and related ruminations. Paul Ryan “was much more interested in talking to me about meatloaf than he was the earned tax credit,” Ms. Steinhauer said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

"**The Netherlands has made it compulsory to wear a face mask in indoor public spaces in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.**
The country is one of the last in Europe to introduce such a measure.
The rule will apply to those over the age of 13 in public buildings such as shops, railway stations and hairdressers from Tuesday.
The Netherlands has been one of the countries worst affected by Europe's second wave of Covid-19.
It broke daily case records throughout October, and the number of new confirmed infections in the country of 17 million has remained fairly stable at about 5,000 a day for several weeks.
The new face mask rule will remain in place for at least three months, with those who ignore it facing a fine of up to â¬95 (Â£85; $113).
But there are questions over how the measure will be enforced. Major retail chains have said they will inform customers about the rule but not refuse entry to those without a face covering.
""This is not something which we consider part of our job as shop workers,"" a spokesman for the Mirage retail group said.
Separately, under the measure, students and teachers will have to wear a mask when moving around school buildings but not during lessons. Teachers who move around the classroom while talking, however, will have to put on a face covering.
Places of worship, such as churches, temples, and mosques, are exempt.
""Making face masks mandatory almost everywhere makes it clearer what the rules are,"" a government website reads. ""[We] want to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.""
The Dutch have tied themselves up in knots over this issue.
As neighbouring nations followed World Health Organization advice (the body recommends wearing a mask to help reduce the spread of the virus), the government refused to follow suit and insisted it was being ""guided by the science"".
Scientists here doubted whether masks were effective. In fact, the prime minister even spoke of potential risks they posed and suggested they gave people a false sense of security.
Moreover, at the start of the crisis the Dutch were told they didn't need to be treated like children with curfews and other sweeping measures. That has made it harder for the government to convince people they do now need to be told what to do. This inconsistency has caused confusion and reduced compliance.
It's also worth noting that the coalition cabinet is made up of five political parties that have been battling with competing priorities: the economy, civil liberties and people's health.
The much-lauded Dutch ""live and let live"" mentality has also been used as an excuse for people not to change their habits or lifestyles. That said, the latest figures collected by the Dutch public health institute suggest 84% of people ""support the principle"" of wearing a mask.
Earlier in the year, the Dutch government adopted a strategy of ""intelligent lockdown"" that avoided strict national restrictions and did not shut down as much of public life as in many other countries.
At the time, Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the Netherlands as a ""grown-up country"" where people were glad to be ""treated as adults"".
Only in September were people in the country's major cities advised to wear face masks in shops."

Any entity seeking to have an impact on the course of foreign policy in Washington D.C. should have an orientating position paper--a take on the currents of national strategy. All too often the national security community has ceded the intellectual ground to policymakers and professors alike. One camp might give us evidence for action with little context for implementation (the academics). Another may give us a desired means of achieving a goal, but little consideration for feasibility (policymakers). In _Building a Modern Military_, released on May 26, 2020, the Cato Institute’s defense and foreign policy team seeks to provide an orientating guide to the future of U.S. national security policy with a strong concern for feasibility and the implementation of our ideas.



We began work on _Building a Modern Military_ in the summer of last year. The goal was to produce a yearly budget analysis document. Over time this project evolved into so much more. While the budget is a big part of our project, we are more concerned with overall strategy and the strategic challenges that might upset United States’ standing in the world.



After we had written _Building the Modern Military_ at the turn of the year, perhaps the greatest national security challenge United States has ever faced since World War II occurred: COVID-19. We considered scrapping everything we had done and reorienting ourselves for the challenge of global health. We found, though, that the words written last year were still prescient. We never predicted a global pandemic, but we did push for budget adjustments, military innovation, and a realignment of strategic deterrence. All three of these issues remain relevant.



Moving forward we have a deeper challenge to re-conceptualize just what security might mean in the age of COVID-19. The topics we tackle next year will have to morph and change with the times. We will still advocate a restraint-based strategy that considers the priority of national defense and enabling our allies as opposed to a global geostrategic umbrella that defends neither the homeland nor our allies. But just how we defend the homeland and what we spend to do so will have to change.



Some future challenges are already known. How do we enable defenses against cyber threats and information operations given that we are more dependent now than ever before on digital connectivity? How do we ensure that global repression is not a common outgrowth of the rise of the surveillance state to support health initiatives? How do we move on from legacy technologies that no longer serve a strategic purpose?



Moving forward, budget cuts are going to have to be drastically more intense than ever due to the pandemic's prolonged economic harm. We will be required to make tough choices. The United States is a country built on tough choices and has endured for generations. It will meet the coming challenge of global pandemics, climate change, and the rise of near peer competitors, but it will not change American values and intentions. Our goal is stability while maintaining security, moving beyond the failures of leadership and coordination that the United States recently witnessed.



As we eventually move past the pandemic and think about recovery, we must also remember what we have lost during this period of turbulence. The significant amount of lives lost, the resulting loss of prestige and position internationally as a global leader in health, and the economic harm the United States will experience will reverberate for generations. How we meet this challenge and move forward as a resilient nation will shape how the United States engages with the world for many years to come.

================================================
The German Weather Service has a problem with the climate

By Dr. D. E. Koelle
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
One typically regards the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) as a serious organization that supplies us with reliable weather data. But when it comes to climate, doubt grows when one reads the statements made by leading DWD representatives with respect to the press conference in Berlin over the year 2013.
In it they announce “that the warming is marching on” even though this is not the case according to the DWD’s own data – especially in Germany! Such a claim can only be explained by a political instruction or a hasty allegiance to a government climate policy. Even the director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Prof. Dr. Jochem Marotzke, said “I don’t know of any serious colleague who would deny that it hasn’t gotten warmer over the last years.”
1990 reference period one today date reference period, which is also used in the USA. When that period is used things look quite different:
The year 2013 is 0.2°C below normal.
A second example used is that today is 1.2°C warmer in Germany than in 1881. Here as well a low temperature reference point is selected again. If, for example, the year 1860 were selected, then the difference would be only half as much, approx. 0.6°C.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




And there is no mention of the fact that the annual temperatures in Germany dropped 0.6°C from 2000 to 2013 (using DWD data!) and that 2013 was the second coldest year of the last 14 years (Figure 1). It was not possible to find any chart showing the recent development at any of the DWD’s Internet pages. Obviously it just doesn’t fit with the prescribed climate ideology. Also when one considers the time period since 1990, there has not been any temperature rise. Instead there has been an almost constant level.
A third example mentioned by the DWD is the claim that the 1983 – 2012 time period is likely the warmest of the last 1400 years, citing the IPCC report. Doesn’t the DWD have its own historical data? Doesn’t the DWD know that not only 1000 years ago was it just as warm as today, but also over the last 3200 years it was just as warm on multiple occasions (and that without the influence of CO2)?
Figure 2 depicts the climate history which shows that warm periods were always times of political stability and economic prosperity. On the other hand the cool periods that occurred between the warm ones were times of instability (migration) and famine occurring due to drought.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Inspired by an interesting guest post entitled “An energy model for the future, from the 12th century” over at Judith Curry’s excellent blog, I want to talk a bit about energy storage.
The author of the guest post is partially right. His thesis is that solving the problem of how to store city-sized amounts of electricity would make a very big difference, particularly for intermittent sources like wind and solar. And he’s right, it would. But he’s wrong not to point out how devilishly difficult that goal has been to achieve in the real world.
Storage of electricity is a very strange corner of scientific endeavors. Almost everything in a 2013 car is very different from what was in a 1913 car … except for the battery. Automobile batteries are still lead-acid, and the designs only differ slightly from those of a hundred years ago.
Figure 1. Elements of a lead-acid car battery. SOURCE 
Now, we do have nicads and such, but the automobile storage battery is the bellwether for the inexpensive storage of electricity. Cars need a surprisingly large amount of energy to start, particularly if they are balky. If there were a cheaper way to store that big charge, it would be on every car on the planet. Given that huge market, and the obvious profits therein, people have been busting their heads against the problem since before Thomas Edison made his famous statement about automobile batteries.
And despite that century-long huge application of human ingenuity, in 2013 the lead-acid battery still rules. It’s an anomaly, like fusion energy, a puzzle that has proven incredibly hard to solve. Potential solutions have all fallen by the wayside, due to cost, or capacity, or energy density, or dangerous components, or long-term stability, or clogging, or rarity of materials, or a habit of exploding or melting down, or manufacturing difficulties, the number of pitfalls is legion.
So I’ll get excited when we have something other than lead-acid batteries in our cars. Because that will be evidence that we’ve taken the first step … but even that won’t be enough. The other problem is the huge amount of energy we’re talking about. Here’s some back-of-the-envelope figures.
New York City’s electricity consumption averaged over a 24/7/365 basis is on the order of 5 gigawatts (5E+09 watts) continuous. Let’s take a city a tenth of that size, there’s plenty of them on the planet, China alone has dozens and dozens of cities that big, and lets consider how much storage we’d need to provide three days of stored electrical energy for that city. The numbers look like this
5.0E+08 watts continuous times

72 hours equals

3.6E+10 watt-hours of storage times

3.6E+03 seconds/hour gives

1.3E+14 joules of storage needed
So that means we’d need to store 130 terajoules (130E+12 joules) of energy … the only problem is, very few people have an intuitive grasp of how much energy 130 terajoules is, and I’m definitely not one of them.
So let me use a different unit of energy, one that conveys more to me. That unit is “Hiroshima-sized atom bombs”. The first atomic bomb ever used in a war, the Hiroshima bomb released the unheard of, awesome energy of 60 terajoules, enough to flatten a city.
And we’re looking to store about twice that much energy …
I’m sure that you can see the problems with scalability and safety and energy density and resource availability and security for that huge amount of energy.
So while I do like the guest author’s story, and he’s right about the city-sized storage being key … it’s a wicked problem.
Finally, as usual, Judith has put up an interesting post on her interesting blog. I don’t subscribe to a lot of blogs, but hers is near the top of the list. My thanks for her contribution to the ongoing discussion.
w.
PS—Edison’t famous statement about automobile batteries? He was offered big money in those days, something like ten grand from memory, to design and build a better battery for electric automobiles than the lead-acid battery. He took the money and went back to his laboratory. Month after month, there was no news from him. So the businessmen who’d put up the money went to see him. He said he didn’t have the battery, and in fact he didn’t even have the battery design.
Naturally, they accused him of having taken their money and done nothing. No, he assured them, that wasn’t right at all.
He said there had actually been significant progress, because he now knew of more than fifty ways NOT to make a battery for an electric automobile …
Curiously, Edison ended up inventing a nickel-iron-peroxide battery, which was a commercial failure … so even he couldn’t get past lead-acid.
Similarly, we now know hundreds and hundreds of ways not to make a battery for a city. So I suppose that’s progress in Edison’s terms, but after a century the wait’s getting long. I suspect we’ll solve the puzzle eventually, perhaps with something like a vanadium flow battery or whatever, but dang … it’s a slow one.
