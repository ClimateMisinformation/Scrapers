One of Germany’s major power grid operators, Tennet, announced it is “massively increasing power grid fees” and that “power is going to be more expensive“.
Exploding costs, unstable supply
This is another setback for German power consumers, who have seen their power bills explode since Germany enacted the renewable energy feed in tariffs into law as part of the Energiewende (transition to renewable energies).

German power used to be affordable, and highly reliable. But all that has changed since climate hysteria and the green movement took over 15 years ago. Today German power is among the most expensive worldwide.
FOCUS writes:

Power companies will have to deal with a higher electric bill next year. Power grid operator Tennet is increasing its price massively, and bases this on the resulting costs of the Energiewende.”

FOCUS quotes Tennet Director Urban Keussen:

Our power grid fees will increase 80 percent on January 1st.”

For a three-person household, this will mean another 30 euros burden annually, says Keussen.
“Grid stabilization emergency measures”
Moreover the highly volatile wind and solar energies have made the German grid highly unstable and have recently seen it on the verge of collapse. The major problem is that the power grid has been far from adequately expanded to accommodate the briskly expanding solar and wind energy capacity, thus leading to gigantic transmission bottlenecks and massive grid instability.
In fact the added costs in grid fees will have very little to do with grid expansion itself. Rather they are mostly due to “grid stabilization emergency measures” to prevent a total collapse.  FOCUS writes:
The lion’s share of the increase in grid fees from Tennet are due to grid stabilization emergency measures,’ said Keussen. ‘Only 5% are because of grid expansion.'”
FOCUS adds that in 2015 alone “bottleneck management” led to costs totaling about 1 billion euros.

Some 15 years ago German Environment Minister, Jürgen Trittin, wanted the public to believe that Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) would only cost consumers about as much as one scoop of ice cream per month. Since those famous words were spoken that scoop has ballooned to a jumbo bucket of Ben and Jerry’s.
Never have German consumers paid so much for electricity. Indeed one study concluded that the high cost of electricity in Germany is resulting in hundreds of thousands of German households having their power cut off because families can no longer afford the high electric bills – see here and here. It just goes to show that under reckless political management even a scoop of ice cream can become a luxury.
The BZ reports:

According to media reports, 24.1 billion euros were paid out to green energy producers last year. That is 2.6 billion euros, or 12 percent, more than in 2014.”
The costs are rising so fast that some leading politicians are (finally) beginning to sound the alarms. The BZ writes that leading conservative politician Michael Fuchs of Angela Merkel’s CDU party “fears the worst“, telling the flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the Energiewende “is on the best path to becoming a financial disaster”.
And despite the massive investment, wind energy was only able to deliver 13% of Germany’s electricity needs last year – and that in a year which was a relatively windy one.
What will be the consequence of all the Bernie-Sanders-“free” green energy in the future? The Berliner Zeitung writes: “Higher costs”.
One reason for the higher costs, the BZ writes, is because of the governments plan to boost investment in offshore wind parks – and slow down the construction of onshore parks. The problem with that plan is that offshore wind energy is far more expensive. Offshore wind park operators are guaranteed up to 19.4 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour – which is some three times more than what onshore operators get.
And there’s still remains the problem of getting offshore wind energy to markets inland.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the past couple of days an “explosive scandal” has erupted in Germany.
Apparently traces of Monsanto pesticide product Glyphosate has been detected in 14 of Germany’s top beer brands, read background here. OMG!

Greens warn of a “health danger”: Those 50,000,000 micrograms of alcohol in 1 liter of beer might contain a whole 29 micrograms of “unlikely carcinogenic” Glyphosate! Photo: normalkneipe.de/
 This story is just the latest that so vividly illustrates how Green clean-freaks can erupt into a fit of irrational hysteria. And the drone media just blindly run with it.
According to the Environmental Institute in Munich, tests on 14 German beer brands that have the highest sales figures in the country were found to contain “traces of the pesticide”.
The highest intensity of the pesticide was allegedly found in Hasseröder brand beer with over 29 micrograms of the chemical per litre. Note here that we are talking about a few millionths of a single gram, and per liter concentrations in the billionths.
According to the English-language The Local here, the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled Glyphosate “potentially carcinogenic” in 2015. That means they are not even sure. And the EU food safety authority Efsa concluded that it was “unlikely that Glyphosate poses a cancer risk to humans”.
In a nutshell: the evidence showing that Glyphosate is carcinogenic, especially at those low levels, is scant at best.

Alcohol concentration million times higher
What makes the story all the more comical is that by comparison German beer contains alcohol, and at concentrations of near 5%, or 50,000,000 micrograms. German blogger Ludger Weß here discusses just how ridiculous the reaction of the German Green clean-freaks has been. He notes that the chemical alcohol has been put in the highest hazard category (Class 1 – carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
The German Greens are thus demanding the public be hysterically concerned about 30 micrograms of “unlikely carninogenic” Glyphosate in beer, and not to worry at all about the comparatively whopping 50,000,000 microns of Class 1 carcinogen alcohol in the beer.
Weß adds sarcastically (paraphrasing): “What’s next? Tests to see if cigarettes might contain trace amounts of Glyphosate ?”
So what motive could be behind the irrational hysteria that has been brewed up by the green-leaning Environmental Institute in Munich? The Local writes:
With Monsanto’s licence to sell the pesticide running out in the summer, the European Commission will have to once again consider whether the product is safe for use in the EU.”
Just the latest dirty attack by environmentalists and greens aimed at an industry it wants to destroy. Create a scare story about a non-problem.
It’s always a good idea to really put all scare stories of environmentalist greens into the correct perspective. Almost all the time they are completely false and irrational.

"WASHINGTON  —   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president’s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president’s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. “We’re not willing to be wrong on this subject,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” he said in a written statement. “This is not about religion  —   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ” He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama’s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. “I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,” he said. “My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ” While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. “Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,” he wrote. “We cannot allow this horror to continue!” His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York’s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was “in compliance with judicial orders. ” Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and “they said we’ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,” Mr. Connolly said. “I said that’s not acceptable,” he continued. “We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That’s where the problem is, and that’s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ” The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to “claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ” The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. “We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,” he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America’s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she “is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did “not agree with this kind of approach. ” The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump’s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. “Shame,” they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie “Finding Dory. ” “No hate, no fear,” they added later. “Refugees are welcome here. ” Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ” Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump’s handling of the issue. “We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,” said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs’ donor network. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was “poorly implemented” and urged the president to “make appropriate revisions. ” Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ”"
"**The number of refugees fleeing the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia - where federal and regional forces are engaged in fighting - has reduced drastically after soldiers were deployed to the border with Sudan.**
The BBC first spotted the soldiers on Wednesday, at the Hamdayet border crossing point, and has been hearing testimonies from refugees who say their relatives are being blocked from leaving Ethiopia.
""I arrived yesterday morning and I wanted to go back home to bring my family here,"" said one man who did not want to be identified. Speaking on the banks of River Sittet in Hamdayet, he told the BBC he had been unable to return to Tigray to get his relatives because ""there are soldiers on the border and those who had gone before me were asked not to return"".
The Ethiopian government has not responded to repeated BBC requests for comment on the accusation.
Across the river that straddles the border, about a dozen soldiers stand at intervals on hilltops looking in the direction of Tigray. Boats parked on both sides of what is usually a busy crossing point are largely unused.
Dozens of refugees have gathered to look at the newly deployed federal soldiers on the Ethiopian side of the border. Others - both refugees and Sudanese - have been down to the river to fetch water or wash. A group of children have been swimming and playing in the water.
But mystery lies in the land beyond this river. An information blackout in Tigray has meant that separated families have been unable to communicate.
Human Rights Watch, quoting refugees who have recently arrived in Sudan, has reported that Ethiopian soldiers have been blocking civilians in Humera, about 20km (12.5 miles) from the border, which it says has resulted in ""a massive drop in the number of refugees reaching Sudan"".
Data from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that new refugee numbers peaked around 10 November, with more than 6,800 people crossing into Sudan in a single day. The average number arriving daily has been 3,000, officials told the BBC. However, since Ethiopian troops were deployed along the border, the number has dropped to about 700 a day.
An 11-year-old girl was among those who arrived before refugee movement was restricted. She fled alone from her grandmother's home, where she had heard gunfire - her grandmother was too old to run.
""I had to spend the night in the wilderness. I was frightened. I had no clothes and no money,"" she said. ""After that I saw someone driving a tractor and begged him to drive me to the border.""
Once she had crossed the Sittet river, she gave out her father's phone number. Father and daughter were reunited at the Um Raquba refugee camp on Wednesday. Her father, who walked around the camp protectively holding her hand, said she had witnessed people getting shot.
Earth movers have been clearing ground for more construction at the camp, located about 70km from the border. A new World Food Programme tent was being set up when we arrived. Many refugees were also busy digging holes in the ground, mounting poles or covering the makeshift structures with wide mats to make new shelters.
In just three weeks, more than 43,000 refugees have fled into Sudan, according to the UNHCR. Aid agencies have been struggling to keep up with the rising numbers. ""Our humanitarian response is overstretched,"" UNHCR said, adding: ""Support is urgently needed.""
The Ethiopian government appears keen not only to keep people from fleeing, but also to return any refugees to the country.
After meeting envoys from the African Union on Friday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement that the government was ready to ""receive, rehabilitate and resettle citizens that have fled by setting up four camps established to rehabilitate returnees before resettling them back into their original locales"".
What he meant by ""rehabilitation"" was not immediately clear.
The federal government has also said it would provide humanitarian assistance access to refugees and displaced people in the northern Tigray region. Before the offensive was launched on 4 November, the region was already hosting about 100,000 Eritrean refugees in four camps, according to the UNHCR.
Last week, the organisation said it had not heard from staff in the camps in five days. ""We are very worried,"" UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said in a statement, while calling for unimpeded access to the camps. ""Rations were provided until the end of November, so it is increasingly critical for humanitarian workers to have access and for additional food to be distributed before refugees run out.""
Back in Sudan, refugees remain in limbo. Some are waiting at the Hamdayet border crossing, hoping that their families will join them. Then, they could hop onto the almost daily convoys of lorries modified to carry passengers through the rugged terrain in eastern Sudan to refugee camps.
But in the camps, many also hope the crisis will be resolved soon, allowing them to get back to their normal lives - and children like the 11-year-old who travelled alone could return to school or play with their friends."

"WASHINGTON  —   As President Trump signed a sweeping executive order on Friday, shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim countries, the secretary of homeland security was on a White House conference call getting his first full briefing on the global shift in policy. Gen. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, had dialed in from a Coast Guard plane as he headed back to Washington from Miami. Along with other top officials, he needed guidance from the White House, which had not asked his department for a legal review of the order. Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office. “The president is signing the executive order that we’re discussing,” the official said, stunned. The global confusion that has since erupted is the story of a White House that rushed to enact, with little regard for basic governing, a core campaign promise that Mr. Trump made to his most fervent supporters. In his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed other executive actions with little or no legal review, but his order barring refugees has had the most explosive implications. Passengers were barred from flights to the United States, customs and border control officials got instructions at 3 a. m. Saturday and some arrived at their posts later that morning still not knowing how to carry out the president’s orders. “The details of it were not thought through,” said Stephen Heifetz, who served in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, as well as the C. I. A. under the previous three presidents. “It is not surprising there was mass confusion, and I expect the confusion and chaos will continue for some time. ” Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, oversaw the writing of the order, which was done by a small White House team, including Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s policy chief. But it was first imagined more than a year ago, when Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican nomination, reacted to terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. by calling for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” In the months that followed, Mr. Trump’s campaign tried to back away from the proposal, which was seen by Democrats as    campaign rhetoric that would never be reality. Mr. Trump offered few details as the campaign progressed, and as   he promised to protect the country from terrorists with only vague promises of “extreme vetting. ” But Mr. Bannon, who believes in highly restrictive immigration policies and saw barring refugees as vital to shoring up Mr. Trump’s political base, was determined to make it happen. He and a small group made up of the president’s closest advisers began working on the order during the transition so that Mr. Trump could sign it soon after taking office. A senior administration official said that the order was drafted in cooperation with some immigration experts on Capitol Hill and members of the “beachhead teams”  —   small groups of political appointees sent by the new White House to be liaisons and begin work at the agencies. James Jay Carafano, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team, said that little of that work was shared with career officials at the Homeland Security Department, the State Department or other agencies. There was “a firewall between the old administration and the incoming one,” Mr. Carafano said. One reason, he said, is that when the Trump transition team asked pointed questions suggesting new policies to the career officials, those questions were swiftly leaked to the news media, generating negative stories. So the Trump team began to limit the information they discussed with officials from the previous administration. “Why share it with them?” Mr. Carafano said. R. Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama, said that his staff had little communication with Mr. Trump’s transition team, who made no mention of a bar on entry for people from certain countries. White House officials in the meantime insisted to reporters at a briefing that Mr. Trump’s advisers had been in contact with officials at the State and Homeland Security Departments for “many weeks. ” One official added, “Everyone who needed to know was informed. ” But that apparently did not include members of the president’s own cabinet. Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense, did not see a final version of the order until Friday morning, only hours before Mr. Trump arrived to sign it at the Pentagon. Mr. Mattis, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations, was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the order and was not given an opportunity to provide input while the order was being drafted. Last summer, Mr. Mattis sharply criticized Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration as a move that was “causing us great damage right now, and it’s sending shock waves through the international system. ” Customs and Border Protection officers were also caught unaware. They contacted several airlines late Friday that were likely to be carrying passengers from the seven countries and “instructed the airlines to offload any passport holders from those countries,” said a state government official who has been briefed on the agency’s actions. It was not until 3 a. m. on Saturday that customs and border officials received limited written instructions about what to do at airports and border crossings. They also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order, which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case. One customs officer, who declined to be quoted by name, said he was given a limited briefing about what to do as he went to his post on Saturday morning, but even managers seemed unclear. People at the agency were blindsided, he said, and are still trying to figure things out, even as people are being stopped from coming into the United States. “If the secretary doesn’t know anything, how could we possibly know anything at this level?” the officer said, referring to Mr. Kelly. At the Citizenship and Immigration Service, staff members were told that the agency should stop work on any application filed by a person from any of the countries listed in the ban. Employees were told that applicants should be interviewed, but that their cases for citizenship, green cards or other immigration documents should be put on pause, pending further guidance. The timing of the executive order and the lack of advance warning had homeland security officials “flying by the seat of their pants,” to try to put policies in place, one official said. By Saturday, as the order stranded travelers around the world and its full impact became clear, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, became increasingly upset about how the program had been rolled out and communicated to the public. By Sunday morning, Mr. Priebus had to defend the immigration ban on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he insisted that the executive order was rolled out smoothly. He also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order’s restrictions on entry to the United States would not apply to legal permanent residents “going forward. ” As White House officials also insisted on Sunday that the order had gone through the usual process of scrutiny and approval by the Office of Legal Counsel, the continuing confusion forced Mr. Kelly to clarify the waiver situation. He issued a statement making clear that lawful permanent residents  —   those who hold valid green cards  —   would be granted a waiver to enter the United States unless information suggested that they were a security threat. But senior White House officials insisted on Sunday night that the executive order would remain in force despite the change, and that they were proud of taking actions that they said would help protect Americans against threats from potential terrorists. That assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor, which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s second full week in the Oval Office. Mr. Carafano said he believed that the substance of Mr. Trump’s executive order was neither radical nor unreasonable. But he said that Mr. Trump’s team could have delayed signing the order until they had better prepared the bureaucracy to carry it out. He also said the president and his team had not done a good job of communicating to the public the purpose of the executive order. “If there is a criticism of the administration, and I think there is, I think they have done a rotten job of telling their story,” he said. “It is not like they did not know they were going to do this. To not have a cadre of people out there defending the administration  —   I mean, really guys, they should have done this. ”"

This month Education Minister Chris Hipkins changed the school system to **discourage** religious teaching in State schools. Previously it was an opt-out system but he has changed it to an opt in system. The opt-out system requires effort only from those opposed to religious instruction for their children but now that has been reversed. Now parents who support religious instruction are being treated as the minority and as such have to go out of their way in order for their children to be able to take part in it.



This is a **significant change** as it is treating Christianity as an abnormal/unusual choice instead of a mainstream choice relevant to the majority of the New Zealand population. It is a move designed to sideline and eventually remove religious instruction in schools, as parents are far **less likely** to opt-in than to opt-out because opting in will now take effort, which is the opposite of how the system previously worked.



Out with the old in with the new. Not coincidentally a[ **replacement religion**](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/shane-jones-wallops-eco-bible-bashing-climate-change-wombles/) has been introduced to schools at the same time that Christianity is being pushed out the door.



[…] nature abhors a vacuum, and the Government had a quasi-religious substitute locked, loaded and ready to fill the gap. January 13 was also the date on which the far more significant news broke that climate change is to become part of the [school syllabus](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/)[ ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/118909741/lets-respect-all-beliefs-in-schools-including-those-of-nonbelievers)for Years 7-10 pupils, which means those aged between 11 and 14.



[…] This was no sudden political impulse. The climate change curriculum emerged fully formed, with the Greens’ fingerprints all over it.



[…] Join the dots. Out goes religious instruction and in comes its secular substitute in the form of politically charged dogma surrounding climate change. The two announcements neatly complemented each other, serving as a kind of metaphor for wider political and social changes driven by the “progressive” Left.



[…] It is quite explicit about its goal, which is to groom a generation of climate change activists. Apparently drawing inspiration from Greta Thunberg, the teaching resource is threaded with statements such as: “Climate change poses a severe threat to children’s most basic rights”.



It’s a piece of work the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels would have been proud to call his own – one that targets malleable young minds in much the same way as the Hitler Youth did in the 1930s.



[…]Guilt is an unstated sub-text throughout. The message is that Earth has been put at risk through greed and complacency and we must act fast before the process becomes irreversible.



In effect, schoolkids will be captive zealots in training. Indoctrination isn’t too strong a word for this, and it raises questions about the morality of using the public education system to impose adult anxieties and political convictions on the young.



[…] Valid scientific scepticism is caricatured as Donald Trump-style craziness.



Nowhere in the teaching resource is there any acknowledgement that many of the statements it makes are scientifically contestable.



[…] If climate change alarmism is the new religion, then scepticism – or denialism, to use the more damning term favoured by climate-change activists – is the new heresy.



There’s a disturbing whiff of totalitarianism in the way this secular religion permits no dissent. If you believe that it’s dangerous in a democracy to allow one view to hold unchallenged sway, denialism starts to look like an honourable stance, purely on principle.

2020 has arrived and it promises to be one of intense interest, at least for us political tragics. There is our own election, the American election and the ongoing saga of Brexit. No doubt tragics of a different sort will keep banging on about climate change and how death for all of us is just around the corner. Then there will be the United Nations doing their best to march us all on to their misguided utopia of an eventual world government. Oh, and we mustn’t forget the [ludicrous impeachment.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/impeachment-really-about-harming-trump-2020/)



So what might be the outcomes of all of these? Some are easier to predict than others.  
Starting with our own election where, unfortunately, the outcome is by no means a certainty. Had National performed in Opposition as effectively as David Seymour then I think we could be more confident of a result to our liking. National need to hammer home the things they will do that set them apart from Labour. Getting rid of [Kiwibuild](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/resignation-another-hole-in-the-kiwibuild-ship/), a moderate message on climate change, start supporting legal gun owners, bringing back oil and gas exploration and charter schools and building roads. They should also show unequivocal support for our beleaguered farmers with realistic goals and regulations.



The American election looks much easier to predict. It will be tweeter Trump against whichever economic nutter the Democrats select. I just can’t see the Donald losing the election. He has lived up to most of his promises, the economy is strong and the sharemarkets are performing well. For how long is the million-dollar question? He has done well in the area of job creation which means he should maintain support in the rust belt. While some of his policies in relation to trade and foreign affairs might be questionable he overall comes across as a no-nonsense President and not one to be messed with.



[Brexit ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/monty-margaret-backing-boris-on-brexit/)will provide a year of engrossment. Boris will have to show a Trumparian determination to see it through. The EU is already starting to play dirty and act in a cowardly manner as they are only too aware that Boris now has the upper hand. You can expect plenty of political thuggery as this plays out. Boris must not yield any ground to these zealots of the left who despise anyone who thinks differently to them. How successful Brexit is could determine whether or not other countries decide to leave thereby hastening the end of a thoroughly obnoxious organisation.



The insane lot in the Green Party will no doubt keep wanting us to be forever having to change our knickers over their verbal emissions on climate change…while they get theirs in a twist. We can expect a lot more grandstanding from [Greta ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-bfd-video-13/)as George (Soros) tells her what to say. No doubt all the other political wets around the world will continue to show their undying support to this child marionette of global warming. You have to feel sorry for her.



Despite the major setback to the EU through Brexit, that paragon organisation of the left, the United Nations, will be undeterred in their aims for globalisation. Just last Friday they approved a Russian led bid, backed by China, to create a new convention on cybercrime. Russia and China’s aim will be to extend their **internet censorship** from their countries around the globe. I would hate to think our UN luvvie PM would sign us up to this dangerous convention. It is nothing short of impinging on the rights to free speech.



And finally to the circus that is [Trump’s impeachment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/dim-bulbs-begin-to-light-up-that-impeachment-might-be-a-pyrrhic-victory/) led by the clowns from the Democrats with poor old Nancy forced to play the role of ringmaster. Ocasio-Cortez and her squad are pulling the strings from the high wires while Schiff, Nadler and co are the chimpanzees running the tea party. It appears Senate Democrats have a few more clues than their House counterparts as they are now expressing concern that the impeachment will only strengthen Trump’s hand following his acquittal in the Senate. They have come to the conclusion that the Donald will be able to say he did nothing wrong and the whole thing was a witch hunt. Correct, but we at _The BFD_ could have told them that at the start. This proves again that those on the Left are not the brightest of the human species. Hello Wellington.



However, you look at 2020, it’s going to hold our interest in more ways than one. And that’s before we get to prognosticating on how well Ian Foster will succeed as All Black coach! So many things to think about. But being on the right side, the bright side, I’m sure we’ll all cope.



Happy 2020!

"The moment Joanna Acevedo first set foot in a boxing gym, she had a vision of herself standing in the ring, wearing gloves and trading blows with an opponent. But her adoptive mother refused to let her box. She was too much of a fighter out of the ring. Ms. Acevedo, who as a child would not back down from a schoolyard brawl, said her irascible nature stemmed from years spent in the foster system. Her birth mother had a substance abuse problem, and her father was in prison for much of her life. “I grew up not being loved at all,” Ms. Acevedo, 22, said. “If you tell me how it feels for somebody to love me, I wouldn’t even know. ” She distracted herself with heavy partying and dropped out of high school. In 2011, Ms. Acevedo was arrested on robbery and assault charges. After her release from the Rikers Island jail complex, Ms. Acevedo vowed to correct her errant path. She returned to Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School in the South Bronx and received her diploma. She also connected with a social worker from the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Then Ms. Acevedo finally took up boxing. “Boxing has changed my life from zero to 100,” she said. “It helped me stop drinking, smoking, clubbing. That’s all I was doing at one point. ” The sport brought   and a focus she had never known. Ms. Acevedo devoted herself to it, competing in numerous tournaments across New York City. In 2014, she learned she was pregnant. Her first instinct was not to go through with the pregnancy. But she decided to become a mother in part because she dreamed of training alongside her daughter at the boxing gym. Ms. Acevedo gave birth to Serenity in July 2015. Her daughter, she said, has helped her experience life in a new way. “The only love I have is for my daughter,” Ms. Acevedo said. “Once I had my daughter and I cried, I felt like this is how it feels to be loved. I love her like crazy. ” Serenity was born with a rare condition called optic nerve hypoplasia. In utero, her pituitary gland shifted in her brain, preventing her optic nerves from fully developing. The extent of her blindness is still unknown. “That’s a one in a million,” Ms. Acevedo said. “My daughter got it. That’s not fair. ” A month after Serenity was born, her father was arrested, and Ms. Acevedo and her baby moved into her mother’s home in the Bronx. Ms. Acevedo does not work. Much of her time is dedicated to caring for Serenity, administering medications and taking her to doctors. Each month, Ms. Acevedo receives about $250 in federal assistance. She is in the process of applying for disability benefits for Serenity. In June, Ms. Acevedo was given $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund by the Children’s Aid Society for gift cards, which were used to buy clothing and food. For a time Ms. Acevedo was able to continue boxing, taking her daughter with her to the gym. As Serenity grew older, more apt to squirm and cry, Ms. Acevedo had to stop going. “Sometimes people can’t accomplish their dream because of a certain situation they’ve got to put first,” she said. “That’s how I feel right now. I can’t really do what I’d love to do because I have to take care of her right now, put her first. ” Her dream of expanding her family has been postponed. Ms. Acevedo is hesitant to have more children, concerned that something could happen to them. And without an outlet for aggression, Ms. Acevedo has become more restless. She has picked back up what she admits is a bad habit: smoking. But she said she would go no further than cigarettes, for fear of losing her daughter. “That’s what keeps me focused,” she said. “I don’t want her reliving a life that I lived. ” Recent experiences have led Ms. Acevedo to consider a career in nursing, but she is not sure when or if she will be able to pursue it. There is no day care for blind children in the city, she said, and she does not trust others to care for Serenity as vigilantly as she does. Ms. Acevedo says she believes in God, and in miracles, and remains hopeful that modern medicine will find a remedy for her daughter’s condition. Ms. Acevedo laments what her daughter will miss: sunsets, the delight in the holiday spectacle of Rockefeller Center or the joy of animals at the zoo. “I’m going to wish she could do this with me, that with me,” Ms. Acevedo said. “I’m never going to let her know, of course. But deep down inside, closed in a room or when she’s sleeping, and I’m up at night, that’s going through my head. ”"
"**Tourists are staying away and retailers are reeling after nearly five months of protests that have dealt a ""devastating"" blow to businesses in Hong Kong, and pushed the economy to the brink.**
Growth figures issued on Thursday showed Hong Kong has entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In the third quarter, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.2% from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.4%.
Ahead of the numbers, the city's leader Carrie Lam warned of a looming recession. She expects the economy to record negative growth for the year.
DBS economist Samuel Tse agrees the upcoming figures will show Hong Kong has sunk into recession - and expects more pain to come.
""We don't think it will rebound that fast,"" Mr Tse says.
The protests - which began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China - have piled pressure on existing economic strains.
Hong Kong has been grappling with the US-China trade war, while a weaker yuan has hit spending from mainland visitors and bruised consumer sentiment.
The controversial extradition bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrations continued and evolved into demands for greater freedoms, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Those dramatic scenes have kept tourists away.
In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Visitor numbers are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to the previous year.
Many hotels are struggling to fill their rooms and Mr Tse says the vacancy rate is sitting around 60%.
Some hotels have slashed prices in the hopes of winning back tourists, while reports suggest many have forced staff to cut work hours or take leave to cope with the slowdown.
Among those to have taken a hit is Ovolo Group. The firm, which operates four hotels in Hong Kong, has seen occupancy rates fall by up to 30% over the past three months.
""It's devastating to see the effect that the recent situation in our city has had on local businesses, particularly those of us in the hospitality industry,"" Ovolo Group's chief executive Girish Jhunjhnuwala says.
Mr Jhunjhnuwala says business is holding up better on weekdays as most guests choose to leave before the weekend, when protests typically kick off. The firm has introduced flexible cancellation policies to help offset uncertainty for guests.
With fewer tourists flying in, airlines have also been knocked. Days of protests at Hong Kong's airport in August, one of the world's busiest transit hubs, led to widespread flight cancelations.
Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers to the territory in the past two months, while Qantas said the protests would hit first-half earnings by A$25m ($17m; Â£13m).
Lighter tourist flows have weighed on retailers in the city, many already battling with softening consumer sentiment from local shoppers.
Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours while workers report fears over their safety as protests have turned violent.
Certain businesses have faced direct attacks.
Vandals have targeted big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have also repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire.
The chaos has led to a sharp fall in retail sales, down 23% in August, the biggest drop on record. The decline in September is expected to be even worse.
Additionally, the long-running unrest has shaken business confidence and frustrated investment. That could have a more lasting impact on the economy, Mr Tse says, as questions and uncertainty remain over Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.
The city has so far injected more than HK$20bn to combat the slowdown including help for the transport, tourism and retail sectors. More relief measures are expected.
But the government argues there's only so much it can do to stem the economic slide.
""To truly cure the problem, we must always work together to stop the violence, stop the destruction of traffic infrastructure and specific target shops, banks and institutionsâ¦ and let the society recover as soon as possible,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.
""Our society and the economy need to take a breather and need to get back on the road."""
"In the world according to President Trump, the United States and Britain are about to make their special relationship great again. Having cast off decades of global niceties  —   the United States by putting him in the White House, Britain by voting to leave the European Union  —   they can now forge a magnificent future. Mr. Trump is readying proof. As he prepares to host Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain at the White House on Friday, he intends to begin discussions on a   agreement that would deepen commercial ties between their countries. A trade agreement would make for useful political theater on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly as President Barack Obama had pointedly warned that a deal would not easily happen. But as a spur to economic expansion and hiring, a deal would almost certainly amount to very little. Until Britain actually leaves Europe  —   a step most likely at least two years away  —   it is legally barred from entering a trade agreement with any country. If a deal was quietly negotiated to take effect after Britain’s departure, its economic punch would probably be modest. Tariffs between the countries are already minimal, meaning there are relatively few trade impediments left to clear away. What areas of business could be opened to increased competition tend to be the most politically sensitive: agriculture, government procurement and defense. Legions of lobbyists would mount ferocious battles to preserve the privileges of   industries. American federal government contracts would attract keen interest from British defense and aerospace companies, especially as Mr. Trump has vowed to rebuild the military. But opening such business to foreign competitors in a trade agreement would directly collide with Mr. Trump’s “America First” mantra. “If President Trump genuinely means ‘buy American, hire American’ above all else, then there’s going to be very little left to offer other countries,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the   committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. “There is no way in hell this is a massive trade deal. It would take massive effort to create a trade deal of even minimal effect. ” Trade, it is worth noting, tends to involve  . Negotiations are politically fraught, because they expose domestic industries to the prospect of greater competition with overseas companies. In exchange, domestic consumers gain access to more and cheaper products. British steak aficionados may cheer the shrinking of steep tariffs that limit the influx of American beef. The British beef industry would probably respond less enthusiastically. It would seek protection, particularly as Britain’s exit from the bloc would eliminate European subsidies for British agriculture. Any proposed opening of agriculture would probaly provoke British opposition to genetically modified crops. British insurance companies may be eager for a greater crack at the enormous American market, but that would be outside the scope of a potential deal. In the United States, the insurance industry is regulated at the state level, meaning the Trump administration would lack the authority to engineer an opening. The biggest impediment to a substantial deal between Britain and the United States is the similarity of the two economies, and especially the importance of financial services on both shores. Opening finance to greater competition would require that British bankers pledge fealty to American regulations. Either that, or the rules would have to be opened and renegotiated by both sides. That might happen in the same way that Mr. Trump might perhaps renounce shiny ties and golf in favor of   and Zen meditation. For American companies, the appeal of giving something up to gain access to the British market has been diminished by the very thing that makes such a trade permissible: Britain’s looming exit from Europe, known as Brexit. Britain’s inclusion in the European Union and its enormous single market has made Britain a prized center for manufacturing and corporate headquarters for multinational companies. American investment banks have been able to set up shop in London and use these bases to serve clients from Ireland to Romania, as if operating in one country. But once Britain leaves Europe, these benefits would almost certainly disappear, raising endless questions about the future terms of trade across the English Channel. Already, major banks are publicly outlining plans to shift some operations to cities in the European Union, exploring Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg. Already, major multinational companies are expressing reservations about sinking the next investment in Britain. All of this makes a trade deal less compelling, diminishing the stakes, leaving politics as the most meaningful context. Last year, before Britain’s referendum, Mr. Obama visited the country and urged voters to opt for remaining in Europe. He sought to undercut a key aspiration of those urging a break from the bloc  —   the prospect that a more independent Britain could strike a   deal with the United States. Washington had little interest in striking deals with single countries, Mr. Obama said, preferring to focus on giant multilateral trade arrangements like the sprawling   Partnership (a deal Mr. Trump just renounced). If it sought a trade deal with the United States, Britain would land “in the back of the queue,” Mr. Obama warned. With Mr. Trump now in the White House, Britain’s place in the queue has effectively been upgraded, a handy development for Mrs. May as she presses ahead with Brexit. She is under pressure to demonstrate that Britain, once liberated from Europe, can harvest bounty via trade with   more innovative parts of the globe. A trade deal with the largest economy on earth would presumably check that box. “It is clearly in the British government’s political interest to show that it can negotiate a   agreement with the United States,” said Stephen Woolcock, a trade expert at the London School of Economics. “The question is what the economic costs and benefits of such an agreement would be? These would seem to be less clear cut. ” In much of the world, Britain’s decision to abandon the European Union has been construed as a retrenchment of British influence and a disengagement from global affairs. In recent weeks, Mrs. May has labored to displace that notion by describing   Britain as a land of dauntless capitalists scouring the planet for fresh opportunities. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, she described a British exit as “a vote to take control and make decisions for ourselves and, crucially, to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit, too. Because that is who we are as a nation. ” A trade deal with the United States could be considered evidence to further that case. Mr. Trump could post a deal with Britain on Twitter as proof he is not, despite popular perceptions, a nativist protectionist leading the United States on a retreat from global concerns. Mr. Trump has   Carrier and Ford Motor into altering plans to shift production from American factories to Mexico, cashing in on photo opportunities that allow him to claim he is engineering a renaissance in industrial America, even as the big picture remains unchanged. In a similar vein, he could use a trade deal with Britain  —   even a narrow, economically inconsequential one  —   to claim vindication for his encouragement of leaving the bloc. That could resonate with the sort of voters who make up Mr. Trump’s base as well as supporters of Brexit in Britain  —   that is, those inclined to blame immigrants for economic afflictions. “Trump can play to his constituents,” Mr. Posen of the Peterson Institute said, people “who believe that trade deals among white rich people are particularly desirable. ”"

Software engineering whiz Tony Heller makes a presentation on climate change and the data behind it.
If you haven’t watched it already, then do take the time to do so.

“Utter nonsense”
Heller, who goes by the pseudo-name of Steve Goddard at his wildly popular realclimatecience site, calls the idea that it’s getting hotter “utter nonsense”, and shows how US temperatures were much hotter in the 1930s.

According to Heller, the warming in the US is not real, and was created through statistical tricks after 1990. Later he highlights some of the many ridiculous claims climate experts and activist politicians made, and have since turned out to be a complete folly. At this point the presentation rivets your attention and for skeptics it becomes one you don’t want to stop watching.
“Manipulated to increase alarm”
Heller calls the US warming trend “completely fake” and being due to “station data loss and fabrication” and later shows that NASA “erased” the once unanimously agreed cooling from 1940 – 1970:

 
Not only temperature data have been altered, but so has sea level data, Heller later shows. Overall he writes “climate data is being manipulated to increase alarm“.

We now have a full one‐​third of a century of satellite‐​measured lower atmospheric temperatures, and what an interesting story the machines are revealing. I think it’s fair to say that they provide increasing evidence in favor of the “lukewarm” view of climate change, or the hypothesis of modest warming. In climate change, “it’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity”, or the amount of warming that a change in carbon dioxide causes, that is important.



Almost every map of the decadal trends in the satellite data is centered on the Equator and looks like this:









But much more interesting things are going on around the poles, where the climate action is.



For a number of reasons, computer models with added atmospheric carbon dioxide preferentially warm the mid‐​and high‐​latitude land areas of the northern hemisphere that are ice‐​free, which also enhances summer melting of the relatively shallow ice in the Arctic Ocean. That, in turn, results in an increased absorption of solar radiation by the darker ocean surface, which also contributes to warming.



Here’s a view from over the North Pole. with vision down to 60°N:









The warming of high‐​latitude North America and the adjacent Arctic Ocean is the largest of any on the planet. Note that there tends to be less warming over the massive Greenland ice cap.



That’s because Greenland is kind of a miniature Antarctica, where things are much different than they are in our hemisphere.



Here’s the view from over the South Pole:









Antarctica is surrounded by a very cold and turbulent ocean, whose massive thermal capacity (compared to land) drastically reduces warming, compared to what we see in our hemisphere. But, even a tiny warming of the huge Southern Ocean must increase the amount of moisture in the air around Antarctica which can only result in more clouds and snow over the continent. Indeed, interior Antarctica can conceivably cool with a modest “global” warming. Warming doomsayers conveniently ignore the fact that even the UN’s models (current version) forecast that Antarctica will gain ice this century.



A lot of interior Antarctica (and a big patch of the southern ocean, for reasons I think no one understands) is getting colder. There are some pockets of decent maritime warming right near the coast, which almost certainly are increasing snowfall substantially when the wind blows onshore.



Here’s the lukewarm part. The bipolar behavior is pretty close‐​in pattern‐​to what theory and models say should be happening. But the models aren’t even close in the amount of warming.



The average warming trend in the one‐​third century of satellite data is 0.14°C per decade, but the warming rate in the UN’s midrange climate models is 0.25°. This differential has been pretty constant ever since the satellite data was corrected for orbital and sensor issues.



There’s no reason for that not to continue. In other words, the UN’s average forecast of 3.2°C of warming this century is off by about 40%, which should spell the victory of the lukewarmers and the death‐​knell of apocalyptic global warming. Indeed, it is not the heat, it’s the sensitivity, which looks to be quite a bit lower than what’s in those computer simulations.

"**The main hospital in the capital of Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray is ""dangerously low"" on supplies as it treats the wounded from the fighting around the city, the Red Cross says.**
On Saturday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had said that federal forces had taken control of the city.
He described it as the ""last phase"" in the three-week long conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front.
But the TPLF leader vowed to fight on, in a statement to Reuters.
Few details have emerged from Tigray throughout the fighting as communications have been cut.
The statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides a rare insight into events on the ground during the conflict - in which hundreds have reportedly died and tens of thousands have fled their homes.
The ICRC said the Ethiopian Red Cross ambulances had taken ""injured and deceased people"" to the Ayder Referral Hospital.
On a visit to the hospital, ICRC staff found ""80% of patients to be suffering from trauma injuries"" adding that other services had to be suspended ""so that limited staff and resources could be devoted to emergency medical care"".
""The hospital is running dangerously low on sutures, antibiotics, anticoagulants, painkillers, and even gloves,"" ICRC head in Ethiopia Maria Soledad said.
The hospital is also running low on body bags for the deceased, the Geneva-based organisation said.
The ICRC, however, did not give any figures for the numbers injured or dead. Neither did it say whether the victims were civilians or military personnel.
In a statement on Twitter on Saturday, Mr Abiy said the army was in full control of Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"".
""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said.
He added that the army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, saying that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"".
The prime minister has consistently described the TPLF leadership as a ""criminal clique"" and said that the police will ""bring them to the court of law"".
In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last.""
He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination.""
Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown.
A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"".
Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.
The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle.
It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
In an update released on Saturday, the UN said that more than 40,000 Ethiopians had crossed over since the fighting began in early November.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement.
In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
The organisation was founded in the 1970s and spearheaded the uprising against Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in 1991.
It then went on to be the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy became prime minister in 2018.
Mr Debretsion has said the Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, sparked by Mr Abiy's moves to sideline the party.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
In early November, TPLF fighters entered a military base in Mekelle which led to the start of the federal army's operation in Tigray."

The arse-covering and blame-shifting in the wake of Australia’s catastrophic summer continues with unseemly haste. It goes without saying that the odious Greens were first out the gate, trying to exploit the fires for grubby political advantage, even as forests, houses, wildlife and people were burning. Now, politicians and bureaucrats on all sides of the political fence are busily engaged in their own, desperate political backburning.



Two senior NSW government ministers have accused their own environmental agencies of not conducting enough hazard reduction burning in the lead-up to the bushfire season, with Deputy Premier **John Barilaro** blaming green ideology for allowing forest fuel loads to build up.



Mr Barilaro said the NSW ­National Parks and Wildlife Service was “ideologically opposed” to hazard reductions.



In a separate interview, NSW Water Minister **Melinda Pavey** suggested it was wrong to blame climate change for the recent devastating bushfires when there were more practical solutions that could be deployed.



But state governments in Australia are responsible for managing national parks, so, in a real sense, Barilaro as Deputy Premier shares at least some responsibility. Still, he is almost certainly right in most respects. Governments come and go, but bureaucracies fossilise in place and zealously guard their little fiefdoms against interference by mere elected representatives.



“I genuinely do believe we have agencies within government that, over decades, haven’t actually honoured their commitments for fuel reduction because of ideological positions, especially in national parks. We just lock them up.”



Pavey is also absolutely right: climate change almost certainly had sod-all to do with these fires.



But, someone with even more direct responsibility for national parks is NSW Environment Minister **Matt Kean**. Guess who’s desperate to pin the blame on climate change?



The comments of Mr Barilaro and Ms Pavey — both Nationals — are at odds with that of their cabinet colleague, NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean, who is advocating for a greater focus on renewable technologies to bring down the state’s carbon emissions. He has not ruled out increasing hazard reduction burning.



Mr Kean sparked a furore this week after he alleged some senior federal government MPs were uncomfortable with Scott Morrison’s stance on climate change, and that they wanted more drastic action to be taken, prompting a backlash from fellow party members.



Still, while it has lagged behind hazard reduction targets for years, NSW at least made the effort to reach its targets last year. Not so Victoria, which has never once met its targets – even though its targets are far below what the Black Saturday royal commission recommended.



So it’s no surprise to see who’s getting all defensive, and trying to blame climate change.



Victorian Environment Minister **Lily D’Ambrosio** , also from Labor, would not say whether she supported Mr Morrison’s proposal but did defend the state’s record on hazard reduction…



Queensland’s Acting Minister for Fire and Emergency Services, **Di Farmer** , criticised the Prime Minister’s call for a national standard for bushfire hazard-­reduction burns, saying his lack of action on climate change was “an international embarrassment”.



Queensland: also a Labor state, just like Victoria.



Fancy that. Surely it’s not like they’ve got any reason to shift blame…?

"MANILA  —   When Lizel Torreras, 35, became pregnant with her third child, she mixed a tincture of bitter herbs and mahogany bark, a home remedy said to induce abortion. Her husband, who worked as a garbage scavenger, did not make enough money to buy a regular supply of birth control pills, much less raise another child. “With just two kids, we were already struggling,” she said. “The children were going to have a hard time. We might not have been able to send them to school. ” But after three attempts, Ms. Torreras, a churchgoing Catholic, could not bring herself to drink the potion. Like millions of other women in the Philippines who have no access to contraception, Ms. Torreras had the baby. Then another one. The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, signed an executive order this month calling for the full and immediate enforcement of a 2012 law that would give six million women like Ms. Torreras free   contraception and reproductive health services. Mr. Duterte portrayed the order as an antipoverty measure, with an official calling it “      and   development. ” But the order was also Mr. Duterte’s latest jab at the Roman Catholic Church, which wields significant power in the Philippines and has fought for years to keep the law from taking effect. Under the law, government agencies will provide modern family planning services, including free contraceptives and prenatal care to all women and families. The measure also mandates that sex education be taught in schools and that companies offer reproductive health services to their employees. But the law, which took more than 13 years to be passed by Congress before being signed into law in 2012, has yet to fully take effect, a testament to the power of the Catholic Church,   groups and allied lawmakers. The church and other contraception opponents filed petitions with the Supreme Court, which issued several rulings blocking parts of the law. The court continues to prevent the Health Department from procuring, distributing or selling birth control implants, a ban that women’s health groups fear could be extended to the pill and other forms of hormonal birth control when existing certifications expire in 2018. Last year, Congress cut the Health Department’s budget for contraceptives, citing the court order halting the distribution of implants. Local agencies have administered the law differently in different districts, and sex education in particular has varied widely by school district. This month, Vicente Sotto III, the Senate majority leader, vowed to stop the distribution of condoms in high schools, arguing that they encouraged promiscuity. The battle is not over, but Mr. Duterte’s order provides clear guidance to government agencies and local health officials that they should uphold the law, eliminating some of the ambiguity the various court decisions have caused. And while the church still opposes the law in principle, it has scaled back its public campaign against it. Two archbishops, in interviews, acknowledged defeat. The Duterte administration says it can provide desperately needed services that are vital to lifting millions of people out of poverty. It estimates that there are six million women, two million of whom are poor, who do not have access to modern forms of contraception. Mr. Duterte’s order aims to achieve “zero unmet need for family planning” by 2018, helping to meet his goal of reducing the poverty rate to 14 percent by the end of his administration in 2022, down from the 2015 level of 21. 6 percent. Sex education, advocates say, has been a failure. The Philippines is the only country in Asia where teenage pregnancy increased over the last two decades, according to the United Nations Population Fund. “A lot of the existing education in the Philippines is abstinence only, and this contributes to teenage pregnancy,” said Hope   project coordinator for Likhaan, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to women’s health. Stephanie Carmen, 15, is the kind of teenager Ms.   has in mind. Ms. Carmen, who has a    daughter, says she did not know that sex could result in pregnancy. She has learned the hard way, and says she will get an intrauterine device from Likhaan, which distributes free birth control using private funds and cooperation from the Health Department, as soon as she heals from the birth. “I don’t want any more children,” she said. “It hurts too much. ” Mr. Duterte’s executive order is not his first clash with the church in his seven months in office. He has called the church “the most hypocritical institution,” accusing priests and bishops of graft, corruption and taking mistresses. He called Pope Francis a son of a whore (and later apologized) openly accused the church of pedophilia and claimed to have been sexually abused by a priest as a teenager. And he has accused the church of doing nothing to combat drugs, which he sees as the country’s biggest problem. For its part, the church has opposed his push to reinstate the death penalty and has begun to publicly criticize his antidrug campaign, which has left more than 3, 600 people dead. “We will continue to oppose those because they are inhuman,” said Archbishop Ramón Argüelles of Lipa. He added, of Mr. Duterte, “I think whether he knows it or not, whenever we do anything bad, you are the tool of the devil. If you bring harm to others, you are the devil’s tool. ” Priests across the Philippines have urged citizens to speak out against the killings in the drug campaign. In the days before Christmas, the Redemptorist Church of Baclaran in Manila mounted a photo exhibition of its victims,   corpses strewn in the streets and grieving families, aimed to prick a sense of outrage among churchgoers. Fighting the church is not without risk. More than 80 percent of Filipinos identify as Catholic, and the church was instrumental in toppling two presidents, Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Joseph Estrada in 2001. But Mr. Duterte appears to be winning this fight. Rather than repelling Catholics with his sacrilegious outbursts, his willingness to confront the church has endeared him to Filipinos. According to a pair of 2016 polls by Pulse Asia, 86 percent of Filipinos support   reproductive health services, and 55 percent want the administration to prioritize programs to combat poverty. While the church may have lost this battle, Archbishop Argüelles says Mr. Duterte has not won the war. “He said he was going to destroy the church,” the archbishop said. “The only thing I can tell him is that Hitler tried to do that, Bismarck tried to do that, Napoleon tried to do that. The church is still there, all these people are gone. ”"

Guest Opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
In a recent article, I was pleased to read that Willis Eschenbach identified himself as a “Generalist” on his business card. In doing so, he correctly identifies it as a unique, even out of step position, especially in the science community. There is a degree of whimsy in his self-assessment, but it also identifies an underlying real issue. It is like the woman who gave me a business card with the self-assessment of ABC, an acronym for “Another Bloody Consultant”.
Eschenbach’s position and defense don’t surprise me. I watched academia transform from the idea that there were general rules with exceptions, to the idea that everything is an exception. It translated into the view that to generalize is the mark of a fool to specialize the mark of genius.
Eschenbach adds that it is an advantage in climate science. It is not just an advantage, but essential in studying climatology. I wrote about this in various ways in previous articles, but it needs a larger context as the world grapples with increasing fragmentation of information and knowledge.
Climatology is the study of weather patterns of a place or region, or the change of weather patterns over time. Climate science is the study of one component piece of climatology. The analogy I’ve used for decades is that climatology is a puzzle of thousands of pieces; climate science is one piece of the puzzle. A practical approach to assembling the puzzle is to classify pieces into groups. The most basic sorting identifies the corner pieces, the edge pieces and then color. Climatologists say the four corner pieces, which are oceans, atmosphere, lithosphere, and the cosmos are not even fully identified or understood. Climate scientists tend to hold one piece of the puzzle and claim it is the key to everything.
The year 1859 was pivotal in reducing people’s ability to understand the world. In that year, Darwin’s Origin of Species was published, and Alexander von Humboldt died. Darwin’s theory evolved from the collection of large amounts of evidence. The collection of information dominated European science of the 19th century. The information came from all over the world in increasing volumes and rapidly overwhelmed the ability of anyone to know it all.
Because of that Von Humboldt is credited with being the last “universal” person. That is he was the last person who “knew” all the science and geography known at that time. We still have renaissance people with a wider knowledge of several subjects, but not universal knowledge.
Since then the proliferation of knowledge, information, and ideas encouraged and lauded specialization and derided generalization. People specialize and become experts in one small piece of a very large complex puzzle, but are incapable of seeing the larger picture necessary for context and real understanding. For example, psychology studies individual behavior while sociology studies group behavior, but in the real world they are intertwined and inseparable. We are truly in a world where we cannot see the forest for the trees. We have more information and less understanding.
The problems became apparent for people studying the real world. A farmer told me of such an experience. He knew there was something wrong with the efficiency and productivity of his soils. He went to the University of Manitoba School of Agriculture. They told him they had no expert on soils, but they could line up several specialists, on such subjects as nematodes, trace minerals, clay colloid complexes, and plant microclimates. He ended up at his local fertilizer dealer who knew more about the soil problems of his area than any specialist.
Only those in the academic world dealing with the real world understood and responded to the problem in two basic ways. One was the creation of interdisciplinary studies. University calendars are now replete with them. As always the status quo resisted. They viewed them as hybrids and impure. Often specialists who put too much emphasis on their specialty chaired them. Environmental studies were likely the most expansive interdisciplinary study because it encompassed the new paradigm of environmentalism. They were also controversial in the academic world because they crossed the largest academic and intellectual boundary between Arts and Science.
The second was the introduction of systems analysis. It is interesting to read the various attempts to define system analysis. I only use Wikipedia here because it illustrates the problem.
“Systems analysis is a problem solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose”. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, systems analysis is “the process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purposes and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way”. Analysis and synthesis, as scientific methods, always go hand in hand; they complement one another. Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis, and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results. 
Other definitions provide insight and explanation about why a computer model was a natural vehicle for systems analysis.
The analysis of an activity, procedure, method, technique, or business to determine what must be accomplished and how the necessary operations may best be accomplished.
Or,
The analysis of the requirements of a task and the expression of those requirements in a form that permits the assembly of computer hardware and software to perform the task 
Computers apparently provided one other major benefit in the volumes of data they could include and mathematically manipulate. As climate modelers quickly discovered, to build a model you need adequate data and accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In the case of climate, neither were available.
The need for computer models and the need for adequate data was a conflict that evolved at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Hubert Lamb knew the computer and models offered potential. As a result, he hired Tom Wigley. He explains in his autobiography,
The research project which I had put forward to the Rockefeller Foundation was awarded a handsome grant, but it sadly came to grief over an understandable difference of scientific judgment between me and the scientist, Dr. Tom Wigley, who we appointed to take charge of the research.
Lamb set up the CRU believing,
The first and greatest need was to establish the facts of the past record of the natural climate in times before any side effects of human activities could well be important. 
This approach is in line with Darwin’s that you need adequate data as a basis for developing a theory.
“Since my retirement from the directorship of the Climatic Research Unit there have been changes there and in the direction of my own efforts. My immediate successor, Professor Tom Wigley, was chiefly interested in the prospects of world climate being changed as a result of human activities, primarily through the burning up of wood, coal, oil and gas reserves…” 
 
After only a few years almost all the work on historical reconstruction of past climate and weather situations, which had made the Unit well known, was abandoned.”
 
Lamb knew it would degenerate into creating the historical record needed for the political agenda, as exposed in the leaked emails.
A computer model is a generalization created by a specialist with each component produced by a different specialist. You only have to read the chapter on computer models in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Physical Science Basis Reports to see the resulting disconnect and dissonance. I identified this as a Gestaltist or learning problem, but it is much more. The volume of data grows, but the division into narrower specialties continues.
Through this period climatology, a generalized approach became the specialties of climate science. Computer models offered a chance at dealing with large volumes of data and the ability to simulate natural systems. Most climatologists were generally not interested nor capable of producing computer models, as Lamb acknowledged when he hired Wigley. Instead, computer modelers cast around for large-scale systems to challenge their skills. The other issue was the cost of the computers and operation time, which only governments could afford. They either operated the computers themselves or provided funding to academics doing the research they wanted. After a discussion with a computer modeler in 1998, I realized the limitations of his weather and climate knowledge. Despite this, I watched modelers take over as climate scientists and become keynote speakers at most climate conferences. It became so technologically centered that whoever had the biggest fastest computers were the “state of the art” climate experts. I recall the impact of the Cray computer on climate science. The idiocy continues today with the belief that the only limitation to the models is computer capacity and speed.
This pattern in climate science reflects President Eisenhower’s warnings.
Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.
In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.
Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation’s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.
 
The comment that follows the above is more important because it provides the template for today and tomorrow.
It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system — ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. 
This statesmanship was on display at the recent Heartland Climate Conference in the presentations of Senator Inhofe, US Rep. Lamar Smith, and State Sen. Carlyle Begay. They are the vanguard to fulfill what Marcel Masse observed,
The more the world is specialized, the more it will be run by generalists.

"A mishandled handoff between foremen may have played a role in an Amtrak crash last April in which two workers were killed when a train slammed into construction equipment that was on the tracks near Chester, Pa. according to documents released on Thursday. The documents, part of a continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, also revealed the train’s operator tested positive for marijuana, and show a supervisor’s distress upon hearing that the track had been cleared for use. “Oh my gosh you’ve got to be kidding me,” John Yaeger, an Amtrak day shift foreman whose shift had just begun, told a dispatcher, according to a transcript of radio communications from that morning. “Oh man. The backhoe got plowed. I can’t believe it. ” The documents released on Thursday do not draw conclusions about what caused the crash, though possible factors are cited. The crash occurred around 7:50 a. m. on April 3, when the train struck a backhoe that was being used during a multiday maintenance operation on a neighboring track, according to the documents. During an interview with investigators, Mr. Yaeger suggested there had been confusion in the handoff from a night foreman about whether the track had been cleared for traffic. The backhoe operator, Joseph Carter Jr. 61, and his supervisor, Peter Adamovich, 59, died.   people were taken to hospitals. The preliminary N. T. S. B. documents consist of hundreds of pages of interviews, transcripts and reports, and include the revelation that the train’s operator, Alexander Hunter, tested positive for marijuana that day. Efforts to reach Mr. Hunter on Thursday evening were not immediately successful. The train was traveling south at 106 miles per hour  —   within the authorized limit of 110 m. p. h.  —   when Mr. Hunter applied the emergency brakes after “seeing something” on Main Track 3, according to the documents. He was able to slow the train to only 88 m. p. h. before striking the backhoe. “The collision obliterated the backhoe, sending pieces of the equipment throughout the area and into the west side of the first passenger coach,” according to an analysis report. Amtrak estimated the damage at $2. 5 million."

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science critics Dr. Sebastian Lüning and professor Fritz Vahrenholt here present today some findings that climate alarmists are not very amused over: Climate alarmism has waned and is no longer making any headlines.
The two co-authors of “The Neglected Sun” write at their site:
========================================
“People aren’t dumb. Climate alarmism just isn’t working. The public is fed up with the constant unending apocalypse, for which there are still no reliable indications. Gradually the alarm has been disappearing from the headlines.
Here the UN is getting very worried because with the help of climate panic they wish to justify huge finance transfers from the rich to the poor. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has expressed these concerns in a press release. It is indeed absurd that the climate change is being hyped as the ‘greatest problem for humanity’ at a time when the world is currently suffering from rampant terrorism and migration crises. What on earth is going through the heads of the climate romanticists? Do they not want to or are they just unable to see the reality? Is it all about money? Or power? Read the following from the IFAD press release April 6, 2016, which will leave you amazed:
‘Despite being “the biggest threat facing humanity” climate change and its impacts fail to make headlines, says IFAD study
Even as 60 million people around the world face severe hunger because of El Niño and millions more because of climate change, top European and American media outlets are neglecting to cover the issues as a top news item, says a new research report funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) today.

“It’s incredible that in a year when we have had record temperatures, 32 major droughts, and historic crop losses that media are not positioning climate change on their front pages,” said IFAD President, Kanayo F. Nwanze. “Climate change is the biggest threat facing our world today and how the media shape the narrative remains vitally important in pre-empting future crises.”
The report, “The Untold Story: Climate change sinks below the headlines” provides an analysis of the depth of media reporting around climate change in two distinct periods: two months before the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, and two months after. Specifically, it explores whether issues connecting climate change, food security, agriculture and migration made headlines, and if so, how much prominence these stories were given.
Among some of its key findings:
• Climate change stories were either completely absent or their numbers decreased in major media outlets in Europe and the United States before and after COP21.
• Coverage on the consequences of climate change, such as migration, fell by half in the months after COP21 and people directly impacted by climate change rarely had a voice in stories or were not mentioned at all.
• News consumers want climate change issues and solutions to be given more prominence in media outlets and, in particular, want more information on the connections between climate change, food insecurity, conflict and migration.
The release of the report comes just days before world leaders gather at the United Nations in New York to sign off on the Paris Agreement coming out of COP21. In December, the agreement made headlines and led news bulletins across the globe. But leading up to COP21 and in the months following it, coverage on climate change significantly fell off the radar of major media outlets across Europe and the United States. […]

"**Ethiopia has urged the international community to refrain from ""unwelcome and unlawful acts of interference"" in its affairs following calls to end the conflict in the northern Tigray region.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has called the military offensive a ""law-enforcement operation"".
His deadline to Tigray fighters to surrender will lapse on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed and thousands have been forced from their homes.
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
The UN has said it was alarmed by the threat of major hostilities if the Ethiopian army advanced on Tigray's capital, Mekelle, home to about 500,000 people.
In a statement released on Wednesday morning, Mr Abiy said when it came to help from outside ""the international community should stand by until the government of Ethiopia submits its requests for assistance"".
On Tuesday, a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the fighting in Tigray ended without a statement, according to AFP news agency, with African countries reportedly requesting more time to allow for diplomatic efforts by the African Union to continue.
Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell met with Ethiopia's foreign minister to discuss the conflict.
""I expressed my great concern regarding increasing ethnic-targeted violence, numerous casualties and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law,"" Mr Borrell said after their Tuesday meeting.
On Sunday, Mr Abiy issued a 72-hour ultimatum to Tigray's forces, telling them to surrender as they were ""at a point of no return"".
But Tigray's forces have vowed to keep fighting, with their leader Debretsion Gebremichael saying they are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Meanwhile, Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a youth group from the Tigray region of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 civilians were killed.
The commission says the group stabbed, bludgeoned and burned to death non-Tigrayan residents of the town of Mai-Kadra with the collusion of local forces.
Human rights group Amnesty International first highlighted reports of a massacre in Mai-Kadra but was unable to confirm who was behind it, or exactly how many died.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, denied involvement, and called for an independent international investigation into the killings.
The conflict started after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons.
In response, Mr Abiy - a former Nobel Peace Prize winner - ordered a military offensive against forces in Tigray, accusing them of treason.
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed ""alarm at reports of a heavy build-up of tanks and artillery around Mekelle"".
She called on all sides to give ""clear and unambiguous orders to their forces"" to spare civilians.
""The highly aggressive rhetoric on both sides regarding the fight for Mekelle is dangerously provocative and risks placing already vulnerable and frightened civilians in grave danger,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I fear such rhetoric will lead to further violations of international humanitarian law.""
The rhetoric has been ramped up in recent days. On Sunday, the Ethiopian army said there would be ""no mercy"" for Mekelle's residents when its soldiers ""encircle"" the city.
Such talk could constitute a war crime, Ms Bachelet said.
Mr Abiy has repeatedly said the Ethiopian army would protect civilians in its campaign against forces in Tigray.
But Ms Bachelet said a virtual communications blackout in Tigray was making it difficult for the UN to monitor the human rights and humanitarian situation.
""Reports continue to emerge of arbitrary arrests and detentions, killings, as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of ethnic Tigrays,"" the UN said.
At least 40,000 refugees have already crossed into neighbouring Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
A couple sit looking pensive by the wall of the UN building in Hamdayit in eastern Sudan's Kassala region.
Smoke rising from a charcoal burner partially blurs their faces. The woman lines up tiny cups as she waits for coffee to boil in an earth kettle.
A traditional coffee ceremony is performed even in the worst of circumstances.
They've recently arrived at the transit camp, having fled from Tigray.
A young man interrupts this moment when he walks up to me. He worked as a customs official in the Tigray town of Humera but fled three days ago, he tells me.
I ask why he hasn't yet moved to the refugee camp further away from the border. ""I am waiting for my family,"" he says.
They are still trapped inside Tigray. Families have been torn apart by the conflict.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Analysts believe the conflict could be long and bloody given the strength of Tigray's forces."

The stage is set for a big fight between two green Titans — the Green Party of Germany and Greenpeace Germany. They sound similar and used to be so, but no longer. When it comes to climate change, Greenpeace is a leading Action Now! radical group, while the Green Party is becoming ever more moderate. This is clearly a prescription for political conflict.



These are two big outfits. Germany is the fourth biggest national economy in the world and by far the greenest major. In the last national election, the Green Party got almost 10% of the vote and recent polls suggest this could get much bigger, more than double in some cases. So the Greens are seen as an emerging political powerhouse.



Greenpeace Germany is also politically powerful, with annual revenues on the order of 100 million dollars. They rival Greenpeace International, which has the rest of the world, in size. Both Greenpeaces are leading hysterics in the Action Now! radical political movement. Both are calling for disruption and Germany reportedly has seen more and bigger Greta Thunberg marches than anywhere else.



The Green Party is becoming progressively more moderate for the fundamental political reason; they want more votes. There is even speculation that Robert Habeck, the personable Green Party co-boss, might be the next Chancellor of Germany. He would replace Angela Merkel, who has been known as “the Climate Chancellor.” After all, Merkel’s ruling coalition is crumbling and the Green Party is coming on strong, at least in the polls. (The new German anti-green populist party is also growing in power, so some of this speculation may be well off.)



In recent weeks, Habeck has gone so far as to explicitly renounce key policies of the Action Now! radicals. For example, he has said that people should be free to fly or eat meat if they want to. He knows perfectly well that these radical demands are vote killers.



Up to now the Green Party and Greenpeace Germany seem each to pretend that the other does not exist. The Party’s visible slide to moderation has been well discussed in the press but I have yet to see an article on it that mentions Greenpeace. Habeck certainly does not, lest he goad the radical green beast into action. Greenpeace could easily denounce Habeck, but have not yet done so.



Perhaps they have a political understanding. Greenpeace Germany may well think that the Green Party’s victory is more important than the extreme climate actions it espouses. They probably figure that they will get a big place in the new green government if there ever is one. If so they are sitting on a powder keg of hypocrisy



2020 is set to be the year of heated, even violent, rhetorical battles over climate policy, including in Germany. It may well be that at some point Greenpeace Germany will have to draw the line against the Green Party’s growing moderation. As Greenpeace said in Madrid when COP 25 collapsed: “Getting no deal is better than getting a bad deal.” They rejected the moderates then and they can do it again.



In fact, rejecting moderation is central to the Action Now! mission. Greta Thunberg does it repeatedly. After all, this is precisely what “Action Now!” means, no more slow moving moderate action on climate change.



If and when this Green versus Green breakup occurs, it should be spectacular. Given the German situation, the Green Party will be fighting for its political life, while Greenpeace will be fighting for its dearly held principles. Both sides are powerful and well entrenched.



Germany could be where the most spectacular battle between the climate radicals and the climate moderates takes place. Sort of like Northern Virginia in the U.S. Civil War, where Grant and Lee hammered it out, except in Germany both sides could lose (to the sceptics).



If the misguided climate action movement is going to tear itself apart, which seems increasingly likely, Germany could be where it happens most definitively, and most publicly. That will be truly fun to watch.



The stage is set; let the show begin. Stay tuned to CFACT for coverage.

Action needed now to end EPA deception, fraud, collusion, tyranny and destruction
Guest essay by Paul Driessen
Russian President Vladimir Putin is outraged that the United States has indicted 14 FIFA soccer officials, accusing them of corruption, racketeering, fraud and conspiracy, involving bribes totaling over $150 million in kickbacks for awarding tournament rights. He says the US is meddling in Russian affairs and plotting to steal the 2018 World Cup from his country. What chutzpah.
This is the same Mr. Putin who annexed Crimea and parts of Ukraine, and whose close cronies have been secretly channeling millions of dollars to US and EU environmentalist groups to oppose both American oil drilling in the Arctic and hydraulic fracturing – the game-changing process that is producing so much oil and gas that it’s slashed energy prices … and Russian revenues. 
The Justice Department indictments generated global applause. Now the DOJ needs to conduct an equally zealous investigation into corruption, fraud and collusion in the Obama Environmental Protection Agency. Of course, that will never happen – no matter how rampant or flagrant the abuses have been.
As Kimberly Strassel documents in May 14 and May 21 articles, EPA emails and other documents reveal that the agency had already decided in 2010 to veto the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska on ideological grounds, “well before it did any science” on the project’s potential environmental impacts. Meanwhile, an EPA biologist was working with eco-activists to recruit Native Americans to oppose the mine. “It’s not much of a leap,” Strassel writes, “to suggest that the EPA encouraged [petitions against the mine] so that it would have an excuse to intervene, run its science as cover, and block a project it already opposed.”
At the same time the biologist was aiding the petition drive, he was also helping to write EPA’s “options paper” for the mine – and lobbying his co-authors and report contributors to veto the mine, Strassel notes. Now, contrary to newly discovered agency emails, EPA bosses are pretending they never saw the options paper and trying to put the blame on low-level functionaries, when they were deep in cahoots all the way.
This represents incredible collusion, deception, fraud and abuse of power – to impose agency edicts and appease environmental ideologues in and out of EPA. Moreover, it is just the latest in a long line of abuses and usurpations by this Obama agency, under a culture of corruption and secretive, manipulated science used to justify regulatory overkill that imposes extensive damages for few or no benefits.
On climate, EPA relies on computer models and discredited IPCC reports to predict global catastrophes that it insists can be prevented if the United States slashes its fossil fuel use, carbon dioxide emissions and living standards, even if China, India and other developing countries do nothing. Meanwhile, real-world temperatures, hurricanes, tornadoes, polar ice and sea levels continue to defy the fear-mongering. So now the rhetoric has shifted yet again, to alleged national security and asthma threats from climate change.
Just this week, EPA announced that it will henceforth regulate any ponds, puddles, creeks, ditches and other waters that have a “significant nexus” to navigable waterways, even if that ill-defined connection enjoys six degrees of separation from streams in which you can actually paddle a kayak. EPA itself recognizes that “science” does not support its new regime, so now it says its “experience and expertise” justify regulating virtually all “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) – and thus of all lands, land uses, and family, farm and industrial activities not already covered by its climate and other rules.
Homeowners, farmers and businesses will now have to apply for permits to do almost anything that might theoretically pollute or affect waterways. Even taking a shower is now subject to EPA regulation.
On mercury, EPA is shutting down coal-fired power plants that emit barely 3% of all the mercury in US air and water. It claims this will prevent “0.00209 points” in American IQ losses and protect nonexistent “hypothetical female subsistence consumers” who every day for 70 years eat a pound of fish that they catch themselves in US navigable or “nexus” waterways.
For fine particulates, EPA wasn’t satisfied with regulations that prohibited more than one ounce of soot spread evenly in a volume of air a half-mile square by one story tall. When illegal experiments on humans failed to demonstrate that these levels were not actually “dangerous” or “lethal,” it imposed tougher standards anyway, as part of its war on coal.
Before he landed in jail for fraud, high level EPA bureaucrat John Beale concocted the sue-and-settle tactic, under which agency lawyers meet with environmentalist groups behind closed doors, agree to new regulatory standards, and then settle a friendly lawsuit whereby a court orders EPA to adopt the rules. Parties actually impacted by the new regulations never find out about them until it’s a “done deal.”
As presidential candidate Obama promised, under his policies electricity prices would “necessarily skyrocket.” But this means poor families, small businesses, factories, school districts, hospitals and churches must pay far more to keep their lights, heat, air conditioning and equipment running. That means people get laid off, fewer jobs are created, living standards decline, people’s health and wellbeing suffer, stress, depression, and drug and alcohol abuse increase, more people die during heat waves, and far more die during much deadlier winter cold snaps.
However, EPA ignores all these cold, hard realities – as it cherry-picks research and pseudo-science to support its agenda, ignores contradictory studies, and pays advisory boards and activist groups like the American Lung Association millions of dollars annually to rubberstamp and promote its decisions.
What can be done to curb these abuses and usurpations, and rein in this renegade agency? 
Congress should cut EPA’s budget, to eliminate money that it routinely gives to activist and propaganda groups – and prevent the agency from spending any further taxpayer funds to regulate carbon dioxide, impose its new ozone, mercury and WOTUS rules, or participate in new sue-and-settle lawsuits.
Congress should also pass the Secret Science Reform Act, to ensure greater honesty and transparency in EPA rulemakings – and hold hearings on the Pebble Mine and other questionable agency actions, with EPA officials under oath and subject to penalties for perjury, malfeasance and criminality in office.
Presidential candidates must become well versed in these issues, discuss them during interviews and debates, and be prepared to amend, suspend and upend EPA decisions and regulations that were implemented in violation of transparency, integrity, and honest, robust science.
They should also examine how the federal EPA behemoth can be systematically dismantled and replaced with a “committee of the whole” of the 50 state environmental protection agencies – so as to balance and protect our needs for air and water quality, livelihoods, living standards, health and welfare.
State legislators, governors and attorneys general, companies and other aggrieved parties should continue to file lawsuits to block EPA excesses. However, they should stop relying on “abuse of discretion,” as courts almost always bow to government agencies. Instead, they need to demand that every agency decision is grounded in reliable, replicable, testable, peer-reviewed evidence, data and standards – as set forth in the Supreme Court’s Daubert, Joiner and Kumho decisions – and that the agencies demonstrate that they have fully accounted for the negative job, economic, health and welfare impacts of their rulings.
Meanwhile, as Charles Murray (author of By the People: Rebuilding liberty without permission) and others have suggested, states, communities, companies and individuals should engage in a new form of “systemic” civil disobedience: refusing to bow to harmful, nonsensical, tyrannical EPA regulations.
In short, we should take Dylan Thomas’s advice – and rage, rage against the dying of the light – due to regulations that are dimming the lights in our homes and the light of liberty and American exceptionalism.

A paywalled article in the _Financial Times_ reports the musings of Cambridge Professor of Engineering and the Environment, **Julian Allwood**. His conclusion is that the only way for aviation to hit net zero by 2050 is to stop flying. Yeah right!



Dreaming of electric planes and planting trees will not save our planet



The UK aviation industry this week promised to bring its net carbon emissions down to zero by 2050 while growing by 70 per cent, and Prime Minister **Boris Johnson** boldly predicted that “viable electric planes” would be available in just a few years.



In response to an [earlier post](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/this-is-the-type-of-thing-the-facepalm-emoji-was-invented-for/) on _The BFD_ , reader **Brian Dingwall** posted some interesting facts: _“An Airbus A320 Neo carries 266MWh of fuel energy. A battery pack carrying the same energy would weight 1640 tons, 19 times the maximum, take-off weight. [Plugged into] a 1MW source it would take 11 days to charge.”_ We are going to need a lot more space at the airports to park all the planes while charging.



“A ha”, I hear you say, “what about Moore’s Law and everything getting smaller, faster, lighter like computers and smartphones?” Brian’s factoids go on to point out: _“Not applicable. Electrons in a microprocessor do not take up space but ions in a battery do. Only major new battery chemistry will bring major changes.”_



So we have a wee way to go before we take our first battery-powered long-haul vacation.



But past experience with innovation in aviation suggests that such **ambitious targets are unrealistic and distracting**. The only way the UK can get to net zero emission aviation by 2050 is by having **a substantial period of no aviation at all**. Let’s stop placing impossible hopes on breakthrough technologies, and try to hit emissions targets with today’s technologies. Our recent report “Absolute Zero” draws on work at six British universities to explain how. […]



So the commitment to net zero aviation by 2050 is **really a commitment to zero aviation**. Rather than hope new technology will magically rescue us, we should stop planning to increase fossil-fuel flights and commit to halving them within 10 years with an eye toward phasing them out entirely by 2050.



Taxing aircraft fuel at the level of the UK’s current road fuel tax would be a useful first step: **I estimate that it would make flights up to four times more expensive.**



Climate policy announcements so far have failed to account for the limited rate at which new technologies can reach significant scale. Fifty years after the Danes began developing wind turbines, **they contribute just 2 per cent of world primary energy.** Regardless of prices or incentives, new energy generation, transport and industrial processes require public consultation on regulations, land use, funding, environmental impacts and more. This all slows down their adoption.



So the first step is to hike fuel costs and thus ticket prices by a factor of 4 and if that doesn’t work then ground all the planes – simple. Although I do wonder how the CoP delegates are going to get to their annual ~~wasteful talkfests~~ conferences. Perhaps St Greta can organise [a fleet of yachts?](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/st-greta-nails-her-colours-to-the-mast/)



Shaw’s Zero Carbon plan must include the zero carbon plane, shawley?

_—_   
  
Over the past couple of weeks, prominent members of the climate science/climate policy community have come under attack for not toeing the (Presidential) party line when it comes to how human-caused climate change is being billed and sold via the President’ Climate Action Plan.   
  
The attacks began with Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics researcher Willie Soon, and thanks to the attention afforded by Justin Gillis in the _New York Times_ , were expanded by Representative Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), to include Richard Lindzen, David Legates, John Christy, Judith Curry, Robert Balling, Roger Pielke Jr., and Steven Hayward.   
  
In this _You Ought to Have a Look_ , we provide links to the subsequent public comments from those researchers under question (who have made them available) in response to this line of investigation—one which many have termed a “witch hunt.""   




Here they are:

Additionally, there are other comments out there, almost all negatively inclined to Rep. Grijalva’s investigation and its assault on academic freedom.   
  
Here are a few of the more prominent:

It is well-worth looking through these responses to see just how ill-advised this campaign is widely-considered to be.

"**In cities around the world, people are taking to the streets.**
Here's a look at seven places that are seeing varying levels of demonstrations - from peaceful marches to violent clashes.
Soldiers and tanks have been deployed on the streets of Chile for the first time since 1990, when the country returned to democracy after years of military dictatorship.
A state of emergency was declared in the capital, Santiago, on Saturday after protests sparked by a now-suspended increase in metro train prices turned violent. The demonstrations have since widened out to include the cost of living and inequality.
At least five people died in protests over the weekend - after looters torched a garment factory and supermarket - with more disruption expected on Monday.
President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a billionaire conservative, has described demonstrators who have caused fires, set up barricades and looting as ""criminals"".
""We're at war against a powerful and implacable enemy who doesn't respect anything or anyone, and who's willing to use limitless violence and criminal acts,"" he said.
From South America to the Middle East, where protests about corruption and austerity in Lebanon are moving into their fifth day.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been on the streets angry about proposed new taxes - including one on voice calls via WhatsApp and other messaging services that was quickly scrapped after being announced last Thursday.
Power cuts and uncollected rubbish are also a source of anger for protesters.
The country's coalition government looks likely to approve some economic reforms, like scrapping taxes and halving salaries of top officials, to stop the protests.
The weekend started peacefully in Barcelona, with 500,000 people on five marches gathering together in the city centre. But it later descended into violence with some protesters throwing objects at police - who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.
It follows prison sentences being handed to nine separatist politicians in Spain who want Catalonia - the Spanish region where Barcelona is - to form an independent country.
By Sunday - the seventh day of protests - demonstrators sat in front of the Spanish national police headquarters with their smartphone torches turned on.
Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez warned that those who caused disturbances would face justice.
It's not gained as much attention as demonstrations in other countries recently, but Haiti has been going through weeks of protests - not for the first time this year - over an economic crisis unfolding on the Caribbean island.
Haitians are demanding the resignation of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se, who they blame for fuel shortages and worsening inflation - when the cost of living rises, leading to a decline in the value of money.
A prominent journalist who was covering the protests was found dead in his car with gunshot wounds a few weeks ago.
The president previously rejected calls for his resignation, saying he would not leave the country in the ""hands of armed gangs and drug traffickers"".
This one's not ongoing but up to one million people took to London's streets on Saturday, according to organisers of the ""People's Vote march"", to demand a ""final say"" on Brexit.
People from across the UK marched on Parliament Square, with some saying it was the last chance to show how they felt about getting another Brexit referendum, six months on from the last rally of this scale.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson were among the politicians who addressed the crowd, while inside the House of Commons MPs were voting for another delay to Brexit.
The government is trying hard to get MPs to vote on the prime minister's deal on Monday.
Politicians in Northern Ireland are sitting in the country's parliament, Stormont, for the first time in nearly three years after being recalled in a last-ditch attempt to stop changes to the abortion law.
Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government since January 2017 - with politicians in the House of Commons passing some key laws on behalf of Northern Ireland since that time.
A law which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland will come in at midnight - something unionist parties don't want to happen.
It's unlikely politicians there will be able to act in time to change anything - but both those for and against abortion laws being relaxed have been out with placards to let their feelings be known.
There couldn't be a round-up of protests without mentioning Hong Kong - where pro-democracy demonstrations have been taking place for the past four months.
Authorities didn't give permission for this latest march, but organisers say 350,000 people went out anyway - partly fuelled by anger over an attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham last week which left him in hospital.
A hardcore element of the group launched petrol bombs at a police station, although not all of Sunday's demonstrators were violent.
""The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,"" one person told the BBC at the demo. ""That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using.""
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam called for an end to the protests in parliament last week.

The Australian government is obviously heartily sick of being finger-wagged by the holier-than-thou Ardern government. Especially over **climate change.**



At last year’s Pacific Island Forum, **Jacinda Ardern** repeatedly threw pointed sneers at Australia, and PM **Scott Morrison** in particular. Ardern smugly declared that _“Australia has to answer to the Pacific”_ on climate change. With her unrivalled penchant for self-righteousness, Ardern further asserted that _“we will continue to say that New Zealand will do our bit…we have to”._



Yeah, about that…



Coalition MPs have accused New Zealand of hypocrisy over climate change, as the Ardern government looks set to use carry-over credits to hit its 2020 Kyoto target despite its opposition to Australia using the credits to meet its Paris reductions target.



 **So, who’s really doing their bit?**



New Zealand plans to use 27.7 million tonnes worth of credits from outperforming the 2012 target to meet this year’s Kyoto deadline of reducing emissions by 5 per cent on 1990 levels. While New Zealand must use credits to meet its 2020 target, Australia is forecast to beat its 2020 target by 287 million tonnes without the use of the carry-over mechanism.



So, New Zealand is resorting to doing what was derided as dodgy double-counting by the Green lobby, when Australia did it. The only way New Zealand can even pretend to meet its present obligations is by borrowing from the legacy work done long before Ardern came to power. Green-flag-waving Ardern is failing to produce any meaningful action on emissions, while supposed “denier” Morrison is easily beating Australia’s targets.



New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who said Australia had “to ­answer to the Pacific” for its ­climate change position, piled pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison at last year’s ­Pacific Islands Forum to back a UN commitment to a carbon-­neutral economy by 2050, which her government has agreed to do.



 **But New Zealand government figures show the country is forecast to fail to meet its Paris target to ­reduce emissions by 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030.**



New Zealand Climate Change Minister **James Shaw** said last week there was an “allergic reaction” to using carry-over credits to meet 2030 Paris targets despite NZ’s use of carry-over credits to meet its 2020 target.



Speaking to Sky News, Mr Shaw said he was opposed to countries using Kyoto credits to meet their Paris targets.



 **Yet, that is exactly what his government is going to do.**



Australian politicians are lining up to kick back at the sanctimonious Kiwi lefties.



 **Barnaby Joyce** was also among government MPs who took aim at the New Zealand comments.



“They say in the country when your neighbour starts quoting the Bible, start counting your sheep,” Mr Joyce said.



 **“And when New Zealand starts quoting environmental policy, start counting your carbon credits.**



Other government ministers were even less forgiving, after enduring two years of sanctimony from the Ardern government.



LNP senator **Gerard Rennick** declared Australia could reduce its domestic emissions by deporting the more than 600,000 New Zealanders living in Australia.



New Zealand, on the other hand, might more easily meet the obligations it so hypocritically touts, simply by putting an end to the stinking clouds of methane its livestock emit.



I’m not talking farming, by the way: cows and sheep actually serve a useful purpose. I’m referring to the endless gaseous outpourings from the Beehive.

Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
__



  
  
Over the past couple of days, several articles have caught our eyes that we thought worthy of a mention in these pages.   
  
First up is a pair of papers, one by Swiss researcher Peter Landschützer and colleagues and the other by a team led by University of Colorado’s David Munro, that examined trends in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake in the Southern Ocean. In each case, the authors report that carbon uptake has been increasing there during the 21st century. This is good news.   
  
Carbon dioxide uptake is basically the opposite of carbon dioxide emissions. As emissions increase and the atmospheric concentration grows, this puts a pressure on some carbon sinks to expand—notably the standing biomass of vegetation (through carbon fertilization) and the carbon content in the oceans (through Henry’s Law). In fact, the proportion of human carbon dioxide emissions that are being taken up by carbon sinks has been pretty constant for the past 150 years—meaning the sinks are expanding to offset a significant portion of our growing emissions.   
  
Even though the behavior found in the new research paper is confirming expectations, it is worth highlighting in that over the past couple of years several papers were published and subsequently rose to prominence suggesting that the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by the Southern Ocean was slowing down and this was an indication that the carbon sink there was saturating. This had some segments of the climate alarmosphere in a tizzy (google “ocean carbon sink saturating” for some examples). The worry spiral went like this: CO2 emissions were leading to climate changes that were leading to less carbon update by the oceans which was leading to more CO2 in the atmosphere which was leading to more climate change which… you get the point. Uncontrolled positive feedback.   
  
The new findings pretty much stamp out this overheated concern.   
  
From Landschützer et al.:   




Several studies have suggested that the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean—the ocean’s strongest region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2—has weakened in recent decades. We demonstrated, on the basis of multidecadal analyses of surface ocean CO2 observations, that this weakening trend stopped around 2002, and by 2012 the Southern Ocean had regained its expected strength based on the growth of atmospheric CO2.



And from Munro et al:   




Overall, [our results are] suggesting that the Southern Ocean is playing an ever-increasing role in taking up atmospheric CO2.



So it seems that the apparent slowdown in the rate of carbon dioxide uptake in the Southern Ocean was most likely just a passing blip in what is natural variability—the level of which was previously underestimated. No cause for alarm.   
  
Next up is a new paper by hurricane forecasters/researchers Phil Klotzbach, Bill Gray and Chris Fogarty examining the trends and natural variability in a key indicator of Atlantic hurricane behavior. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, or AMO, has long been identified as a dominant influence on the frequency of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean. As its name suggests, the AMO “oscillates” back and forth between its positive and negative states with a time period of several decades. The AMO had been in a “positive” state—one that is conducive for hurricane development--since 1995. In their new paper, Klotzbach and colleagues present evidence that the AMO may have recently switched to a “negative” state—one that tends to hinder hurricane development. This would explain the dearth of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean for the past couple of years and would suggest that we are entering a prolonged period of below average activity.   
  
Klotzbach goes into the details of what they found in a great article hosted by _Washington Post_ ’s Capital Weather Gang. That article begins:   




Floyd, Katrina, Wilma, Ike and Sandy — just a few of the devastating hurricanes we’ve seen in the years since 1995. It’s been an astonishingly active hurricane period of the Atlantic Ocean, costing the U.S. over $500 billion in damages. But there’s evidence to suggest that the painfully memorable, two-decade era that brought some of the most intense hurricanes on record — and some the most active hurricane seasons — is coming to a close.



Not everyone is sold on the idea that the AMO is a real phenomenon and/or that it exerts a major influence on Atlantic hurricane activity. For example, is association with the extremely active hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, several research papers were published and subsequently rose to great prominence, that suggested that rising sea surface temperatures caused by human greenhouse gas emissions were the cause of the observed upswing of hurricane activity—with things only to get worse in the future. The subsequent downturn of hurricane activity, including the on-going (and expanding) record period of time between major hurricane landfalls in the U.S. (which is fast approaching 10 years) has vindicated the AMO and those researchers, like Klotzbach and Gray, who have identified its influence (although there are still some holdouts, as MIT’s Kerry Emanuel, who told AP reporter Seth Borenstein in regards to the new study “I think they're pretty much wrong about this”).   
  
Klotzbach says that time will tell for certain.   
  
And finally, we come across what we think has to be the most unusual suggestions as to how to handle the climate change issue—ask aliens.   
  
Apparently there is something called the Breakthrough Message contest in which a million dollars in prizes will be awarded for “messages that could be read by an advanced civilization.” The Breakthrough Message sponsors want to “encourage debate about how and what to communicate with possible intelligent beings beyond earth.”   
  
In response to the contest, a group of U.K. researchers dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) have decided to submit an entry. They have yet to agree on what their message will contain, but the group’s spokesman told the BCC:   




“[We] also know that our own civilisation is in a fair bit of trouble. We face some pretty big threats. That means it might be a good idea to gamble, and hope there is someone slightly older and wiser out there. If aliens told us something about how to handle our climate, or artificial intelligence, we might want to listen.""



We resist any comparison to the Papal Encyclical.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFear mongering no longer pays: Climate alarmist John Church sacked by Australian government
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated by P Gosselin (NASA image added by P Gosselin)

NASA image showing 6-meter sea level rise. Public Domain image.
Website ClimateChangePredictions.org has taken on the task of recording climate change forecasts in order to compare them to the real, observed developments. A nice example is sea level rise. Currently sea level is rising at about 2-3 mm per year, a trend that would mean about 25 cm by the end of the century. However that does not keep some from publicly trumpeting much higher sea level amounts with the aim of getting publicity.
You’ll find a very interesting list of all prognoses at the named website here. For example Australian climate scientist John Church projects 3 meters by the year 2100.
No room for “extreme, activist views”
With respect to this unbearable climate alarmism, the Australian government has pulled the emergency brake. While Church was on an expedition ship halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica, he was informed by Australian Research authority CSIRO that he was “potentially redundant” and that he would lose his position. That is an overdue signal that unrestrained climate alarmism is no longer tolerable. Society is entitled to balanced science. There must not be any room for extreme, activist views.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported on May 14, 2016:
Global sea-level expert John Church made to walk the plank by CSIRO
For John Church, a leading authority on sea-level rise caused by global warming, there was much that was fitting – and yet callous – about being sacked at sea. The veteran scientist was well into one of dozens of research voyages he had taken since joining CSIRO as a post doctoral student in 1979. His vessel, the RV Investigator, was midway between Antarctica and New Zealand and steaming north on the 170 degree longitude when he received Thursday’s call to tell him he was “potentially redundant”.
Read more: Sydney Morning Herald.
The sacking of Church is part of a large trimming down, which is seeing a wave of hundreds of scientists moving from the climate sciences over to other highly relevant science fields.
In Germany we are still a long way from that point. To the contrary the state-supported and climate activism-tinged IASS Institute Potsdam is searching a scientific staff member through an advert auf stepstone.de:
The Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies e.V. (IASS) in Potsdam is an institution supported by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung and the state of Brandenburg and is dedicated to an all encompassing transdisciplinary and international research of climate change, the earth system components and sustainability.

2015 came to a close with something many people thought they’d never see: The end of the No Child Left Behind Act, the federal education law that no one seemed to like, but that was long overdue for replacement because no one could agree on how to change it. Finally Congress and the Obama administration did agree, and to the delight of many conservatives NCLB was replaced with the Every Student Succeeds Act, a statute that appears to end federal micromanagement. Or does it?



While the law says a lot that seems to rein Washington in, it leaves open several opportunities for major federal influence.



The ESSA probably is an improvement over NCLB. Most notably, it eliminates NCLB’s “adequate yearly progress” nucleus, which subjected schools to increasingly stringent punishments if, say, this year’s fourth graders did not get better scores on state tests than last year’s. The ESSA also prohibits the U.S. Secretary of Education from mandating that states use the highly contentious Common Core curriculum standards. The Core was not part of NCLB, but Washington pushed it with both funding and waivers to escape many of NCLB’s demands.





If we have learned anything over the last few years it is that policymakers will exploit whatever openings they can to assert power.



These are welcome provisions, but they hardly make the ESSA, as the American Enterprise Institute’s Frederick Hess and Elizabeth English recently put it, “a smashing educational triumph” for conservatives. Rather, the ESSA may largely just do a better job than its predecessor of masking Washington’s influence.



The crux of this shadowy power is in three words: “challenging” and “much greater.”



The first is the requirement that, to get ESSA funds, states must adopt “challenging” academic standards and assessments. Who gets to judge what constitutes “challenging”? State plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education, which seems to put the ball squarely in Washington.



But the law prohibits the Secretary from conditioning funding on the use of “specific instructional content, academic standards and assessments, curricula, or program of instruction.” So he clearly cannot influence standards or tests, right?



Wrong. While the Secretary cannot require a “specific” set of standards or assessments, he can, it appears, reject whatever states offer up that he deems not challenging. In other words, he is unable to tell states specifically what to use, but is empowered to say what they _cannot_ employ. So he could control standards and assessments by veto.



These “challenging” standards and tests could also be forced into a federally shaped, test‐​centric accountability framework. While adequate yearly progress and its cascade of punishments are gone, the ESSA requires that the lowest performing five percent of schools face state interventions. It also allows states to use multiple measures of school success, but requires that “much greater” weight be placed on academic measures such as test scores than non‐​academic concerns such as school climate. Ultimately, regulation writers at the U.S. Department of Education will decide what “much greater” means in practice.



Even with these problems in the legislative language, it may still seem far fetched that the ESSA might actually empower micromanagement. But if we have learned anything over the last few years it is that policymakers will exploit whatever openings they can to assert power.



Indeed, one of the major things that finally brought left and right together on the ESSA was anger over conditions that the Obama administration attached to NCLB waivers, such as requiring that states use “college‐ and career‐​ready” standards, and evaluate teachers in part on their students’ state test scores. These demands came despite NCLB giving the Secretary no authority to attach conditions to waivers and, in effect, make law all by himself.



Then there’s this: From Day One of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act — of which NCLB and ESSA are just the most recent permutations — federal education law has contained some version of the following provision: “Nothing…shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s specific instructional content, academic achievement standards and assessments, curriculum, or program of instruction.”



Of course, mandating, directing, and controlling is exactly what we have seen, and there is good reason to worry the ESSA will continue it.

From the LEIBNIZ INSTITUTE FOR TROPOSPHERIC RESEARCH (TROPOS) and the department of settled science comes this new discovery related to cloud formation.
Surface of the oceans affects climate more than thought
First detected abiotic source of isoprene

Lyon/ Leipzig. The oceans seem to produce significantly more isoprene, and consequently affect the climate more than previously thought. This emerges from a study by the Institute of Catalysis and Environment in Lyon (IRCELYON, CNRS / University Lyon 1) and the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS), which had studied samples of the surface film in the laboratory. The results underline the global significance of the chemical processes at the border between ocean and atmosphere, write the researchers in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. Isoprene is a gas that is formed by both the vegetation and the oceans. It is very important for the climate because this gas can form particles that can become clouds and then later affect temperature and precipitation. Previously it was assumed that isoprene is primarily caused by biological processes from plankton in the sea water. The atmospheric chemists from France and Germany, however, could now show that isoprene could also be formed without biological sources in surface film of the oceans by sunlight and so explain the large discrepancy between field measurements and models. The new identified photochemical reaction is therefore important to improve the climate models.
The oceans not only take up heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they are also sources of various gaseous compounds, thereby affecting the global climate. A key role is played by the so-called surface microlayer (SML), especially at low wind speed. In these few micrometers thin layer different organic substances such as dissolved organic matter, fat and amino acids, proteins, lipids are accumulating as well as trace metals, dust and microorganisms.
For the now published study, the research team took samples from the Norther Atlantic Ocean. The surface film was collected in the Raunefjord near Bergen in Norway. For this purpose, a glass plate is immersed in water and then again carefully pulled from the water. The 200 micron thin film sticks to the glass and is then scraped off with a wiper. The sample thus obtained is analyzed in the laboratory later. At the Institute of Catalysis and Environment in Lyon (IRCELYON), which belongs to the French research organization CNRS and the University of Lyon 1, the team investigated its photochemical properties during which collected samples were irradiated with light and the gases were analyzed: it became clear that isoprene was produced in magtnetudes that were previously attributed solely to plankton. “We were able for the first time trace back the production of this important aerosol precursor to abiotic sources, so far global calculations consider only biological sources,” explains Dr. Christian George from IRCELYON.
In the laboratory of IRCELYON in Lyon the sea water was artificially illuminated by the group led by Dr. George Christian. The resultant gases were analysed to investigate the photochemical processes at the interface between sea water and the atmosphere. Photo: IRCELYON
Thus, it is now possible to estimate more closely the total amounts of isoprene, which are emitted. So far, however, local measurements indicated levels of about 0.3 megatonnes per year, global simulations of around 1.9 megatons per year. But the team of Lyon and Leipzig estimates that the newly discovered photochemical pathway alone contribute 0.2 to 3.5 megatons per year additionally and could explain the recent disagreements. “The existence of the organic films at the ocean surface due to biological activities therefore influences the exchange processes between air and sea in a unexpected strong way. The photochemical processes at this interface could be a very significant source of isoprene”, summarizes Prof. Hartmut Herrmann from TROPOS.
The processes at the boundary between water and air are currently of great interest in science: In August, the team from the CNRS and TROPOS presented evidence in Scientific Reports, the open-access journal of Nature, that dissolved organic material in the surface film is strengthening the chemical conversion of saturated fatty acids into unsaturated gas phase products under the influence of sunlight. For the first time it was realized that these products have to be of biological origin not only, but also abiotic processes at the interface between two media have the potential to produce such molecules. In early September another team from Canada, the US, Great Britain and Germany showed in the journal Nature that organic material from the surface film of the oceans can be an important source for the formation of ice in clouds over remote regions of the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean. The recent publication of the teams from CNRS and TROPOS in Environmental Science & Technology provides indications how the climate models in the important details of the influence of isoprene could be improved. Because of the great importance this paper will be open access as “Editor’s Choice”.

 **Viv Forbes**  
[saltbushclub.com](https://saltbushclub.com/category/bushfires/)



Politicians hide behind enquiries – their magic answer to all problems, especially bushfires.



Announcing enquiries give the impression of decisive action, they generate fees for armies of barristers, lawyers and bureaucrats, and provide momentary excitement for the media.



The proposed 2020 Australian Bushfires corrobboree will provide a grandstand for the Climate Rebellion Mob who will get starring roles on ABC/Fairfax. Big business will probably propose a carbon tax to fight bushfires while foresters and land owners will hardly be heard.



When the final report is ultimately delivered, the media will be off trumpeting some new climate “emergency” to scare the public. The expensive new report will be quietly filed with all the others.



We’ve had at least 57 bushfire enquiries since 1939 – about one every two years. Anyone who bothers to read them will soon deduce what should be done. Nothing much has changed except there are more people living in fire prone zones with no protection, and more forest and private land was locked up with heavy fuel loads.



The current bushfire tragedy has occurred after 30 years of unprecedented government control of environmental policy at all levels of government. Many of these destructive policies have been imported under so-called “international agreements”. As a result, ordinary Australians have been dragged into court for constructing firebreaks or removing dangerous trees on their own land. Governments and Green advisers have assumed total stewardship of the environment and they own the results – massive destruction of lives, homes, property, animals and vegetation – over five million hectares and 2,000 homes burnt.



Here is a five point plan which should come from Bushfire Enquiry number 58.



Firstly, reduce the fuel load especially in national parks and forests by cool season burning, grazing, timber harvesting, slashing/mulching and collecting dead fire-wood. Appoint trained and experienced foresters to maintain safe and healthy public forests. Private landowners should also be enabled and obliged to become fire safe. Green-tinged politicians and bureaucrats have prevented or hampered all of these reforms.



Secondly, create and maintain wide clear trafficable roads, tracks and firebreaks through the forests and around towns and private properties. In fire seasons, these patrolled fire-barriers will help to confine any fire to one sector and provide a prepared line from which to back burn if there is an approaching fire.



Thirdly, build more dams and weirs to provide water for fire-fighting and to provide fire havens for humans, animals and vegetation. Increase penalties for arson in times of high fire danger.



Fourthly, abolish all restrictions on responsible management of “protected” vegetation reserves on private land – especially the private land sterilised to fulfil foolish government Kyoto Protocol promises or under government-enforced vegetation protection orders. Governments have created these fire hazards by trying to wrap vast areas of vegetation in cotton wool and green tape (both of which are flammable). Government “protection” of flora and fauna has proved to be the fiery kiss of death.



Fifthly, decentralise fuel and forest management out of the cities and into the regions.



City-based politicians and bureaucrats have done enormous harm by locking up land and opposing fuel load reduction.



Decisions on vegetation risk management should be handed to property owners, park rangers, forest managers and rural fire wardens.



There is no useful role for the Commonwealth unless asked by States or regions for logistic support or to help fund bushfire training and fuels management. Otherwise, it is better if Canberra politicians keep out of the way – send them all for a holiday in Hawaii.



 _Viv Forbes has been an explorer, pastoralist and weather-watcher in Queensland and NT for most of his long life. He has lit fires (accidentally and deliberately), and he and his wife have fought fires and had their camps, fences and pastures wiped out by fires. They were both members of a local bush fire brigade for over 25 years. (Judy even had formal training and a uniform)._

 **[B]e it resolved that [our school] is a Heterodox University**   
  
  
We make the following specific requests to the faculty and administration:   
  
  
**1) Adopt the Chicago Principles on Freedom of Expression**   
  
  
A clear way for the university to show commitment to viewpoint diversity is by adopting the University of Chicago’s Principles on Freedom of Expression, which state in part:   
  
  
The University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong‐​headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University’s educational mission.   
  
  
We request that the Faculty Senate endorse the “Chicago Principles” as official university policy.   
  
  
**2) Implement a non‐​obstruction policy for protests**   
  
  
We support the right of all students to protest against speakers and writers with whom they disagree, but we ask that protests be done in a way that does not deprive other students of their rights to speak and hear. When members of our community shout down a speaker, or take other actions intended to make it more difficult for a speaker to speak or for an audience to hear, they are practicing obstruction, censorship, and sometimes intimidation, not free speech. Such practices have no place in any academic community. We request that the university formulate and enforce a non‐​obstruction policy. As stated in the Chicago Principles: “The University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”   
  
  
**3) Improve viewpoint diversity**   
  
  
We request that the university include viewpoint diversity, and particularly political diversity, in its diversity policies and in its efforts to diversify the faculty and the curriculum. We want to encounter a range of viewpoints in the classroom, just as we will after we graduate.



Adoption of these resolutions will mark a school as a “Heterodox University” – a safe space for intellectual diversity and uncensored speech. Heterodox Academy stands ready to help tailor these resolutions to specific universities and to help support students who wish to promote these principles. For more information, click here.

Satire (Possibly)



It came as a bolt from the blue. An email arrived from a crazy lady. I’d occasionally scribbled some words for a website catering to fellow right-wing nut-jobs and had submitted a piece for the editor’s consideration vis-à-vis publication. 



The email from said Devil-ess arrived a couple of hours afterwards. You won’t believe what it contained. She requested, nay, demanded: **evidence,** to substantiate claims made in my wittering screed, she stating rather severely that my (I’m very sure, of this I am certain) absolutely wonderful piece would no longer be considered for publication unless facts were forthcoming. I was, as you can well imagine, flabbergasted by the mad-woman’s affront, her high-handed nit-pikkery.



Evidence! Evidence [sigh]. Crikey. What the sheesh is evidence? And, who needs it? Not our ‘respectable’ daily news press, that’s for sure. Nevertheless, I acquiesced to the tyrant, responding with the considerable volume of 1,300 bytes of sober non-binary truth, signing it off; ‘Ha. So there!’ (Or, possibly; not).



By way of contrast, I found myself in the same sticky conundrum as our right-wing nut-job inter-web page editor (who shall remain un-named) a couple of weeks ago. Wellington’s daily rag announced on January 10th, 2020 in a front-page headline ‘Climate change takes hold’ that the temperature of 30.3c reached on January 29th, 2019 was ‘the highest temperature in Wellington since records began.” [Cue: a sharp intake of breath].



This revelatory record announcement actually annoyed me. Knowing that particular day’s temperature number was not, in fact, a record at all irritated me all over, to the point of correspondence, into which I foolishly enjoined, asking for (God help me) ‘evidence’ and challenging their ‘record’.



To their immense credit I received a reply from someone describing themselves as a ‘senior journalist’ from said rag, but honestly (you can trust me), it only missed [a parrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo) to complete the hilarious farce. Such was the apologetic.



Beginning with ‘I have an answer’ [to my consternation over their quite obvious bullshittery] senior reporter stated that “since records began” means, as far as they are concerned “1927”, which is exactly **not** when records began; that particular part of verified meteorological history began **sixty-three years before** , in 1864…[“He’s not dead, he’s just resting, probably pining for the fjords. Norwegian Blue’s do that”.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo)



Continuing on, senior reporter conceded “1895”, “ **may have been hotter** ” but, Aha! “Presumably it was measured differently”. Well; perhaps it was. Perhaps the thermometer reading was scaled to the volume of the bucket of water our government meteorologist emptied over his head at the time of measurement. I wasn’t there, so can’t confirm that the good weatherman used the accepted temperature scale and not a calibrated clipping from ‘Shipping News’. Who knows, maybe our ‘senior reporter’ is right.



Next: maybe the 1895 temperature was measured “at a different site”. Entirely possible, I suppose. The temperature recorded for downtown Wellington may have actually, fraudulently, been conveyed from Sivaganga, Southern India, but conceding this possibility would render the entire local temperature record as seriously misbehaved and, therefore, inadmissible to terrifying modern reconstructions and computer-models. That simply wouldn’t do.



There’s more: senior reporter (seriously) suggests that maybe the 1895 measurement was made “with different equipment”. Oh, my giddy Aunt. Good grief. Mr Fahrenheit perfected his Mercury-thermometer in 1752, nevertheless; perhaps temperature measurements were recorded in Wellington, New Zealand 143 years later using a six-inch rule, maybe a sextant, let’s not rule out the possibility of the maximum shade-sweep length of an isoscelised triangulation of Brazilian bananas being used to gauge the temperature. For heaven’ sake, what a ridiculous defence to mount in support of an unverifiable, certifiably false, **front-page full-frontal Fib.**



[‘This parrot is deceased. He is no more. He’s run off ‘is perch to meet ‘is maker. He is a Dead Parrot!’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZw35VUBdzo) [Customer bangs rigamortised parrot on counter-top. Parrot-seller looks downward, morosely].



The correspondence descended (or ascended), to some heights (or lows), depending on your viewpoint. But that, people; is the state of the ‘Climate Crisis’ reporting from science so settled it needs no real facts, only inventive alternative suggestions and, certainly, no debate will be entered into. And, just to keep the anonymous but ever-watchful editorial and readership pedants happy, should you closet any (completely sane) reason to distrust my mirthful memoranda:



That’s all, folks. Enjoy your global warming, brought to you by fact-free _Stuff_ with no shame, with no embarrassment, and with no veracity whatsoever, at all.



Who would you rather trust with your facts?

We are seeing a great deal of debate at the moment over ~~teaching~~ brain-washing of students with a [climate alarmism curriculum.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/teaching-global-warming-in-schools-provides-a-great-opportunity/) Chief among the proposals is to have students adopt a vegan diet, all to save the planet. Meat-eating is said to contribute a horrendous negative amount to the perils of climate change.



The vegan nasties have ramped up their pressure, raiding supermarkets and harassing and haranguing meat-eaters. But it seems the science isn’t with either the vegans or the climate alarmists.



Vegans face a moral dilemma – animal welfare or climate change. Dr Graeme Coles, a Canterbury-based nutrition scientist, has done the calculations.



He estimates that **someone getting their minimum essential amino acid requirements from plant-based foods excrete more climate-damaging material than the same person getting them from animal products.**



“ **Avoiding animal protein in the diet means excreting 32g/day more nitrous oxides than people on omnivorous diets”** he says.



 **“The extra nitrous oxides from a vegan’s diet are equivalent to the emissions associated with two return journeys annually from New Zealand to London”.**



Oh dear, vegan farts and burps are very bad for the environment.



The problem for vegans is that **plant-derived protein is of markedly lower nutritional value than animal-derived protein.**



This is because of its low content of essential amino acids. A combination of amino acids is needed in order to maintain muscle and the immune system; if there is a limiting amino acid then other amino acids (and the nitrogen they contain) will be wasted.



Further problems are associated with the measures that plants have evolved to prevent predation. These are termed “antinutritional factors” – **the nutrients appear to be present but can’t be accessed by the digestive system.**



 **In order to overcome this, humans apply treatments such as soaking, heating, acidification, or pulverisation.** Treatment **takes time and energy, which increases the greenhouse gases associated with the food.**



Stick that in your hemp bong and smoke it.



Soybeans are the only staple crop also considered a protein crop. Soy ranks sixth for provision of calories globally, and soybeans are approximately 36 per cent protein when dry. After soaking overnight and cooking for a couple of hours, the protein is 17 per cent.



But soy’s high concentrations of antinutritional components mean that only a portion of the soybean protein is digested; the estimate is approximately 73 per cent, in comparison with 80-100 per cent from animal proteins.



Furthermore, the antinutritional factors delay the digestion of soy and other proteins in the diet. Other legumes have considerably lower protein quality and are generally less than 60 per cent digestible.



And on top of that soy is high in phytoestrogen, or a plant-based estrogen, which if consumed in large quantities turns you into an effete half-man with the constitution of a wilted pansy otherwise known as soy-boys.



In contrast, most of **the protein in meat, egg and dairy is digested in the first part of the small intestine, which enhances rate of absorption**. Processing animal products is easier too: beef is 26-34 per cent protein, and cooking takes five minutes (depending on the taste of the consumer).



Meat, delicious and climate-friendly too.



 **There is another problem with plants, even before food reaches the human mouth: wastage.** Food that is suitable for humans to eat is also suitable for other consumers – termed pests.



Whether the pests have legs (mammals, reptiles, birds, insects), no legs (nematodes, slugs, snails), or are fungi, bacteria or viruses, they destroy plants and stored plant products.



Glasshouses or vertical farms mitigate against predation but are not practicable for staple crops such as maize, rice and wheat (the top three global staple crops). Nor are they suitable for potatoes, cassava or soybeans (the next three).



In fact, **glasshouses and vertical farming are suitable only for relatively high-value crops, which provide vitamins and variety but not carbohydrates or proteins.**



Technological developments might change this in the future, as might the price that people are prepared to pay, but in the meantime the bulk of crops are grown outdoors and protected by the farmer with nets and sprays.



This protection is only partially successful.



Veganism seems very wasteful. But wait, it gets way worse:



In the developed world wastage occurs at and after harvesting. In the UK, **up to 30 per cent of vegetable crops aren’t harvested at all** because they do not meet exacting market standards for appearance.



 **Harvesting itself leaves much material in the field – over 80 per cent of broccoli, 6 per cent of wheat, 50 per cent of pineapple. More is lost in storage.**



Of the produce that does reach the supermarket, **promotions encourage customers to purchase excess, which, in the case of perishable foodstuffs, inevitably generates wastage in the home.** ImechE estimates that **between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of what has been bought in developed countries is thrown away by the purchaser.**



Therefore, **an unintended consequence of moving to a plant-based diet is increased waste** including all the resources that went into the wasted food.



This includes the nutrients, water and fossil fuels, and the land area that has produced waste, not food.



Fussy eaters and fussy consumers as well. It doesn’t seem like they are saving the planet much at all; in fact, it looks like they are harming the planet because of their stupid diet.



The most efficient way of processing plant proteins into consumable and useful proteins that the human body can use is animals. They eat the plants, processing them into useful proteins, then we eat them.



Don’t expect vegans to take this information well as they have enfeebled their minds with their plant-based diet.



So, you can stick your fake meat patties where the sun doesn’t shine. You know vegans are stupid because they keep trying to make vegetables look like meat. There should be consumer laws that prevent companies from calling plant-based foods meat.



Finally, if are still convinced that your plant-based existence is still warranted, then consider this video and sit crying into your soy latte at your hypocrisy:

"
"GLEN ELDER, Kan.  —   Doug Palen, a   grain farmer on Kansas’   plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter. To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration  —   the trapping of    gases in plant life and in the soil  —   or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land. In short, he is a climate change realist. Just don’t expect him to utter the words “climate change. ” “If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that’s their choice,” Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. “I have a farm to run. ” Here in   Kansas, America’s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn’t settled. So while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else. “People are all talking about it, without talking about it,” said Miriam Horn, the author of a recent book on conservative Americans and the environment, “Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman. ” “It’s become such a charged topic that there’s a navigation people do. ” Mr. Palen  —   he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton  —   and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance. Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. “When you don’t get the rainfall, it’s tough times,” he said. Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college  —   whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings  —   speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming). And an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change  . “Some readers thanked us,” the editor Gil Gullickson said. “But some wondered whether we’d been hijacked by avid environmentalists. ” The climate has not always been such a partisan issue. Richard Nixon, a Republican president, set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Montreal Protocol, the first global treaty to protect the global atmosphere. Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a   push by   interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack   research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened. President Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of   programs from the White House and State Department websites. It has also ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the E. P. A. and other government agencies. The fact that the   discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment. The Trump campaign successfully seized on that schism, painting Democrats as overzealous environmentalists with little sympathy for the economic realities or social mores of rural America. “Many of our federal environmental laws are being used to oppress farmers instead of actually helping the environment,” Mr. Trump quipped in a widely circulated Q. and A. on FarmFutures. com. “Farmers care more for the environment than the radical environmentalists. ” Still, “it would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,” Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive   agenda, she said, “there will be a big backlash in the heartland. ” In many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His   the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of   Kansas. Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called “no till,” which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas’ relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind   farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion. Mr. Palen’s fields aren’t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. “They say there’s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,” Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is   yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious. “See how it’s firm and holds together?” he said. “See how it doesn’t break down into goo?”   farming addresses a dire problem facing American farmers: Almost 1. 7 billion tons of topsoil are blown or washed off croplands a year, according to the Department of Agriculture, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for farmers. Keeping the soil healthy and covered also reduces evaporation by 80 percent, helping farmers conserve water, the department estimates. Farmers like Mr. Palen also happen to be protecting a vast and valuable carbon sink, making him an ally to   campaigners. The soil traps far more carbon in its depths than all plant and animal life on the earth’s surface, scientists estimate. A 2013 study estimated that   and other restorative farming methods could achieve up to 15 percent of the total carbon reduction needed to stabilize the climate. Despite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America. “We want to be left alone,” Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E. P. A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers. And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. “We’re the ones working to protect the environment. We’re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth. ” Carl Priesendorf, a science teacher at Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, Mo. has learned strategies to talk about climate change without completely alienating climate skeptics. He teaches geology and meteorology. Those subjects would usually be innocuous, but not here. “I’d show the CO2 data  —   how we’d had the hottest year on record,” Mr. Priesendorf said. “But I get students who basically say what I’m teaching is nonsense. My car’s been keyed. I get notes from students saying they’re praying for my soul. ” One such note that he shared reads, “Know that God’s love surpasses knowledge. ” Since a particularly contentious debate in class  —   a student threw a book bag at him, he said  —   Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. “I ask: ‘Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?’ That’s science,” he said. “Then I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change. ” That is an uphill battle. A 2013 survey found that just 8 percent of farmers in the Midwest believed that “climate change is occurring, and it is caused mostly by human activities. ” An earlier Pew Research Center poll found that only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is “solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,” a number below other regions in the country. And conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group’s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism. But now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. “If even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it’ll be even tougher for science teachers,” he said. “I’m going to focus on keeping my students’ minds open to the possibility that the science is correct. ” Annie Kuether, a Democrat and   advocate in the   Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee’s chairman does not believe in climate change. A St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state. She has sat through committee meetings where climate skeptics, including the discredited scientist   Soon, blasted the science behind global warming. “Carbon Dioxide, CO2, is merely a bit player in climate change,” reads one slide Mr. Soon presented in 2013. “Rising CO2 is largely beneficial to plant and human life. ” “I remember being horrified,” Ms. Kuether said. Still, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income. “Gradually, from a political standpoint, you can build a constituency that benefits from this industry,” said Mark Lawlor, one ally and an executive at Clean Line Energy Partners, which is building a    transmission line to deliver 4, 000 megawatts of wind power from western Kansas to Missouri, Illinois and other neighboring states. “Just like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind’s another valuable resource Kansas can export,” he said, referring to Kansas’ sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. “Kansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits. ” Kansas’ dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state’s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action. In fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. “I’ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water  —   whether they’re Democratic, Republican or independent,” she said. Mr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An   veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data. “I started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,” he said. “And it’s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, ‘I’ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information. ’” So for the first time in the storied magazine’s    history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, “@#$*% Weather!” “I know what you’re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore’s imagination adopted by liberal   who want to tank the U. S. economy,” Mr. Gullickson wrote. “Still, think back over some rough weather you’ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,” he continued. “Are springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?” The clear answer, he said: “Yes. ” Mr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article’s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash. Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor’s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine’s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, “Never use the words ‘climate change. ’” “I was told: ‘Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,’” he wrote. The industry publication, which has a circulation of 390, 000, was influenced by some of the biggest names in agriculture taking a stand on the issue, Mr. Gullickson said. The agricultural giant Cargill has started to lobby members of Congress and urged farmers to take climate change seriously, saying inaction would be detrimental to the United States economy. The response to the magazine’s take on the issues has been split. “When you start quoting ‘climate scientists’ and the United Nations,” wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, “you are as nutty as Al Gore. ” Measures to control emissions, he said, “are just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses. ” Mr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. “Finally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,” wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis. Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people’s inability to speak openly. “The phrase has become so politicized, it’s just hard to talk about,” he said. “But we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing. ” Mark Salvo, vice president at the wildlife conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, might be a walking, talking stereotype of the kind of environmentalist who so frustrates Mr. Palen. An Oregonian now based in Washington, he spent 15 years in the American West fighting to conserve fish and wildlife on public lands. But Mr. Salvo thinks he knows an unlikely  —   and highly sympathetic  —   character to bring Kansans and others together around climate change: the lesser  . Known for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser   once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat  —   its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the   Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to   drought, farming, drilling and other human activity. The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser   as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers. Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn’t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird’s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser  . In the “Little House on the Prairie” novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating   mush. Mr. Salvo also stresses how   practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil. “Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,” he said. “It helps everybody come to the table. ” Last week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather  —   if not climate change  —   at a conference of   farmers  in Salina, Kan. Sessions included “Using Your Water Efficiently,” “Making Weather Work for You in 2017” and “Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing,” a practice that helps to fertilize the land. And yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser  . “I often think of ways I can protect their habitat,” he said. “I enjoy wildlife. ”"

The biggest problem with [NZ First having scuppered ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/the-backdown-on-a-cgt-is-bad-for-national/)Jacinda’s proposed Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is that the subject will never go away. Even if Jacinda adheres to her promise to never introduce it, the next Labour leader will bring the subject up again. It doesn’t matter what the proletariat thinks; as we all know, from the 2016 US election and the 2019 UK election, voters are “deplorables” and have no idea what they are voting for. The next Labour leader, whoever that is, will bring it back into play, the Greens will start to jump up and down with excitement and the whole darned debate will start up again. You can be sure of it.



And as sure as night follows day, on the second day of 2020, the subject of tax reform has been raised again by our beloved messiah, [Shamubeel Eaqub.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/delusional-drongo-doubles-down/) It has the same feel about it as Brexit had: the people don’t want it, but they are stupid. Let’s keep pushing for it and eventually, everyone will come around to our way of thinking. Shamubeel might want to have a little chat with Jeremy Corbyn about that attitude.



Our tax system has worked pretty well so far. But the pressures will grow over coming decades. The two most immediate threats, from my view, are demographics and decarbonisation. 



A big chunk of taxes comes from a cut of wages. But as the population ages, the tax burden will grow for a shrinking base of taxpayers. 



Popular myth No 1, constantly bandied about by Shamubeel and his ilk is that we have an ageing population. In fact, as I have pointed out before, the median age in New Zealand is currently 37.3 years. Most of those 37 year-olds either already have children, or they will, at some time in the future. Until a person can be born at the age of 65, we do not have a serious problem with an ageing population.



One glaring discrepancy was on how we tax savings, where land was lowly taxed compared to all other forms. This leads to the natural conclusion that we should explore some kind of land tax that is broad based but low.



Because land cannot run away, it is a relatively easy thing to tax.



(The old mantra is that socialists will tax anything that moves. Clearly they will tax absolutely everything.)



I assume he is talking about taxing land that is held, rather than land being sold. Land sales are, in fact, taxed in many cases – on those in the business of property development, and under the Bright Line Test. No. We are talking about some kind of annual levy on landowners, which is exactly the sort of tax that Michael Cullen so desperately wanted to impose on all those ‘rich pricks’.



But, those who have ever studied Taxation 101 know that the first underlying principle of taxation is that it must be fair. There is nothing fair about imposing a tax on an asset that produces no income, and therefore no way to pay the tax. If land produces income, as in farming, then that income is taxed elsewhere. This proposal is like taxing a courier driver for his courier income and then imposing a special tax on his van. It is stupid, inequitable, and would cause financial hardship in many cases, where there is no income to pay the tax from. 



Another problem with this idea, of course, is that all the expensive land is in the cities, usually under houses, but the family home will have to be exempted from this tax. So the poor unfortunate guy living on his lifestyle block in Murchison will be paying land tax every year, whereas homeowners in Herne Bay, with sections worth a million dollars, get off scot-free. It was partly this kind of inequality that scuppered the CGT last year, but at least CGT would only have been applied on the sale of a property. Eaqub’s latest idea will result in a financial burden year after year.



The idea of a land tax goes back to the days when only the extremely wealthy owned land. They employed serfs to do the work and made bucketfuls of cash. These days, there are few barons left. Most farmers work extremely hard and have large loans, owners of lifestyle blocks often plant lots of trees and while their wealth may be in the land, it is unrealised wealth. If we could all dig down into a rabbit hole and find wads of cash, the idea of a land tax would be fair enough. Unfortunately, that is not yet possible. 



Eaqub studiously ignores the fact that the current tax system is, in fact, mostly fair. Income taxes are graduated, and thanks to Working for Families, many people on low incomes actually pay no income tax at all. I simply do not understand why there is this constant call for more fairness in the tax system when it features policies like that. **How can paying no income tax be ‘unfair’ to low-income families?**



No. This is just yet another attack on the perceived ‘rich’ and yet another attack on farmers. No doubt there is a climate motive in Eaqub’s thinking too, but therein lies one fatal flaw. A land tax will not just affect those evil dairy farmers who provide us with one of the staples of life. It will also affect orchardists, crop growers and foresters. Yes, even kale growers will have to pay land tax. Watch out for an increase in the price of mung beans. Watch out also for a dramatic drop in the number of trees being planted, as landowners look to sell up to avoid the tax.



 **And who will they sell to? They will sell to foreigners.** Yes, that’s right. Eaqub has globalism in his sights too. 



Landlords will no doubt be affected, which is all part of the plan. Eaqub hates landlords with a passion. If such a tax were introduced, it is likely that only the land under a family home would be exempted, which means this would be **another cost on rental properties.** Eaqub believes that, as time goes on, more and more people will be forced to rent, but he never explains how landlord bashing policies are going to make this situation any better. Already, we have landlords leaving the rental markets in droves, selling up and taking their untaxed capital gains with them, and a land tax might well be the final straw for those few landlords game enough to stay on. 



You must remember that Shamubeel Equab is the economic writer who told everyone to rent rather than buy a house… and then went out and bought a house for himself and his family because they ‘needed the security’ that owning a house brings. In other words, it is OK for other people to be turfed out of their rentals on an all too frequent basis, but that is not good enough for the Eaqub family. With that level of barefaced hypocrisy, I am amazed that he has the nerve to voice his opinion anywhere again, but it is, as we all know, OK if members of the elite do it.



All in all, this is a bad idea. This prevailing idea that we should tax the ‘rich’ into oblivion fails to see the bigger picture: it is landowners, mostly in the form of farmers, that are the backbone of our economy, and hitting them over and over again with levies and taxes when their income is at best unpredictable is a great way to destroy our economic powerhouse. 



Taxation is never an incentive, in any shape or form. The success of this country has been built on the back of hard work and enterprise. Now people like Eaqub want to destroy that, all in the name of equality. One has to wonder, however, exactly who is really in need of equal treatment these days – the low-income family paying no income tax? Of course not. Eaqub, like Michael Cullen, can never resist an opportunity to stick it to those ‘rich pricks’. Nothing has changed in 2020.

"Sitting on a bar stool, the glass in front of him mostly drained, the actor Richard Roxburgh leaned in to make a point. It was early afternoon on a Tuesday, but the muscles in his jaw were slack, his blue eyes vague. He spoke with quiet urgency, his words faintly misshapen, and when he gestured for emphasis, he didn’t seem to notice that his hands were right in my face. The sober boundaries of social behavior had dissolved, abruptly, in an alcoholic haze. That was the idea, of course. Perched in the window of an espresso bar on West 47th Street, drinking nothing stronger than a cortado, Mr. Roxburgh, 55, was demonstrating a   skill: playing drunk. “In terms of the study of alcohol and its effects, I probably have an unfair advantage in that I am, A, Australian, and, B, an actor,” he said, his eyes perfectly clear now, glinting with humor. “I’ve had probably an unhealthy overexposure to the shenanigans of booze over time. ” If so, he’s putting it to good use. Through March 19 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, he’s starring opposite Cate Blanchett in “The Present,” a Chekhov adaptation that floats along on a vodka tide, gradually snaring his character, Mikhail, in the undertow. (It does not help that Mikhail downs a whole bottle of the stuff in Act III.) Back home, on the Australian television series “Rake,” Mr. Roxburgh has spent several seasons playing a different sort of alcoholic, a lawyer determined even in middle age to keep the party going. Performing drunkenness requires striking what is, for many actors, an elusive balance  —   somewhere between sloshy and straight. “Seeing bad drunk acting is probably like watching an actor trying to squeeze out tears,” Mr. Roxburgh said. “It’s kind of     excruciating. ” This is his advice for getting it right. “That would be my first question always: Why are you doing it?” Mr. Roxburgh said. “Because we all do it for a reason. ” How to play the character, and the drunkenness, depends in part on the answer. “A lot of what I do is instinctual in a way,” Mr. Roxburgh said, “and it’s based on observations that I made over a life of being surrounded by Australian actors, and stealing from it. ” Well, that and muscle memory a family man these days, he drinks less than he used to. But he’s familiar with the moment when a pleasant buzz gives way to a loss of control, and he recognizes the difference between sanguine drunks and the darker sorts, like Mikhail, whose vodka demons keep him company. Mr. Roxburgh stood up, planting his feet some distance apart. “There’s a stance that might happen at a certain point, which is a kind of slightly wider leg stance. If your legs are together, your center of gravity is a much more dangerous element, and you will literally fall over. A very drunk person, the room is doing this for them,” he said, tilting his arms from one side to another. “It’s as if they’re on a ship at sea. ” That doesn’t mean they will lurch or clutch, but they might rest a hand on a chair, “just for a little bit of support,” a fixed point of physical reference. “The more you try and stand up straight, there’s always a part of you that has to know the world is spinning. ” “There’s also a very subtle kind of tipping that might happen in the body,” Mr. Roxburgh said, and as he leaned, his eyes clouded over. For a moment, he might have been utterly wasted. “Another element is the gaze, which is that famous   thing where somebody is talking to you, but they’re not quite there. The world is bleary to them, and your face at a certain point becomes, to all intents and purposes, pixelated. So they’re not looking with any clarity into your eyes. ” “It’s fascinating reading things like the police studies into blood alcohol levels and what they actually do to your response times” behind the wheel, Mr. Roxburgh said. “The same thing obviously applies in terms of your conversation, your responses, the way you inhale and feed out information just in the normal sense of conversation when you’re drunk. “But it can be very subtle stuff, I suppose the way you might slightly stutter on a word or rethink the way that you’re going to go into a sentence. It blocks clear thinking that’s a fact. ” Counterintuitive, yes, but Mr. Roxburgh was adamant that this is an essential part of playing drunk: struggling against the sloppier effects of inebriation rather than giving in to them. “Remember that the person that you’re playing almost invariably doesn’t want to appear drunk,” he said. “In bad drunk acting, you see somebody wobbling around all over the place and slurring their words in a very overt way. ” In the real world, though, the   try to get their minds and bodies to obey the normal rules: speaking clearly, making sense, not falling over. And it’s precisely that extra focus that can give their game away. The more determined they are not to seem drunk, Mr. Roxburgh said, the more clearly drunk they will seem."
"Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year. House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods, with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico. With the tax, the price for some heavily imported items could go up. But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper. While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket. A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1. 50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years. The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1. 50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value  —   the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border. That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store’s rent, the store’s bills for   and other utilities, or the wages for the store’s staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado. For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece. So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado. It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without. That is right  —   a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions. Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies  —   even the   onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms  —   so they owe corporate tax. That is notable because various plans being circulated call for a border tax to be used to help reduce the corporate profits tax. Right now, the corporate profits tax is 35 percent. Multinationals like Apple actually pay a lot less, in part because much of their profits are held offshore. That is harder for an onion farmer to do, although there are tax breaks for farmers. With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers. The whole idea behind the House Republicans’ plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods. Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers. Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax. That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference."

Last month’s vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union gives control over trade policy back to British officials, who are now faced with the difficult task of creating new domestic institutions and formulating trade and other international economic policies. 



Some of their immediate work is obvious. The UK must negotiate a new economic relationship with Europe, both with the EU and with non‐​EU countries. The UK’s relationship with the EU could be along the lines of what Norway or Switzerland currently have with the EU, or it could be something less extensive, such as the trade agreement Canada and the EU have been negotiating. As to trade with the non‐​EU part of Europe, it makes sense for the UK to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) (it could even consider becoming part of EFTA). In addition, the UK will need to make a decision on whether to be part of the EU customs union, which will have a significant impact on how much control it has over its trade policy.



The UK must also restructure its relationship with its trading partners at the World Trade Organization (WTO). It was an original member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and remains a member of the WTO in its own right. However, as it subsumed its trade policy to that of the EU over the years, the EU took over negotiations on its behalf, and the UK’s WTO membership is now intertwined with that of the EU. The job of the UK trade negotiators is to disentangle themselves, and establish the UK as a fully independent member of the WTO.1



Beyond Europe and existing international institutions, the possibilities for UK trade policy are more open ended, with a great deal of discretion on future directions. Two big questions are: (1) How free‐​trade oriented will the UK be? And (2) how will the UK approach trade negotiations with countries outside Europe? This paper evaluates the UK’s options, and makes recommendations for how it should proceed.



The motivations for the UK leaving the EU were complex and varied, and many issues played a role. In the area of trade policy, it is difficult to discern a single view among those supporting Brexit. Some Leave proponents have hinted at protectionism, whereas others were strong free traders.



On the protectionist side, UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage noted that leaving the EU would offer greater protection against China’s dumping of steel. He also complained about EU procurement laws, stating: “Whether we are building a warship or whatever it is, under EU rules we have to tender this out to German companies and French companies as well.”2 On the free trade side, by contrast, economist Patrick Minford, a member of the Economists for Brexit group, argued for cutting import tariffs to zero immediately after the vote.3



So how will this conflict between supporters of the vote to leave the EU be resolved? There is a tradition of free trade within the UK. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 is still held out as one of the great examples of unilateral free trade. In today’s political climate, pure free trade of this sort is difficult to achieve. Nonetheless, hopefully the post‐​EU leaders of the UK will draw on the views of their ancestors, and try to keep the UK as a champion of free trade. When there are choices to be made as to whether to be protectionist or not, the UK should err on the side of openness and liberalization.



These days, however, free trade is largely an international issue. Governments negotiate mutual reductions in trade barriers, with international agreements to enforce their commitments. 



But there are many models for these negotiations, with different countries taking different views about what a trade agreement should involve. The UK has a blank slate in front of it and thus has many options available.4 The two most important questions for future UK trade agreements are: (1) With whom should the UK negotiate? And (2) what should it negotiate about?



As noted, the UK will be negotiating a new relationship with the EU and with other European neighbors. This is not in doubt. There are questions, though, about how the UK should select other trade negotiating partners.



To maximize the value of its initial trade negotiations, the UK should think about several factors: (1) Which countries have the most to offer in terms of a substantial economic relationship; (2) with which countries would the negotiations be the smoothest; and (3) which countries would involve the least external controversy in a trade negotiation.



To achieve the greatest economic gains, the UK should look for fairly large economies as negotiating partners, so as to maximize the impact of its initial negotiations.



To ensure a speedy and smooth negotiation, the UK should look for countries with whom it shares cultural ties and/​or political values. Trade negotiations often get bogged down in various disagreements. Having a good overall relationship can help minimize this.



And to minimize controversy, the UK should avoid, at least for its initial trade negotiations, trade agreements with large developing countries, whose cheap labor is seen by some as a threat. This is a political reality, rather than a rational economic assessment.



With this guidance in mind, and weighing and balancing all of these factors, the best candidates for the initial trade negotiations would be Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States; and perhaps developed countries such as South Korea and Japan. These countries maximize the potential value of an international economic agreements; the agreement could be done relatively quickly, and they would minimize any controversy. Of these countries, Australia and New Zealand are likely to be the ones most open to fully liberalized trade. Some of the others might resist full liberalization, but the size of their markets makes them important nonetheless.



With regard to developing countries, one possible exception to their initial exclusion would be a North Atlantic trade agreement that included Mexico in addition to Canada and the United States. But as a general matter, if the UK wants to complete trade agreements quickly and without controversy, large developing countries may have to wait a bit. China and India, for example, offer great possibilities. Unfortunately, negotiations with these countries will lead to objections from a range of groups.5



Perhaps the most important question for the UK in deciding on a new trade agreement policy is what to negotiate about. Ongoing trade negotiations such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have dragged on for years. The UK should try to avoid a process that takes five years or more. A quick agreement done in one or two years would be preferable.



To achieve this, the UK should consider a streamlined approach to negotiating trade agreements that focuses on core trade liberalization issues and leaves out the more complex and controversial regulatory and governance issues that have led to delays in other trade negotiations.



To get a sense of this, consider various chapters in the CETA. There are chapters on technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which mostly duplicate what already exists at the WTO. There is a chapter on investment, even though investment barriers between Canada and the EU are limited. And the investor state dispute settlement mechanism engenders great controversy, without clear evidence that it actually encourages investment. There is a competition policy chapter that achieves very little. There is a chapter on intellectual property, even though the benefits of intellectual property protections that go further than what already exists are questionable, and including such chapters in trade agreements has been controversial. And there are chapters on sustainable development, labor, and the environment that stray far beyond trade liberalization.



Instead of the broad global economic governance agreements that have become the norm in the trade negotiating world, the UK should negotiate trade agreements that focus on trade liberalization. They should cover tariff reductions, services liberalization, and opening procurement markets. There should also be a placeholder for negotiating future mutual recognition agreements for trade in specific goods and services.



With regard to tariffs, the UK should be bold and propose zero tariffs on all products. Trade negotiations can get bogged down in balancing out the demands from each side for continued tariff protection and in determining how long phase‐​out periods should be. However, the simplest and most beneficial tariff policy is to remove all tariffs as quickly as possible. Certain trading partners may resist, but UK trade negotiators should take zero tariffs as the starting point. If the UK is willing to eliminate all of its tariffs, it sends the right message about its seriousness in the negotiations and will, hopefully, lead to trading partners reciprocating with zero tariffs of their own.



Services are traded differently than goods, and the barriers tend to be regulatory in nature. That makes services negotiations inherently more controversial than simple tariff lowering. With services trade, the UK should focus on particular areas that are less sensitive. As an example of a controversial sector, the TTIP negotiations have been undermined by concerns that the UK’s National Health Service could be subject to challenge by U.S. healthcare companies. The UK should make clear at the outset that regulations and policies such as this are not going to be covered by a trade negotiation (although domestic reform of the National Health Service would be welcome). It needs to establish general principles and specific rules that leave no doubt about this.



A cross‐​cutting area, which covers both trade in goods and services, is government procurement. Many trade agreements in the past have been successful in opening procurement markets to competition from foreign providers. The UK should also push hard in these negotiations to open its market and those of its trading partners.



Beyond these core issues, there is the potential for mutual recognition of domestic regulations related to product standards and services qualifications, under which goods and services that satisfy the regulations of one country are deemed to satisfy those of other countries as well. But trying to negotiate these issues comprehensively has proved extremely controversial in the TTIP context, and is unlikely to have greater success in UK trade negotiations. Instead, the agreements should merely refer to the possibility of future discussions on specific products and services, and leave this issue for a later date.



By keeping trade negotiations simple and focused in the ways described above, the UK can push quickly for significant trade liberalization, without the process getting bogged down, either during the negotiations or subsequently with the domestic ratification.



One final area where the UK has an opportunity to be bold is trade remedies, which covers antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. Ideally, the UK would use these measures in a very limited manner, or even not at all, as part of its domestic trade regime. But practically speaking, these trade measures are a core part of today’s trade policy world, and it is unlikely the UK will abandon them.



However, what is possible is that, for its trade relations with close trading partners, the UK might consider a mutual decision not to apply trade remedies. There is precedent for this in various free trade agreements, such as the Australia‐​New Zealand Closer Economic Relations agreement, in which Australia and New Zealand agreed not to apply antidumping duties against each other.6 Anti‐​dumping laws are a particular problem in trade relations, and have been criticized for their lack of economic justification.7 The negotiation of new UK trade agreements provides an opportunity for reform, as allegations of “dumping” often focus on competition with cheap labor in developing countries. With trading partners who are at similar development levels, it may be possible to escape the usual arguments about fear of low‐​priced products.



With regard to the potential trading partners mentioned above, the United States is the least likely to agree to such a proposal. However, as noted, Australia and New Zealand have already agreed to this between themselves. And Japan was traditionally only a limited user of trade remedies (although it has increased its use in recent years). Thus, there is a chance that if the UK proposed the elimination of one or more trade remedies, some of these countries might agree.



The UK faces some difficult tasks in terms of formulating a new trade policy. First of all, it needs to hire trade negotiators. While there are some UK government officials who have expertise in this area, this type of work has been largely farmed out to European officials for decades. The UK needs to start from scratch to a great extent, which could slow down its progress.



But it will put a team in place eventually, and that team will be faced with many difficult choices. In this short paper, I have tried to kick off the debate by suggesting some general ideas for how the UK might approach the negotiation of trade treaties in a manner that draws on its tradition of free trade. In the coming months and years, after the UK sorts out its trade relationship with the EU and takes back competence over trade policy,8 the specific details will continue to be fleshed out.

Tracey Martin has decided to challenge the views of her leader, **Winston Peters** , and **[Shane Jones](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/shane-jones-wallops-eco-bible-bashing-climate-change-wombles/)** over the newly announced child [brain-washing curriculum.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/)



New Zealand First MP **Tracey Martin** is defending the controversial climate change teaching resource despite her colleagues speaking out against it for telling students to eat less meat.



Martin, Associate Education Minister, posted a video to her Facebook page explaining how eating less meat was a reality for her growing up because her family couldn’t always afford it.



“I’m really not sure what the drama is… I’m really not sure when for many New Zealanders part of having days where you don’t eat meat is a reality because they can’t afford the meat.”



The teaching resource, almost [ _sic_ ] about two weeks ago by Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Climate Change Minister **James Shaw** , tells students how they can help to reduce emissions by eating “less meat and dairy”.



The advice sparked an angry response from Martin’s New Zealand First colleagues Winston Peters and Shane Jones – both Cabinet ministers – and Mark Patterson, the party’s spokesperson for agriculture.



“I don’t want the politically correct brigade colonising my dietary habits – it will never, ever happen […] Schools have absolutely no authority to stigmatise and demonise us meat-eaters,” [Jones told Newshub last week](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/nz-first-s-shane-jones-mark-patterson-blast-eat-less-meat-advice-in-climate-teaching-resource.html). 



Peters, the Deputy Prime Minister, [supported Jones](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/winston-peters-backs-shane-jones-pro-meat-stance-in-row-over-climate-teaching-resource.html) and suggested to Magic Talk that the prospect of eating less meat could damage the country’s agriculture industry and lead to job losses. 



“Exports give people jobs in this country and you’ve got this group of elitists challenging the very existence of these jobs by their extremist, absolutist statements.”



I can’t work out if Tracey Martin trolling Jonesy and Winston or just totally effin’ stupid. Perhaps readers can assist?



My money is on totally effin’ stupid. Then again, sources inside NZ First say that it is Tracey’s way of signalling that she is retiring.

Yesterday, I resumed some temperature analysis I had been doing and found an amazing improvement in the GISS website for station data.
Instead of the tiny map with no station locations marked on it, I found a nice rotatable and zoomable globe with dots marking the station locations. There is also now a time window selector, making it much easier to find long and/or recent temperature records.

 Figure 1: Screen grab of the station data selector screen on the GISS website here.
In this screen, there is also a selector for the data set. The selections are: GHCN V3 unadjusted, GHCN V3 adjusted, GHCN V3 adjusted and cleaned, and GHCN V3 adjusted, cleaned, and homogenized.


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




When a station is selected, these selections will be the downloaded data. But, all these are visible, and highlightable, on the graph for each station. When you hover the cursor over a station dot, the station name, the station number, the latitude and longitude, the station altitude, and the record beginning and end dates.
Here is a typical graph, this one for Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.

Figure 2: Temperature chart for Churchill. As you hover the cursor over the legend, the corresponding data is highlighted.
At the bottom of this page are the links to the images and data. These have also been improved with more selections.
These improvements have made it much easier to explore the temperature data available and the homogenization adjustments that have been applied. Keep in mind that these data, even the unadjusted data, have been somewhat manipulated by GHCN and NCDC.

Scientific claims are only worth the data they’re based on. In turn, that data is only as good as the methodology by which it’s collected. Among other things, experimenters should absolutely rigorously compare apples with apples. Measuring two different things, however similar they might be, and pretending that they’re the same is not good science. Using such flawed data to construct a strong claim – especially a startling or catastrophic claim – is junk science.



Once again, we are seeing that a key claim of climate change alarmism – the alleged “death” of the Great Barrier Reef – is based on flawed methodology, and may well turn out to be junk science.



Rebel marine scientist Peter Ridd has thrown down a challenge to reef scientists to test whether or not human actions have caused a collapse in the growth rate of coral­s on the Great Barrier Reef.



Dr Ridd said despite published claims of a collapse in coral growth rates between 1990 and 2005 due to stress from human pollution, there was no data for the past 15 years. “We don’t know how the Great Barrier Reef has fared since 2005,” he said.



If the Reef really was under such threat, then surely it would be continuously monitored?



He has proposed a new program­ of drill core sampling to bring the record up to date and test whether assumptions about a collapse in growth rates because of warmer temperatures can be believed­. Like tree trunks, drill cores from old corals can reveal growth rings that show age and growth rates. Writing in The Australian on Thursday, Dr Ridd says a properly supervised program would be an “acid test of the trustworthiness of our major science institutions”.



When similar problems emerged with the proxy measurements (such as bristlecone pines) used to support claims of global warming, the alarmists simply refused to go back and re-do the measurements. “Too hard,” they whined.



Sure: when you’re proposing unprecedented, trillion-dollar social and economic upheavals, trudging a few kilometres carrying a piece of boring equipment really is just **too** hard.



Far easier to stick with the alarmist narrative, and not risk inconvenient facts getting in the way.



The foundation of claims about a dramatic decline in reef growth is contained in a 2009 paper by Glenn De’ath from the Australian Institute of Marine Science that is still widely quoted.



The Great Barrier Reef Outlook­ Report 2019 cites the De’ath report in claims that reef calcification declined by 14 per cent between 1990 and 2005…



Dr Ridd challenged the research­, claiming a change in methodology had resulted in the apparent drop in coral growth rates from 1990.



The authors accepted criti­cisms that there had been incorrect measurement of near-surface coral growth rings on most of the corals that were giving data from 1990 to 2005 and printed a correction to the paper. However, AIMS rejected criticisms by Dr Ridd that much smaller and young­er corals had been sampled for the 1990-2005 data compared with the mostly very large and old corals­ of the pre-1990 data.



This all highlights some common, and growing, problems with modern science. First, the “reproducibility crisis”: in recent years, it has become more and more obvious that many scientific studies are impossible to reproduce. They’re scientifically worthless, in other words. This is modern science’s shameful secret, and why, when a headline claims that “science says…”, you should immediately assume that it **doesn’t** , until otherwise proven.



Secondly, the deplorable media-tarting of many scientists. Outlandish claims are rushed to print in the mass media, often ahead of publication in the scientific literature (this is, in fact, a key characteristic of pseudo-science). Quite often, the same studies are either rejected by scientific publishers (for instance, Gergis, et al, 2012) or later withdrawn (Resplandy, et al, 2018). Yet, these facts are **never** reported in the mass media, certainly not with the same shrieking headlines with which their alarmist (and, as it turned out, utterly false) claims were originally trumpeted.



The “IFL Science” crowd won’t admit it, but we are smack in the middle of a full-blown crisis in modern science. Rigorous scientific practise is being trashed by activist, junk science. As we see, too, climate science is frequently among the worst offenders.

"BEIJING  —   Xu Zhengming was lugging a     television through the Beijing West Railway Station on his way home for China’s Lunar New Year. Another passenger was hauling a tub of meat. And many migrant workers returning to their home villages carried bundles of clothes and gifts for children they see maybe once a year. They all said that they could not go home   for China’s biggest holiday. Even if that meant carting a television for two days across 1, 000 miles. “I get to go back just once a year. It’s a long way,” Mr. Xu said as he heaved the television, bundled in protective clothing, through the railway station. He was headed to a village outside Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, a journey he estimated would take about 20 hours. “My father is in the countryside, and the family is hard up,” said Mr. Xu, a   construction laborer in Beijing, the Chinese capital. “He always wanted a   television, so I’m taking mine home to give him. ” He and most other passengers at this cavernous, thrumming station were among hundreds of millions of Chinese on the move for the Lunar New Year. Many wore red hats or scarves, the color of good luck. While the total number of holiday travelers is hard to pin down, this is the world’s largest annual migration. Zhang Kemin, a restaurant worker dragging a plastic tub holding about 18 pounds of beef and lamb, said he was taking the meat home to Hebei Province, adjacent to Beijing, to make boiled dumplings filled with a mix of meat and vegetables, an essential part of the holiday food in northern China. “There’s pork at home,” he explained. In the days before the holiday, big cities, like Beijing, and the coastal industrial regions exhale tens of millions of workers who head back to their hometowns and villages by train, plane, bus, car and motorbike for this family holiday of marathon eating, fireworks and paying respects to relatives. This year, the festivities start on Friday evening, when the country says goodbye to the Year of the Monkey and welcomes the Year of the Rooster. On Thursday, the Beijing West Railway Station hummed like a giant boot camp, with the police, paramilitary troops and station staff members hustling passengers into waiting rooms to be corralled onto trains. Workers at the station said the holiday rush was more orderly than a decade ago, when heaving crowds threatened to overwhelm stations. “It used to be crazy, but it’s a lot better now,” said Yang Guibao, a bald    cleaner at the station. “They add many more trains for the Spring Festival, and the passengers don’t have to be so packed,” he said, using another name for the Lunar New Year. With a wag of his finger, he warned, “There are still pickpockets around, but there are also plainclothes cops. ” China’s trains have become more numerous and faster than even a few years ago. More people go by car or plane, and they are not as bent on all going home at the same time. Some visit at quieter times of the year. China’s expanding   rail network now covers about 12, 500 miles of track. The railway administration has cracked down on ticket scalpers, and it has become common to order tickets online or from vending machines. So while the holiday migration is still daunting, it’s not as crazy as before. “Before it took a day on a train, but now it takes three and a half hours,” said Zhang Guiping, a    businesswoman waiting for a train to Fuping, a county in Hebei Province. She said she had been in Beijing petitioning the government over a land dispute. Despite her feud with officialdom, she said she was happy with the better trains. “There are more trains, the security checks take less time, and it’s easier to buy tickets,” she said. The Chinese transportation authorities have estimated that people will make close to three billion journeys over this Lunar New Year travel period, including 356 million trips by train. But those numbers can sound misleadingly large. Many people take multiple journeys  —   by train and bus  —   to get home and then return to work, so the actual number of bodies on the move is lower than those numbers may suggest. That does not mean that the holiday rush is a tranquil experience. The Beijing West Railway Station, in particular, is an unsightly monument to poor planning that opened in 1996, and its construction was blighted by corruption. Officials estimated that in the   holiday travel period that began in   the station would send off 11. 8 million passengers, 6 percent more than last year, Chinese state radio reported. People must steel themselves for big crowds, and then they scramble to jump on trains and find space for the gifts and treats that many take home. The official Lunar New Year break lasts a week, but the traditional festival ends after its 15th day. Many migrant workers from the countryside linger at home for precious time with children and parents, whom they rarely or never see the rest of the year. But Wang Tianchang, a    migrant laborer who had been sleeping on a sack of bedding in a train station waiting room, said he was not taking home any gifts for his children. His boss on a building site had not paid him $150 owed in wages. “Things are expensive here. I haven’t bought a thing,” he said. But he said, “It’s really important to go home for the Spring Festival. You can see your wife and kids. ”"

Earlier this week a 21-year-old university student from Queensland [took his own life.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/wilson-gavin-is-a-hero-but-just-hours-after-his-death-tolerant-progressives-still-arent-done-vilifying-him/)



Wilson Gavin was a young same-sex attracted man who didn’t fit the expected narrative. A pro-life and pro-family activist, Wilson was vocal in his defence of life, marriage and family. He was also a devout man of faith.



By all accounts, Wilson was a kind-hearted soul who spent a great deal of his time helping the less fortunate and trying to leave this place better than he found it.



His death came soon after he participated in a student protest against an instance of [“drag queen story time”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/rainbow-activists-bully-gay-man-to-suicide/) for children in a public library.



Footage and coverage of the protest was circulated online, and Wilson soon became the target of shocking vitriol. Sadly, trolling and hatred are commonplace on social media, especially in forums like Twitter.



I’ve received unsolicited hate mail and threats myself, particularly during 2017’s marriage debate. I’ve also been “doxxed” (that is, had my family’s home address shared online).



But my experiences pale in comparison with the size, speed and ferocity of the avalanche of hate Wilson suffered.



And let’s not forget: the target was a 21-year-old student.



What can we say about a society where people think it’s OK to bully a young person – indeed, anyone! – to the point of suicide?



At the very least, it’s sick. In certain quarters, it’s toxic.



Even after his death, the attacks on Wilson haven’t ceased. Some are even seeking to gain mileage out of it, implying that the death of a same-sex attracted man spells out the need for continued Rainbow activism and for “anti-bullying” programs such as “Safe Schools”.



I don’t believe I ever met Wilson, although he interacted with AFC on Facebook on numerous occasions.



I’m sorry I will never have the chance now. He sounded upbeat, dedicated and amiable – someone unafraid to speak up for the things he cared about. What a tragedy that his life ended so early.



And how sad that many people will be too scared to share their views in future for fear of reprisals.



And that’s a point I’d like to reflect on.



Many people are afraid to share their views.



People feel the need to hide or water down their beliefs for all sorts of reasons: professional security, harmony with family and friends, or simply not wanting to be pigeonholed as a “bigot”, a “hater”, etc.



That’s why we need to do more to support and look out for each other.



Not so long ago, the idea of drag queens reading books to children in libraries would have been unthinkable. Now, we have to defend our position.



Let that sink in for a minute. It’s crazy, but it’s true.



In such a climate, it’s incumbent upon us to lift each other up – to assure each other that it’s OK to believe in radical ideas like family, faith and freedom.



Maybe you might even make a point of reaching out to someone after reading this email?



If you would like to read more about Wilson Gavin, you might be interested in [this article](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/friends-remember-hero-student-found-dead-after-protest-against-drag-queen-event-for-kids).



And this [heartfelt statement](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/a-message-from-wilson-gavin-s-family-20200116-p53s13.html) has been issued by his family.



I’m at a loss for words in trying to summarise this incredibly sad story. 



I can only hope that some good comes from it.

The justification being circulated by the COL for plunging NZ into debt is that borrowing money has never been cheaper. But less than two years ago Labour and Goff discovered a far cheaper method of raising capital, a 12.5% regional fuel tax. No borrowing, no interest, and no conscience. The first year of embezzlement raised $150 million. The presumption was that it would help fund the fast rail project to the airport but it hasn’t, and to this day fast rail remains a figment of Twyford’s and Goff’s imaginations. The point is, why is this tax still being applied?



Would you believe, now that it is an election year, suddenly Auckland is awash with borrowed Government money. With so much borrowed money being splashed around, surely the need for the regional fuel tax has become redundant; after all, “money has never been cheaper” – unless you steal it of course. Delusion is Ardern’s strong suit.



 **Delusion 1:** “A once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in New Zealand – modernising our infrastructure, preparing for climate change and helping grow the economy”. Once in a lifetime? Guess what this is called Jacinda: “housekeeping”. Every administration since 1856 has been modernising our infrastructure and helping to grow our economy. However you are the first administration that has insanely borrowed money in preparation for climate change.



 **Delusion 2** : Do you remember your speech regarding KiwiBuild at the 2018 Labour Party conference? It was only thirteen months ago.



“It was a huge day. I was standing near the front of one of the families’ new homes when I overheard Phil Twyford say to one of the people gathered at the street party “this is one of the most important days of my political life”. You continued “And I can see why. KiwiBuild is an example of the government seeing a problem, and FIXING IT?”



Seven months later Twyford was sacked from his KiwiBuild portfolio. That must have been the second most important day of his political life. Delusional to the end.



 **Delusion 3** : And this gem from your same speech:



“And yet we all know that some of our critics gloomily forewarned that Labour in government wouldn’t be able to balance the books. But Grant has proved the naysayers wrong. He has kept a firm grip on the country’s finances and he is focused on running surpluses which is a vital part of our plan. **A surplus is a safety net** ”.



  
Not in an election year apparently! Three years ago Labour’s election promises were calculated to contain an 11 billion dollar fiscal hole. The amount borrowed was $10 billion. Who told the truth? Delusional to the end.



 **Delusion 4:** If you are prepared to spread this manure to the Party faithful, how can the electorate rely on you to run an honest and factual campaign? They don’t and you won’t of course.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Wikileaks has published a disturbing claim, that the US NSA have been monitoring Japanese government internal deliberations on Climate Change.
According to Wikileaks;
Target Tokyo
PRESS RELEASE
Today, Friday 31 July 2015, 9am CEST, WikiLeaks publishes “Target Tokyo”, 35 Top Secret NSA targets in Japan including the Japanese cabinet and Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi, together with intercepts relating to US-Japan relations, trade negotiations and sensitive climate change strategy.
The list indicates that NSA spying on Japanese conglomerates, government officials, ministries and senior advisers extends back at least as far as the first administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which lasted from September 2006 until September 2007. The telephone interception target list includes the switchboard for the Japanese Cabinet Office; the executive secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga; a line described as “Government VIP Line”; numerous officials within the Japanese Central Bank, including Governor Haruhiko Kuroda; the home phone number of at least one Central Bank official; numerous numbers within the Japanese Finance Ministry; the Japanese Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa; the Natural Gas Division of Mitsubishi; and the Petroleum Division of Mitsui.
Today’s publication also contains NSA reports from intercepts of senior Japanese government officials. Four of the reports are classified TOP SECRET. One of the reports is marked “REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL”, meaning it has been formally authorised to be released to the United States’ “Five Eyes” intelligence partners: Australia, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand.
The reports demonstrate the depth of US surveillance of the Japanese government, indicating that intelligence was gathered and processed from numerous Japanese government ministries and offices. The documents demonstrate intimate knowledge of internal Japanese deliberations on such issues as: agricultural imports and trade disputes; negotiating positions in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization; Japanese technical development plans, climate change policy, nuclear and energy policy and carbon emissions schemes; correspondence with international bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA); strategy planning and draft talking points memoranda concerning the management of diplomatic relations with the United States and the European Union; and the content of a confidential Prime Ministerial briefing that took place at Shinzo Abe’s official residence.
Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief, said: “In these documents we see the Japanese government worrying in private about how much or how little to tell the United States, in order to prevent undermining of its climate change proposal or its diplomatic relationship. And yet we now know that the United States heard everything and read everything, and was passing around the deliberations of Japanese leadership to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. The lesson for Japan is this: do not expect a global surveillance superpower to act with honour or respect. There is only one rule: there are no rules.”
WikiLeaks Investigations Editor Sarah Harrison said: “Today’s publication shows us that the US government targeted sensitive Japanese industry and climate change policy. Would the effectiveness of Japan’s industry and climate change proposals be different today if its communications had been protected?”
Japan has been a close historical ally of the United States since the end of World War II. During a recent Presidential visit to Japan, US President Barack Obama described the East Asian country as “one of America’s closest allies in the world”. Today’s publication adds to previous WikiLeaks publications showing systematic mass spying conducted by US intelligence against the US-allied governments of Brazil “Bugging Brazil“, France “Espionnage Élysée” and Germany “The Euro Intercepts”; “All the Chancellor’s Men”.

A word of caution – in my opinion Wikileaks is not an entirely credible source. WUWT has documented at least one occasion where Mr. Assange bent the truth.
However, if the Wikileaks claim is true, it paints a disturbing picture of a US administration utterly obsessed with climate change, to the point that US covert assets are apparently being diverted from trying to catch terrorists, so the President has detailed inside information about what Japan thinks about Climate Change.
The Wikileaks press release also suggests Japan is less than enthusiastic about CO2 reductions. But given China, one of Japan’s main economic rivals, has been given a free pass to emit CO2 and grow their economy until 2030, Japan’s lack of enthusiasm for CO2 cutbacks should not be a surprise – though the Japanese also appear to be worried about offending the USA.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore “consensus” science: Antarctica not influenced by AGW
By Kenneth Richard
In recent years, the headlines of common news sources have austerely warned that West Antarctica is melting rapidly:

“‘Nothing can stop retreat’ of West Antarctic glaciers” — BBC
“The melting of Antarctica was already really bad. It just got worse.”   — Washington Post
“West Antarctic glacier loss: We have passed the point of no return“ — Christian Science Monitor
“Antarctic ice melting so fast the whole continent may be at risk“ — The Guardian

Then, last November (2015) a NASA study (Zwally et al., 2015*) was released indicating that the growth in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) has been exceeding the losses since the early 1990s, and that the net mass gains from the AIS were negatively contributing to sea level.  This, of course, did not affirm the alarmist headlines.
RealClimate, an AGW blog co-founded by Gavin Schmidt and Michael Mann, necessarily cobbled together a response to the inconvenient study.  After all, a growing polar ice sheet in response to anthropogenic global warming did not advance the cause.
The result was an essay written by Jonathon Bamber – “So what is really happening in Antarctica?”** – which essentially characterized the Zwally et al. (2015) conclusion as a peculiar outlier. Most other papers on Antarctic ice sheet mass balance indicate that the AIS is losing about -50 to -100 Gt/year on average (which is the equivalent of about one inch per century of sea level rise contribution).
These studies were characterized as more likely to be accurate than the NASA-sponsored paper that found a net AIS gain of about +100 Gt/year.  In other words, “consensus” logic (the more people agree, the more likely they are to be right) was employed to “refute” the NASA study. This graph (below) from the RealClimate essay was featured as a visual representation of just how “out-there” the Zwally et al. (2015) paper was compared to the “consensus” conclusions of other scientists:

Image: RealClimate.org.
Sometimes, though, a thorough reading of entries on AGW blogs like RealClimate can prove enlightening. Buried in the comment section of this same essay — comment number 26 to be specific — was an admittance by Dr. Eric Steig (moderator of comments) that the evidence that the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) responds to anthropogenic global warming, is “weak.” Not only that, he acknowledged that about half of scientists agree with him on this.
Dr. Eric Steig’s Comment 26:
I think the evidence that the current retreat of Antarctic glaciers is owing to anthropogenic global warming is weak. The literature is mixed on this, about 50% of experts agree with me on this.”
The admission that Antarctica may not respond to CO2 emissions, or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in general, has been affirmed several more times in other recent scientific analyses.  The most recent example is a peer-reviewed paper by Smith and Polvani (2016) published online just last week. These scientists set out to determine if anthropogenic forcing can explain why West Antarctica has warmed substantially in the last few decades, or why East Antarctica has not warmed substantially during the same period.
After analyzing the factors involved for the warming of West Antarctica and the peninsula, Smith and Polvani concluded that an anthropogenic signal is “completely absent” when “natural climate variability” is included. In other words, “natural climate variability” is the driving force behind the West Antarctica and peninsula warming, and “there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends.”
Below are the key points from the paper Smith and Polvani, 2016:
The recent annually averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of West Antarctica, stands in stark contrast to very small trends over East Antarctica. This asymmetry arises primarily from a highly significant warming of West Antarctica in austral spring and a cooling of East Antarctica in austral autumn. Here we examine whether this East–West asymmetry is a response to anthropogenic climate forcings or a manifestation of natural climate variability. We compare the observed Antarctic surface air temperature trends over two distinct time periods (1960–2005 and 1979–2005), and with those simulated by 40 models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We find that the observed East–West asymmetry differs substantially between the two periods and, furthermore, that it is completely absent from the forced response seen in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, from which all natural variability is eliminated by the averaging. We also examine the relationship between the Southern Annular mode (SAM) and Antarctic temperature trends, in both models and reanalyses, and again conclude that there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends. These results offer new, compelling evidence pointing to natural climate variability as a key contributor to the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the Peninsula.

Here is a further sampling of some (6) other recently-published papers indicating that an anthropogenic forcing (warming) signal may not be detectable for Antarctica, or that natural variability dominates in that region:

1. Le et al., 2016
Our analysis suggests that internal climate variability played a more significant role than external forcings in short-term SAT variability in the regions of the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic Peninsula, and its surrounding oceans.
2. Garfinkel et al., 2015
Correct representation of the SSTs changes is important for the Northern Hemisphere, while correct representation of stratospheric ozone changes is important for the Southern Hemisphere. The ensemble-mean trend (which captures only the forced response) is nearly always much weaker than trends in reanalyses. This suggests that a large fraction of the recently observed changes [in sea surface temperatures, ozone] may, in fact, be a consequence of natural variability and not a response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcings.
3. Thomas et al., 2015
Introduction: It is expected that the observed recent atmospheric warming in this region [Bellingshausen-Amundsen coast region between the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica] will result in increased snow accumulation, although the stable water isotopes from Ellsworth Land ice cores have shown that the recent rise in temperature here is not unusual in the past 300 years [Thomas et al., 2013]. Therefore, it is unclear whether these recent glaciological changes are part of a longer term natural trend or associated with anthropogenic climate forcing.
4. Altnau et al., 2015
For East Antarctica, no general warming and increase in precipitation is found in surface observational data (Turner et al., 2005; Monaghan et al., 2006, 2008). This is important because an increase in precipitation, and hence increased surface mass balance (SMB), might mitigate sea level rise. … We conclude that, in the last 2 centuries, conditions in the interior DML [Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica] have been fairly stable and only weakly influenced by changes in atmospheric dynamics.”
5. Raphael et al., 2016
The Amundsen Sea low (ASL) is a climatological low pressure center that exerts considerable influence on the climate of West Antarctica. Its potential to explain important recent changes in Antarctic climate, for example, in temperature and sea ice extent, means that it has become the focus of an increasing number of studies. … The ASL has deepened in recent decades, affecting the climate through its influence on the regional meridional wind field, which controls the advection of moisture and heat into the continent. Deepening of the ASL in spring is consistent with observed West Antarctic warming and greater sea ice extent in the Ross Sea.”
6. Schmithüsen et al., 2015
For this region [central Antarctica], the emission to space is higher than the surface emission; and the greenhouse effect of CO2 is around zero or even negative, which has not been discussed so far. We investigated this in detail and show that for central Antarctica an increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increased long-wave energy loss to space, which cools the Earth-atmosphere system. … For most of the Antarctic Plateau, GHE-TES [greenhouse effect as measured by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer] is close to zero or even slightly negative; i.e., the presence of CO2 increases radiative cooling.
Yet, let’s assume the alarmist headlines are actually true and that indeed Antarctica has been melting rapidly, or has eclipsed the “point of no return.” If the burgeoning scientific “consensus” is that Antarctica is likely not responding to anthropogenic or CO2 forcing,  or that warming trends (for West Antartica and the peninsula) are predominantly a consequence of natural variability, the alarmist headlines forecasting an Antarctic ice melt catastrophe effectively lose their impact.
Apparently the scientifically “weak” evidence that the Antarctic climate is significantly affected by anthropogenic forcing doesn’t make a good headline.

Yesterday’s DC Court of Appeals ruling throwing out an omnibus petition against EPA’s first tranche of carbon dioxide restrictions rested largely on the Court’s decision that EPA’s “Endangerment Finding” from related global warming stands as is. In particular, it noted that the petitioners’ argument that “uncertainty” about climate change was not sufficient grounds to void the Finding.   
  
  
Indeed, “uncertainty” is thin ice if EPA is in the business of saving us from almost‐​certain doom. A better argument would have been a direct assault on the Finding’s science, or rather, selective science.   
  
  
But this is beyond the capabilities of most litigators, who simply aren’t trained to wade through the enormous technical literature on global warming and its effects. That’s about to change.   
  
  
The next battle with EPA is likely to come over their proposed regulation that would essentially outlaw coal‐​fired electrical generation. Here at Cato, we are preparing the definitive answer to its Endangerment Finding.   
  
  
With regard to climate change impacts in the U.S., the Finding relies primarily on one document, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States. It was produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a mélange of agencies all dependent upon climate change dollars. This document is about as inclusive as one would expect it to be—i.e. it avoids a massive amount of inconvenient science. You can find it here.   
  
  
Since April, 2011, along with several colleagues around the country, I have been working on the scientific counter to the USGCRP document. It looks like it, section by section. It flows exactly like it. It has more references and notes—almost twice as many—as the USGCRP document. As in the adage, “you can take it to court.”   
  
  
While it’s not yet in final copy, the latest draft is sufficient to give you the idea: this is the document to take down the Endangerment Finding. You can download it here.   
  
  
We expect this document is going to figure heavily in the next round in the fight to prevent EPA from imposing scientifically senseless but economically disastrous restrictions on energy use.

Tribal National supporters are ecstatic that **Simon Bridges** has declared that [he won’t have a path to victory.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/simon-bridges-announces-he-has-no-path-to-victory/) Their disconnect from the reality of the situation is astonishing. Let’s look at the claims.



 **Winston can’t be trusted because he sued National two days before the last election.**



This one is astonishing. National supporters ignore that National was donkey deep in spreading rumours of a pending issue for Winston Peters over superannuation. **Anne Tolley** was briefed and then stupidly asked her ministry for more information under a misapprehension that it was covered by no surprises. She discussed the matter with at least 10 people, amongst them her own sister, her husband and her staff. She admitted to that in court. National operatives were spreading rumours around the press gallery and on social media before the news broke. One was a staffer in **Paula Bennett** ‘s office, someone well known for leaking, and who has coincidentally recently resigned. So for National to talk about a lack of trust is astonishing in its hypocrisy.



 **Winston doesn’t honour his promises.**



No politician, perhaps with the exception of **Donald Trump** , honours their promises. This is a consequence of MMP. John Key never honoured his promises. He raised GST, added new taxes and generally rode roughshod over core National party principles. We have had two chances to get rid of MMP and both failed, the last because **John Key** rigged the referendum so the vote was split. He genuinely thought he could govern forever under MMP and when he discovered he couldn’t he bolted for cushy jobs outside of parliament.



 **This decision will send unhappy NZ First voters to National.**



Really? Then how come National is behind in every poll except 1News? If this is the case then why hasn’t NZ First’s vote approached zero in recent polls? The numbers don’t lie and the maths doesn’t work in National’s favour. Every scenario that shows them winning needs heroic assumptions to make it work. The two big parties usually slide in the final weeks and smaller parties grow in support. That is likely to still be the case. Deny the maths all you like but on the latest numbers out of UMR, **Simon Bridges** plan doesn’t work. Labour 41, National 39, Greens 7, NZ First 7, Act 2. That seven percent from Winston isn’t going to go magically to National. Those people will still vote for him, they certainly won’t vote for someone who has dissed their leader like Bridges has. Do the math, there aren’t enough votes to get Bridges to the prime minister’s chair.



 **NZ First slid from 12.5% to 7% at the last election, this election will see them slide further.**



Yes, they did. However, in past elections, the smaller parties’ vote increased at the expense of the larger parties. The last election was an aberration for two main reasons. NZ First’s slide coincided with two things. The first being the National dirty tricks over Winston’s superannuation and secondly a surge from Labour after ditching the poorly-performing Andrew Little for **Jacinda Ardern**. 



Those supporting NZ First that saw them climb to 12.5% **weren’t National voters** , they were Labour voters, and they went home. National didn’t grab ANY of that slide, yet somehow they think they will now. National’s vote hasn’t increased in the intervening two years, its slowly ebbing away, not growing. One per cent has gone to ACT, but that doesn’t help National. Some, the soft middle, are pretty happy with Labour, and National has now declared that they don’t want friends. Simon Bridges is expecting us all to believe that from his own personal rating of **5%** he can best Jacinda Ardern and Labour with only ACT helping, something that John Key, despite his more than **50%** personal rating, never achieved.



 **Every time NZ First has been in coalition with someone it ends in tears.**



True, but with a qualifier. Every time NZ First went into a coalition in the past it was with a third term government. There hasn’t been any government with more than three terms since **[Sir Keith Holyoake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Holyoake)** , a gap of more than 48 years. The Bolger/Shipley government was three terms, the last with NZ First. The Clark government was three terms, the last with NZ First. The Key/English government was three terms and ended, I suppose because of Winston Peters too, ironically, but not because of a coalition. This time it is different: this is a first-term government, not a third term one.



 **Winston Peters was always going to go with Labour anyway.**



Are people forgetting that his first coalition was with National? Are people not considering that Winston Peters would on the balance of probabilities have had a greater chance of going with National this time around to keep the king-maker narrative alive. Bridges has taken that off the table now, so now it becomes a truism that he will go with Labour. But it is also true that Winston’s narrative will now be that National can’t win any more and so only a strong NZ First can keep the Greens out or in check, along with softening the more socialist extremes of Labour.



 **Ruling out Winston Peters makes me more likely to vote National**



Why? National is a less socialist party than Labour. So far we have seen National agree with Labour on almost everything, especially climate change. On almost every policy issue so far this term National has been found wanting. Simon Bridges just seems to have become **Little Sir Echo** , saying “me too” to everything. The mantra seems to be that National aren’t quite as shit as the other lot, plus we don’t like Winston Peters. That is hardly a groundswell to change the government or to vote National. 



People vote for things like health, security, jobs and the economy. They don’t choose a party because of who they may or may not form a coalition with. Apart from aggrieved gun owners, who have been dumped on by every party in parliament except for ACT, there is no groundswell of anger at this government.



 **I’m not supporting NZ First because they brought in the gun law changes**



Yes, and so did every other party in parliament except ACT. With the proposed second tranche of gun laws, supporting ACT can’t and won’t do anything to get those amended in any meaningful way. **There is only one party who can seriously affect those changes right now.** NZ First has seen the shift in polling, only a fool would ignore that, and Winston Peters is no fool. He’s not going to let ACT get any more support from gun owners and the best way he can stop that is by substantially altering the proposed laws to something far more sensible. ACT has one vote, and maybe after the election 2 or three votes, but the legislation is before the house now, not after the election, so blindly supporting ACT won’t change a thing right now.



 **I cannot stand the way our MMP system works – it is totally flawed how it allows horse-trading after the vote.**



That’s not going to change. To expect that it will is folly. We have had 24 years of MMP and will have many more. Whining that you don’t like the rules is like a cricketer whining about being [‘Mankadded’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinoo_Mankad). It’s within the rules but people get their knickers in a bunch as it’s supposed not to happen in the spirit of the game. The rule has never been changed since Mankad famously used it in 1948 against Australia. Same goes for MMP…get over it, that’s our system, time you got used to it.



 **Bridges has made a principled stand, he should be commended.**



What tosh. If he has, it’s the first principled stand he’s ever made. However, that is beside the point. What he has chosen is to remain in opposition. So much for “saving” the nation from Labour. Given a choice between swallowing one’s pride and removing Labour from government, he’d rather be pious and sanctimonious and let Labour win. That’s like the Democrats rushing to impeach Trump before Christmas because he shouldn’t be president for a second longer, then holding onto the articles of impeachment for over a month.



 **New Zealand can’t survive another term of Labour**



Another trite bucket of cow dung. We’ve survived Labour before, we will do it again. We even survived nine years of Muldoon, then six years of Labour then nine of Bolger and nine of Clark. I think we can survive another three years of Labour. We will have to anyway because that’s what Simon Bridges would rather do than do a deal with someone he doesn’t like. He’s made the choice to give Labour another three years.



 **I don’t really have any hard facts to support the fact that Winston is terrible, let’s call him a traitor, treasonous, corrupt and duplicitous anyway because that will make me feel better.**



Yeah, that has always worked well. **MMP was designed to foster cooperation.** National seems to think that demonisation of personalities is the way forward. That is the politics of poison and it poisons your own party. **Parties need to learn to work with other parties not talk past them.** Brazen partisan politics is unbecoming and almost always destructive. It is also puerile and negative. You don’t win office by having hordes of puerile partisans mouthing off on Twitter. You win by looking like you can be trusted.



Simon Bridges emailed supporters and said this:



This Labour/Green/NZ First Government has failed to deliver for New Zealanders. The cost of living has gone up, taxes have been piled on, there’s been no new infrastructure, and crime has risen making your family less safe. New Zealanders have been let down and we can’t afford another three years of this incompetence.



If that is true why is National behind Labour in the polls, not 20% in front and why are Bridges’ net favourables **60% behind** those of Jacinda Ardern?



If you can answer those two questions then you may be some way to finding the path to victory for National. You should give Simon Bridges a call because he sure as hell can’t answer that.



I know readers don’t like hearing this, but where possible I have provided facts, history and proof. I welcome you to challenge me with your own facts, ones that don’t rely on heroic assumptions for your dreams to become reality. Try it as an exercise, refute me if you can. Research the polls, average them to gain a sensible data point, then try and work out precisely what path to victory exists for Simon Bridges. I ask you to do that for your own good, so you can see for yourself just how improbable it is to suggest that Simon Bridges can do that which eluded John Key.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
There are several notable pieces this week that relate to the social cost of carbon (SCC)—the government’s powerful tool to aid in justifying all manner of rules and regulations. The SCC is supposed to represent the negative externalities (i.e., projected economic damages in a projected society resulting from projected climate change) that are associated with the emissions of each ton of carbon dioxide. It was developed as a way to translate carbon dioxide emission reductions into dollars savings and to make the “benefits” of proposed climate actions hit closer to home for more people.   
  
But as you may guess from the number of “projected”s in the above parenthetical, the SCC is so highly malleable that you can pretty much game it to produce any value desired—the perfect characteristic for an all-purpose economic cost/benefit tool wielded by an opportunistic and activist government.   
  
The situation is well-described by American Enterprise Institute’s Benjamin Zycher in his recent post for _The Hill_ “The magic of the EPA's benefit/cost analysis.”   




Welcome to the fascinating world of EPA benefit/cost analysis… the administration conducted an ""analysis"" of the ""social cost of carbon"" (SCC), in order to generate an estimate of the marginal externality cost of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The problems with that analysis are legion, but the central ones are the use of global (rather than national) benefits to drive the benefit/cost comparison; the failure to apply a 7 percent discount rate to the streams of benefits and costs, despite clear direction from the Office of Management and Budget; and — most important — the use of ozone and particulate reductions as ""co-benefits"" of climate policies. The administration's estimate is about $36 per ton in 2015 ($31 per ton in 2010).   
  
And that is how a regulation yielding future changes in temperatures and sea levels approaching zero can be claimed to yield net benefits ""exceeding $100 billion, making this a highly beneficial rule."" In the EPA's benefit/cost framework, the actual effects of the policies literally are irrelevant; just compute the assumed reduction in GHG emissions, multiply by $36, and voila!



Zycher takes us through the absurdities of just how small the impact of Obama’s “climate” actions is on the actual climate and how the actions are enormously magnified they become when they are run through the social cost of carbon. He concludes:   




It is the delegation of legislative powers to the regulatory agencies that has allowed such game-playing in pursuit of an ideological agenda. The only means with which to restore political accountability to the regulatory process is a requirement that all regulations be approved by Congress.



You can check out his entire article, here.



  
  
If you wonder if the government’s SCC of $36/ton of carbon dioxide (as mentioned by Zycher) is scientifically robust: it isn’t.   
  
This embarrassment is shown by some new work from a team led by Heritage Foundation’s Kevin Dayaratna that also included Ross McKitrick and David Kreutzer. These researchers re-ran the models used by the Obama Administration to determine the social cost of carbon with the most recent estimate of the earth’s climate sensitivity (i.e., how much global warming we should expect to result from our carbon dioxide emissions). The estimate they used came from a paper published by Nic Lewis and Judy Curry last year, replacing the climate sensitivity used by the government which was based on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates from 2011.   
  
What did they find?   




The resulting Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates are much smaller than those from models based on simulated parameters. In the DICE model the average SCC falls by 30-50% depending on the discount rate, while in the FUND model the average SCC falls by over 80%. The span of estimates across discount rates also shrinks considerably, implying less sensitivity to this parameter choice… Moreover FUND, which takes more explicit account of potential regional benefits from CO2 fertilization and increased agricultural productivity, yields a substantial (about 40 percent or more) probability of a negative SCC through the first half of the 21st century.



Did you catch the end? The model that also includes positive externalities of carbon dioxide emissions (e.g., increased agricultural productivity) produces a decent probability that the social cost of carbon is negative for decades to come. In other words, instead of regulations trying to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, the government ought to be encouraging those emissions.   
  
Given the growing evidence for a low climate sensitivity (see here for our latest on this topic) along with the firmly established evidence that carbon dioxide is a plant fertilizer that increases crop yields (among other benefits), you’d think that science organizations would be pushing the federal government to revise their SCC estimates.   
  
Well, some are, like us. But others, with seemingly more clout (and much more government reliance) are pushing for the opposite.   
  
Take the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), for example. This week they released the results of their examination of ways that the government could improve their SCC determination. Judy Curry has the low down. Notably absent from the NAS’s myriad suggestions was using an updated estimate of the climate sensitivity. Curry writes. “I am gobsmacked that they think the current … values of [equilibrium climate sensitivity] are fine.”   
  
As for us, we are hardly surprised and had this to say in her comment section:   




Judy–why are you surprised about not re-examining the ECS distribution? NAS was created to advise the Federal government by Abraham Lincoln and it has not deviated from that mission. The members of this particular committee are pretty much all on the global warming dole, big time. Why would they behave counter to their interests, which would be to admit that the [climate sensitivity] distributions are wrong and that the most likely values are near the low end of the present (AR4) [IPCC] distribution? That would be the end of the dole and an admission that billions were wasted on a minor issue whose solution is best left to private investment rather than public taxation.



Sadly, we can’t foresee the government letting loose its grip on its all-too-powerful social cost of carbon tool so long as we have a ruling Administration that takes an activist’s role in climate change—despite overwhelming evidence that such a role in unjustified. But we’ll keep trying our best to wrest this abusive device from them.

Testimony before Congress was based on model hindcast, actual data ignored
Guest essay by Michael Wallace, Hydrologist
Members of the global science and lay communities have begun to learn of the confirmed omission of 80 years of instrumental data from contemporary ocean acidification (OA) scientific products. The missing ~2 million data points comprise a majority of the world’s historical ocean pH measurements.   The data was replaced without disclosure, by a model hind cast. The substituted history, known as the FEEL2899 report (1) was itself used as the technical basis for testimony to the US Congress (2). In turn, OA mitigation research funding was augmented, and the regulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was strengthened and deepened.
This occurrence of a model-replacing-data-without-disclosure has few publicized precedents of this scale. Already some in media have chosen to headline this as a case of “pHraud” (3). Whatever it is called, a fundamental question remains whether or not this omission will ever be corrected. Currently the major obstacle to rapid correction appears to be a consensus among those in power, that ocean pH cannot (and could never) be instrumentally measured using any conceivable means for any conceivable ocean purpose by any conceivable scientist. Therefore those in power effectively assert that the world must put aside expectations of data accessibility and transparency, and accept the PMEL authors’ formerly undisclosed SeaCarb model hindcast replacement as the entire truth of past ocean pH.
I came into awareness of the ocean pH data omission myself, purely through research activities, which led to personal communications with the authors of the omission (4). I learned through two of those authors some facts concerning the origins, pervasiveness, and structure of the omissions.
Originally I had simply hoped to find somewhere a complete basic ocean instrumental pH time series data set, in order to compare to other ocean and climate indices of interest to me.   Although it was a detour from my primary research, I found it necessary to begin to construct my own time series and geospatial products, based on the new information, obliquely brought to my attention by the PMEL authors towards the end of our communications, which I later downloaded.
I have continued to follow up through ongoing stochastic evaluations of the actual omitted instrumental data (5). I think this information largely speaks for itself and so I’ve adapted some of those evaluations for the attached figure. In addition I’ve traced some of the OA citation pathways in order to focus on the most likely reasons for the existing disconnects between the OA research community and the rest of the aqueous pH measuring communities.
One of the greatest disconnects relates to the question of instrumental measurement accuracy.   In my communications with the FEEL2899 authors from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), they asserted that instrumental ocean pH measurements prior to around 1988 were not sufficiently accurate (4).
Figure 1-a. includes a subset of the FEEL2899 pH time series product as the thick reddish curve. Some aspects of the NOAA World Ocean Database (WOD) (6) global ocean pelagic pH data (GOPpH) are plotted over the same time frame. These include the ten year moving average in blue, and a rounded version of that as open green circles. Please note that although there doesn’t appear to be a clear trend up or down, both of the WOD-based curves suggest an oscillatory behavior, over the period shown.

NOAA’s WOD pH data are typically published to two decimal places. This is presumably because of the 0.01 pH unit accuracy of the meters utilized. This accuracy is standard for many modern day glass electrode pH (GEpH) meters as well. In addition, the natural global ocean pH (GOpH) values for all depths can range over 4 full pH units.   That yields at least 400 unique possibilities along a continuous ocean pH curve, that can be accurately identified by any pH meter of its time.   Even a measurement taken with an accuracy of only one decimal place yields 40 possible points along that curve. Either accuracy should be more than adequate for initial and publishable GOpH and/or GOPpH trend analyses.
As a rough illustration, I have included the green open circles of Figure 1.a., which are simply the blue curve data rounded to the nearest 0.1 pH unit. The apparent oscillatory pattern of the more refined time series is preserved. This holds even though I’ve already severely restricted the pH range of that data set due to the 10 year averaging filter.
The real data continue to receive additional confirmatory support. For example, I have been profiling outside natural indexes which appear to correlate with the WOD GOPpH data set (5). These include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Otowi stream gage in the US Southwest.   I’ve included part b. of Figure 1 to summarize some of those findings here (7). As shown, my construction of the GOPpH time series shows a higher correlation to a premier continental stream gage (the Otowi gage of the Upper Rio Grande in the US Southwest) than correlations of that gage to the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and atmospheric CO2 (from Mauna Loa Observatory).
To me, this is interesting. I know that the correlation between GOPpH and the Otowi stream gage is not high enough to be useful by itself for forecasting purposes. Yet it would appear to be more justified than ENSO and/or CO2, even though those are the ‘go to’ drivers employed to justify contemporary assertions about hydrology in this region.
In any case, given such reproducible and stochastically interesting outcomes for GOPpH, why do OA researchers consistently maintain that GEpH meters are insufficiently accurate for any conceivable ocean hydroclimatologic use? Why do they also assert that only spectrophotometric (SP) based pH meters are up to the claimed accuracy challenge?
These assertions appear to be largely based upon invalid referencing (8,9) to the document known as “SCOR Working Group 75” (SCOR75) (10). The SCOR75 report contradicts those claims by clearly stating that “Under the best circumstances, the absolute value of pH is only known within 0.01 pH unit”.   Moreover, it appears that the validity of SP based pH measurements is only supported when those measurements are backed up by, of all things, GEpH meter readings. In fact, one of the FEEL2899 authors has contributed to a report where this GEpH specification is repeated many times (8).
Perhaps even these inconsistencies are overshadowed by another twist; why do SP based pH measurements also require the use of conventional pH indicator dyes? Unlike typical applications for SPs, the emission or absorption of the target ion species (hydronium in this context) is not directly measured. Rather, the SPs in this context appear to be nothing more than expensive, exotic, titration- fed colorimeters.
The non-OA community might benefit to know of this pernicious limitation that all ocean scientists are now constrained to.   Is it conceivable that if only for consistency, authorities soon will pressure the rest of us to abandon GEpH meters in favor of a technology that is no more accurate, yet exponentially more expensive and time consuming?
No doubt I have biases, but I believe that the scientific consensus will eventually condense around the omitted NOAA WOD GOpH data as the most practical and useful foundation for any credible and complete ocean pH time series analyses. It is amazingly rich and informative, and appears to align with many independent hydroclimatologic patterns and expectations.
The ocean pH data omission was an unprecedented and disturbing incident in the history of hydrological sciences. Only NOAA can likely correct this. That’s because NOAA contains the source of the problem (the FEEL2899 pH time series product) as well as its solution (the WOD database). To help resolve that paralyzing disorder, scientists and others may wish to consider signing a petition that I have authored at (11). It may seem overly prescriptive, but in some ways it merely asks that the ocean pH data omissions be corrected by NOAA, and that GOpH measurements follow the OA authorities’ own published guidelines.

"Manhattan Conference on Global Warming Indicates that “No Regrets” is the Best Policy.
The Carbon Sense Coalition based in Australia, says that the science and empirical evidence on Global warming is now clearly indicating that a “No Regrets” policy is the best course for the world to follow.
The Carbon Sense Coalition was one of the 52 organisations from 20 different countries which co-sponsored the recent International Conference on Climate Change in New York. Al Gore was invited to address the conference (he was even promised his $200,000 fee) but he declined to appear. Jim Hansen of NASA, another prominent alarmist, was also invited, but declined. (Contrast this with the Bali conference when a delegation of prominent sceptical scientists sought to present their petition to the UN. They were denied admission and refused an audience.)

The Chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, who attended the conference along with about 20 other Australian and New Zealand speakers and observers, said that with over 500 delegates attending over 100 sessions presented and discussed by scientists, economists, politicians and policy analysts (many of world standing) there was no aspect of global warming science and policy that was not examined in the light of current knowledge and evidence.
For more information on the conference see:
www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=22875 and www.americanthinker.com/2008/03/ny_climate_conference_journey.html
Forbes claimed that a number of clear conclusions arose from the conference:

There is no doubt that the earth is in a warming phase, and has been in this phase for some 300 years. Warming started after the frigid years of the Little Ice Age, and has continued, in waves, ever since.
There is no doubt that the short warm eras in earth’s history have proved very beneficial for life on earth as evidenced by the rising population, increased prosperity, increased life span, increased food production and the flourishing of art and architecture that has accompanied every one of the recent warm eras. Ice Ages, not Warm Ages, are the big threats to life on earth.
There is considerable uncertainty about the future trends in earth’s temperature. However, there is close correlation between past temperature trends and variations in solar output and planetary cycles, and these indicate that the current warming is likely to end, no matter what man does, maybe within decades. The cooling may have already started.
It is very clear that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, but close study of the correlations between CO2 and temperature shows that it is far more likely that temperature changes trigger changes in CO2 levels. Past records also show that current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are neither unusual nor concerning.
There are no credible claims or evidence from any quarter that current or projected levels of CO2 in the atmosphere pose any other threat to human, animal or plant life on earth. CO2 is not a contributor to air pollution; in fact it is a precious plant food on which all life on earth depends.
Man’s activities contribute less than 5% of total emissions into the atmosphere, and this addition has had only minor effect (probably undetectable) on the rising temperature trend.
There is good evidence that oceans, volcanoes and other natural sources expel large but variable quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. Oceans expel CO2 as they warm and absorb it as they cool.
It is agreed in all quarters that the computerised General Circulation Models utilised heavily by the IPCC to produce their warming alarms have no proven ability to forecast climate even one year in advance, let alone the 50 or more years that some people have quoted.
It is a fact that CO2 and the other atmospheric gases provide an insulating blanket to the earth, keeping surface temperature higher than it would otherwise be. However, science is agreed that CO2’s warming potential is almost exhausted, and even if current levels of CO2 doubled, it would not on its own cause alarming global warming. There is nothing to fear from CO2 induced warming.
The large positive warming feedbacks assumed by the IPCC are quite likely to be much smaller or even negative. Recent work is showing that the earth has a huge capacity to distribute and dissipate heat via winds, ocean currents, evaporation, precipitation and radiation to space. There is a large degree of self regulation in the natural global temperature controllers.

“In summary, man is not as important or as smart as some people believe he is. He is nowhere near to understanding the complex interactions between the big climate players – the sun, planetary cycles, atmospheric circulation, volcanoes and the dominating role of water in clouds, in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and in snow and ice. Moreover, his tiny contribution to an extremely minor atmospheric gas such as CO2 is highly unlikely to be the main driver of world climate.
“The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from the above observations is that man is unlikely to achieve any positive climate benefits from a very costly and disruptive policy of forcible decarbonisation of all human activities. The earth will largely ignore him.
“This indicates that the huge sums of money contributed by consumers, taxpayers and businesses to this futile war on carbon will be largely wasted, and future generations will have great regrets that their parents were so profligate with their inheritance.
Forbes claimed that the nations of the world should follow a “No Regrets Policy” which yields dividends no matter what the future climate holds.
“We should abandon all policies that assume either warming or cooling, because there is no clear evidence on what the future holds.
“We should be strengthening our ability to adapt our lifestyle and our economy to whatever climate the future holds for us. We can be certain that climate will change, perhaps dramatically, but no one is yet competent to predict it, and man is powerless to have significant effect on it.
“A “No Regrets” policy means exposing all people to the full cost of their actions, and allowing the climate and the market to deter silly practices and encourage sensible ones.
“Specifically, all governments should assist their communities to adapt to whatever changes are surely in store for us by ceasing to mandate market shares for any particular energy source, and abolishing all discriminatory energy taxes and subsidies and all limits, caps and taxes on harmless emissions of CO2. They should also abandon all plans to mandate the Emissions Trading Game – leave that to the gamblers who choose to play. It will be more fun than Monopoly with a similar outcome – a few big winners and all the rest losers.
“No one has the right to gamble the seed corn of the community on preparing for last year’s climate crisis. Governments are currently planning to spend huge and growing amounts of money on the very dubious assumption that global warming is a clear and present danger. This money would be far better spent on infrastructure to insulate us from future shortages of water, energy or food, procuring emergency equipment that can cope with ANY natural disaster, tackling real air or water pollution problems or designing policies that ensure that rising prices are left free to discourage the waste of scarce resources.
“Useful equipment and facilities and sound stable policies will serve us well in drought, flood, fire, tempest, tidal wave, global warming or global cooling.
This indeed would be a policy of “No Regrets”.
“Man believes he is a heavy hitter, confident in his ability to dominate and manipulate the climate. But he needs to remember, “Nature bats last”.

What do you think was the most costly intelligence failure of all time? No, it was not the world’s leading intelligence agencies’ failure to notice that Saddam had few, if any, weapons of mass destruction. It was the failure of many leading climate model builders to be modest enough about their predictions, and the politicians’ and media’s failure to ask the tough questions of these climate experts. 



As a consequence of what we now know was an overblown global‐​warming scare, everyone on the planet is paying substantially more for food and fuel than is necessary. 



Despite the prediction of all the major climate models, the Earth has been getting cooler since 1998. At first, it was not considered a big deal because temperatures fluctuate from year to year. However, the drop has now been going for a decade, with another big drop last year.





The reason people like Al Gore and many others are in denial is explained by cognitive dissonance. 



The global warming zealots have just been handed another rude shock, when the peer‐​reviewed journal, Nature, reported on May 1 that according to a new (and hopefully improved) climate model, global surface temperatures may not increase over the next decade. 



Roger A. Pielke, environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado, and not previously a global warming skeptic, reacted to the Nature article: “Climate models are of no practical use beyond providing some intellectual authority in the promotional battle over global‐​warming policy.”



Hudson Institute environmental economist Dennis Avery said: “The Earth’s warming from 1915 to 1940 was just about as strong as the “scary” 1975 to 1998 warming in both scope and duration — and occurred too early to be blamed on human‐​emitted CO2. The cooling from 1940 to 1975 defied the Greenhouse Theory, occurring during the first big surge of man‐​made greenhouse emissions. Most recently, the climate has stubbornly refused to warm since 1998, even though human CO2 emissions have continued to rise strongly.”



As a direct result of the global‐​warming hysteria, which, as noted above, was grossly overblown to say the least, governments reacted by restricting energy production from traditional sources, such as oil, gas and coal, and by enacting very costly regulations on CO2 emission sources. Governments also quickly jumped on the fad of “biomass” production, which, at least in the case of corn, does not result in less CO2 but more than standard oil and gas wells produce — a clear “intelligence” failure.



The restrictions on oil and gas have greatly increased the cost of gasoline and home heating oil, and the production cost of almost everything else, especially plastics and food.



In addition, the corn‐​based ethanol craze has removed huge quantities of agricultural land that was used to produce things like wheat, rice and corn for animal food, to corn to be used as motor fuel. The predictable result was a huge rise in global food prices. 



A revisionist history is under way, where many who believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, and said so, and supported the war, are now in denial — another type of “intelligence” failure.



We now see a similar thing among these same politicians who used, in part, the excuse of global warming to justify their votes against more drilling on the North Slope of Alaska, and offshore in the Lower 48. If you prevent new oil supplies, gasoline prices will rise. If you divert farm land used for growing food crops to that of growing corn to make ethanol for transportation, food prices will increase. Two more clear cases of “intelligence” failures, or worse. 



Now some of the same politicians who have, in part, created the oil and food price problems want to put a “windfall” profits tax on oil companies. (New York Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders have been particularly outspoken advocates of this idea). They seem not to have noticed that the price of oil is largely set by world supply and demand.



They have also failed to notice that over the years oil production and refining companies have had no higher profits on average than most other industries, and if you tax away all their profits this will not reduce prices at the gas pump. Most of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is the price of crude oil (only 12 percent of it controlled by private companies, the rest owned by state‐​controlled companies like Pemex in Mexico), and federal, state and local taxes. A windfall profits tax would only reduce investment in new production and refining and incentives to produce more oil — another “intelligence” failure. 



You may wonder — if the data from the last decade show the Earth is not getting warmer, and the climate models have been making incorrect predictions — why are so many in the political and media classes continuing to shout about the dangers of global warming and insisting the “science” is settled when the opposite is true. (You may recall that Copernicus and Galileo had certain problems going against the conventional wisdom of their time.)



The reason people like Al Gore and many others are in denial is explained by cognitive dissonance. This occurs when evidence increasingly contradicts a strongly held belief. Rather than accept the new evidence and change their minds, some people will become even more insistent on the “truth” of the discredited belief, and attack those who present the new evidence — again an “intelligence” failure. 



Finally, many people directly benefit from government funding global warming programs and care more about their own pocketbooks than the plight of the world’s poor who are paying more for food. This is not an “intelligence” but an “integrity” failure.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has published a commentary by renowned economics professor Silvio Borner, University of Basel, where he sharply criticizes climate models and basing political decisions on them.
He compares climate forecasts to economic forecasts, where in both fields one runs into a myriad of unpredictable variables and complex, poorly understood interactions that make reliable forecasts impossible – even more so in climate.
When it comes to climate, Borner writes that it is a fact the current warming started before industrialization and that CO2 is “partly responsible” for the current warming – as scientifically accepted temperature reconstructions of the past show.
In his commentary he looks at the parallels between global economy and global climate, reminding us that we already know that there are huge margins of errors for even short-term forecasts. “They often err even on the algebraic sign“.
Interestingly, Borner writes that forcasting the climate system is even more difficult because “we do not know the unknown exogenic causal factors in advance nor are we able to control them politically“. He explains that economists have had (bitter) experiences in trying to forecast economies and that the climate system is an even more unfamiliar system. This is evident, he says, even from weather forecasts which “differ from model to model and are often wrong“.
On the usefulness of models, Borner says they are of value, but never “true” due to the numerous assumptions that go into them. He writes:

For these reasons, all the ‘doom prognoses’ concerning the limits of growth have all failed grandly.”
Due to all the unknowns in the climate system, and the extreme lack of understanding with regards to their interaction, Borner says it is “scientifically irresponsible to fix a relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming, and then calculate from that how much Co2 needs to reduced by 2030 in order to avoid a 2°C temperature rise.” He adds:
To qualify that as methodological nonsense, one does not have to be a ‘climate denier’.”
Borner believes that it makes sense to reduce CO2, “but not on the backs of the poor countries“. He favors a CO2 emissions certificate trading scheme. He concludes:
 It is enough to set down the right general framework conditions. State planning or investments lead to chaos.”
Take this from a renowned expert in economic modeling – one who understands that the climate system is even more complex, unpredictable and far less controllable. In a nutshell Professor Borner is warning that controlling the climate is a futile endeavor and that basing policy on climate models borders on folly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn open letter about climate politics from seven distinguished climate researchers and friends of science follows:
=============================================
Some 375 political activists attached to the National Academy of Sciences, supporting the totalitarian view on the climate question, have issued an open letter saying we “caused most of the historical increase in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases”.

Harvard astrophysicist Willie Soon slams political open letter issued by 375 NAS activists, calling manmade global warming science a “totalitarian view”. Soon has been viciously attacked by activist groups, organizations and the mainstream media. He refuses to back down. Image: Heartland Institute.
Global warmists making outlandish and absurd claims…
We influence climate by returning to the air carbon dioxide that was there before. But so do termites, by emitting more methane than all the world’s farm animals combined. So do plants, by breathing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the air. So does the Sun, by supplying the Earth’s radiant energy. So do volcanoes, by ejecta that shade the Earth from the Sun. So do the oceans, by helping to keep the Earth’s temperature extraordinarily stable for more than 800,000 years.
The activists say we are warming the oceans. But even the worst assessment says this is just 1 degree Celsius every 430 years.
The activists say we are warming the lower atmosphere. Yet all data shows the atmosphere is warming at less than half the rate originally predicted by the error-prone Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The activists say the oceans are “acidifying”. The truth is that we have no idea whether or at what rate the oceans are “acidifying”. What is known, however, is that the oceans are pronouncedly alkaline and are so powerfully buffered that alkaline they must remain.
The activists say our influence on climate is evident in “altered rainfall patterns”: but there is little or no evidence of a link between our industries and enterprises on the one hand and global rainfall patterns on the other.
The activists say we are to blame for retreating Arctic sea ice. But Arctic sea ice variations, if objectively quantified with proper error estimates, are fully within the large natural range of changes that have no need of any unique explanation by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. In addition Antarctic sea ice, which they forget, has largely offset the loss of Arctic ice.

Failed predictions mean bad science
The activists declare their faith in the doctrine “that the problem of human-caused climate change is real, serious and immediate, and that this problem poses significant risks” to everything from national security via health and agriculture to biodiversity. But this statement is based wholly on faith and is unsupported by reality. We know this because of the serially failed predictions made by the activists. Good science makes accurate predictions.
The activists say, “We know that the climate system has tipping points”. Yet, revealingly, “Tipping point” is not a scientific but a political term. The activists say that “rapid warming of the planet increases the risk of crossing climatic points of no return”, but there is no evidence for rapid warming of the planet today.
The activists say warmer weather will “possibly” set in motion “large-scale ocean circulation changes”. The scientific truth is that, while the wind blows, the Earth rotates and its land-masses are approximately where they are, the ocean circulation must remain much as it is now. To suggest otherwise is mere rodomontade.
Totalitarians undercurrents
Scientists, like other citizens, are entitled and even encouraged to take part in the political process. This applies to non-citizens, which many of the 375 are. What scientists must not do, however, is pretend, as the activists did, that their totalitarian point of view is unchallengeable. In all material respects, unfolding events have proven their extremist viewpoint prodigiously exaggerated at best, plain wrong at worst.
Though the activists have attempted – falsely and improperly – to convey the impression that it is somehow illegal, immoral or damaging to the planet to vote for the Republican party’s candidate in the forthcoming Presidential Election because he disagrees with the totalitarian position on the climate question that they espouse with such religious fervor and such disregard for science, in truth it is not the business of scientists to abuse the authority of their white lab-coats by collectively suggesting that “Science” demands the voters should or should not cast their vote in any particular direction.
“Antiscientific letter”
Therefore, the signatories hereto repudiate the letter issued by the 375 activists as reflecting not scientific truth but quasi-religious dogma and totalitarian error; we urge the voters to disregard that regrettable and anti-scientific letter; and we invite every citizen to make up his or her own mind whom to elect to the nation’s highest office without fear of the multifarious bugaboos conjured into terrifying but scientifically unjustifiable existence by the totalitarian activists who have for decades so disrespected, disgraced and disfigured climate science.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) last week to fanfare and stinging criticism.   
  
Most of the criticism was aimed at the IPCC’s defense of climate models—models that the latest observations of the earth’s climate evolution show to be inaccurate, or at least are strongly indicative that is the case.   
  
There are two prominent and undeniable examples of the models’ insufficiencies: 1) climate models overwhelmingly expected much more warming to have taken place over the past several decades than actually occurred; and 2) the sensitivity of the earth’s average temperature to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (such as carbon dioxide) averages some 60 percent greater in the IPCC’s climate models than it does in reality (according to a large and growing collection of evidence published in the scientific literature).   
  
Had the IPCC addressed these model shortcomings head on, the flavor of their entire report would have been different. Instead of including projections for extreme climate changes as a result of continued human emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from our production of energy, the high-end projections would have featured relatively modest changes and the low-end projections would have been completely unremarkable.   
  
Since changes in the earth’s temperature scale approximately linearly with a property known as the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (how much the earth’s average surface temperature rises as a result of a doubling of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide concentration), it is pretty straightforward to adjust the IPCC’s projections of future temperature change to bring them closer to what the latest science says the climate sensitivity is. That science suggests the equilibrium climate sensitivity probably lies between 1.5°C and 2.5°C (with an average value of 2.0°C), while the climate models used by the IPCC have climate sensitivities which range from 2.1°C to 4.7°C with an average value of 3.2°C.   
  
To make the IPCC projections of the evolution of the earth’s average temperature better reflect the latest scientific estimates of the climate sensitivity, it is necessary to adjust them downward by about 30% at the low end, about 50% at the high end, and about 40% in the middle.   
  
The figure below the jump shows what happens when we apply such a correction (note: we maintain some internal weather noise). The top panel shows the projections as portrayed by the IPCC in their just-released _Fifth_ _Assessment Report_ , and the lower panel shows what they pretty much would have looked like had the climate models better reflected the latest science. In other words, the lower panel is what the IPCC temperature projections _should have looked like_.   
  






Figure 1. (Top) Temperature evolution from 1950 to 2100 as portrayed by the IPCC in _its Fifth Assessment Report_ according to its worst case (red) and best case (blue) emissions scenarios (RCP8.5 and RC2.6, respectively). (Bottom) Temperature evolution from 1950 to 2100 from the same emission scenarios adjusted such that the equilibrium climate sensitivity values better matched the latest science.   






The result of such adjustments is that the IPCC’s worst-case emissions scenario produces a global average temperature rise (from the 1986-2005 average) by the end of the century that has a centralized value of about 2.6°C, compared with a rise of 4.1°C given in the IPCC AR5. The more moderate emissions scenarios (the more likely course as the natural gas revolution will see lower carbon dioxide-emitting natural gas replace higher-emitting coal in energy production), once properly adjusted, produce a temperature rise by century’s end of only about 1.25°C (of which, about 0.15°C has already happened).   
  
Since virtually all climate impacts are related to the change in the earth’s temperature, the smaller the future temperature increase, the smaller the resulting impacts. Another degree of so of temperature rise during the next 87 years is not going to lead to climate catastrophe.   
  
Had the IPCC been more interested in reflecting the actual science rather than in preserving a quickly crumbling consensus (that human greenhouse gas emissions are leading to dangerous climate change that requires urgent action), its _Fifth Assessment Report_ would have been a much kindler and gentler document—as it well should have been.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."
"**Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says government forces are now ""fully in control"" of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region.**
He said the army had entered the city in the ""last phase"" of the conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front - but details are hard to confirm as there is a communications blackout.
The TPLF leader vowed to ""fight... to the last"" in a statement to Reuters.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced.
It began earlier this month after Mr Abiy announced an operation against the TPLF, the regional party, accusing it of attacking the Ethiopian army's northern command HQ in Mekelle.
Federal security forces are now searching for the TPLF leaders.
The BBC managed to briefly speak to one contact in Mekelle who said that federal soldiers were in the city and he had heard sporadic gunshots on Sunday morning. Some residents had earlier fled to the city's outskirts, he added.
Meanwhile, the US embassy in neighbouring Eritrea said six explosions were heard in the capital Asmara late on Saturday. Tigrayan forces have previously fired rockets at Eritrea, which they accuse of backing Ethiopian government forces in the weeks-long conflict. It is not clear if the latest incidents in Asmara are linked to the fighting in Tigray.
In a statement on Twitter, Mr Abiy said the army was in full control of Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"".
""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said.
The army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, Mr Abiy said, adding that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"".
There have been fears for the safety of the 500,000 people living in the city.
Mr Abiy's statement said federal forces would ""continue their task of apprehending TPLF criminals and bring them to the court of law"".
Confirming details from Tigray is very hard as telephone and internet lines have been down during the conflict.
In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last.""
He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination.""
Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown.
A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"".
It also accused the Eritrean government of involvement in the attack on Mekelle.
Tigray TV and another station from the region are now off air.
Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.
The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle.
It has also expressed concerns about the lack of access for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government would be opened, adding they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan.
In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected.
However, there was no mention of potential peace talks and the envoys were not allowed to visit Tigray.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle.
Mr Debretsion has said Tigray forces were ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF denied involvement.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced far-reaching reforms.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal""."

Over at Heterodox Academy, we have been hearing from students who are concerned that their universities exhibit a rigid ideological orthodoxy, with dissenting faculty members almost nonexistent and dissenting students afraid to speak their minds. We agree that this sort of academic climate is profoundly unhealthy: It tends to stifle the sort of uncensored intellectual inquiry that produces groundbreaking scholarship and robust education. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has cautioned against a “pall of orthodoxy” in education: “The classroom is peculiarly the marketplace of ideas. The Nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.” _Keyishian v. Board of Regents_ , 385 U. S. 589, 603 (1967) (internal quotations omitted).



Yale University understood this very well, for a time. And the University of Chicago understands it now. But, alas, this basic principle has been forgotten on countless campuses across the country. Heterodox Academy has, therefore, launched a new initiative to empower students to call for a more heterodox education. In collaboration with several students, we have generated three short resolutions that students may use to reaffirm the central importance of free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. Students who want an uncensored and heterodox education may propose these resolutions to their student governments, publicize them in student newspapers and use them to press for official policy changes:



 **[B]e it resolved that [our school] is a Heterodox University**



We make the following specific requests to the faculty and administration:



 **1) Adopt the Chicago Principles on Freedom of Expression**



A clear way for the university to show commitment to viewpoint diversity is by adopting the University of Chicago’s Principles on Freedom of Expression, which state in part:



The University’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong‐​headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University’s educational mission.



We request that the Faculty Senate endorse the “Chicago Principles” as official university policy.



 **2) Implement a non‐​obstruction policy for protests**



We support the right of all students to protest against speakers and writers with whom they disagree, but we ask that protests be done in a way that does not deprive other students of their rights to speak and hear. When members of our community shout down a speaker, or take other actions intended to make it more difficult for a speaker to speak or for an audience to hear, they are practicing obstruction, censorship, and sometimes intimidation, not free speech. Such practices have no place in any academic community. We request that the university formulate and enforce a non‐​obstruction policy. As stated in the Chicago Principles: “The University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”



 **3) Improve viewpoint diversity**



We request that the university include viewpoint diversity, and particularly political diversity, in its diversity policies and in its efforts to diversify the faculty and the curriculum. We want to encounter a range of viewpoints in the classroom, just as we will after we graduate.



Adoption of these resolutions will mark a school as a “Heterodox University” — a safe space for intellectual diversity and uncensored speech. Heterodox Academy stands ready to help tailor these resolutions to specific universities and to help support students who wish to promote these principles. For more information, clickhere.

"LONDON  —   As American allies across Europe and Asia brace for President Trump, Britain stands out for the degree to which it is proceeding as if little has changed. The country, consumed with managing “Brexit” and its associated domestic political dramas, appears to have taken relatively few steps to prepare for the geopolitical earthquakes that Mr. Trump could bring to the international and European orders on which Britain relies, and that his proposals would undermine. “The people at the top of our system, whether they’re politicians or officials or journalists or think tankers like me, we’re all totally focused on Brexit,” said Charles Grant, who heads the   Center for European Reform. “We haven’t thought about Trump as much as we should have. ” It is possible that Prime Minister Theresa May, by throwing in her lot with Mr. Trump, could ride out any changes to the international order. But if that approach does not succeed, it could have severe consequences both for her nation and for the world that Britain plays a role in keeping together. Mrs. May has sought to win over Mr. Trump, whom she will visit this week, just as her European counterparts are exploring more fundamental questions about American reliability. “The British debate on Trump is over very trivial stuff, like who Trump spoke to before May, and the German debate is over the future of the liberal order in the West,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the   European Council on Foreign Relations.   Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, wrote in a column this week for the German newspaper Bild that, with Mr. Trump’s election, “the old world of the 20th century is gone” and that Germany could confront drastic changes. François Hollande, the French president, said last month that Mr. Trump’s election “opens a period of uncertainty. ” British leaders, Mr. Leonard said, have not accepted the view, growing in other European governments, “that our prosperity and security are based on an international architecture that’s now being threatened. ” “There’s an assumption that’s all going to remain,” he continued. Since Britain’s decline from a global power in the years just after World War II, the country’s foreign policy has rested on two pillars. First is the   partnership, which allows Britain to project its power and safeguard its interests globally. Second is European unity, which is essential for Britain’s economic prosperity and, by removing the   diversions of European conflict, frees up Britain to act on the world stage. But both of those pillars could now be crumbling under the strain of European populism, Russian resurgence and particularly Mr. Trump’s threats to step away from Europe. Britain’s challenge is not just that each of those elements is coming under strain. Mr. Trump’s avowed opposition to the European Union has put them in direct conflict. For instance, Mr. Trump offered to reward Britain’s exit from the European Union with a speedy trade deal. But this risks encouraging more exits from the bloc and possibly its disintegration. The resulting turmoil on the Continent, which includes several top British trading partners, could risk harming Britain’s economy far more than an American trade deal would help. Mr. Trump’s proposed alignment with Russia poses a similar quandary. Germany and other leading European powers oppose such a realignment, which they fear would open the way for Russia to dominate Eastern Europe, breaking the Continent’s unity on security matters. Mrs. May remains hawkish on Russia. But it is unclear whether she would oppose Mr. Trump on the matter, particularly as she more fully ties her fate to the alliance. “If America eases up on Russia, Britain will be under heavy pressure to pick the United States, not to side with Merkel,” said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a   think tank, referring to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Mrs. May is increasingly focused on maintaining the alliance with the United States, the world’s largest economy and military power. Whereas leaders such as Ms. Merkel have responded sharply to criticism from Mr. Trump, Mrs. May has been more forgiving. For example, she overlooked Mr. Trump’s decision to meet with Nigel Farage, a former leader of the fringe U. K. Independence Party, before speaking with her. Even if Mrs. May succeeds in upholding the alliance, it is unclear that her government is preparing for the range of more seismic changes that Mr. Trump’s election and other events could bring. Jeremy Shapiro, an American and the research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said he had struggled to convince British officials that the old order is “eroding all around them. ” Mr. Shapiro paraphrased the “dominant” British view of Mr. Trump as, “We didn’t want him, but pressures of the presidency, checks and balances, our expert tutelage will socialize him, and it’ll be O. K. ” British hopes, he added, often rest on Senator John McCain’s persuading of Mr. Trump to drop his controversial plans and revert to traditional positions such as upholding European unity. Mr. Shapiro said he had been unable to convince British officials that Mr. McCain, whom Mr. Trump has publicly mocked, was an unlikely savior. Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, said there was a simple reason that British leaders never seemed to discuss their backup plan should they fail to moderate Mr. Trump. “There isn’t a Plan B,” he said. Preparing for life without American support, British leaders worry, could send the message that the United States can safely withdraw, risking exactly the outcome Britain wishes to avoid. “This has always been the problem,” Mr. Freedman said, because it leaves Britain unprepared for a situation that could be deeply destabilizing  —   much as it failed to prepare for Brexit. Brexit has focused attention inward, on    political dramas and on the countless challenges of negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union. “We’re going through a very solipsistic moment,” Mr. Leonard said. This has led the British to behave “as if the only independent variable is Britain leaving the E. U. and the manner in which it’s done. ” This is shaping British foreign policy in other ways. “There’s always going to be a question of whether we’re better off using our political capital to advance the international security order or to try to get a good trade deal,” Mr. Leonard said. Britain’s party politics also distract. Mrs. May is only barely holding together the governing Conservative Party, leaving her overwhelmingly focused on managing divisions that are mostly about Brexit and migration. Both she and her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have spent their careers focused on domestic issues. The opposition Labour Party is riven by its own divisions. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tends to be skeptical toward Britain’s global role. As a result, there are no major voices in British politics who have an interest, either ideological or political, in addressing the country’s foreign policy challenges. Britons’ view of their country as a pillar of a European and world order, rooted in their experience of standing up to fascism and militarism in World War II, is also shifting. “Until quite recently, we saw ourselves as   of the European order, but we don’t sort of see ourselves in that way anymore,” said Mr. Freedman, the King’s College professor. This has accelerated with the enmity toward immigration, which has focused politics inward and portrayed the outside world as something to guard against rather than to protect and uphold. That has ramifications beyond Britain. Even after Brexit, the country remains important for upholding the postwar order in Europe, where it is the largest economy after Germany and the biggest military spender after Russia. If its horizons continue to narrow, that will contribute to the Continent’s continuing fracturing on economics and opposition to Russian power. Mr. Niblett, the Chatham House chief, said he was worried Britain would become the “weak link” on European sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea. “The U. K. which traditionally sees itself as upholding the spine of Europe toward Russia, is pulling itself out of that role,” Mr. Niblett said. Other European states are already preparing for the possibility that the Continent can no longer rely on Britain, Mr. Leonard said, on issues from Russia to the Iran nuclear deal to global free trade. “They don’t know if Britain’s going to be there or not,” he said."

If one was to consider writing a manifesto the first rule would be to minimize the usage of clichés. When clichés were first uttered they were created by literary geniuses, but now they are phrases which are overused and betray the lack of an original thought. Just like the National Opposition. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, “Never has so little been said by so many to benefit so few”. We have the leaders of the minor parties, including ACT, grabbing most of the headlines whilst the most supported party within the New Zealand electorate has paralysis of the larynx.



Why has the National Opposition to this Coalition rabble become so ineffective? There is something seriously wrong. This COLs has provided the **National Party** with endless opportunities to annihilate their credibility, but instead of outright attack, there appears to be passive resistance and even support for the many autocratic and oppressive pieces of legislation that are being forced upon the populace. Where the hell are the politicians we elected to safeguard us from, or at the very least, mount a constructive challenge to all this?



I could go on and on, there is so much wrong with this Labour-led administration that you, as our representative, should have shielded us from, but you haven’t. Rampant socialism is their aim and you are allowing it to happen. Everything they had promised in their manifesto has resulted in catastrophic failure.



ACT MP **David Seymour** has shown us centre-right leadership that was once the exclusive domain of National. We have two votes. When are you going to convince us that you offer a legitimate alternative? My votes, and those of many others **cannot be taken for granted.** You have a lot of work to do this year so it’s up to you. 



USA, Great Britain and Australia scuttled socialism in spite of the MSM’s relentless support of the left. It would be an embarrassing tragedy if New Zealand was the exception. Would you want that as your legacy?

After a long vacancy, President Trump nominated Kelvin Droegemeier of Oklahoma to fill the position of Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), often referred to as the White House Science adviser.





John Holdren, Obama’s science adviser, called him “a very good pick.” Climate scientists such as Katherine Hayhoe and Judith Curry have expressed their approval. It’s rare we see Myron Ebell, who headed the EPA transition team, and Rush Holt, the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in emphatic agreement.



There are many reasons for this agreement. Droegemeier is a working scientist whose enthusiasm will be infectious and convincing, something sorely needed within the demoralized ranks of federal and university scientists.



At the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology, he taught and advised students, chased storms and tornadoes in pursuit of their fine dynamic structure, and rose through the academic ranks to serve as vice president of research for the entire university. His colleagues describe him as conscientious, fair-minded, apolitical and non-partisan—a science nerd who works very hard.





Droegemeier is a working scientist whose enthusiasm will be infectious and convincing, something sorely needed within the demoralized ranks of federal and university scientists.



The nation’s top‐​ranking scientific adviser should not only have a strong record of research and research policy experience, but also the capability to clearly communicate complicated information to the president and lawmakers. The scale of science and technology policy issues tasked to the OSTP is vast and involves navigating the perilous Washington bureaucratic minefield. Droegemeier’s experience is highly germane, including his recent service on the National Science Board that oversees the National Science Foundation. He is also Oklahoma’s Secretary of Science and Technology.



During the previous administration, OSTP was largely focused on the putative perils of climate change. It is no secret that the Trump administration is generally skeptical about climate change gloom and doom. Expect that Droegemeier is fully cognizant of the difference between what environmental activists, the scientific literature, and politicians say—and hopefully able to influence the president to speak more clearly about climate. Droegemeier’s OSTP would likely also pay more attention to the universe of other scientific activities including biology, remote sensing from space, and computing.



One criticism libertarians may have with Droegemeier is, like most, he believes that government funding of basic science is “critical for growing our economy.” In fact, as noted by the likes of the OECD, American University’s Walter Park, and our Cato colleague Terence Kealey, there’s no clear relationship between government funding of basic science and economic growth. In fact, government funding of basic science crowds out that of the private sector. With rare exceptions, almost all U.S. science was non‐​governmentally funded until World War II—but it was in this era that the U.S. economy overtook those of the rest of the world.



Regardless of his views on U.S. basic science R&D, the federal government’s share of funding is now below 50 percent, being increasingly displaced by private industry support, as well as direct university support. This transition accelerated under John Holdren’s watch, and is likely to continue regardless of who assumes the role of science adviser. The rate of technological progress continues apace, with or without government funding.



Senators may use the confirmation battle to go after Trump’s nominee and score political points ahead of the midterm elections. That would be a disservice to Dr. Droegemeier and poison the recruiting well when other highly‐​respected scientists are asked to serve in government. In fact, John Holdren was unanimously confirmed, in spite of his outspoken and partisan views on climate. We encourage an honest evaluation of the nominee’s record and a spirited debate on his science policy views, and it will become clear that Trump’s pick for OSTP director should be confirmed without delay.

This article presents a method for calculating the Earth’s rate of warming, using the existing global temperature series.
Guest essay by Sheldon Walker
It can be difficult to work out the Earth’s rate of warming. There are large variations in temperature from month to month, and different rates can be calculated depending upon the time interval and the end points chosen. A reasonable estimate can be made for long time intervals (100 years for example), but it would be useful if we could calculate the rate of warming for medium or short intervals. This would allow us to determine whether the rate of warming was increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.
The first step in calculating the Earth’s rate of warming is to reduce the large month to month variation in temperature, being careful not to lose any key information. The central moving average (CMA) is a mathematical method that will achieve this. It is important to choose an averaging interval that will meet the objectives. Calculating the average over 121 months (the month being calculated, plus 60 months on either side), gives a good reduction in the variation from month to month, without the loss of any important detail.
Graph 1 shows the GISTEMP temperature series. The blue line shows the raw temperature anomaly, and the green line shows the 121 month central moving average. The central moving average curve has little month to month variation, but clearly shows the medium and long term temperature trend.

The second step in calculating the Earth’s rate of warming is to determine the slope of the central moving average curve, for each month on the time axis. The central moving slope (CMS) is a mathematical method that will achieve this. This is similar to the central moving average, but instead of calculating an average for the points in the interval, a linear regression is done between the points in the interval and the time axis (the x-axis). This gives the slope of the central moving average curve, which is a temperature change per time interval, or rate of warming. In order to avoid dealing with small numbers, all rates of warming in this article will be given in °C per century.
It is important to choose the correct time interval to calculate the slope over. This should make the calculated slope responsive to real changes in the slope of the CMA curve, but not excessively responsive. Calculating the slope over 121 months (the month being calculated plus 60 months on either side), gives a slope with a good degree of sensitivity.
Graph 2 shows the rate of warming curve for the GISTEMP temperature series. The blue line is the 121 month central moving slope (CMS), calculated for the central moving average curve. The y-axis shows the rate of warming in °C per century, and the x-axis shows the year. When the rate of warming curve is in the lower part of the graph ( colored light blue), then it shows cooling (the rate of warming is below zero). When the rate of warming curve is in the upper part of the graph ( colored light orange), then it shows warming (the rate of warming is above zero).

The curve shows 2 major periods of cooling since 1880. Each lasted approximately a decade (1900 to 1910, and 1942 to 1952), and reached cooling rates of about -2.0 °C per century. There is a large interval of continuous warming from 1910 to 1942 (about 32 years). This reached a maximum rate of warming of about +2.8 °C per century around 1937. 1937 is the year with the highest rate of warming since the start of the GISTEMP series in 1880 (more on that later).
There is another large interval of continuous warming from about 1967 to the present day (about 48 years). This interval has 2 peaks at about 1980 and 1998, where the rates of warming were just under +2.4 °C per century. The rate of warming has been falling steadily since the last peak in 1998. In 2015, the rate of warming is between +0.5 and +0.8 °C per century, which is about 30% of the rate in 1998. (Note that all of these rates of warming were calculated AFTER the so‑called “Pause-busting” adjustments were made. More on that later.)
It is important to check that the GISTEMP rate of warming curve is consistent with the curves from the other temperature series (including the satellite series).
Graph 3 shows the rate of warming curves for GISTEMP, NOAA, UAH, and RSS. (Note that the satellite temperature series did not exist before 1979.)

All of the rate of warming curves show good agreement with each other. Peaks and troughs line up, and the numerical values for the rates of warming are similar. Both of the satellite series appear to have a larger change in the rate of warming when compared to the surface series, but both satellite series are in good agreement with each other.
Some points about this method:
1) There is no cherry-picking of start and end times with this method. The entire temperature series is used.
2) The rate of warming curves from different series can be directly compared with each other, no adjustment is needed for the different baseline periods. This is because the rate of warming is based on the change in temperature with time, which is the same regardless of the baseline period.
3) This method can be performed by anybody with a moderate level of skill using a spreadsheet. It only requires the ability to calculate averages, and perform linear regressions.
4) The first and last 5 years of each rate of warming curve has more uncertainty than the rest of the curve. This is due to the lack of data beyond the ends of the curve.  It is important to realise that the last 5 years of the curve may change when future temperatures are added.
There is a lot that could be said about these curves. One topic that is “hot” at the moment, is the “Pause” or “Hiatus”.
The rate of warming curves for all 4 major temperature series show that there has been a significant drop in the rate of warming over the last 17 years. In 1998 the rate of warming was between +2.0 and +2.5 °C per century. Now, in 2015, it is between +0.5 and +0.8 °C per century. The rate now is only about 30% of what it was in 1998.  Note that these rates of warming were calculated AFTER the so-called “Pause-busting” adjustments were made.
I was originally using the GISTEMP temperature series ending with May 2015, when I was developing the method described here. When I downloaded the series ending with June 2015 and graphed it, I thought that there must be something wrong with my computer program, because the rate of warming curve had changed so dramatically. I eventually traced the “problem” back to the data, and then I read that GISTEMP had adopted the “Pause-busting” adjustments that NOAA had devised.
Graph 4 shows the effect on the rate of warming curve, of the GISTEMP “Pause-busting” adjustments. The blue line shows the rates from the May 2015 data, and the red line shows the rates from the June 2015 data.

One of the strange things about the GISTEMP “Pause-busting” adjustments, is that the year with the highest rate of warming (since 1880) has changed. It used to be around 1998, with a warming rate of about +2.4 °C per century. After the adjustments, it moved to around 1937 (that’s right, 1937, back when the CO2 level was only about 300 ppm), with a warming rate of about +2.8 °C per century.
If you look at the NOAA series, they already had 1937 as the year with the highest rate of warming, so GISTEMP must have picked it up from NOAA when they switched to the new NCEI ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature reconstruction.
So, the next time that you hear somebody claiming that Global Warming is accelerating, show them a graph of the rate of warming. Some climate scientists seem to enjoy telling us that things are worse than predicted. Here is a chance to cheer them up with some good news. Somehow I don’t think that they will want to hear it.

Spoils system reinstated by choice of grant subject.
In memoriam–our civil service as it was, a political cartoon by Thomas Nast showing statue of Andrew Jackson on a pig, which is over “fraud”, “bribery”, and “spoils”, eating “plunder”. Featured in Harper’s Weekly on 28 April 1877, p. 325. Source: Library of Congress
Clifford Eddy, PhD writes:
After James Garfield’s assassination, the spoils system of granting government jobs was replaced by the civil service system, with merit being the criterion for hiring rather than political loyalty to those in high political office.
[via Wikipedia]
In the politics of the United States, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party—as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit, independent of political activity.
The term was derived from the phrase “to the victor belong the spoils” by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of the Jackson Democrats in the election of 1828, with the term spoils meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory.
…
After the assassination of James A. Garfield by a rejected office-seeker in 1881, the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level came with the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job. The Pendleton Act’s reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the White House every election between 1884 and 1896. After each election the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to jobs held by his political supporters. By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service and the spoils system was limited only to very senior positions.
The separation between the political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the Hatch Act of 1939 which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities.
The spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall ring, which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the Shakman Decrees of 1972 and 1983. Modern variations on the spoils system are often described as the political machine.
In today’s climate science, merit criteria have been replaced  by a spoils system of giving grants to those loyal to the political doctrine of Climate Change caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
The US government claim is that $36B has been spent on climate research.  The terms of the resulting grants assured that their recipients would support the entirely political doctrine of  anthropogenic origins of climate change.
This has particularly evil implications such as “scientific truth can be sold to the highest bidder.”

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger   
  
\---   
  
One of the planet’s most prolific weather and climate Tweeters is Florida State PhD and WeatherBell wizard Dr. Ryan Maue (rhymes with zowie). Ryan’s initial claim to fame was his analysis of tropical cyclone (e.g., hurricane) activity that shows, over the past 45 years, lots of variability but no overall change. Originally published in 2009, it flies in the face of global warming doomsayers who predict increases in all manner of extreme weather events including hurricanes and their tropical brethren. As a young scientist, going against the grain is not typically a good career move (which is why the global warming establishment is self-perpetuating), but Ryan is driven more by the truth than by political correctness. In fact, political correctness is an antonym of Ryan.   
  
He has risen to prominence as the creator of the amazing analyses and graphics produced by the private weather forecasting firm WeatherBell Analytics. Many of these products find their way onto Ryan’s Twitter page along with some insightful (and often witty) commentary. His analysis of current weather events is unparalleled. If you’ve heard of the “polar vortex,” you can thank (or blame) Ryan: he first popularized this arcane professional term last winter.   
  
This past week he has been active, covering the humongous lake-effect snows burying parts of greater Buffalo, the cold outbreak setting all-time monthly low temperature records in the Eastern United States, and pushing back against the growing tide of media that so desperately wants to link it all to global warming.   
  
From our standpoint, Ryan is one of the best young weather/climate guys out there. If you don’t want to limit yourself to only encountering Ryan’s analysis on the Drudge Report (which actually isn’t too limiting since his work is frequently featured there), then you ought to have a look for him on Twitter and become another of his more than 13,000 followers. To tune in to Ryan telling it like it is, check out @RyanMaue.   




Also worth noting is that the deadline for the public to comment on the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants is December 1 (yes, that’s the Monday after Thanksgiving). This legislation is the crème-de-le-crème of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan and seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants to 30% below the emission level in 2005 by the year 2030. According to the EPA, that will result in a reduction of 730 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to taking 150 million cars off the road.   
  
While that sounds like a lot, it really is a very little, especially when it comes to the climate impact. In public comments we are about to submit, we calculated that these emissions reductions would avert only 0.02°C of projected global warming by the end of the century—a value too little to care about (and assuming a warming that is way too much). That is, unless you care about the price. Then you come to realize just how much pain this insignificant gain costs.   
  
Just this week, an economic analysis from Energy Venture Analysis was released examining the impact of the proposed EPA regulations on energy prices. From the report’s press release:   




The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed carbon rule is the latest in a series of regulations alongside rising natural gas prices that will increase the cost of electricity and natural gas by nearly $300 billion in 2020 compared with 2012, according to a study released today by Energy Ventures Analysis, Inc. The study, “Energy Market Impacts of Recent Federal Regulations on the Electric Power Sector,” demonstrates the heavy financial burden the EPA’s collection of regulations will force on American families, businesses and manufacturers through soaring energy costs.   
  
The study found the typical household’s annual electricity and natural gas bills would increase by $680, or 35 percent, from 2012 compared to 2020, escalating each year thereafter as EPA regulations grow more stringent. The cost of electricity would increase the most in states that have implemented deregulation of wholesale electric power markets, where the price of electricity will rise to the marginal cost to support new generating capacity.



The full report, including an online tool to examine the impacts on a state-by-state basis, is available here.   
  
If you wish to point out any of this to the EPA, or if you have other details (pro or con) that you feel worth mentioning, you can submit your comments at the website Regulations.gov. We are currently busy putting the final touches on ours!   
  
And finally, a bit of a departure. While typically our focus here is on global warming, the bigger view of the Center for the Study of Science is examining how federal control of research dollars influences science. Global warming is a prominent (and popular) example, but it is by no means the only science topic that is co-opted by the government.   
  
We just came across this example even though it was reported on earlier this year: “Feds Accused of Steering Funding to Anti-pot Researchers.” As drug legalization is a major libertarian emphasis, we thought it was worth dusting off this article and mentioning it here. That the feds are apparently meddling in the scientific research process and favoring those researchers who will produce results that support the federal stance (in this case, that marijuana is bad) should hardly be surprising for anyone who follows us at the Center for the Study of Science.   
  
From the article’s lead:   




As the nation’s only truly legal supplier of marijuana, the U.S. government keeps tight control of its stash, which is grown in a 12-acre fenced garden on the campus of the University of Mississippi in Oxford.   
  
From there, part of the crop is shipped to Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, where it’s rolled into cigarettes, all at taxpayer expense.   
  
Even though Congress has long banned marijuana, the operation is legitimate. It’s run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which doles out the pot for federally approved research projects.   
  
While U.S. officials defend their monopoly, critics say the government is hogging all the pot and giving it mainly to researchers who want to find harms linked to the drug.



For the rest of the story of the government bogarting the weed, be sure to check out the full piece.   
  
That’s it for this week. We’ll be off for Thanksgiving next week, but we’ll be back with other interesting tidbits that you ought to have a look at come the first week of December.

June brings with it sunshine and warmth – Germany can rely on that.
The German June mean temperature, however, has hardly changed over the past 85 years, as the official weather data of the German DWD National Weather Service confirm:

Figure: June mean temperature trend in Germany over the past 85 years. Data: DWD. Chart: Josef Kowatsch

What stand out are the negative peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Then in the 2000s there was a sudden upward jump.
Today June mean temperatures have been moving well within a normal range. Of course this is much too boring for the media to report on. Luckily at the Die kalte Sonne website, you get all the facts unfiltered.
Thanks to Josef Kowatsch

"**The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has denied accusations made by Ethiopia's army chief that he helped to procure weapons for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).**
The TPLF is fighting federal troops.
Dr Tedros is Tigrayan and was health minister in a previous Ethiopian government, which was led by the TPLF.
""There have been reports suggesting I am taking sides in this situation. This is not true,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""I want to say that I am on only one side and that is the side of peace,"" he added.
His comments come after Gen Berhanu Jula said in a press conference that Dr Tedros had ""left no stone unturned"" to support the TPLF and help get them weapons. He did not provide any evidence to support his allegations.
Hundreds have died in the conflict in Tigray since the beginning of November.
""My heart breaks for my home, Ethiopia, and I call on all parties to work for peace and to ensure the safety of civilians and access for health and humanitarian assistance,"" Dr Tedros tweeted.
Earlier, Gen Berhanu said: ""We don't expect him to stand on the side of Ethiopians and condemn these people. He has been doing everything to support them, he has campaigned for neighbouring countries to condemn the war,"" said Gen Berhanu.
""He has worked for them to get weapons.""
After being voted in as the head of the WHO in 2017, Dr Tedros became well known at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and is now arguably the highest-profile Tigrayan abroad.
Meanwhile, US President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy aide has appealed for both sides to end the fighting.
""Deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, reports of targeted ethnic violence, and the risk to regional peace and security,"" Antony Blinken tweeted.
The UN's refugee agency warns that a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding.
More than 30,000 people have crossed the border from Ethiopia into Sudan.
Thousands of civilians are continuing to flee across the border, the UN Refugee Agency's representative for Sudan, Axel Bisschop told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""I spoke to a banker, some teachers, health workers, and they all say that it was too dangerous to be there... and they left by foot,"" he said.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and politics for decades before Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in 2018.
He pushed through major reforms which some say sidelined the TPLF.
The feud escalated in September when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Abiy called the vote illegal.
Then fighting broke out on 4 November after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons.
The TPLF has denied the attack.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."

I have been watching “Hitlers Circle of Evil”  
It is like a documentary and can be viewed on Netflix.



Hitlers Circle of Evil: Series 1 This is the inside story of the rise and fall of the Third Reich told like the drama it really was: from the perspective of those who made it happen — the movers and shakers of the most evil regime in history. They were Hitler’s henchmen — the small gaggle of war heroes, misfits, careerists and fanatical Nazis who had the ear of the Fuhrer..



There are 10 episodes and it takes the viewer from the beginning to the end of the Nazi Party.  
While watching some of the episodes a number of times I thought…”That’s exactly what the coalition are doing.”



For example:



There are many more examples that came through the series.  
I believe that we should be very worried if Ardern gets another 3 years

…PLUS AN OBVIOUS ERROR IN THE NEW NOAA ERSST.V4 PAPER
Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
We’ve discussed NOAA’s new ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature reconstruction in a number of posts this year.  They are linked at the end of this post.  We can add yet another curiosity to the list…this time relating to the global ERSST.v4 data during the first half of the 20th Century.  Additionally, there is an error in a new paper about the NOAA ERSST.v4 that I want to discuss as well.
This post was prompted by a paragraph in NOAA’s recent paper about the uncertainties of their ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature reconstruction.  That paper is Huang et al. (2015b) Further Exploring and Quantifying Uncertainties for Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) Version 4 (v4), which is presently available (paywalled) as an Early Online Release.   Two things in the following paragraph caught my eye (my boldface):
A recent study (Karl et al. 2015) indicated that the trend of globally averaged SST in ERSST.v4 in the most recent decades (0.99°C century-1; 2000-2014) is as large as in the longer period of 1951-2012 (0.88°C century-1). Figure 6b shows the histogram of the trend during the longer period. The trend ranges from 0.7°C to 1.0°C century-1, which is higher than the long term trend shown in Figure 6a, indicating stronger oceanic warming since the middle of the 20th Century. Factor analyses indicate that the major contributor to this trend uncertainty is the ship-buoy adjustment (the 9th parameter; Fig. 7b).
FIRST, THE ERROR IN THE NEW HUANG ET AL. (2015b) PAPER
For the period of 1951-2012, Karl et al. (2015) listed the trend of 0.088 deg C/decade (0.88 deg C/century) for their “old” ERSST.v3b data, not the “new” ERSST.v4 data.   The 1951-2012 trend for the “new” ERSST.v4 data shown in Table S1 from the Supplementary materials for Karl et al. (2015) is listed as 0.100 deg C/decade (1.00 deg C/century). Their Table S1 is included as my Table 1.  NOAA repeated that “typo” throughout Huang et al. (2015b).

Table 1
Looks like the peer reviewers missed an obvious mistake.
In Figure 1, I’ve added vertical red lines to Figure 6 (SSTa trend uncertainty histograms) from Huang et al. to show the data trends listed in Karl et al. (2015) for the periods of 1951 to 2012 and 2000 to 2014. (Refer again to Karl et al. Table S1, my Table 1.) I’ve also shown the 0.88 deg C/Century trend that was erroneously listed in Huang et al. (2015b) for the period of 1951 to 2012.

Figure 1
Curiously, but not surprisingly, the actual sea surface temperature data trends align with, or are near to, the extreme high end trends in the uncertainty histograms.
And if you’re wondering about the ERSST.v4 data trend for the period of 1901 to 2014 (Cell a in Figure 6 from Huang et al. 2015b), the data for the latitudes of 60S-60N (global excluding the polar oceans) present a linear trend of 0.073 deg C/decade (0.73 deg C/century)….once again toward the high end of the histogram.  (Data available through the KNMI Climate Explorer.)
SO THE WARMING RATE FOR 1951-2012 IS HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR 1901-2012
The above quote from Huang et al. (2015b) included (my brackets):
The trend ranges from 0.7°C to 1.0°C century-1 [for the period of 1951-2012], which is higher than the long term trend shown in Figure 6a [for the period of 1901-2014], indicating stronger oceanic warming since the middle of the 20th Century.
There’s nothing unusual about global sea surface temperatures since 1951 having a higher warming rate than the data since 1901.  All sea surface temperature and night marine air temperature datasets (end products) available from the KNMI Climate Explorer show that simple relationship.  See Figure 2. The difference between the shorter-term (1951-2012) and the longer-term (1901-2012) trends depends on the dataset.

Figure 2 (Typo Corrected in ERSST.v3b Graph)
Figure 2 (and Figures 3 through 5) include global (60S-60N) ocean surface temperature anomalies referenced to the period of 1971-2000, from top to bottom:

NOAA’s ERSST.v4 Sea Surface Temperature (NOAA’s new “Pauses-Buster” data)
NOAA’s ERSST.v3b Sea Surface Temperature (NOAA’s “old” data)
UKMO’s HadNMAT2 Night Marine Air Temperature (Which NOAA uses to adjust their ERSST.v4 data to account for ship-based temperature biases, from buckets and ship inlets)
UKMO’s HADSST3 Sea Surface Temperature (An uninterpolated product used in the UKMO HadCRUT4 global land+ocean surface temperature product), and
UKMO’s HadISST Sea Surface Temperature (the most-often-used sea surface temperature dataset used in scientific studies, even though it has the lowest warming rates.)

Huang et al. included trends for the periods of 1901-2014 and 1951-2012, using two different end years. For ease of illustration, I ended the data for both periods in 2012. That also agrees with the periods shown in Table 2.5 from Chapter 2 of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. The exception to the 2012 end year is the HadNMAT2 data, which run through 2010 because the dataset ends then.
The data suppliers account for sea ice differently…thus the use of the latitudes of 60S-60N.
In the quote above, Huang et al. (2015b) are suggesting that global warming is accelerating.  But Huang et al. (2015b) failed to note something important.
THE WARMING RATE FOR 1901-1950 IS ALSO HIGHER THAN THE RATE FOR 1901-2012
Figure 3 includes trend comparisons for the five ocean surface temperature products, but this time comparing the warming rates for 1901-1950 and 1901-2012.

Figure 3 (Corrected typo on HADSST3 graph)
The “ew” “new” and “old” NOAA sea surface temperature products show slightly higher warming rates for 1901-1950 than they do for 1901-2012. On the other hand, the UKMO’s HadNMAT2, HADSST3 and HadISST show noticeably higher warming trends for the early period of 1901-1950.
ONLY THE NOAA “PAUSES-BUSTER” DATA SHOW A LOWER WARMING RATE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY 
Figure 4 compares the warming rates for 1901-1950 and 1951-2012 for the 5 ocean surface temperature products.

Figure 4 (Corrected typo on HADSST3 graph)
With the “old” NOAA ERSST.v3b data, the warming rates for the early (1901-1950) period are comparable to those for the later period (1951-2012).  The early period has a slightly higher warming rate than the later period in the HadNMAT2 and HadISST datasets…though it could be argued that they’re comparable.  The HADSST3 data have a noticeably higher warming rate in the early period.
The exception is NOAA’s new ERSST.v4 “pauses buster” data, which show a noticeably lower warming rate in the first half of the 20th Century.
DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUAL-LENGTH (50-YEAR) PERIODS
Someone is bound to note that we’re not comparing periods of equal length. So, for Figure 5, I ended the later period in 2000, breaking the 20th Century in two.

Figure 5 (Corrected typos in ERSST.v4 and HADSST3 graphs.)
THE DATASET USED BY NOAA FOR SHIP-BASED BIAS ADJUSTMENTS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE LOWER WARMING RATE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY 
Figure 6 compares the warming rates for the periods of 1901-1950 and 1951-2010 using the global (60S-60N) HadNMAT2 and the new NOAA ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature data.  NOAA adjusts their ERSST.v4 sea surface temperature data using HadNMAT2 night marine air temperature data to account for ship-based temperature measurement biases (buckets of various types and ship inlets).

Figure 6
Curiously, NOAA’s ERSST.v4 data have a noticeably lower warming rate than the reference HadNMAT2 data during the first half of the 20th Century (and a noticeably higher warming rate from 1951-2010).  Those additional tweaks are the reasons why the NOAA ERSST.v4 are the outlier, showing a lower warming rate in the first half of the 20th Century than for the period from 1951-2012.
CLOSING
Did NOAA adjustment (modify, tweak, manipulate, etc.) their ERSST.v4 “pauses-buster” sea surface temperature data during the first half of the 20th Century so that the ocean surfaces showed a slight acceleration in global sea surface warming for 1951-2012?   The other ocean surface temperature datasets don’t show the same disparity over those two time periods.  If fact, the UKMO’s HADSST3 dataset (which like ERSST.v4 is also adjusted for bucket, ship inlet and buoy biases) shows a noticeably higher warming rate for 1901-1950 than for 1951-2012.
ADDITIONAL POSTS ABOUT NOAA’S NEW ERSST.v4 “PAUSES-BUSTER” SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA
In previous posts at WattsUpWithThat and at my blog ClimateObservations, I’ve discussed the new NOAA “pause-buster” sea surface temperature dataset (ERSST.v4) a number of times since the publication of Karl et al. (2015)—latest to earliest:

Busting (or not) the mid-20th century global-warming hiatus

State education rankings published by _U.S. News & World Report_, _Education Week_ , and others play a prominent role in legislative debate and public discourse concerning education. These rankings are based partly on achievement tests, which measure student learning, and partly on other factors not directly related to student learning. When achievement tests are used as measures of learning in these conventional rankings, they are aggregated in a way that provides misleading results. To overcome these deficiencies, we create a new ranking of state education systems using demographically disaggregated achievement data and excluding less informative factors that are not directly related to learning. Using our methodology changes the order of state rankings considerably. Many states in New England and the Upper Midwest fall in the rankings, whereas many states in the South and Southwest score much higher‐​than they do in conventional rankings. Furthermore, we create another set of rankings on the efficiency of education spending. In these efficiency rankings, achieving successful outcomes while economizing on education expenditures is considered better than doing so through lavish spending. These efficiency rankings cause a further increase in the rankings of southern and western states and a decline in the rankings of northern states. Finally, our regression results indicate that unionization has a powerful negative influence on educational outcomes, and that, given current spending levels, additional spending has little effect. We also find no evidence of a relationship between student performance and teacher‐​pupil ratios or private school enrollment, but some evidence that charter school enrollment has a positive effect.



So many myths stand in the way of expanding educational freedom to all Americans: choice drains money from public schools; choice segregates; choice undermines democracy; and so on. In _School Choice Myths_ , editors Corey A. DeAngelis and Neal P. McCluskey bring clear logic and overwhelming evidence to bear against all the major anti school‐​choice myths, giving readers what they need to see though them and understand how even well‐​intentioned people can be deceived. This book is a one‐​stop guide to everything from the latest research on the effects of school choice on civic engagement to Supreme Court precedent. It is a must‐​have for any combatant in the school choice wars, or anyone who just wants the best education for their children. 



_Preorder your copy below:_



Which states have the best K–12 education systems? What set of government policies and education spending levels is needed to achieve targeted outcomes in an efficient manner? Answers to these important questions are essential to the performance of our economy and country. Local workforce education and quality of schools are key determinants in business and residential location decisions. Determining which education policies are most cost-effective is also crucial for state and local politicians as they allocate limited taxpayer resources.



Several organizations rank state K–12 education systems, and these rankings play a prominent role in both legislative debate and public discourse concerning education. The most popular are arguably those of _U.S. News & World Report_ ( _U.S. News_ ).1. It is common for activists and pundits (whether in favor of homeschooling, stronger teacher unions, core standards, etc.) to use these rankings to support their arguments for changes in policy or spending priorities. As shown by the recent competition for Amazon’s HQ2 (second headquarters), politicians and business leaders will also frequently cite education rankings to highlight their states’ advantages.2. Recent teacher strikes across the country have likewise drawn renewed attention to education policy, and journalists inevitably mention state rankings when these topics arise.3. It is therefore important to ensure that such rankings accurately reflect performance.



Though well-intentioned, most existing rankings of state K–12 education are unreliable and misleading. The most popular and influential state education rankings fail to provide an “apples to apples” comparison between states.4. By treating states as though they had identical students, they ignore the substantial variation present in student populations across states. Conventional rankings also include data that are inappropriate or irrelevant to the educational performance of schools. Finally, these analyses disregard government budgetary constraints. Not surprisingly, using disaggregated measures of student learning, removing inappropriate or irrelevant variables, and examining the efficiency of educational spending reorders state rankings in fundamental ways. As we show in this report, employing our improved ranking methodology overturns the apparent consensus that schools in the South and Southwest perform less well than states in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. It also puts to rest the claim that more spending necessarily improves student performance.5.



Many rankings, including those of _U.S. News_ , provide average scores on tests administered by the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), sometimes referred to as “the nation’s report card.”6. The NAEP reports provide average scores for various subjects, such as math, reading, and science, for students at various grade levels.7. These scores are supposed to measure the degree to which students understand these subjects. While _U.S. News_ includes other measures of education quality, such as graduation rates and SAT and ACT college entrance exam scores, direct measures of the entire student population’s understanding of academic subject matter, such as those from the NAEP, are the most appropriate measures of success for an educational system.8. Whereas graduation is not necessarily an indication of actual learning, and only those students wishing to pursue a college degree tend to take standardized tests like the SAT and ACT, NAEP scores provide standardized measures of learning covering the entire student population. Focusing on NAEP data thus avoids selection bias while more closely measuring a school system’s ability to improve actual student performance.



However, student heterogeneity is ignored by _U.S. News_ and most other state rankings that use NAEP data as a component of their rankings. Students from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds tend to perform differently (regardless of the state they are in). As this report will show, such aggregation often renders conventional state rankings as little more than a proxy for a jurisdiction’s demography. This problem is all the more unfortunate because it is so easily avoided. NAEP provides demographic breakdowns of student scores by state. This oversight substantially skews the current rankings.



Perhaps just as problematic, some education rankings conflate inputs and outputs. For instance, _Education Week_ uses per pupil expenditures as a component in its annual rankings.9. When direct measures of student achievement are used, such as NAEP scores, it is a mistake to include inputs, such as educational expenditures, as a separate factor.10. Doing so gives extra credit to states that spend excessively to achieve the same level of success others achieve with fewer resources, when that wasteful extra spending should instead be penalized in the rankings.



Our main goal in this report is to provide a ranking of public school systems in U.S. states that more accurately reflects the learning that is taking place. We attempt to move closer to a “value added” approach as explained in the following hypothetical. Consider one school system where every student knows how to read upon entering kindergarten. Compare this to a second school system where students don’t have this skill upon entering kindergarten. It should come as no surprise if, by the end of first grade, the first school’s students have better reading scores than the second school’s. But if the second school’s students improved more, relative to their initial situation, a value-added approach would conclude that the second system actually did a better job. The value-added approach tries to capture this by measuring improvement rather than absolute levels of education achievement. Although the ranking presented here does not directly measure value added, it captures the concept more closely than do previous rankings by accounting for the heterogeneity of students who presumably enter the school system with different skills. Our approach is thus a better way to gauge performance.



Moreover, this report will consider the importance of efficiency in a world of scarce resources. Our final rankings will rate states according to how much learning similar students have relative to the amount of resources used to achieve it.



Students arrive to class on the first day of school with different backgrounds, skills, and life experiences, often related to socioeconomic status. Assuming away these differences, as most state rankings implicitly do, may lead analysts to attribute too much of the variation in state educational outcomes to school systems instead of to student characteristics. Taking student characteristics into account is one of the fundamental improvements made by our state rankings.



An example drawn from NAEP data illustrates how failing to account for student heterogeneity can lead to grossly misleading results. (For a more general demonstration of how heterogeneity affects results, see the Appendix.) According to _U.S. News_ , Iowa ranks 8th and Texas ranks 33rd in terms of pre-K–12 quality. _U.S. News_ includes only NAEP eighth-grade math and reading scores as components in its ranking, and Iowa leads Texas in both. By further including fourth grade scores and the NAEP science tests, the comparison between Iowa and Texas remains largely unchanged. Iowa students still do better than Texas students, but now in all six tests reported for those states (math, reading, and science in fourth and eighth grades). To use a baseball metaphor, this looks like a shut-out in Iowa’s favor.



But this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The characteristics of Texas students are very different from those of Iowa students; Iowa’s student population is predominantly white, while Texas’s is much more ethnically diverse. NAEP data include average test scores for various ethnic groups. Using the four most populous ethnic groups (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian),11. at two grade levels (fourth and eighth), and three subject-area tests (math, reading, science), there are 24 disaggregated scores that could, in principle, be compared between the two states in 2017. This is much more than just the two comparisons—eighth grade reading and math—that _U.S. News_ considers.12.



Given that Iowa students outscore their Texas counterparts on each of the three tests in both fourth and eighth grades, one might reasonably expect that most of the disaggregated groups of Iowa students would also outscore their Texas counterparts in most of the twenty exams given in both states.13. But the exact opposite is the case. In fact, Texas students outscore their Iowa counterparts in all but one of the disaggregated comparisons. The only instance where Iowa students beat their Texas counterparts is the reading test for eighth grade Hispanic students. This is indeed a near shut-out, but one in Texas’s favor, not Iowa’s.



Let that sink in. Texas whites do better than Iowa whites in each subject test for each grade level. Similarly, Texas blacks do better than Iowa blacks in each subject test and grade level. Texas Hispanics do better than Iowa Hispanics in all but one test in one grade level. Texas Asians do better than Iowa Asians in all tests that both states report in common. In what sense could we possibly conclude that Iowa does a better job educating its students than does Texas?14. We think it obvious that the aggregated data here are misleading. The only reason for Iowa’s higher overall average scores is that, compared to Texas, its student population is disproportionately composed of whites. Iowa’s high ranking is merely a statistical artifact of a flawed measurement system. When student heterogeneity is considered, Texas schools clearly do a better job educating students, at least as indicated by the performance of students as measured by NAEP data.



This discrepancy in scores between these two states is no fluke either. In numerous instances, state education rankings change substantially when we take student heterogeneity into account.15. The makers of the NAEP, to their credit, allow comparisons to be made for heterogeneous subgroups of the student population. However, almost all the rankings fail to utilize these useful data to correct for this problem. This methodological oversight skews previous rankings in favor of homogeneously white states. In constructing our ranking, we will use these same NAEP data, but break down scores into the aforementioned 24 categories by test subject, grade, and ethnic group to more properly account for heterogeneity.



Importantly, we wish to make clear that our use of these four racial categories does not imply that differences between groups are in any way fixed or would not change under different circumstances. Using these categories to disaggregate students has the benefit of simplicity while also largely capturing the effects of other important socioeconomic variables that differ markedly between ethnic groups (and also between students within these groups).16. Such socioeconomic factors are related to race in complex ways, and controlling for race is common in the economic literature. In addition, by giving equal weight to each racial category, our procedure puts a greater emphasis on how well states teach each category of students than do traditional rankings, paying somewhat greater attention to how groups that have historically suffered from discrimination are faring.



Our methodology is to compare state scores for each of three subjects (math, reading, and science), four major ethnic groups (whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders) and two grades (fourth and eighth),17. for a total of 24 potential observations in each state and the District of Columbia. We exclude factors such as graduation rates and pre-K enrollment that do not measure how much students have learned.



We give each of the 24 tests18. equal weight and base our ranking on the average of the test scores.19. This ranking is thus limited to measuring learning and does so in a way that avoids the aggregation fallacy. We refer to this as the “quality” rank.



From left to right, Table 1 shows our ranking using disaggregated NAEP scores (“quality ranking”), then how rankings would look if based solely on aggregate state NAEP test scores (“aggregated rank”), and finally the _U.S. News_ rankings.



 **Table 1**  
 **State rankings using disaggregated NAEP scores**

The difference between the aggregated rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings shows the effect of _U.S. News_ ’ use of only partial NAEP data—no fourth grade or science scores—and the inclusion of factors unrelated to learning (e.g., graduation rates). The effects are substantial.



The difference between the disaggregated quality rank (first column) and the aggregated rank (third column) shows the effects of controlling for heterogeneity—our focus in this report—which are also substantial. States with small minority population shares (defined as Hispanic or black) tend to fall in the rankings when the data are disaggregated, and states with high shares of minority populations tend to rise when the data are disaggregated.



There are substantial differences between our quality rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings. For example, Maine drops from 6th in the _U.S. News_ ranking to 49th in the quality ranking. Florida, which ranks 40th in _U.S. News_ ’, jumps to 3rd in our quality ranking.



Maine apparently does very well in the nonlearning components of _U.S. News_ ’ rankings; its aggregated NAEP scores would put it in 24th place, 18 positions lower than its _U.S. News_ rank. But the aggregated NAEP scores overstate what its students have learned; Maine’s quality ranking is a full 25 positions below that. On the 10 achievement tests reported for Maine, its rankings on those tests are 46th, 45th, 48th, 37th, 41st, 40th, 34th, 40th, 41st, and 23rd. It is astounding that _U.S. News_ could rank Maine as high as 6th, given the deficient performance of both its black and white students (the only two groups reported for Maine) relative to black and white students in other states. But since Maine’s student population is about 90 percent white, the aggregated scores bias the results upward.



On the other hand, Florida apparently scores poorly on _U.S. News_ ’ nonlearning attributes, since its aggregated NAEP scores (ranked 16th) are much better than its _U.S. News_ score (ranked 40th). Florida’s student population is about 60 percent nonwhite, meaning that the aggregate scores are likely to underestimate Florida’s education quality, which is borne out by the quality ranking. In fact, Florida gets considerably above-average scores for all but one of its 24 reported tests, with student performance on half of its tests among the top five states, which is how it is able to earn a rank of 3rd in our quality rankings.20.



The decline in Maine’s ranking is representative of some other New England and midwestern states such as Vermont, New Hampshire, and Minnesota, which tend to have largely white populations, leading to misleadingly high positions in typical rankings such as _U.S. News_ ’. The increase in Florida’s ranking mirrors gains in the rankings of other southern and southwestern states, such as Texas and Georgia, with large minority populations. This leads to a serious distortion of beliefs about which parts of the country do a better job educating their students.



We should note that the District of Columbia, which is not ranked at all by _U.S. News_ , does very well in our quality rankings. It is not surprising that D.C.’s disaggregated ranking is quite different from the aggregated ranking, given that D.C.’s population is about 85 percent minority. Nevertheless, we suspect that the very large change in rank is something of an aberration. D.C.’s high ranking is driven by the unusually outstanding scores of its white students, who come from disproportionately affluent and educated families,21. and whose scores were more than four standard deviations above the national white mean in each test subject they participated in (a greater difference than for any other single ethnic group in any state). Were it not for these scores, D.C. would be somewhat below average (with D.C. blacks slightly below the national black average and Hispanics considerably below their average).



Massachusetts and New Jersey, which are highly ranked by _U.S. News_ , are also highly ranked by our methodology, indicating that they deserve their high rankings based on the performance of all their student groups. Other states have similar placements in both rankings. Overall, however, the correlation between our rankings and _U.S. News_ ’ rankings is only 0.35, which, while positive, does not evince a terribly strong relationship.



Failing to disaggregate student-performance data and inserting factors not related to learning distorts results. By construction, our measure better reflects the relative performance of each group of students in each state, as measured by the NAEP data. We believe the differences between our rankings and the conventional rankings warrant a serious reevaluation of which state education systems are doing the best jobs for their students; we hope the conventional ranking organizations will be prompted to make changes that more closely follow our methodology.



The overall quality of a school system is obviously of interest to educators, parents, and politicians. However, it’s also important to consider, on behalf of taxpayers, the amount of government expenditure undertaken to achieve a given level of success. For example, New York spends the most money per student ($22,232), almost twice as much as the typical state. Yet that massive expenditure results in a rank of only 31 in Table 1. Tennessee, on the other hand, achieves a similar level of success (ranked 30th) and spends only $8,739 per student. Although the two states appear to have education systems of similar quality, the citizens of Tennessee are getting far more bang for the buck.



To show the spending efficiency of a state’s school system, Figure 1 plots per student expenditures on the horizontal axis against student performance on the vertical axis. Notice that New York and Tennessee are at about the same height but that New York is much farther to the right.



 **Figure 1**

The most efficient educational systems are seen in the upper-left corner of Figure 1, where systems are high quality and inexpensive. The least efficient systems are found in the lower right. From casual examination of Figure 1, it appears likely that some states are not using education funds efficiently.



Because spending values are nominal—that is, not adjusted for cost-of-living differences across states—using unadjusted spending figures might disadvantage high-cost states, in which above-average education costs may reflect price differences rather than more extravagent spending. For this reason, we also calculate a ranking based on education quality per adjusted dollar of expenditure, where the adjustment controls for statewide differences in the cost of living (COL).22. The COL-adjusted rankings are probably the rankings that best reflect how efficiently states are providing education. Adjusting for COL has a large effect on high-cost states such as Hawaii, California, and D.C. Table 2 presents two spending-efficiency rankings of states that capture how well their heterogeneous students do on NAEP exams in comparison to how much the state spends to achieve those rankings. These rankings are calculated by taking a slightly revised version of the state’s z-score and dividing it by the nominal dollar amount of educational expenditure or by the COL-adjusted educational expenditure made by the state.23. These adjustments lower the rank of states like New York, which spends a great deal for mediocre performance, and increase the rank of states like Tennessee, which achieves similar performance at a much lower cost. Massachusetts and New Jersey, which impart a good deal of knowledge to their students, do so in such a costly manner using nominal values that they fall out of the top 20, although Massachusetts, having a higher cost of living, remains in the top 20 when the cost of living adjustment is made. States like Idaho and Utah, which achieve only mediocre success in imparting knowledge to students, do it so inexpensively that they move up near the top 10.



 **Table 2**  
 **State rankings adjusted for student heterogeneity and expenditures**

The top of the efficiency ranking is dominated by states in the South and Southwest. This result is quite a difference from the traditional rankings.



The correlation between these spending efficiency rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings drops to –0.14 and –0.06 for the nominal and COL-adjusted efficiency rankings, respectively. This drop is not surprising since the rankings in Table 2 treat expenditures as something to be economized on, whereas the _U.S. News_ rankings don’t consider K–12 expenditures at all (and other rankings consider higher expenditures purely as a plus factor). The correlations of the Table 1 quality rankings and Table 2 efficiency rankings, with nominal and adjusted expenditures, are 0.54 and 0.65, respectively. This indicates that accounting for the efficiency of expenditures substantially alters the rankings, although somewhat less so when the cost of living is adjusted for. This higher correlation for the COL rankings makes sense because high-cost states devoting the same share of resources as the typical state would be expected to spend above-average nominal dollars, and the COL adjustment reflects that.



Our data allow us to make a brief analysis of some factors that might be related to student performance in states. Our candidate factors are expenditure per student (either nominal or COL adjusted), student-teacher ratios, the strength of teacher unions, the share of students in private schools, and the share in charter schools.24. The expenditure per student variable is considered in a quad­ratic form since diminishing marginal returns is a common expectation in economic theory.



Table 3 presents the summary statistics for these variables. The average z-score is close to zero, which is to be expected.25. Nominal expenditure per student ranges from $6,837 to $22,232, with the COL-adjusted values having a somewhat smaller range. The union strength variable is merely a ranking from 1 to 51, with 51 being the state with the most powerful union effect. The number of students per teacher ranges from a low of 10.54 to a high of 23.63. The other variables are self-explanatory.

We use multiple regression analysis to measure the relationship between these variables and our (dependent) variable—the average z-scores drawn from state NAEP test scores in the 24 categories mentioned above. Regression analysis can show how variables are related to one another but cannot demonstrate whether there is causality between a pair of variables where changes in one variable lead to changes in another variable.



Table 4 provides the regression results using COL expenditures (results on the left) or using nominal expenditures (results on the right). To save space, we only include the coefficients and p-values, the latter of which, when subtracted from one, provides statistical confidence levels. Those coefficients for variables that were statistically significant are marked with asterisks (one asterisk indicates a 90 percent confidence level and two a level of 95 percent).

The choice of nominal vs. COL expenditures leads to a large difference in the results. The COL-adjusted results are likely to lead to a greater number of correct conclusions.



Nominal expenditures per student are related in a positive and statistically significant manner to student performance up to a point, but the positive effect of expenditures per student declines as expenditures per student increase. The coefficients on the two expenditure-per-student variables indicate that additional nominal spending is no longer related to performance when nominal spending gets to a level of $18,500 per student, a level that is exceeded by only a handful of states.26. The predicted decline in student performance for the few states exceeding the $18,500 limit, assuming causality from spending to performance, is quite small (approximately two rank positions for the state with the largest expenditure),27. so that this evidence is best interpreted as supporting a view that the states with the highest spending have reached a saturation point beyond which no more gains can be made.28.



Using COL-adjusted values, however, starkly changes results. With COL values, no significant relationship is found between spending and student performance, either in magnitude or statistical significance. This does not necessarily imply that spending overall has no effect on outcomes (assuming causality), but merely that most states have reached a sufficient level of spending such that additional spending does not appear to be related to achievement as measured by these test scores. This is a different conclusion from that based on nominal expenditures. These different results imply that care must be taken, not just to ensure that achievement test scores are disaggregated in analyses of educational performance, but also that if expenditures are used in such analyses, they are adjusted for cost of living differentials.



The union strength variable in Table 4 has a substantial and statistically significant negative relationship with student achievement. The coefficient in the nominal expenditure regressions suggests a relationship such that if a state went from having the weakest unions to the strongest unions, holding the other education factors constant, that state would have a decrease in its z-score of over 1.22 (0.024 × 51). To put this in perspective, note in Table 3 that the z-scores vary from a high of 1.22 to a low of –1.51, a range of 2.73. Thus, the shift from weakest to strongest unions would move a state down about 45 percent of the way through this total range, or equivalently, alter the rank of the state by about 23 positions.29. This is a dramatic result. The COL regressions also show a large relationship, but it is only about half the magnitude of the coefficient in the nominal expenditure regressions. This negative relationship suggests an obvious interpretation. It is well known that teachers’ unions aim to increase wages for their members, which may increase student performance if higher quality teachers are drawn to the higher salaries. Such a hypothesis is inconsistent with the finding here, which is instead consistent with the view that unions are negatively related to student performance, presumably by opposing the removal of underperforming teachers, opposing merit-based pay, or because of union work rules. While much of the empirical literature finds positive relationships between unionization and student performance, studies that most effectively control for heterogeneous student populations, as we have, tend to find more negative relationships, such as those found here.30.



Our results also indicate that having a greater share of students in charter schools is positively related to student achievement, with the result being statistically significant in the COL regressions but not in the nominal expenditure regressions. The size of the relationship is fairly small, however, indicating, if the relationship were causal, that when a state increases its share of students in charter schools from 0 to 50 percent (slightly above the level of the highest observation) it would be expected to have an increase in rank of only 0.9 positions (0.5 × 1.8) in the COL regression and about half of that in the nominal expenditure regressions (where the coefficient is not statistically significant).31. Given that there is great heterogeneity in charter schools both within and between states, it is not surprising that our rather simple statistical approach does not find much of a relationship.



We also find that the share of students in private schools has a small negative relationship with the performance of students in public schools, but the level of statistical confidence is far too low for these results to be given any credence. (Although private school students take the NAEP exam, the NAEP data we use are based only on public school students.) Similarly, the existence of vouchers appears to have a negative relationship to achievement, but the high p-values tell us we cannot have confidence in those results.



There is some slight evidence, based on the COL regression, that higher student-teacher ratios have a small negative relationship with student performance, but the level of statistical confidence is below normally accepted levels. Though having more students per teacher is theorized to be negatively related to student performance, the empirical literature largely fails to find consistent effects of student-teacher ratios and class size on student performance.32. We should not be too surprised that student-teacher ratios do not appear to have a clear relationship with learning since the student-teacher ratios used here are aggregated for entire states, merging together many different classrooms in elementary, middle, and high schools.



Although this study constitutes a significant improvement on leading state education rankings, it retains some of their limitations.



If the makers of state education rankings were to be frank, they would acknowledge that the entire enterprise of ranking state-level systems is only a blunt instrument for judging school quality. There exists substantial variation in educational quality within states. Schools differ from district to district and within districts. We generally dislike the idea of painting the performance of all schools in a given state with the same brush. However, state-level rankings do provide an intuitively pleasing basis for lawmakers and interested citizens to compare state education policies. Because state rankings currently play such a prominent role in the public debate on education policy, their more glaring methodological defects detailed above demand rectification. Any state ranking is nonetheless limited by aggregation inherent at the state-level unit of analysis.



Another limitation to our study, common to virtually all state education rankings, is that we treat the result of education as a one-dimensional variable. Of course, educational results are multifaceted and more complex than a single measure could capture. A standardized test may not pick up potentially important qualities such as creativity, critical thinking, or grit. Part of the problem is that there is no accepted measurement of those attributes.



We also are using a data snapshot that reflects measures of learning at a particular moment in time. However, the performance of students at any grade level depends on their education at all prior grade levels. A ranking of states based on student performance is the culmination of learning over a lengthy time period. An implicit assumption in creating such rankings is that the quality of various school systems changes slowly enough for a snapshot in one year to convey meaningful information about the school system as it exists over the entire interval in which learning occurred. This assumption allows us to attribute current or recent student performance, which is largely based on past years of teaching, to the teaching quality currently found in these schools. This assumption is present in most state rankings but may obscure sudden and significant improvement, or deterioration, in student knowledge that occurs in discrete years.



While the state level may be too aggregated a unit of analysis for the optimal examination of educational outcomes, state rankings are frequently used and discussed. Whether based appropriately on learning outcomes or inappropriately on nonlearning factors, comparisons between states greatly influence the public discourse on education. When these rankings fail to account for the heterogeneity of student populations, however, they skew results in favor of states with fewer socioeconomically challenged students.



Our ranking corrects these problems by focusing on outputs and the value added to each of the demographic groups the state education system serves. Furthermore, we consider the cost-effectiveness of education spending in U.S. states. States that spend efficiently should be recognized as more successful than states paying larger sums for similar or worse outcomes.



Adjusting for the heterogeneity of students has a powerful effect on the assessments of how well states educate their students. Certain southern and western states, such as Florida and Texas, have much better student performances than appears to be the case when student heterogeneity is not taken into account. Other states, such as Maine and Rhode Island in New England, fall substantially. These results run counter to conventional wisdom that the best education is found in northern and eastern states with powerful unions and high expenditures.



This difference is even more pronounced when spending efficiency, a factor generally neglected in conventional rankings, is taken into account. Florida, Texas, and Virginia are seen to be the most efficient in terms of quality achieved per COL-adjusted dollar spent. Conversely, West Virginia, Alabama, and Maine are the least efficient. Some states that do an excellent job educating students, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, also spend quite lavishly and thus fall considerably when spending efficiency is considered.



Finally, we examine some factors thought to influence student performance. We find evidence that state spending appears to have reached a point of zero returns and that unionization is negatively related to student performance, and some evidence that charter schools may have a small positive relationship to student achievement. We find little evidence that class size, vouchers, or the share of students in private schools have measurable effects on state performance.



Which state education systems are worth emulating and which are not? The conventional answer to this question deserves to be reevaluated in light of the results presented in this report. We hope that our rankings will better inform pundits, policymakers, and activists as they seek to improve K–12 education.



Conventional education-ranking methodologies based on NAEP achievement tests are likely to skew results. In this Appendix, we provide a simple example of how and why that happens.



Our example assumes two types of students and three types of schools (or state school systems). The two columns on the right in appendix Table 1 denote different types of student, and each row represents a different school. School B is assumed to be 10 percent better than School A, and School C is assumed to be 20 percent better than School A, regardless of the student type being educated.



There are two types of students; S2 students are better prepared than S1 students. Students of the same type score differently on standard exams depending on which school they are in, but the two student types also perform differently from each other no matter which school they attend. Depending on the proportions of each type of student in a given school, a school’s rank may vary substantially if the wrong methodology is used.

An informative ranking should reflect each school’s relative performance, and the scores on which the rankings are based should reflect the 10 percent difference between School A and School B, and the 20 percent difference between School A and School C. Obviously, a reliable ranking mechanism should place School A in 3rd place, B in 2nd, and C in 1st.



However, problems arise for the typical ranking procedure when schools have different proportions of student types. The appendix Table 2 shows results from a typical ranking procedure under two different population scenarios.



School ranking 1 shows what happens when 75 percent of School A’s students are type S2 and 25 percent are type S1; School B’s students are split 50-50 between types S1 and S2; and School C’s students are 75 percent type S1 and 25 percent type S2.33.



Because School A has a disproportionately large share of the stronger S2 students, it scores above the other two schools even though School A is the weakest school. Ranking 1 completely inverts the correct ranking of schools. This example, detailed in appendix Table 2, demonstrates how rankings that do not take the heterogeneity of students and the proportions of each type of student in each school into account can give entirely misleading results.

 **Rankings not accounting for heterogeneity**

Conversely, school ranking 2 reverses the student populations of schools A and C. School C now also has more of the strongest students. The rankings are correctly ordered, but the underlying data used for the rankings greatly exaggerate the superiority of School C. Comparing the scores of the three schools, School B appears to be 32 percent better than School A and School C appears to be 68 percent better than School A, even though we know (by construction) that the correct values are 10 percent and 20 percent, respectively. School ranking 2 only happens to get the order right because there are no intermediary schools whose rankings would be improperly altered by the exaggerated scores of schools A and C in ranking 2.



The ranking methodology used in this paper, by contrast, compares each school for each type of student separately. It measures quality by looking at the numbers in appendix Table 1 and noting that each type of student at School B scores 10 percent higher than the same type of student at School A, and each type of student at School C scores 20 percent higher than the same type of student at School A. That is what makes our methodology conceptually superior to prior methodologies.



If all schools happened to have the same share of different types of students, a possibility not shown in appendix Table 2, the conventional ranking methodology used by _U.S. News_ would work as well as our rankings. But our analysis in this paper has shown that schools and school systems in the real world have very different student populations, which is why our rankings differ so much from previous rankings. Our general methodology isn’t just hypothetically better under certain demographic assumptions; rather, it is better under any and all demographic circumstances.

4. We are aware of an earlier discussion by Dave Burge in a March 2, 2011, posting on his “Iowahawk” blog, discussing the mismatch between state K–12 rankings with and without accounting for heterogeneous student populations, http://iowahawk.typepad.com/iowahawk/2011/03/longhorns-17-badgers-1.html. A 2015 report by Matthew M. Chingos, “Breaking the Curve,” https://www.urban.org/research/publication/breaking-curve-promises-and-pitfalls-using-naep-data-assess-state-role-student-achievement, published by the Urban Institute, is a more complete discussion of the problems of aggregation and presents on a separate webpage updated rankings of states that are similar to ours, but it does not discuss the nature of the differences between its rankings and the more traditional rankings. Chingos uses more controls than just ethnicity, but the extra controls have only minor effects on the rankings. He also uses the more complete “restricted use” data set from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), whereas we use the less complete but more readily available public NAEP data. One advantage of our analysis, in a society obsessed with STEM proficiency, is that we use the science test in addition to math and reading, whereas Chingos only uses math and reading.



5. For a recent example of the spending hypothesis see Paul Krugman, “We Don’t Need No Education,” New York Times, April 23, 2018. Krugman approvingly cites California and New York as positive examples of states that have considerably raised teacher pay over the last two decades, implying that such states would do a better job educating students. As noted in this paper, both states rank below average in educating their students.



6. We assume, as do other rankings that use NAEP data, that the NAEP tests assess student performance on material that students should be learning and therefore reflect the success of a school system in educating its students. It is of course possible that standardized tests do not correctly measure educational success. This would be a particular problem if some schools alter their teaching to focus on doing well on those tests while other schools do not. We think this is less of a problem for NAEP tests because most grades and most teachers are not included in the sample, meaning that when teacher pay and school funding are tied to performance on standardized tests, they will be tied to tests other than NAEP.



7. Since 1969, the NAEP test has been administered by the National Center for Education Statistics within the U.S. Department of Education. Results are released annually as “the nation’s report card.” Tests in several subjects are administered to 4th, 8th, and sometimes 12th graders. Not every state is given every test in every year, but all states take the math and reading tests at least every two years. The National Assessment Governing Board determines which test subjects will be administered each year. In the analysis below, we use the most recent data for math and reading tests, from 2017, and the science test is from 2015. NAEP tests are not given to every student in every state, but rather, results are drawn from a sample. Tests are given to a sample of students within each jurisdiction, selected at random from schools chosen so as to reflect the overall demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the jurisdiction. Roughly 20–40 students are tested from each selected school. In a combined national and state sample, there are approximately 3,000 students per participating jurisdiction from approximately 100 schools. NAEP 8th grade test scores are a component of _U.S. News_ ’ state K–12 education rankings, but are highly aggregated. 



8. As direct measures of student learning for the entire student body, NAEP scores should form the basis of any state rankings of education. Nevertheless, rankings such as _U.S. News_ ’ include not only NAEP scores, but other variables that do not measure learning, such as graduation rates, pre-K education quality/enrollment, and ACT/SAT scores, which measure learning but are not, in many cases, taken by all students in a state and are likely to be highly correlated with NAEP scores. We believe that these other measures do not belong in a ranking of state education quality.



9. “Quality Counts 2018: Grading the States,” _Education Week_ , January 2018, https://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/quality-counts-2018-state-grades/index.html. The three broad components used in this ranking include “chance for success,” “state finances,” and “K–12 achievement.”



10. Informed by such rankings, it’s no wonder the public debate on education typically assumes more spending is always better, even in the absence of corresponding improvements in student outcomes.



11. NAEP data also include scores for the ethnic categories “American Indian/Native Alaskan,” and “Two or More.” However, too few states had sufficient data for these scores to be a reliable indicator of the performance of these groups in that state. These populations are small enough in number to exclude from our analysis.



12. Not all states give all the tests (e.g., science test) to their students. While every state must have students take the math and reading tests at least every two years, the National Assessment Governing Board determines which other tests will be given to which states.



13. Because Iowa lacks enough Asian fourth and eighth grade students to provide a reliable average from the NAEP sample, NAEP does not have scores for Asian fourth graders in any subject or Asian eighth graders in science. This lowers the number of possible tests in Iowa from 24 to 20.



14. Our rankings assume that students in each ethnic group are similar across states. Although this assumption may not always be correct, it is more realistic than the assumption made in other rankings that the entire student population is similar across states.



15. For example, Washington, Utah, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Nebraska, and Minnesota also shut out Texas on all six tests (math, reading, science, 4th and 8th grades) under the assumption of homogeneous student populations. Nevertheless, Texas dominates all these states when comparisons are made using the full set of 24 exams that allow for student heterogeneity. Six states change by more than 24 positions depending on whether they are ranked using aggregated or disaggregated NAEP scores.



16. There are other categories in the NAEP data not directly related to race. Several of these (e.g., disability status, English language learner status, gender) have only minuscule effects on rankings and thus are ignored in our analysis. Among these nonracial factors, the most important is whether the student qualifies for subsidized school lunches, a proxy for family income. We do not include this variable in our analysis because the income requirements determining which students qualify for subsidized lunches are the same for all states in the contiguous United States, despite considerable differences in cost of living between jurisdictions. High cost of living states can have costs 85 percent higher than low cost of living states. High cost of living states will have fewer students qualify for subsidized lunches, and low cost of living states will have more students qualify than would be the case if cost of living adjustments were made. Because the distribution of cost of living values across states is not symmetrical, the difference in scores between students with subsidized lunches and students without, across states, is likely to be biased. This bias is pertinent to our examination of state education systems and student performance, so we exclude it from our analysis. Its inclusion would only have had a minor effect on our rankings, however, since the correlation between a state ranking that includes this variable (at half the importance of the four equally weighted ethnicity variables) with one that excludes it is 0.92. A different nonracial variable is the parents’ education level, but this variable has the deficiency of only being available for eighth grade and not fourth grade students.



17. While we would have preferred to include test scores for 12th grade students, the data were not sufficiently complete to do so. While the NAEP test is given to 12th graders, it was only given to a national sample of students in 2015, and the most recent state averages available are from 2013. Even these 2013 state averages did not have a sufficient number of students from many of the ethnic groups we consider, and many states lacked a large number of observations. Because of the relatively incomplete data for 12th graders, we chose to include only 4th and 8th grade test scores. Note that _U.S. News_ only includes state averages for 8th grade math and reading tests in their rankings.



18. When states do not report scores for each of the 24 NAEP categories, those states have their average scores calculated based on the exams that are reported.



19. We equate the importance of each of the 24 tests by forming, for each of the 24 possible exams, a z-score for each state, under the assumption that these state test scores have a normal distribution. The z-statistic for each observation is the difference between a particular state’s test score and the average score for all states, divided by the standard deviation of those scores over the states. Our overall ranking is merely the average z-score for each state. Thus, exams with greater variations or higher or lower mean scores do not have greater weight than any other test in our sample. The z-score measures how many standard deviations a state is above or below the mean score calculated over all states. One might argue that we should use an average weighted by the share of students, but we choose to give each group equal importance. If we had used population weights, the rankings would not have changed very much because the correlation between the two sets of scores is 0.86, and four of the top-five and four of the bottom-five states remain the same.



20. Without listing all of Florida’s 24 scores, its lowest 5 (out of the 51 states, in reverse order) are ranked 27, 21, 20, 19, and 10. The rest are all ranked in the top 10, with 12 of Florida’s test scores among the top 5 states.



21. Some 89 percent are college educated. See for example, David Alpert, “DC Has Almost No White Residents without College Degrees,” GGW.org, August 29, 2016, https://ggwash.org/view/42563/dc-has-almost-no-white-residents-without-college-degrees-its-a-different-story-for-black-residents.



22. The statewide cost of living adjustments are taken from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center’s Cost of Living Data Series 2017 Annual Average, https://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living.



23. It would be a mistake to use straightforward z-scores from Table 1 when constructing the “z-Score/$” variable because states with z-scores near zero and thus near one another would hardly differ even if their expenditures per student were very different. Instead, we added 2.50 to each z-score so that all states have positive z-scores and the lowest state would have a revised z-score of 1. We then divided each state’s revised z-score by the expenditure per student to arrive at the values shown in Table 2.



24. Data on expenditures, student-teacher ratios, and share of students in charter schools are taken from the National Center for Education Statistics’ _Digest of Education Statistics_. Data on share of students in private schools come from the NCES’s Private School Universe Survey. Our variable for unionization is a 2012 ranking of states constructed by researchers at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education research organization, that used 37 different variables in five broad categories (Resources and Membership, Involvement in Politics, Scope in Bargaining, State Policies, and Perceived Influence). The ranking can be found in Amber M. Winkler, Janie Scull, and Dara Zeehandelaar, “How Strong Are Teacher Unions? A State-By-State Comparison,” Thomas B. Fordham Institute and Education Reform Now, 2012, https://edexcellence.net/publications/how-strong-are-us-teacher-unions.html.



25. Because many states had results for fewer than 24 exams, giving each state equal weight in the overall average would not provide the zero “average” that would be expected if the average of every z-score were used to form the average. There were also some rounding errors.



26. New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Alaska, and New York all exceed this level.



27. The decline is 0.15 z-units, which is about 5 percent of the total z-score range.



28. We should also note that efficient use of money requires that it be spent up until the point where the marginal value of the benefits is less than the marginal expenditure. Thus, the point where increasing expenditures provides no additional value cannot be the efficient level of expenditure. Instead, the efficient level of expenditure must lie below that amount.



29. This is a somewhat rough approximation because the ranks form a uniform distribution and the z-scores form a normal distribution with the mass of observations near the mean. A movement of a given z-distance will change ranks more if the movement occurs near the mean than if the movement occurs near the tails.



30. For a review of the literature on unionization and student performance, see Joshua M. Cowen and Katharine O. Strunk, “The Impact of Teachers’ Unions on Educational Outcomes: What We Know and What We Need to Learn,” _Economics of Education Review_ 48 (2015): 208–23. Earlier studies found positive effects of unionization, but recent studies are more mixed. Most researchers agree that unionization likely affects different types of students differently. For studies that find unionization negatively affects student performance, see Caroline Minter Hoxby, “How Teachers’ Unions Affect Education Production,” _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 111, no. 3 (1996): 671–718, https://doi.org/10.2307/2946669; and Geeta Kingdom and Francis Teal, “Teacher Unions, Teacher Pay and Student Performance in India: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach,” _Journal of Development_ Economics 91, no. 2 (2010): 278–88, https://doi.org/10.1016/j. jdeveco.2009.09.001 For studies that find no effect of unionization, see Michael F. Lovenheim, “The Effect of Teachers’ Unions on Education Production: Evidence from Union Election Certifications in Three Midwestern States,” _Journal of Labor Economics_ 27, no. 4 (2009): 525–87, https://doi.org/10.1086/605653. More recently, only very small negative effects on student performance were found in Bradley D. Mariano and Katharine O. Strunk, “The Bad End of the Bargain? Revisiting the Relationship between Collective Bargaining Agreements and Student Achievement,” _Economics of Education Review_ 65 (2018): 93–106, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.04.006.



31. To arrive at this value, we multiply the coefficient (1.96) by 50 percent to determine the change in z-score and then divide by 2.73, the range of z-scores among the states. This provides a value of 35.5 percent, indicating how much of the range in z-scores would be traversed as a result of the change in charter school students. This value is then multiplied by 51 states in the analysis.



32. For a discussion on the empirical literature regarding school class size, see Edward P. Lazear, “Educational Production,” _Quarterly_ _Journal of Economics_ 116, no. 3 (2001): 777–803, https://doi.org/10.1162/00335530152466232. Lazear suggests that differing student and teacher characteristics make it difficult to isolate the effect of class size on student outcomes. This view, although spun in a more positive light, generally is supported in a more recent summary of the academic literature found in Grover J. Whitehurst and Matthew M. Chingos, “Class Size: What Research Says and Why It Matters for State Policy,” Brown Center on Education Policy, Brookings Institution, May 2011, https://www.brookings.edu/research/class-size-what-research-says-and-what-it-means-for-state-policy/.



33. The score column in appendix Table 2 merely multiplies the score for each type of student at a school by the share of the student type in the school population and sums the amounts. For example, the 87.5 value for School A in ranking 1 is found by multiplying the S1 score of 50 by .25 (=12.5) and adding that to the product of the population share of S2 (0.75) and the S2 score of 100 (=75) in School A. This method is effectively what _U.S. News_ and other conventional rankings use.

"LIKE it or not, winter is coming. Apart from layering up, you can turn to your phone to help you brave the rain, wind or snow ahead. Weather apps are abundant in mobile app stores, and my new favorite is Fire + Rain. Unlike many other weather apps, it keeps weather data simple. Built on information from the Weather Network, the app’s display is streamlined and easy to understand. The screen’s color corresponds with the forecast, and the temperature is displayed in large type. Alongside this are a small icon and a simple phrase describing the weather, like “light rain” or “cloudy with showers. ” You get, at a glance, everything you need to know about the coming weather where you are. Swipe down the screen to see hourly and daily forecasts tap to swap between a   detailed forecast and a   forecast. If you see the words “heavy snow” in tomorrow morning’s forecast, you’ll know to make the necessary preparations tonight. Fire + Rain is free on iOS. For people who like detailed weather forecasts, there is RainAware. This app belongs to the new breed of weather apps that try to deliver extremely accurate weather data based on the time and your precise location. The app uses GPS to detect where you are, and then it pulls forecast data from its system, including detailed radar scans. Instead of the typical approximation other weather apps might offer, like “50 percent chance of storms,” RainAware has concrete alerts, like “It’s going to rain in 30 minutes. ” The app’s radar maps are also neat: They show how rain clouds are moving near you and predict where they will go next, so you can see how the weather is going to change. RainAware has a lot of features, including a weather clock showing the forecast in   increments, so it may take some getting used to. But it’s an excellent option. It costs $5 on iOS and $4 on Android. Another app, Storm Radar from Weather Underground, is a source that television weather forecasters consult before they step in front of the camera. This weather app has   radar maps and   algorithms to figure out if you are in the path of a nearby weather event. It even has lightning alerts for a   radius around your location. Data on variables like dew point and humidity can be viewed as colored patterns on a map, or as graphs or charts. You can also get highly localized weather alerts  —   for example, the app told me there were two “coastal event” alerts as high winds and high tides threatened the seafront zone near my home. If you prefer a   forecast, Storm Radar offers that too. There is a lot to discover in this app, and if you plan to use it you may need to spend some time on Google to get a full understanding of what all the data means. But it is free on iOS, and its interface is both attractive and easy to interact with. MeteoEarth, another scientific weather forecast app, shows animated maps that contain a wealth of forecasting information for your location. The maps can show data on rainfall, wind, temperature and pressure, and can even track tropical storms. The app also offers access to live weather webcams around the world that give a sense of the conditions in a particular location. MeteoEarth takes some figuring out, but its slick graphical interface is satisfying to use. It’s free on iOS and Android. Lastly, it may be worth keeping the free FEMA app (iOS, Android) on your phone in case your home is subjected to the worst of the winter weather. In addition to an alert system from the National Weather Service, the app offers guidance about what to do before, during and after a disaster. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has been making television programs about the wonders of life for 60 years, and now over 1, 000 clips from his body of work are available in a new app: Attenborough’s Story of Life (free on iOS, Android). Browse it with your children and enjoy learning about nature from the soothing voice of Sir David himself."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more volatile supply wind and solar energy that comes online in Germany, the more insane the market prices become. Too often the wind blows and the sun shines when power is unneeded, or they are simply AWOL when demand is high like in the wintertime.

Germany’s wildly fluctuating wind and solar energy are creating grid and market havoc. Source: Agora.
Earlier this month Germany saw a spate of both sunny, windy days, thus leading to huge power grid surges during the Ascension holiday weekend, a time when many factories were running close to idled (see chart above).
Despite billions annually in subsidies, wind and sun still puny
And for a few minutes last Pentecost Monday afternoon – a holiday that saw very low national electricity demand – wind and solar provided almost enough power to cover all of the country’s electricity needs, reported Die Welt here. Leading Greens cheered, and proclaimed that coal and nuclear had not been needed for a time. But they cheered “too early” writes Die Welt’s business journalist Daniel Wetzel, pointing out that market and technical conditions became dangerously precarious and that in total “electricity represents only 21% of Germany’s total energy need.”
While Germany’s installed solar and wind energy may be able to get fairly close to fulfilling total electricity demand for a few minutes in rare instances that weather and demand conditions are just right, their share of total primary energy is still depressingly measly. Die Welt puts it all in true perspective:
Despite billions in subsidies, ‘renewable energies’ wind and sun covered only 3.7% of Germany’s primary energy needs last year.”
Negative wholesale prices becoming rampant

Another debilitating feature of the weather-dependent renewable energies are the havoc they create on the electricity exchanges. Last week’s power grid overloading by wind and sun led to deep negative wholesale prices.
Spiegel here writes that the wholesale power price plummeted to -130 euros per megawatt (see blue curve in the right chart)! Literally, foreign consumers were being paid to take the power. (The black curve shows total German demand).
Moreover the phenomenon of negative wholesale prices (i.e. excessive power feeding uncontrollably into the grid) occurred a record 25 times in 2015, Spiegel writes. That was 4 times more often than in 2011.
Among the highest electricity prices in the world
With wholesale electricity prices dipping into negative territory, one might think that power must be very cheap for the consumer. Unfortunately this is not the case. At negative prices power companies lose money, and so are then forced to pass along these extra costs along to the end consumers. German consumers are paying close to €0.30 for each kilowatt-hour they consume – among the highest in the world.
The situation has gotten so alarming that leading politicians of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU conservative party are now demanding an end to subsidies for new wind and solar installations.
Denmark slams brakes on wind projects
Not only Germany is struggling with wildly fluctuating grid and market conditions, which are leading to massive costs and pain for consumers, but so is Denmark. Die Welt writes:
The situation has also led wind energy leader Denmark to a rethinking. Press reports say that Energy Minister Lars Christian Lilleholt has stopped the planned construction of five large offshore wind farms in order to protect consumers from large cost increases.”

"**The US National Basketball Association (NBA) has defended free speech amid a row with China over a team executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protests.**
The tweet posted by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, caused uproar in China and his attempt to backtrack upset American fans.
But NBA boss Adam Silver defended Mr Morey and said the league would ""support freedom of expression"".
NBA games draw huge viewership in China, mainly via streaming platforms.
The Rockets have been popular there since the team signed Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002. Mr Yao now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).
But Mr Morey's tweet prompted a furious backlash in China, with broadcasters vowing to stop airing Rockets games.
They went further on Tuesday by scrapping plans to broadcast two NBA pre-season games being played in China.
The NBA is just the latest international business to be embroiled in controversy in both China and the US over the Hong Kong protests. But the organisation's strong defence of freedom of expression is unusual.
On Friday, Mr Morey posted a tweet with an image captioned: ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.""
He was referencing months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
Chinese officials and media have reacted furiously to foreign expressions of support for the protesters and accused the West of interfering in Chinese affairs.
In response to Mr Morey's tweet, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.
On Sunday the CBA suspended co-operation with the team, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
On Monday, Mr Morey deleted the tweet and said: ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.""
""I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors,"" he added.
But American fans reacted angrily to his apology, with one tweet saying: ""You shouldn't have to apologise for supporting freedom.""
On Tuesday Mr Silver issued a statement saying: ""The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.""
He later told reporters in Japan that the league would not compromise its values on freedom of speech and was motivated by more than money.
The NBA commissioner said he understood there would be consequences but that ""we will have to live with those consequences.""
He said he would travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and meet the officials to try to ""find mutual respect"". But he recognised that ""this issue might not die down so quickly"".
His defence of free speech in the face of Chinese anger is seen as a bold move, given the potential financial impact for the NBA.
""The vast majority of foreign companies apologize profusely at the first sign of discontent from Chinese consumers, which makes the NBA's response all the more remarkable,"" tweeted Mark Dreyer, an expert on China's sports industry.
Initially the Rockets and the NBA distanced themselves from Mr Morley's tweet. This provoked accusations from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the league was bowing to Beijing.
Former US presidential hopeful - and Rockets fan - Ted Cruz accused the NBA of ""shamefully retreating"" in pursuit of profit.
Mr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey ""call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong"".
Fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse called the NBA's response ""shameful"".
Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro tweeted that the US must ""not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government"".
Also on Tuesday, a Hong-Kong professional gamer was banned by game-maker Blizzard from competing for 12 months for staging an anti-government protest.
Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.
In September, Zara became a target of anger on Chinese social media after some of its Hong Kong stores closed on a day of strike action.
China accused the retailer of encouraging its employees to join the strike but Zara said it was just ensuring its shops were not understaffed if transport was disrupted.
In August the chief executive of airline Cathay Pacific stood down after the company shifted its stance on whether employees could join protests.
And in the same month Versace had to apologise to China after one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories."

The former U.S. vice president, Al Gore, is now urging civil disobedience to stop coal plants. He told a New York audience recently, “If you’re a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.”

We are told the globe is rapidly and dangerously warming, and that this rapid and dangerous warming has been predominantly caused by the steep rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions that began about the mid-1940s.
We even have a widely-recognized “hockey stick” graph of the Northern Hemisphere — created by Michael Mann in the late 1990s and popularized by the IPCC (2001) — to “prove” that modern warming has been synchronously global in scale, as well as rapid, dangerous, and perhaps even unprecedented (“the warmest on record”).
There is a problem with this paradigm, however.  An enormous problem.
That is, when scientists reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SST) and land surface temperatures and deep ocean heat content from the paleoclimate record (hundreds to thousands of years ago) using existing physical proxy evidence, and when they use this same physical evidence to reconstruct the modern temperatures, the rapid and dangerous warming trend that mysteriously forms a hockey stick shape for recent decades seems to just . . . disappear.  In its place is a modern record of temperatures from locations all over the world that does not even come close to resembling a rapidly warming, dangerous, and unprecedented hockey stick.  Instead, the paleoclimate record reveals the opposite.  Large regions of the Earth were significantly warmer than they are now for most of the last several thousand years.
Below is a compilation of 50 temperature graphs from peer-reviewed scientific papers.  Some graphs indicate that (a) post-1940s temperatures actually declined in many regions of the world rather than rose rapidly — the opposite of what climate models had predicted.   All the graphs show that (b) modern (post-1940s) temperatures aren’t any warmer than the decades and centuries and millennia prior to the steep increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and in some locations even the Little Ice Age temperatures (1400s to 1800s AD) were warmer than modern.  Finally, these 50 graphs clearly show that (c) the conceptualization of global-scale warming, or a globally synchronous rise in temperatures for the vast majority of the Earth’s land and oceanic locations in modern times . . . is not scientifically supportable. 
In many parts of the world, today’s temperatures are still among the coldest they’ve been in the last several thousand years.   Sea levels, in turn, are at some of the lowest levels of the last 8,000 years; relative sea levels were 1 to 4 meters higher than they are now just a few thousand years ago.  Where warming has occurred, it’s been modest and slight, not rapid and dangerous.  Perhaps this is why  the “hide the decline” phenomenon became so necessary for hockey stick-favoring reconstructionists.

"Mary Tyler Moore, whose iconic television roles reflected the changing place of women in   America, died on Wednesday, eliciting an outpouring of tributes on social media. Dick Van Dyke, who played Ms. Moore’s husband in the 1960s sitcom “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” said on Twitter that Ms. Moore had changed his life for the better. Other former   and   friends also shared their grief and gratitude online. They included the actors Ed Asner, who played her boss at a local television station in the 1970s sitcom “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, who   with her in the 1996 movie “Flirting With Disaster,” and Michael Keaton, who appeared on her   variety show “Mary. ” Some remembered Ms. Moore as a role model who portrayed strong female characters onscreen. They included Oprah Winfrey, who has said she grew up inspired by Ms. Moore, as well as Ellen Degeneres, Marlee Matlin and George Takei, all of whom described Ms. Moore as a trailblazer. The comedian and actor Stephen Fry said he was rehearsing on Wednesday at the stage where “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” was produced, adding that he and others observed a minute of silence in her honor. Female journalists felt a special affinity for Ms. Moore, who starred in that show as Mary Richards, a news producer at a Minneapolis television station."

The federal government spends more than $20 billion a year on subsidies for farm businesses. About 39 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms receive direct subsidies, with the lion’s share of the handouts going to the largest producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice.1



The current farm law — enacted in 2014 — added new crop programs that have turned out to be more costly than promised. The law expires this year, and subsidy proponents are eager for Congress to pass another expensive bill. But farm subsidies impose a burden on federal taxpayers, and they harm the economy. President Donald Trump proposed cuts to farm programs in the 2019 federal budget, but the longer‐​term goal should be to fully repeal all farm subsidies.



This report provides background for the upcoming farm bill debate. It suggests that agriculture is no riskier than other industries and that it does not need an array of federal subsidies. The government protects farmers against fluctuations in prices, revenues, and yields. It subsidizes their conservation efforts, insurance coverage, marketing, export sales, research, and other activities. Federal coddling of the agriculture industry is deep and comprehensive.



Farm subsidies are costly to taxpayers, but they also harm the economy and the environment. Subsidies distort the decisions made by farm businesses. They encourage overproduction, which pushes down prices and creates political demands for more subsidies. Subsidies discourage farmers from innovating, cutting costs, diversifying their land use, and taking other actions needed to prosper in the competitive economy.



Agriculture has long attracted federal support. The Morrill Act of 1862 established the land‐​grant colleges to teach agriculture and other subjects. The Hatch Act of 1887 funded agricultural research, and the Smith‐​Lever Act of 1914 funded agricultural education. The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 created cooperative banks to provide loans to farmers. That developed into today’s Farm Credit System, which is a government‐​sponsored financial system with more than $280 billion in assets.



The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 created the Federal Farm Board, which tried to raise crop prices by buying up and stockpiling production.2 That did not work, and after spending $500 million this early agricultural boondoggle was abolished in 1933.



Congress enacted many farm programs during the 1930s, including commodity price supports, supply regulations, import barriers, and crop insurance. These programs have been expanded, modified, and added to over the decades, but the central planning philosophy behind farm programs has not changed. U.S. farm policies remain stuck in the past, despite the ongoing economic harm and taxpayer costs.



Between the 1940s and the 1980s, Congress considered farm policy reforms occasionally, usually when commodity prices were high, but then reverted to subsidy expansions when prices were lower.3 In the 1980s the Reagan administration proposed cuts to farm subsidies, but farm finances took a bad turn, and that prompted Congress to increase farm aid, not reduce it.



Farm subsidies have never made economic sense, but farm interests have held sway in Congress. While farmers are a small share of the U.S. population today, the farm lobby is still strong. One reason is that farm‐​state legislators have co‐​opted the support of urban legislators by including food‐​stamp subsidies in farm bills. Other legislators support farm bills because of the inclusion of conservation subsidies.



In 1996 Congress enacted reforms under the “Freedom to Farm” law, which allowed farmers greater flexibility in planting and increased reliance on market supply and demand. But Congress reversed course in the late 1990s, and it passed a series of supplemental farm subsidy bills. As a result, subsidies over the seven years of the 1996 farm bill ended up costing more than double what had been promised.4



In 2002 Congress enacted a farm bill that further reversed the 1996 reforms. The law increased projected subsidy payments, added new crops to the subsidy rolls, and created a new price guarantee scheme called the countercyclical program. The 2002 law increased projected farm subsidy payments by 74 percent over 10 years.5



In 2008 Congress overrode a presidential veto to enact farm legislation that added further subsidies. The law created a permanent disaster aid program and added a revenue protection program for farmers to lock in profits from high commodity prices. It added a sugar‐​to‐​ethanol program to keep sugar prices artificially high, and it added new subsidies for “specialty crops” such as fruits and vegetables.



In 2014 Congress passed another huge farm bill. The bill changed the structure of subsidies, but it did not cut the overall level of benefits. The law ended the direct payment program, the countercyclical program, and a couple of other smaller programs. But it expanded the largest farm subsidy program — crop insurance — and it added two new subsidy programs, the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program and the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program.



When the 2014 farm bill was passed, supporters claimed that it would save money, but the opposite has happened. The ARC and PLC programs have cost almost double what the Congressional Budget Office originally estimated.6 Meanwhile, the cost of crop insurance has soared over the past 15 years.



All of these subsidies ensure that farm incomes are much higher than the incomes of most Americans. Farm programs are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do, and they induce overproduction, inflate land prices, and harm the environment. They should be repealed, and farmers should support themselves in the marketplace.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) runs more than 60 direct and indirect aid programs for farmers. This section summarizes the major ones.



Most of the direct aid goes to producers of a handful of field crops, not to livestock producers or fruit and vegetable growers. In the three largest farm subsidy programs — insurance, ARC, and PLC — more than 70 percent of the handouts go to farmers of just three crops — corn, soybeans, and wheat.7



The Trump administration’s budget for 2019 proposes to cut farm subsidies by tightening limits on the maximum payments to each farmer and ending subsidies for farmers with incomes above $500,000 a year.23 The budget would also cut insurance subsidies and conservation subsidies. The reforms would save about $6 billion a year when phased in.



Studies from various think tanks have also proposed reforms. Heritage Foundation experts propose repealing the ARC and PLC programs and trimming crop insurance.24 American Enterprise Institute (AEI) experts have found that modest limits on payments to large farms would produce major savings.25 For example, a cap on insurance subsidies of $40,000 per farm would affect only 5 percent of farmers but save $2 billion a year.



Ultimately, Congress should end all farm subsidies. Businesses in other industries face many risks and market fluctuations, yet they prosper or fail depending on their own skill and planning without a federal subsidy cushion. Farm businesses face some unique risks, but so do other businesses. Consider, for example, the fast pace of change in technology industries, or the large price fluctuations in the mining and energy industries.



The following sections discuss why farm subsidies make little sense.



A number of major farm programs expire at the end of September 2018, which provides Congress a chance to rethink its costly farm policies. Policymakers should look to the Trump administration’s 2019 budget, which includes a number of sensible reforms to farm programs.



For Republicans in Congress, farm subsidy cuts would signal that the party is concerned about fiscal responsibility at a time of rising budget deficits. The GOP has sought cuts to low‐​income welfare programs, and it makes sense to combine those with cuts to farm subsidies, which are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do.



As the Heritage Foundation has argued, Congress this year should at least repeal the crop subsidy programs added in the last farm bill, ARC and PLC.74 Over the longer term, all farm subsidies should be ended. American farmers should stand on their own two feet in the marketplace, as do businesses in nearly all other industries.

"The news can seem grim. Refugee crises, extreme weather and wars plague the globe. Cellphones have exploded. America is bitterly divided. Mary Tyler Moore died. Even the doomsday clock has been reset. But we thought you could use a break, whatever your politics, your fears, your troubles. The nation’s zoos agree. Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile. It all started, according to  The   with a Smithsonian National Zoo announcement on Wednesday of the birth of a female gray seal on Jan. 21, a pup described as “nursing, moving and bonding well with mom. ” The baby’s mother, a    gray seal named Kara, set a record for being the oldest seal of her kind to give birth in a zoo. (The Washington Post even had a Facebook Live presentation of her ultrasound in December.) The seal’s birth was a reminder that gray seals moved from the endangered list to being a species of least concern in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their numbers rose to more than 600, 000 worldwide. The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online, and generated a hashtag  —   #CuteAnimalTweetOff  —   which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas, otters, orangutans and tiger cubs. There is even a baby turtle, as well as a pun or two, in the fray. “Here we have an otterly adorable submission to #CuteAnimalTweetOff,” the Aquarium of the Pacific said on Twitter with a photo of otters. “Leapin’ Lemurs the #cuteanimaltweetoff is going strong,” the Maryland Zoo wrote with a photo of a lemur. The postings have gone international, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we can find common ground across borders by looking at cute animals. The ZSL London Zoo raised the bar with a few seconds of video of its tiger cubs Karis and Achilles, born in June. Sarah Janet Hill, a host at Radio Free Radio in Hampton, Va. has been credited with giving the Smithsonian announcement the online bump it needed to spread. “I thought, ‘Our seals are cuter than that,’ ” Ms. Hill is quoted as saying in The  . So she retweeted the announcement to the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, which took up the challenge. The viral response to the pup’s birth announcement has been a pleasant surprise for the Smithsonian Zoo. Annalisa Meyer, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the seal pup had not yet been given a name, a process that includes taking suggestions from the public or giving a sponsor the opportunity to come up with one. “We have never set off a cute animal challenge,” Ms. Meyer said. “Will it be the last? Maybe not. We are open to more cute  . ” But to what end? Maybe the point is just relief from the drumbeat of sober news. “It’s been a really fun day, and I’m just glad there was something light to talk about today,” Ms. Hill told The  . “There’s been some heavy news lately, and it’s been fun to distract people with this fun stuff. ” “Everyone wants their zoo to win,” she added, but really, there were no winners or losers in the standoff. Just cute animals."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\--------   
  
A favorite global warming chesnut is that human-caused climate change will make the planet uninhabitable for _Homo sapiens_ (that’s us). The latest iteration of this cli-fi classic appears in this week's _New York Times'_ coverage of the U.N. climate talks taking place in Lima, Peru (talks that are destined to fail, as we point out here).   
  
Back in September, The World Health Organization (WHO) released a study claiming that global warming as a result of our pernicious economic activity will lead to a quarter million extra deaths each year during 2030 to 2050. Yup, starting a mere 15 years from today. Holy cats!   
  
That raised the antennae of Indur M. Goklany, a science and technical policy analyst who studies humanity’s well-being and the impact of environmental change upon it. Goklany detailed many of his findings in a 2007 book he wrote for Cato, _The Improving State of the World: Why We’re Living Longer, Healthier, More Comfortable Lives on a Cleaner Planet_.   
  
As you may imagine, Goklany, found much at fault with the WHO study and wrote his findings up for the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF)—a U.K. think tank which produces a lot of good material on global warming.   
  
In “Unhealthy Exaggeration: The WHO report on climate change” Goklany doesn’t pull any punches. You ought to have a look at the full report, but in the meantime, here is the Summary:   




In the run-up to the UN climate summit in September 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) released, with much fanfare, a study that purported to show that global warming will exacerbate under nutrition (hunger), malaria, dengue, excessive heat and coastal flooding and thereby cause 250,000 additional deaths annually between 2030 and 2050. This study, however, is fundamentally flawed.   
  
Firstly, it uses climate model results that have been shown to run at least three times hotter than empirical reality (0.15◦C vs 0.04◦C per decade, respectively), despite using 27% lower greenhouse gas forcing.   
  
Secondly, it ignores the fact that people and societies are not potted plants; that they will actually take steps to reduce, if not nullify, real or perceived threats to their life, limb and well-being. Thus, if the seas rise around them, heatwaves become more prevalent, or malaria, diarrhoeal disease and hunger spread, they will undertake adaptation measures to protect themselves and reduce, if not eliminate, the adverse consequences. This is not a novel concept. Societies have been doing just this for as long as such threats have been around, and over time and as technology has advanced they have gotten better at it. Moreover, as people have become wealthier, these technologies have become more affordable. Consequently, global mortality rates from malaria and extreme weather events, for instance, have been reduced at least five-fold in the past 60 years.   
  
Yet, the WHO study assumes, explicitly or implicitly, that in the future the most vulnerable populations – low income countries in Africa, Europe, southeast Asia and the western Pacific – will not similarly avail themselves of technology or take any commonsense steps to protect themselves. This is despite many suitable measures already existing – adapting to sea level rise for example – while others are already at the prototype stage and are being further researched and developed: early-warning systems for heatwaves or the spread of malaria or steps to improve sanitation, hygiene or the safety of drinking water.   
  
Finally, the WHO report assumes, erroneously, if the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report is to be believed, that carbon dioxide levels above 369 ppm – today we are at 400ppm and may hit 650ppm if the scenario used by the WHO is valid – will have no effect on crop yields. Therefore, even if one assumes that the relationships between climatic variables and mortality used by the WHO study are valid, the methodologies and assumptions used by WHO inevitably exaggerate future mortality increases attributable to global warming, perhaps several-fold.



In keeping with the topic of bad predictions, check out the “Friday Funny” at the Watts Up With That blog where guest blogger Tom Scott has compiled a list of failed eco-climate claims dating back nearly a century. He’s collected some real doozies. Here are a few of the best:   




“By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people … If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.” -Paul Ehrlich, Speech at British Institute For Biology, September 1971   
  
Some predictions for the next decade (1990’s) are not difficult to make… Americans may see the ’80s migration to the Sun Belt reverse as a global warming trend rekindles interest in cooler climates. -Dallas Morning News December 5th 1989   
  
Giant sand dunes may turn Plains to desert – Huge sand dunes extending east from Colorado’s Front Range may be on the verge of breaking through the thin topsoil, transforming America’s rolling High Plains into a desert, new research suggests. The giant sand dunes discovered in NASA satellite photos are expected to re- emerge over the next 20 to 50 years, depending on how fast average temperatures rise from the suspected “greenhouse effect,” scientists believe. -Denver Post April 18, 1990



There are many more where these came from. To lighten your day, you ought to have a look!

Australia is suffering from a dreadful bushfire season, arguably the worst on record. At the same time ideological folk on both sides are flapping their arms about and blaming each other. Are the fires all to do with climate change? Or are they the result of arson and misguided green policies? What’s fact, and what’s fake, on the Australian bushfires?

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a 501 (c) (3) watchdog group, released an investigatory report, Back to Square One: Unlawful Collusion with Green Pressure Groups Should Doom U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Regulation  and an appendix of source documents.  The report, which is based on e-mails and other documents obtained under numerous Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests and litigation, details illegal activities by EPA staff, colluding with certain environmental lobbyists to draft EPA’s greenhouse gas (GHG) rules behind the scenes, outside of public view, and to the exclusion of other parties.  More importantly, it clearly shows that EPA must start anew if it wishes to regulate GHGs. (A two-minute companion video is available for use.)

With EPA’s GHG rules going final any day, it is critical to inform the public of the emails detailed in this report for what they show about how EPA has developed these costly public policies with select, ideologically aligned outside interests, and its continuing efforts to obscure and even hide the content of discussions with those same lobbyists.

“E&E Legal has obtained proof that EPA’s GHG rules are the product of unlawful collusion and are themselves therefore unlawful,” said E&E Legal Senior Legal Fellow Chris Horner and author the report.  “Congress or the courts — or EPA, in a moment of rationality — should stop these rules from taking effect before the (intended) anticipatory harms of a sham rulemaking are imposed upon millions of Americans, without years of delay and devastation before the ultimately illegal agency rulemaking is overturned.”

EPA is a regulatory agency tasked with protecting the environment. EPA can regulate greenhouse gases thanks to the Supreme Court’s Massachusetts v. EPA decision. It is not compelled to do so, and it remains prohibited under the law from regulating with an “unalterably closed mind”, for the purposes of completing a “naked transfer of wealth”, or to do the bidding of ideologically aligned pressure groups.

“This pattern of conducting official business in secret and outside of the legal parameters is unfortunately a hallmark of this Administration,” said E&E Legal Executive Director Craig Richardson.  “In the case of the EPA, green groups led by the Sierra Club and NRDC set up shop at the EPA, even before Obama took office, with a plan to eliminate the U.S.’s most abundant source of electricity, coal-fired power plants.  Part of this was to shift the public’s wealth to renewable energy, where the large benefactors of these same green groups are now poised to make significant money.”

The report comes as President Obama prepares to announce these rules next week, and follows an E&E Legal interim report released last September which also showed that EPA was working with outside green lobby groups on a common regulatory agenda, often with deliberate secretiveness and unlawfully.   Since the 2014 report, E&E Legal has pried many hundreds of relevant emails out of EPA in several requests and lawsuits.  The record is not complete, of course, but reflects only those records responsive to E&E Legal’s search terms and that EPA, or its now-departed activist-staffers, decided to produce. EPA continues to improperly withhold certain obviously important information with no conceivable legal justification.

As Australian PM **Scott Morrison** attempts to reclaim the political narrative from the firestorm surrounding the 2019-20 bushfire disaster, many rank-and-file Coalition voters have expressed concern that the government is surrendering to climate change alarmism.



As usual, the Greens are ideologically blinded to every obvious cause behind the fires, particularly environmental policies which have largely prevented any meaningful effort to reduce the extraordinary fuel loads piling up in both state-managed forests and private land. No, for the Greens, as with everything, the only cause they can see is climate change. At the height of the fires, with police and emergency services stretched to the limit, the Greens chose to block major cities with protests reminiscent of millenarian flagellants howling and weeping through the ruins of mediaeval Europe.



There were signs that Morrison was catching the green disease, in some sort of anxiety to appease the Gaiaist nutters. Naturally, Coalition voters, who made their feelings about the climate bogeyman clear in no uncertain terms at the ballot box last May, are less than happy.



But the Coalition appears to be reasserting the common-sense approach that won the last election. First, the minor Coalition partners:



New Nationals Deputy Leader **David Littleproud** has reaffirmed his view that Australia must rely on coal power as part of its energy mix.



A day after he became deputy leader and ahead of the new government ministry being unveiled where he is expected to become Agriculture Minister, Mr Littleproud said Australia is “taking real action” on emissions reductions and that “it’s not just Australia that has to act”.



“Instead of beating ourselves up… we’re one of the few nations that actually met Kyoto, we’re the ones with some credibility in this.” Mr Littleproud told ABC Radio National.



The reaffirmation of climate commonsense is being echoed all the way up to the prime minister’s office. But, once again, a minority of Liberal “wets” are desperate to pander to the green-left elite.



Scott Morrison says he will not “be bullied” into adopting tougher pro-climate action policies, as his own Liberal MPs raise fears they could lose affluent, inner-city seats without a new approach.



The “climate wars” broke out in the first Coalition party room meeting of the year yesterday, with Liberals **Katie Allen** , **Fiona Martin** , **Tim Wilson** and **Trent Zimmerman** saying the Coalition would lose city seats if they did not take climate change seriously.



Some of those names will be odiously familiar to the Coalition’s conservative base. Wilson and Zimmerman, in particular, were the major agitators behind the putsch to force through 2017’s shonky “Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey” which ultimately lumbered Australia with, not just gay marriage, but its associated slippery-slope nonsense like Tasmania’s ridiculous transgender laws.



Nothing quite shows the new reality of Australian conservative politics than this rag-tag of doctor’s wives and soaking-wet inner-city progressives in blue ties roosting in Melbourne and Sydney’s trendy, rich suburbs, while formerly rusted-on Labor seats across the outer suburbs and rural Queensland and WA swing solidly conservative.



 **Scott Morrison knows that these “Quiet Australians” are the ones whose support he really needs.**



The Prime Minister on Wednesday said he would not just listen to “the inner-city” and would not adopt any climate policies that involved new taxes or punishing industry.



“We listen to Australians right across the country. Not just in the inner-city but the far flung parts of remote Australia, of our bush and regional communities,” he told the Nine Network.



“And it’s important to listen to everybody to take people forward on practical balanced actions that doesn’t write people’s industries off and put taxes on people,” he told the Nine Network.



“Action on climate change does not mean taxing people. It is about technology, not taxation. We won’t be bullied into higher taxes and electricity prices.”



Just as no American politician of any ambition could afford to **not** pander to the evangelical right during the hey-day of the Theocons, the religious zeal of the green-left today is such that nearly every politician seems to feel obliged to mouth off the appropriate platitudes. Morrison seems to be saying just enough to meet the new religious obligation, while keeping an eye firmly on the reality of just what the Coalition base, not a claque of inner-city “progressives”, really wants.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the today’s hard copy edition of the Nordesee Zeitung, a north German daily, in a letter to the editor veteran and retired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckard Puls writes a 3-point response to recent alarmist claims made by IPCC climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif.
Image: partial shot of letter appearing in the 22 March 2016 edition of the Nordsee Zeitung.
Prof. Latif recently claimed in Bremerhaven that the future of the planet was at stake, and unless drastic action is taken quickly, “the basis for existence for many people will be destroyed by climate change”
Pause has not ended
In his letter to the daily Nordsee Zeitung, Puls reminds readers that the IPCC confirms the 15-year pause in global temperature in its most recent report and that “the warm 2015 El Nino year changes nothing“. Puls notes that even IPCC climate scientist Latif was correct in characterizing the El Niño phenomenon as a “weather event” and that “it has nothing to do with climate“.
Climate refugees claims false

In the second point, concerning climate refugees, Puls reminds: “Previous UN prognoses of 50 million environmental refugees by 2010 proved to be false. In countries that are in the so-called danger zone the number of inhabitants is actually growing.”
No detectable anthropogenic sea level rise signal
In his third point of rebuttal, Puls tells readers that sea level rise has steadily slowed down since the end of the last ice age, and that there has been “no detectable anthropogenic rise signal“.
Interestingly the newspaper left out Puls’s title as a degreed meteorologist. Titles are rarely left out in such situations in Germany.
Klaus-Eckard Puls is also the staff of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).

Economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University recently made this claim (emphasis mine):   




“We’re so rich in our total production and in our capacities to do things that we could solve absolutely fundamental challenges, such as ending extreme poverty or addressing climate change or preserving biodiversity without much effort … it cannot be the most important issue in the world whether the U.S. grows at another 3% or 3.5% or 2.9% a year, when **over the last 65 years there’s been no discernible rise in wellbeing** ”



That is the theme of his new book, _The Origins of Happiness_.   
  
By “we” Sachs appears to mean the U.S. and other rich countries and calls for their governments to engage in wealth transfers to poor countries and a plethora of environmental projects. What he does not seem to realize is that humanity is already making swift progress—through the free actions of billions of individuals—toward ending poverty and better preserving the environment.



As global GDP per person has skyrocketed, global poverty has plummeted. Fewer people live in extreme poverty than ever before, both as a share of the population and in absolute terms. In other words, although there are more people alive, the number of people living in extreme poverty is lower than it has even been. If current trends continue, extreme poverty will be practically eliminated by 2030.   
  
After China liberalized its economy, hundreds of millions of its people escaped extreme poverty. Once India moved towards economic freedom in the early 1990s, its population saw a remarkable decline in poverty as well. It’s tempting to want to make this story about “us” in the U.S. and other rich countries acting as saviors for the global poor, but the reality is that people in the developing world are lifting themselves out of poverty wherever they have the economic freedom to do so. In contrast, no country has ever become rich through foreign aid, which is plagued by many problems.   
  
As incomes rise and people move past worries of basic survival, more of them come to care about the environment. Technological progress is also helping to improve environmental stewardship, by boosting agricultural yields per hectare of land and increasing water productivity, among other things. We are now witnessing numerous trends that give cause for environmental optimism, from expanding forest area in China to falling emissions in the United States.   
  
Once again, Sachs’ well-meaning call for state intervention seems misguided. The U.S. emits less CO2 today not because of EPA regulations or costly subsidies for unreliable wind and solar energy, but because the market delivered a technological breakthrough (hydraulic fracturing) that reduced reliance on more polluting energy sources.   
  
Despite Sachs’ protests, there _has_ been a discernible rise in wellbeing over the last 65 years. Even the amount of progress achieved just in my own lifetime is astounding. Sachs’ book presents data suggesting that higher incomes and better education do not heighten people’s happiness as much as sound health and strong interpersonal relationships do. From this he concludes that despite being richer and better educated, people today are not any better off than their fore-bearers.   
  
Actually, even in terms of health and interconnectedness, we are still better off today. Consider health. Life expectancy is at an all-time high. More infants survive to see their first birthday and more mothers survive childbirth. Cancer takes the lives of fewer men and women. We lose fewer lives to droughts, hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes and extreme temperatures. Safety advances also mean fewer traffic fatalities and fewer fatal plane crashes. Infectious diseases that were once common causes of death have been defeated by better treatment and prevention methods.   
  
As for relationships, despite having more disposable income, today people work less and enjoy more leisure time to spend with loved ones. In 1950, an average American worker worked 1,983 hours in a year. In 2016, that had fallen to 1,774. That’s 209 fewer hours of labor—and 209 more hours to spend with family and friends.   
  
Technology, although much maligned for providing distracting alternatives to social interaction, also makes it possible to remain in contact with others even across vast distances. Access to electricity, mobile phones and the Internet has never been more widespread, connecting more lives across the planet.   
  
Technology not only makes it easier to maintain relationships, but to form them. Just last month I attended a wedding where the bride and groom had first met through a dating app on their smart phones. They were not unusual—online dating now brings about more than a third of U.S. marriages, and the rapid spread of communications technology has also facilitated the formation of many friendships.   
  
To make his case Sachs also cites data showing that people don’t identify as happier today than a half-century ago. If true, that is perhaps evidence in favor of the “hedonic treadmill” theory of psychology, which claims that people quickly get used to improvements in their lives and take them for granted. A year after winning the lottery, for example, many people are no happier than they were previously. In a sense, just being alive right now means you’ve won the lottery—the average American today is richer in many ways than John D. Rockefeller a century ago.   
  
Sachs is too quick to dismiss the incredible progress that humanity has made by practically every measure, and also too quick to assume that government intervention is the best way to bring about progress. You can find even more data showing how far humanity has come at HumanProgress.org.

"**The leader of Ethiopia's Tigray region has rejected the prime minister's ultimatum to surrender by Wednesday and has pledged to fight on in the conflict engulfing the north of the country.**
Debretsion Gebremichael denied federal government claims that the regional capital, Mekelle, was surrounded.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed and tens of thousands have fled in nearly three weeks of fighting.
The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Sunday announced a 72-hour deadline for the region's fighters to surrender, and the army warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that soldiers would ""encircle"" the city and attack it.
But Mr Debretsion, who heads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said the prime minister ""doesn't understand who we are. We are people of principle and ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"", AFP news agency quotes him as saying.
The TPLF is the dominant political party in Tigray and was once a powerful militia force that led the fight to overthrow a previous Ethiopian government in 1991.
The Tigray leader also said, according to the Reuters news agency, that government claims about Mekelle were a cover for a need to regroup after the army was defeated on three fronts.
It is very hard to verify what is happening in the region as there is a virtual communications blackout.
The Ethiopian government has accused TPLF forces of destroying infrastructure including the airport in the ancient tourist town of Aksum, state-affiliated Fana news site reports.
It shared images of a ploughed runway, accusing the fighters of harming the region's economy.
The TPLF has not commented on the accusations but Mr Debretsion told Reuters news agency on Sunday that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he said.
The United Arab Emirates, an influential ally of the Ethiopian government, said it was concerned about the conflict and that it was making contacts around Africa and the world to try to end it.
And on Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. It held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.

"My grandmother, F. Helen Hunt, was tough. I learned this when I was 13, the year I moved alone from London to Clinton County, Ind. to live with her on her   farm. I sailed in amid the wreckage of my parents’ marriage. Maybe I should say as part of the wreckage. Upon my arrival, my grandmother took one look at furious, hurt, young me and prescribed hugs  —   she was never stingy with them  —   and what felt to me, lately prowling the streets of South Kensington and St. John’s Wood, like outrageous amounts of manual labor. These weren’t chores: She paid me, not unfairly, for what I did. But it wasn’t quite voluntary either. I hauled wood, I mowed her enormous lawn with a little push mower, I cleared fallen branches, I raked, I burned, I strung and tested electric fences, I dug holes, I ran a rototiller, I pulled weeds, I knocked down derelict buildings with a crowbar and sledgehammer, I washed windows, I worked a scythe. One of my early jobs was learning how to drive my late  ’s temperamental 1951 Farmall Cub tractor so that I could tear out a vineyard, relic of a winemaking project started by my aunt and uncle that had by that time, in the early 1980s, run its course. It turned out the Cub had a functioning mowing element, and when I had finished tearing out the rows of Foch grapevines, I regularly used it to shear the grass and weeds of my grandmother’s east and west woods. Even if from time to time I also found myself detasseling corn in hot fields or baling and stacking hay in even hotter barns for neighboring farmers, the core of what I did was always for my grandmother. And I didn’t do it alone. My grandmother stood a smidgen over five feet tall in her Sunday heels, was a retired teacher of Latin who knew all the declensions and had once interviewed Thomas Wolfe’s brother and traveled the world, but man, could she get to it. After school and church duties were done  —   and there was no monkeying around about either  —   we went out rain or shine, cold or heat. It didn’t matter if I was walking with a limp or had sore muscles from playing football or basketball the night before. If it wasn’t torn or broken, you worked on it. That first year, on a day when we were shifting old    from one spot to another for no clear  —   to me  —   reason in a cold, steady springtime drizzle, I let one I was supposed to be holding steady slip, and it smacked her hard in the mouth. I already stood a foot taller than her and outweighed her by 50 pounds and that blow would have laid me out. But my grandmother just spat, instructed me through her swelling lip to get a tighter grip, and we went back to it, got it done. On those occasions when we worked independently  —   say my grandmother in her greenhouse and me at the woodpile  —   she was never loath to raise a steely eyebrow in the face of my highball estimates about how many chunks of wood I had carried. I’m painting a picture of a    taskmaster here  —   the older   who runs everyone else into the ground  —   but she also remained generous with those hugs. There were kisses too. My grandmother was, in addition, fond of affectionately grabbing and squeezing my forearm. At the end of a big job, or when I’d done something passable at school or on the field, we would link hands, throw our heads back and spin around together. She would also brag about me to anyone, in any context, within earshot, whether she knew them or not. Much as my teenage self rebelled against the one and sometimes only grudgingly tolerated the other, when I look back on it now, it is clear to me that with these sturdy threads of hard work and fierce affection my grandmother was weaving the torn world back together for me. My grandmother’s admirable grit, which she displayed in just about every aspect of her long life (she variously credited these qualities to having been born breach and not breathing or to having come of age during the Great Depression) not only helped see me through my troubled teens and early adulthood, it has become the subject of my life’s work. Indeed, I recently finished my third novel set in and around rural Indiana, featuring strong women as protagonists. These novels, which take place in the deep well of the past, aren’t studies of my grandmother’s life, but they are absolutely and unapologetically inspired by it. Each character is different, each is admirable and flawed in near equal measure, but they all have in common my grandmother’s   inability to quit in the face of challenge and a thundering capacity for love. When I first went to my grandmother’s, the idea was that I would stay in Indiana for a year. I ended up staying five with her, and nine if you count college in Bloomington, a couple of hours away. In the process, in the company of my outsize, diminutive grandmother, I grew to adulthood. And although she has been gone for years, I keep her close both in my characters and in myself. There is no way to pay off a debt like the one I owe her, but I make regular payments in the only kind of currency she would have accepted: dedication to the task at hand and the ability, when it has been merited, to link hands with those close to me and spin with joy."
"**Ethiopia has issued arrest warrants for 76 army officers accused of being linked to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).**
Forces loyal to that party are fighting the government in the restive Tigray region.
Ethiopia's prime minister has said that his army is advancing on its capital, Mekelle.
Hundreds have reportedly died and tens of thousands have fled the area after two weeks of clashes.
Verifying information from Tigray is hard because of a blackout on most communications.
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the TPLF and Ethiopia's central government.
When Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two groups. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate to lead the country.
The government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons, which the TPLF denied. In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive, accusing the TPLF of treason.
On Wednesday federal police announced arrest warrants for 76 army officers, some of whom are reportedly retired. They are accused of conspiring with the TPLF and ""committing treason"", according to AFP news agency.
Speaking to the BBC, Billene Seyoum - a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - denied reports that Tigrayans elsewhere in the country were being arrested on the basis of their ethnicity. But she admitted many had been detained for membership of what she called criminal networks.
The news came after government forces seized the towns of Shire and Raya after a three-day deadline given by Prime Minister Abiy to Tigray's forces to surrender expired on Tuesday.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was born in Shire, confirmed to a local TV station that his soldiers had lost control of the towns in the south and west of Tigray. However he called their victory temporary, and vowed to defeat Mr Abiy's forces.
Sudan says some 36,000 people have fled over the border from Tigray amid the ongoing fighting. The UN has warned of a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"".
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.

It was a hashtag prosecution, a social‐​media campaign posing as a legal case: #ExxonKnew. And like yesterday’s media balloon become today’s litter, its deflated remains floated back down to earth last week in a New York courtroom.



Whatever you think of them otherwise, ExxonMobil’s communications on climate change had neither the intent nor the effect of wronging the company’s investors. New York’s since‐​disgraced attorney general Eric Schneiderman had no business bringing a securities‐​fraud case on that basis, and there was nothing his successor, Letitia James, could have done to rescue the case.’



In a 2003 case called _Nike v. Kasky_ , no less a liberal authority than Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer warned that it was dangerous to freedom of speech to arm ideological adversaries with legal power to bring fraud charges against businesses based on those businesses’ public statements about contentious issues. (The full Court in _Nike_ did not reach that issue, instead dismissing the case on other grounds.)



New York’s prosecution of Exxon deserves to be studied in law schools for years to come. But not for the reasons its authors once hoped.



The _Nike_ case involved claims by the apparel maker about the treatment of its workforce, but the climate issue offered a similar line of attack. Since at least 2012 activists had been looking for ways to gin up lawsuits or even prosecutions over what they termed climate denial — or, to use a more neutral phrase, advocacy on the wrong side of climate debates. Win or lose, and First Amendment or no, gaining access to the internal files of energy companies and their ideological allies could be politically valuable. The ambitious Schneiderman, widely spoken of as a future New York governor, was willing to go first.



As part of the same effort, a team of state AGs used subpoenas to go after free‐​market non‐​profits such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute as well as university scientists deemed too close to Exxon’s views. The pushback on both that and the Schneiderman suit was intense, from places such as the editorial boards of _USA Today_ (an “exercise in politics” raising “serious First Amendment concerns”) and the _Washington Post_ (“Exxon deserves criticism, but it didn’t commit a crime .… Legitimate scientific inquiry depends on allowing strong, even unfair, criticism of the claims that scientists make.”)



At the last minute Schneiderman’s successor as New York attorney general, James, dropped two counts that would have required a showing of intent by the oil company. That still left the state’s elastic, ultra‐​broad Martin Act, which gives her office unusual powers that are hard to square with due‐​process protection. (“The Martin Act is a nearly empty vessel into which the AG can pour virtually any content that he wants,” per _Reuters_).



But even the Martin Act charges failed. Over the course of the trial, Judge Barry Ostrager also chided the state — to quote the _New York Post_ ’s account — “for being unprepared, for indulging in ‘agonizing, repetitious questioning about documents that are not being disputed’; for pretending a witness was an expert when she wasn’t,” and much more.



In his full, scathing opinion, Judge Ostrager rejected each of the state’s themes. “ExxonMobil’s public disclosures were not misleading.” While the company had used figures for a proxy cost of carbon that varied at different times and places, it gave intelligible and legitimate reasons for doing that. Despite three and a half years of investigation and pre‐​trial discovery, New York had “failed to establish” any misrepresentation material to investors. While not reaching the issue of damages, the court “would have found that the Office of the Attorney General failed to prove any damages.”



In particular, “The Office of the Attorney General produced no testimony either from any investor who claimed to have been misled by any disclosure, even though the Office of the Attorney General had previously represented it ‘would call such individuals as trial witnesses.’” The state had made a fuss over various reports from the company without being able to demonstrate that the content of those reports ever influenced investment analysts or had any other market impact.



That was just for starters. New York’s conduct of the prosecution, the judge noted, had begun with “politically motivated statements” by Schneiderman claiming that a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” had been “sanctioned at the highest levels of the company,” which had supposedly erected “a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of climate change regulation” for its business operations. “The Court finds these allegations to be without merit.” As the state’s withdrawal of its intent‐​based charges late in the game made clear, the misrepresentations on this set of issues were not the ones emanating from Texas.



The Exxon corporate culture, known as a straight‐​arrow kind of place that emphasizes meticulous planning and documentation, came off well at trial. There “was not a single ExxonMobil employee whose testimony the Court found to be anything other than truthful.” Meanwhile, the judge wrote, cross‐​examination had “eviscerated” the contentions of the state’s expert witnesses. In one particularly dubious bit of legal argumentation, the state had argued that an anti‐​Exxon press hit in the _Los Angeles Times_ that momentarily nicked the company’s share price should itself be taken as evidence of the state’s claims about investor harm, being “corrective disclosure.” The _L.A. Times_ piece, of course, reflected agitation by the same body of activist critics who had urged Schneiderman to sue. The judge aptly declared the theory “circular.”



New York’s prosecution of Exxon — a legal vendetta against a target chosen for essentially political reasons — deserves to be studied in law schools for years to come. But not for the reasons its authors once hoped.

There’s no bow too long for the screeching ninnies of climate alarmism to draw. Climate change has already been blamed for everything from a surplus of prostitutes to a shortage of maple syrup.



Worse, though, is the unseemly haste with which green zealots rush to exploit any tragedy. The smoke from Australia’s bushfires is yet to clear, but already Tim Flannery’s climate muppet show is Chicken-Little screeching that “You’re all gonna die!”



But, like almost everything that spews from the donations-desperate Climate Council, that’s egregious, uninformed nonsense.



You may have read several articles recently about the effects of bushfire smoke on your body.



Health experts have warned that smoke particles can aggravate conditions like asthma, and even trigger heart attacks or strokes.



Others compare the exposure to smoking several cigarettes a day.



This is precisely the kind of shrieking nonsense [being peddled by the Climate Council](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/federal-governments-burning-silence-threatening-australians-health/).



But is that comparison fair and accurate?



The Australian Institute of Sport’s chief medical officer, David Hughes, does not think so.



“It is really about the concentration of particulate matter, particularly PM 2.5s, which are the particles which have the most detrimental effect in smoky air,” he said.



“There is a mathematical equation which says that, if that [pollution] is at a certain level, it can be the equivalent to smoking a certain number of cigarettes.



“But those sorts of measures and comparisons are imprecise.”



The chemicals inhaled when smoking a cigarette are much more toxic and harmful than what is found in bushfire smoke.



Also, when you smoke a cigarette, you deliberately suck its chemical cocktail deep into your lungs.



So, typical of the sort of Flannery flim-flam we’ve so sadly become used to, it’s a farrago of bad science and egregious scaremongering.



Dr Hughes said the smoke levels in south-east Australia were dangerous, but they would not cause the same long-term health problems as air pollution in countries like India and China.



“Generally speaking, the smoke from burning, even though it is not good for our health, is less harmful than industrial pollution,” he said.



Dr Hughes said most of the harm caused by bushfire smoke would be short-lived…”Generally, most healthy people will recover without any long-term effects.”



In fact, as we see repeatedly in these sort of disasters, green scare-mongering is by far the deadliest threat.



Nonetheless, the fire crisis’s ill effects are not limited to physical health.



Canberra mother Louise Grace said the weeks of thick smoke stoked deep fears about her eight-month-old son, Eric…”I’ve been lying awake until midnight worrying about how he’s coping.”



The ACT’s chief psychiatrist, Denise Riordan, said this type of anxiety could be traumatic, but was manageable.



For a start, stop listening to zealous idiots like the Climate Council and the left-media.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The shameless attempt by green activists like Prince Charles and President Obama, to link Climate Change and the Syrian Civil War, has just lost even more credibility thanks to The Guardian;
Is climate change really to blame for Syria’s civil war?
Prince Charles is the latest high-profile figure to echo claims that ‘securitise’ the conflict. But the evidence just doesn’t stack up.
Was the Syrian civil war partly caused by climate change? Prince Charles, for one, seems to think so. “There is very good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in Syria was a drought that lasted for about five or six years,” he told Sky News, adding that climate change is having a “huge impact” on conflict and terrorism.
The Prince is not alone on this one: he joins a chorus of voices making similar claims. In the US President Obama, Al Gore, and the democratic presidential hopefuls Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders have all talked of a link between climate change and the Syria conflict, Sanders going so far as to argue that climate change is “directly related to the growth of terrorism”.
…
This time round, there at least appears to be some scientific support for the climate-conflict thesis: a study by Earth scientists at Columbia University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found: “Climate change is implicated in the current Syrian conflict”. The problem is, this study is deeply flawed.

When even the über green Guardian expresses skepticism of a climate scare story, that horse isn’t going to get up and go for a gallop, no matter how hard you flog it.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time today, as will be the case tomorrow as well, and so here’s something way off topic – from last week. Recall I recently wrote about the glaring hypocrisy and deceitfulness of an all-white German media here.
It appears that the heydays of the media are almost over. Their credibility has been rocked. On wide range of issues they have been misleading, outright lying and covering up for too long and it is now all coming home to roost.
They are being exposed in a big way for what they’ve really been over the past couple of decades. The public has woken up. The media is deservedly a despised institution in the eyes of many citizens.
I was really impressed by the powerful speech made by Laura Ingraham. If you’re short on time, start at about the 13:30 mark.
If you have had it with our media, it’ll resonate like, wow!

And here’s one of my favorite politicians (because he actually got things done). Guliani tells how he’s sick and tired of the media defamation of Trump:

He ought to come to Germany and witness the absolute universal bias here. Here they make Hillary look like a shining role model of a law-abiding citizen.

Disappointing results from an initial rank wildcat can’t kill a play.
The cyclical ups and downs of product prices can’t kill a play.
High operating costs can’t kill a play.
Only massively incompetent government can kill a play.
“This is a clearly disappointing exploration outcome,” Marvin Odum, director of Shell’s Upstream Americas unit, said in a statement. While indications of oil and gas were present in the Burger J well in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea, they weren’t sufficient to warrant further exploration, the company said. Shell will now plug and abandon the well.
Shell had planned a two-year drilling program starting this July. The company was seeking to resume work halted in 2012 when its main drilling rig ran aground and was lost. It was also fined for air pollution breaches. The Anglo-Dutch company first discovered oil and gas in the region in the late 1980s.
The company continues to see potential in the region and the decision not to explore further in Alaskan waters “reflects both the Burger J well result, the high costs associated with the project, and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska,” according to the statement.

The potential of the Alaska OCS is nearly as large as the Central Gulf of Mexico…

Product prices and exploration results are by their nature, unpredictable. Operating costs are tied to product prices and regulatory requirements. Regulatory requirements must be predictable in order for any business to function.

"TIJUANA, Mexico  —   Even before President Trump decided to build the wall, this Mexican border city was already overwhelmed. So many Haitian migrants, traveling across the Americas, began arriving here last year with hopes of crossing into the United States that churches, community halls,   programs, rehabilitation centers and private citizens have opened their doors to house, feed and clothe them. In one shelter, about 250 migrants  —   men, women and children  —   share two toilets and one shower. Four hundred are crammed into a church. A soup kitchen sleeps hundreds in hallways, a pantry and a lot out back. Now, some officials and advocates worry that Mr. Trump’s plan could spur immigration crises in towns and cities all along the border and, indeed, throughout Mexico. The Mexican government, they say, may not be able to handle it. Mr. Trump is seeking to tighten the border, restrict immigration and increase deportations from the United States. In announcing his actions this week, the president said they would “help Mexico by deterring illegal immigration. ” “Going to be very, very good for Mexico,” he declared. Yet some international officials and advocates envision a potential nightmare for the country. A growing number of people have been streaming north from Central America, fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands. Nearly 409, 000 were caught trying to cross the southwestern border of the United States illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, a 23 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, according to American government statistics. And the trend has continued over the past few months. As more migrants are blocked at the American border and more undocumented immigrants are deported from the United States, border communities in Mexico could be overwhelmed, migrant shelters could overflow, the ranks of the unemployed could swell, and Mexico will bear the strain, officials and advocates say. “It’s worrying us,” said Christopher Gascon, chief of the Mexico office for the International Organization for Migration. “How Mexico can handle that is going to be a whole new area of concern. I don’t think the absorptive capacity is there. ” Even before this week, Mexico was facing extraordinary migration pressures. The waves of Central Americans heading north were severely testing Mexico’s border patrol in the south of the country and led to a sharp increase in the number of people applying for asylum in Mexico, with applications more than doubling from 2015 to 2016. Mexican officials were also scrambling to develop a strategy in case Mr. Trump made good on his promises to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants, a population that includes millions of Mexicans. An intergovernmental group began on Monday to study ways to help integrate deportees into Mexican society. Beyond that, recent changes in American policy during the Obama administration had already contributed to the surge in Haitian migrants, as well as to a separate wave of Cuban migrants. Thousands of Cubans found themselves stranded in Mexico and Central America this month after the Obama administration ended a longstanding policy that favored Cubans. Under American pressure, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico had been trying to stanch the flow of migrants heading through his country, starting the Southern Border Program in 2014 in an attempt to control the movement of people and goods crossing the border with Guatemala. The plan contributed to a doubling of deportations between 2013, before it was enacted, and 2016. Nearly all the deportees in recent years have been from Central America. But the country’s borders remain highly porous. The International Organization for Migration estimates that between 400, 000 and 500, 000 undocumented migrants transit through the country every year, about 90 percent of them Central Americans. Here in the state of Baja California, the migrant crisis has highlighted the Mexican government’s limited capacity to deal with the challenges. Haitian migrants, traveling from Brazil, began arriving in this border city last spring. For a while, the Haitians had little trouble crossing into the United States. In recognition of the troubles in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake there, American border officials allowed undocumented Haitians to enter under a humanitarian parole provision, with permission to stay for as long as three years. The migrants filled the handful of longstanding migrant shelters and cheap hotels in Tijuana while they waited, often for weeks, for their appointments with American border officials. Then in late September, the Obama administration suddenly announced that it was fully resuming the deportations of Haitians, hoping the policy change would dissuade more Haitians from migrating. Still, the Haitians kept coming. As the Haitian migrant population has ballooned  —   there are now about 4, 500 Haitians in Tijuana and elsewhere in northern Baja California  —   the Mexican authorities have resisted pleas to open a   emergency shelter. More than 30 shelters are providing for the Haitians, yet none are  . Most of the burden of sheltering, feeding, clothing and caring for the nonstop stream of Haitians has fallen to civil society groups and individuals, who have accused the government of doing too little too late. This month, a coalition of the main shelters in Tijuana and Mexicali sent a letter to Mr. Peña Nieto demanding a more robust federal “intervention” to address the crisis. The shelters have yet to receive a reply, they said. Advocacy and humanitarian groups in Tijuana filed a complaint this week with the National Human Rights Commission alleging that federal officials had violated the migrants’ human rights “in a widespread and repeated manner” by failing to address the crisis. Federal officials have rejected the criticism that they have been neglectful. “Is there room to do more? Yes,” Rodulfo Figueroa Pacheco, chief of the Baja California office of the federal migration agency, said in an interview last week, before the complaint was filed. “It’s been a struggle. ” “But,” he added, “it isn’t true that the governments have been unresponsive. ” The crisis, now in its ninth month, has been a crushing burden on the shelters. The migrant population at one longstanding shelter, Movimiento Juventud 2000, with capacity for about 25 people, soared to about 250, many of them living in donated tents in an adjoining lot that becomes a swale of mud when it rains. Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, a church situated in a denuded ravine on the western edge of Tijuana, was sheltering hundreds of people even though it was not connected to the municipal water supply and had to refill its tanks with a water truck. Administrators at Desayunador Salesiano Padre Chava, which had for years served as a soup kitchen, repurposed nearly the entire building, including corridors and the pantry, into a sprawling dormitory that at one point housed more than 500 people. Claudia Portela, coordinator of Padre Chava, which recently opened a smaller second shelter, estimates that donations have provided for 98 percent of their needs during the crisis. Government officials, while acknowledging that the bulk of the humanitarian assistance has come from civil society, insist that they have provided crucial services but have been sorely limited by budgets that were already under strain amid Mexico’s economic malaise. “Our deployment has been very, very small,” Mr. Figueroa said. “Institutional capacities are not as robust as we’d like. ” But despite the limitations, he said, government agencies had donated more than $280, 000, about 445, 000 meals, thousands of blankets, hundreds of mattresses and many other goods and services since late October. State and federal officials, he said, were still discussing the possibility of opening a shelter, but the proposal raised difficult practical and philosophical questions. “Will we be building something we can’t unbuild?” he said. Ad hoc networks of humanitarian groups have scrambled to help. “For me, the worst part is the omission of the federal government,” said Soraya Vazquez, one of nine women who run the Comité Estratégico de Ayuda Humanitaria Tijuana, a local group formed in September. “The government has to recognize it as a humanitarian crisis. ” On a recent morning, she and her colleague, Adriana Reyna, jumped into Ms. Reyna’s sport utility vehicle and took a tour of several shelters in Tijuana to assess their needs. At Iglesia Cristiana Embajadores de Jesus, the church in the ravine, a    Haitian girl had fallen. Her parents worried she had fractured a bone. So the women drove the child and her father to a nearby clinic where they arranged for a free evaluation, then swung by a pharmacy to pick up some medicine to treat the pain and swelling. At another shelter, the women lined up doctor’s appointments for a man with an infected leg wound and for two migrants who were experiencing complications with their pregnancies. They also strategized about setting up a piñata workshop that would give migrants employment. A message arrived, saying that an   cinema had about 30 pillows to donate. With a phone call, the women found a taker: a shelter in central Tijuana. At Iglesia Central del Nazareno, which had been converted into a shelter, the coordinator asked the women whether they had heard anything new about how Haitian migrants were being received at the United States border. Were they being deported? It was the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and rumors were flying. “I hope they’ll all be able to cross. I hope they’ll be O. K.,” said the coordinator, Ruth Gaxiola, fighting back tears. She looked exhausted. Ms. Vazquez opened her arms, and the women embraced."
"ROME  —   It began as a fight over staffing. Then came a dispute about condoms, followed by papal concerns about Freemasons. Now it has become a   proxy war between Pope Francis and the Vatican traditionalists who oppose him, with the battleground being a Renaissance palace flanked by Jimmy Choo and Hermès storefronts on Via dei Condotti, Rome’s most exclusive street. The palace is the headquarters of the Knights of Malta, the medieval Roman Catholic order. For months, an ugly, if quiet, spat over staffing simmered behind the order’s walls before spilling across the Tiber River to the Vatican, setting off a    between the two camps. Francis and his lieutenants sent angry letters. The Knights ignored them, claiming sovereignty. This past week, the dispute finally blew up. Fed up, Francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order’s leader  —   a decision the Knights officially accepted Saturday  —   and announcing that a papal delegate would step in. Conservatives promptly denounced what they called an illegal annexation and ideological purging by a   pontiff, while liberal observers saw the whole episode as resulting from an act of subterfuge by the pope’s most public critic within the Vatican hierarchy, Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American. A seemingly obscure   squabble had erupted into an unexpected shock to the church with ideological fault lines running to the top of the Vatican. “The Vatican is a thing built of tradition,” said John Thavis, the author of “The Vatican Diaries” and a veteran church analyst, “and once those traditional parts start feuding with each other, that is a dangerous sign. ” Francis remains one of the world’s most popular figures, but the spat with the Knights is a small indicator of how the political tensions rippling across the globe are alive in the Vatican, too. Only a year ago, Francis’ calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard, in keeping with his push for a more welcoming church. Now, suddenly, he is more politically isolated. The election of President Trump and the rise of   populists in Europe have ushered in an angrier era  —   and emboldened traditionalists inside the Vatican who sense that the   pope could be vulnerable. The Knights of Malta is a bastion of Catholic tradition. Founded in the 11th century by Amalfian merchants to help Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, it later became a military force, defending the faith during the Crusades and eventually holding off the armies of the Ottoman Empire from its fortress in Malta. The group, now with a wealthy and aristocratic membership of elite Catholics who parade in ornate raiment, has more recently specialized in aiding refugees and the poor in more than 100 countries. Until this past week, the order was led by the conservative and elaborately titled His Most Eminent Highness the Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing of Britain, a former Sotheby’s representative who had taken a monastic oath.   tensions between Mr. Festing and the order’s Grand Chancellor Albrecht von Boeselager of Germany, whose father participated in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, escalated in recent months amid accusations that Mr. Boeselager had knowingly overseen the distribution of condoms as head of the order’s charitable arm. Into this volatile situation stepped Cardinal Burke. In 2014, Francis had demoted Cardinal Burke, a leader of the church’s traditionalist movement, from his position on the Vatican’s Supreme Court. The cardinal’s supporters say Francis did this because of Cardinal Burke’s opposition to the pope’s tentative opening to the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion. Cardinal Burke’s exile was at least a cushy one, as the pope named him as the Knights’ patron and liaison to the Vatican, where he would be out of the way. But the   cardinal has made his presence felt. During the summer, as tensions mounted inside the order, Michael Hichborn, the president of the Lepanto Institute, a conservative Catholic organization in Virginia, conducted what he called a “short investigation” into the order’s international aid arm, which Mr. Boeselager oversaw. Mr. Hichborn said he had discovered that the aid organization was promoting the use of condoms and other contraceptives in Africa and Myanmar, a violation of church rules. “As I was digging around I thought, ‘Well, Cardinal Burke ought to know about this,’” Mr. Hichborn said in an interview. In November, he sent a summary to Cardinal Burke’s office and said he was told that the cardinal “would be working on something” regarding the information. A few days later, Cardinal Burke relayed his concerns about Mr. Boeselager to Francis. According to supporters of the cardinal, the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of Freemasonry, Vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view. But other people familiar with the events inside the order said the pope had also urged Cardinal Burke and the order’s leadership to settle the dispute through dialogue. Instead, Mr. Festing and Cardinal Burke met Mr. Boeselager on Dec. 6 and requested his resignation, claiming, Mr. Boeselager said in a statement, “that this was in accordance with the wishes of the Holy See. ” Mr. Boeselager denied knowing about the condom distribution program and considered the move a coup and an attempt to tarnish him as a “liberal Catholic. ” He argued that once he had discovered the program, he had informed the Vatican and it ended. He also refused to leave, setting off a disciplinary procedure that led to his suspension, and reached out to the Vatican for confirmation that the pope desired his removal. Mr. Boeselager declined to comment for this article. Francis was apparently not pleased about the firing and did not want the dispute to spill into the public, which it did when The Tablet, a Catholic publication in England, broke the news. The pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the Knights (red military jacket and gold epaulets) and by Cardinal Burke (a long train of billowing red silk known as a cappa magna). Francis also had a history of   with the Knights during his time as a cardinal in Argentina. So on Dec. 21, Francis wrote directly to Mr. Festing, conveying his decisions on what he called the “painful circumstances” and making clear that those decisions had “value, regardless of anything else to the contrary. ” Attached to his letter, signed simply “Francesco,” were more letters from his    official, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, stating that “His Holiness asked for dialogue as the way to confront and resolve eventual problems” and that “he never spoke, instead, of kicking someone out!” Cardinal Parolin also wrote that the firing “not be attributed to the will of the pope. ” Critically, he noted that the Knights, because of the group’s status as a lay religious order, fell under the pope’s authority, and that the pope had formed a commission to investigate the firing of Mr. Boeselager. But Mr. Festing refused to comply with the papal commission, citing the order’s status as a sovereign entity and raising questions about the integrity of a commission full of Mr. Boeselager’s allies. “I think maybe he was getting bad advice” from Cardinal Burke, said one senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak by the Vatican. (Cardinal Burke and Mr. Festing declined to comment.) Others say Mr. Festing hardly needed to be egged on by Cardinal Burke, and note that despite having no territory, the order is, in fact, sovereign, issuing its own passports and stamps and conducting diplomatic missions. Either way, the Vatican was not thrilled. On Jan. 17, it issued an unusually tough statement supporting the commission and rejecting “any attempt to discredit these members of the group and their work. ” The commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the Knights of Malta. On Tuesday, he exercised it. He called Mr. Festing to the Vatican and asked for him to step down, a move the Vatican announced the next day. The order followed with its own statement, saying Mr. Festing’s resignation would become official once the order’s counselors met on Via dei Condotti to formally accept it. On Saturday, they did just that, immediately reinstating Mr. Boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope’s delegate. This delighted the pope’s supporters, who said it showed that conniving conservatives would not push him around. But supporters of Mr. Festing were horrified by the Vatican’s de facto takeover. Supporters of Cardinal Burke complained that the pope, for all his talk of fostering debate, was intolerant of opposing views, especially more orthodox ones. “It sends a message to the rest of the Catholic world that if you try to stand for orthodoxy in the church, you are going to be sent away,” Mr. Hichborn said. “And the people pushing for heterodoxy will be put in power. ” What was not up for debate was that, in the Vatican, Francis gets his way. At the order’s headquarters, a stately wooden mailbox hangs on the doorman’s wall. The three top slots are reserved for the order’s top three officials. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Boeselager’s name had been erased. Mr. Festing’s would soon be gone. The third slot belonged to the order’s interim leader, Grand Commander Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein. But only, a Vatican statement made clear, “pending the appointment of the papal delegate. ”"

We know President Trump’s general orientation towards executive power: “when somebody’s the president of the United States, the authority is total.” What limits, if any, does Joe Biden recognize when it comes to the powers of the office he seeks? 





Good luck figuring that out from the current campaign, what discussion we’ve had on that subject has been sporadic and incidental. At the ABC News town hall two weeks ago, for instance, Biden seemed to reject the “pen and phone” approach to governance:



“Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say, ‘Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something.’ [There are] things you can’t do by executive order unless you’re a dictator. We’re a democracy. We need consensus.”



Music to my ears… but: where have I heard that song before? Oh yeah:



“Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own.… That’s not how our democracy functions. That’s not how our Constitution is written.”



That was President Barack Obama in 2011, explaining why he couldn’t unilaterally rewrite immigration law, about a year before deciding to do just that.



In fact, the Biden‐​Harris platform contemplates plenty of pen and phone governance, including a raft of “Day One” executive orders on climate change. And this summer, the former veep insisted the president’s powers were broad enough to impose a national mask mandate: “Our legal team thinks I can do that.” in September. If so, they’re as enamored of crank constitutional theories as Donald Trump during a wee‐​hours tweeting jag: there’s no statutory, let alone constitutional, authority for that kind of move, which is likely why Biden has since walked back the claim.



For a deeper dive into Joe Biden’s executive‐​power philosophy, such as it is, you have to go back much earlier in the campaign, to a candidate survey conducted by the _New York Times’s_ Charlie Savage and published in September 2019. For each of the last four presidential election cycles, Savage has pressed the candidates to answer a questionnaire fleshing out their views on the powers of the office. With the exception of the 2016 race, he’s succeeded more often than not in getting the contenders on the record. Last fall, all 17(!) Democrats then running—including Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris—played along.



As it happens, Joe Biden has been through _two_ rounds of Savage queries: in the 2008 cycle and the current race—so it’s possible to compare his answers and spot some telling shifts between Biden 2008 and Biden 2020. It seems the former veep’s views on the powers of the office “grew in office”–dramatically, in some cases. 



For one thing, Biden now leaves himself a lot more wiggle room on war powers than he did prior to his vice‐​presidential stint. In the 2008‐​cycle version of the Savage survey, then‐​Senator Biden was concise and unequivocal: “The Constitution is clear: except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force.” (Indeed, on the campaign trail at around the same time, Senator Biden promised that if George W. Bush “takes this nation to war in Iran, without congressional approval, I will make it my business to impeach him.”)



The Constitution, Biden now says, vests the CINC with “the power to direct limited U.S. military operations abroad without prior Congressional approval when those operations serve important U.S. interests and are of a limited nature, scope, and duration.” In other words, if the president thinks bombing another country is a good idea and doesn’t think we’ll get bogged down for too long, he can order up a _little_ war, splendid or otherwise. Still, Biden‐​2020 allows that a preventive strike on Iran or North Korea might be a bigger deal, rising to the level of “a ‘war’ in the constitutional sense that would require authorization by Congress.”



That “limited nature, scope, and duration” bit comes almost verbatim from the Obama Office of Legal Counsel opinion rationalizing the Libyan adventure. You may recall that in the 2008 race, Senator Barack Obama _also_ pledged to respect congressional war powers, telling Savage that the president had no constitutional authority “to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.” That answer got thrown in his face repeatedly three years later when, as president, Obama unilaterally launched a seven‐​month bombing campaign against Libya, a country that presented no threat whatsoever and that his own secretary of defense admitted wasn’t a “vital interest” of the United States.



Even if, as Biden now insists, he was a Libya skeptic at the time, he’s not going to get caught saying that the Obama‐​Biden administration launched an unconstitutional war. If you wanted to be especially charitable, you might ascribe Biden’s current views on the assassination of American citizens—“U.S. citizenship alone does not immunize such individuals from being detained or even targeted”—to a similar calculus. Whatever the reason, the former vice president now embraces a suite of executive war powers that a younger, wiser Biden rightly considered dangerous.



One of the most revealing queries Savage included in his latest survey covers “Potential Post‐​Trump Reforms.” He gave each candidate a list of 10 policy areas where Congress might rein in executive discretion and asked which restrictions they’d be willing to sign into law. One or two that Biden says he’d support, like restrictions on removal of special prosecutors, could have serious bite. But for the most part, the reforms Biden provisionally endorses are aimed at avoiding Trump‐​style conflicts of interest: mandating release of the president’s tax returns; forcing him to divest major business holdings; tightening restrictions on nepotism; and regulating self‐​serving uses of the pardon power. The former vice president has already released his tax returns, he doesn’t own a hotel chain, and unless he wants to dangle pardons to cronies or put Hunter in charge of Middle East peace, these are fairly low‐​cost concessions. They likely wouldn’t cramp a President Biden’s style all that much.



What’s more significant is what Biden leaves out. The first item on Savage’s list proposes new restrictions on the “ability of a president to declare a national emergency and activate various standby powers.” In his answer, the former veep glides right past that proposal, leaving it unmentioned.



Aggressive exploitation of emergency powers is one of the few genuinely new weapons Donald Trump has added to the presidential arsenal. As Senator Chris Murphy put it after the president’s border‐​wall emergency declaration last year:



“If Trump can use a legislative stalemate to declare an emergency to divert military dollars to build a border wall… What stops a Democratic President from declaring a climate change emergency and using military dollars to build solar farms and wind turbines?”



Biden’s silence here suggests that when it comes to emergency powers, he may be keeping his options open.



Senator Kamala Harris’s views on presidential power are of particular interest now, given the distinct possibility she’ll soon be the proverbial “heartbeat away” from the presidency. Not to be too morbid about it, but if elected, Joe Biden would be 78 on Inauguration Day, older than any previous president. From an actuarial standpoint, his odds of living through at least one term are pretty good. Still, so far, eight vice presidents have gained the presidency as a result of a death in office.



In her answers to Savage’s queries, Senator Harris is, if anything, more evasive and less reassuring than the top of the ticket. Like her running mate, Harris declines the opportunity to back emergency‐​powers reform. On war powers, the California senator allows that it’s past time for Congress to “rewrite” the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force; still, she “won’t hesitate to do what it takes to protect our country in the face of an imminent threat in the future.” Does that include bombing North Korea or Iran? Those situations, Harris says, “would require careful consideration of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.” Ah. Is it lawful to hold American citizens without trial as “enemy combatants” or kill them with drone strikes? Harris: “Any president should reserve the right to act quickly to protect the country from attack, but decisions of such consequence must rely on our values and constitutional principles.” Well, that clears it up, thanks.



All of this is a reminder, if one was needed, that real presidential power reform isn’t going to come from within the executive branch. The sorts of men and women who are willing to do what it takes to become president are unlikely, having won the prize, to turn around and say: “you know what? Now that I’ve finally made it, I’d like a whole lot less power!” At best, they’ll grudgingly accede to restraints imposed from the outside. Will the next Congress force the issue?

I can think of very few events in life that would be more painful than having to bury your own child (or children) and with that in mind, I offer my sincerest and heartfelt condolences to **Jason Alexander** in Christchurch, who lost both of his daughters, aged 15 and 17, to a horrible, fiery car crash on Christchurch’s Port Hills.



“Teenagers Tayla Alexander, 17, and her sister Sunmara Alexander, 15 at the time, were in a car reportedly driven by a 19-year-old man, when it crashed in the Port Hills about 11pm on November 27.”



I can also appreciate the sentiments expressed by Mr Alexander that he doesn’t want to see any other parent go through the nightmare he has had to face.



“Alexander presented a petition, signed by 6400 people, to the council calling for more sturdy barriers along Summit Rd. 



Alexander also wants the road closed on weekend nights to prevent “needless racing or speeding” around the hills.” 



Alexander said he was not doing this only as a grieving father. “I am doing this because unfortunately our younger generation are using this road as a place to burn rubber at the top and then race down the bottom with undoubtedly bald tyres and it’s not just a few, it’s many. 



I am also doing this for the safety of everyone who uses this road, today tomorrow and in the future.” 



“The speed limit on the road from Godley Head to Gebbies Pass Rd was reduced last year from 70kmh and 100kmh, to 60kmh, but Alexander said it was clear the new limit was not being enforced.”



According to the “Stuffed” report, Christchurch Mayor **Lianne Dalziel** has told the grieving father that the council will do all it can to help in his quest to make Summit Rd safer.



I have a great deal of sympathy for Mr Alexander and the well-meaning 6400 people who signed his petition. Mayor Dalziel? Not so much.



Saying that the council will do all it can to make Summit Road safer is just nonsense. You don’t have a magic wand Ms Dalziel and where does your fairy tale nonsense begin and end. Whatever interventions you can deliver will only move the problem, not solve it. Today Summit Road. Tomorrow – what will it be? Will council do “all it can” to make motorways safer? Will council do “all it can” to make ALL Christchurch suburban streets safer? Will you also deal with natural disasters? Oh, and of course climate change?



There’s no silver bullet and it’s wrong to suggest improved barriers, closing roads, reducing limits or other interventions will do anything more than make the proponents feel better and move the problem elsewhere.



Stationary vehicles don’t have crashes. Is that where we’re headed?



Youngsters see themselves as bullet proof. It’s part of growing up. We did it when we were younger. Despite all the obstacles we’ve tried to put in place, they’re still doing it. We can’t keep them off the monkey bars, the swings or the seesaws. We do the best we can to guide them but they will do their own thing in their own way and in their own time. Sometimes they will make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes will be tragic. That, sadly, is how life is.

Guest essay by C. R. Dickson
If the Pope really knows his chemistry, then the people at ClimateProgress better hope he doesn’t read their June 18 article entitled “What Did Actual Scientists Think of the Pope’s Climate Encyclical?” which discusses the scientific accuracy of the Pope’s passages relevant to climate. The article’s picture of a chalkboard used as a background to a bible contains a very incorrect structural formula for an organic molecule. Obviously, scientific accuracy is not very important in their article about scientific accuracy.
Students taking basic high school and college chemistry courses always learn how to draw Lewis structures for molecules. Each “stick” in a molecule represents two shared valence electrons forming a covalent bond. Every element in a molecule (except hydrogen) strives to obtain the stable noble gas configuration of eight electrons or four sticks. Although they are an outdated way of representing molecules, Lewis structures remain in use today because they are so simple.
The organic molecule in question is re-drawn to the right of the stock picture with some colored arrows to highlight some of the problems.

There are ten unwritten carbon atoms in this molecule, one at each vertex of the two hexagons. The red arrow points to a carbon atom that has five sticks or ten electrons on the carbon atom, which is incorrect. The green arrows point to ambiguities that may or may not be incorrect depending upon whether there are additional unwritten hydrogen atoms present. The yellow arrow shows the stick unattached to the hexagon and several ambiguities result. Finally, the OH group should be attached to the molecule with a stick or it should have a minus sign or a dot to indicate whether it is either a negative ion or a free radical.
Climate news articles often have pictures of chalkboards displaying equations, and almost invariably they contain major errors. Next time a chalkboard appears, check it out for the accuracy of the formulas and equations. Most legitimate scientists immediately question the accuracy of an article when they see pictures with incorrect equations. That’s how good scientists work. Wouldn’t it be nice if journalists did the same?

Guest author Kenneth Richard examines the impacts of past volcanoes on climate. The findings will surely be controversial. (Title above is my own). -PG
============================================
Volcanic activity explains long-term climate change better than CO2
By Kenneth Richard
Long-term (decadal and even centennial-scale) volcanic influence on climate has recently gained more and more attention in the scientific literature.  Previously thought to influence surface temperatures for only a few years at a time, there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting volcanic aerosols may significantly affect both short and long-term climate changes by blocking solar radiation from heating the oceans’ surface waters.
When specifying the factors contributing to decadal and centennial-scale temperature changes, solar activity and greenhouse gases are usually thought to top the list. And since 93% of the heat from global warming ends up in the oceans (IPCC, 2013), the focus necessarily should be on what mechanisms contribute most to variations in ocean heat content (OHC) and sea surface temperatures (SST).
Back in 2013, Rosenthal et al. published a paper in Science on millennial-scale ocean heat content variations (Pacific). As the graph (Fig. 4B from the paper) below illustrates, the authors document a dramatic cooling of the 0-700 m layer between the Medieval Warm Period (~1000 CE) and Little Ice Age (1600-1800 CE). While OHC has risen since the depths of the Little Ice Age, modern ocean temperatures are still significantly cooler (-0.65°C) than what they were just 1,000 years ago, or during the Medieval Warm Period.

Source: Meteo.lcd.lu
In a Rosenthal et al 2013 paper, he writes:
We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4°C and 1.5 ± 0.4°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades.”
The causal explanation for this dramatic ocean cooling during the last millennium has generally not been forthcoming from those who attribute variations in temperature/heat content predominantly to variations in carbon dioxide. After all, there was essentially no change in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (which centered around ~275 ppm) between ~1000 CE and 1600-1800 CE, implying that CO2 forcing cannot explain the long-term changes in OHC.
There are literally hundreds of scientific papers that have been published suggesting that tracts of low solar activity (i.e., Oort, Spörer, Maunder, Dalton Minimums) are well correlated with decadal- and centennial-scale cooling periods. It is also well-documented that the Medieval Maximum and Modern Grand Maximum (~1920 to ~2010) of very high solar activity are well correlated with the last two warm periods. However, the solar activity explanation is deemed quite controversial, as it is presumed that long-term variations in the Sun’s energy output are too small to have a significant impact on climate changes.  So as not to veer off track or stumble through this controversy, a more indirect explanation for global warming and cooling trends is succinctly referenced here.
In 2015, the authors of the Pages2k (2013) “global” temperature reconstruction for 0-2000 CE released their Ocean2k record of sea surface temperatures (SST) entitled “Robust global ocean cooling trend for the pre-industrial Common Era“.  Below is the definitive graph from the paper depicting this robust global ocean cooling (which conspicuously conceals the post-1900 SST record). The paper itself indicates that the 1,000-year (kyr) cooling trend for global ocean temperatures changed by a modest ~0.1°C (from about -0.45°C kyr to -0.35°C kyr) with the inclusion of the 1800 to 2000 (“anthropogenic”) SST record:

Source: here.
 McGregor et al., 2015 (Ocean2K):
Our best estimate of the SST cooling trend, scaled to temperature units using the average anomaly method (method 1), for the periods 1–2000 CE is –0.3°C/kyr to –0.4°C/kyr, and for 801–1800 CE is –0.4°C/kyr to –0.5°C/kyr“
While intriguing that the authors of the Ocean2k reconstruction effectively acknowledge that global ocean surface temperatures haven’t fallen out of the range of long-term natural variability when including the last ~200 years, even more interesting is the physical mechanism suggested for this long-term ocean cooling: a centennial-scale decrease in surface incident solar radiation (SSR) via the aerosol dust-veiling effects of “explosive volcanism.”  Here is the summary from the paper’s abstract:
Climate simulations using single and cumulative forcings suggest that the ocean surface cooling trend from 801 to 1800 CE is not primarily a response to orbital forcing but arises from a high frequency of explosive volcanism. Our results show that repeated clusters of volcanic eruptions can induce a net negative radiative forcing that results in a centennial and global scale cooling trend via a decline in mixed-layer oceanic heat content.”
Another 2015 paper by Pausata et al. published in PNAS explains how the direct, short-lived (2 to 3 years) effects of volcanic eruptions indirectly influence major long-term decadal-scale (25-35 years here) ocean oscillations (AMOC, ENSO), which, in turn, heavily influence climate.
Large volcanic eruptions can have major impacts on global climate, affecting both atmospheric and ocean circulation through changes in atmospheric chemical composition and optical properties. The residence time of volcanic aerosol from strong eruptions is roughly 2–3 y. Attention has consequently focused on their short-term impacts, whereas the long-term, ocean-mediated response has not been well studied. Most studies have focused on tropical eruptions; high-latitude eruptions have drawn less attention because their impacts are thought to be merely hemispheric rather than global. No study to date has investigated the long-term effects of high-latitude eruptions. Here, we use a climate model to show that large summer high-latitude eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere cause strong hemispheric cooling, which could induce an El Niño-like anomaly, in the equatorial Pacific during the first 8–9 mo after the start of the eruption. The hemispherically asymmetric cooling shifts the Intertropical Convergence Zone southward, triggering a weakening of the trade winds over the western and central equatorial Pacific that favors the development of an El Niño-like anomaly. In the model used here, the specified high-latitude eruption also leads to a strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the first 25 y after the eruption, followed by a weakening lasting at least 35 y. The long-lived changes in the AMOC strength also alter the variability of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).”
The conclusion that explosive volcanic eruptions – or clusters of smaller eruptions spaced closely together – could have a significant long-term effect on climate is not a new one. Back during the 1960s and 1970s, when scientists were searching for an explanation for the decades-long -0.3°C global cooling trend and its possible connection to droughts and severe weather events, volcanic climate forcing was often recognized as significantly responsible (Benton, 19701; Mitchell, 19702; Budyko, 19693). It was also usually acknowledged that the proportion of human contribution to atmospheric aerosol loading was small (~10%) relative to the predominance of volcanic aerosols (Mitchell, 1970; Cobb, 19734).  More recently, scientists have also confirmed that volcanic eruptions are the  primary source of increases in stratospheric aerosol, and that “no hint for a strong anthropogenic influence has been found” (Neely et al., 20135; Höpfner et al., 20136 ).
Further strengthening this correlation between the presence or absence of volcanic aerosols and long-term cooling or warming trends, consider this key graph taken from Oliver (1976) below (Fig. 1, page 2).

They write:
A period of several decades existed (~1915-1945) in which volcanic activity was unusually light and, as mentioned earlier, the temperatures were higher than the preceding [1880s to 1910s] or, in fact, the subsequent (current) [1950s-1970s] period. … Numerous possible causes of climate change have been discussed in the literature, including both anthropogenic and natural factors. Two principal anthropogenic sources are often considered: changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and changes in tropospheric dust. … Mitchell (1975) concluded that neither tropospheric particulates [anthropogenic pollution] nor atmospheric CO2, in concert or separately, could have accounted for the major part of the observed temperature changes of the past century.”

Notice the remarkable correlation between the warming decades (1915-1945) and the lack of volcanic eruptions during that same period, and then notice the years and decades with several large volcanic eruptions and how these periods correspond with cooling. This appears to suggest that the absence of a physical cooling mechanism – namely, clusters of volcanic eruptions – may effectively be interpreted as a warming mechanism.
This explanation could account for the ocean temperature changes since the 1880s far better than anthropogenic CO2 emissions can. After all, anthropogenic CO2 emissions were flat and low (~1 GtC [gigatons carbon] per year) during the 1915 to 1945 warming period, and they rose dramatically (up to ~5 GtC per year) between the 1940s and 1970s.  This means that as CO2 emissions increased significantly, surface temperatures cooled significantly (1940s to 1970s) – the opposite of what should have been occurring if rising CO2 emissions are largely responsible for global warming.
A more recent depiction of large-scale volcanic eruptions for the last 1,500 years comes from a new paper (Liu et al., 2016) linking global-scale precipitation patterns (monsoons) to large volcanic eruptions. Notice that the dramatic post-Medieval Warm Period centennial-scale ocean cooling described above (Rosenthal et al., 2013, Ocean2k) corresponds closely with frequent clusters of volcanic eruptions. Also, notice how volcanically quiescent the last 80 years of the 20th century have been, which has, on net, allowed more solar radiation to heat the oceans and contribute to global warming.
Liu et al., 2016 finds:
There are 54 large explosive volcanoes during 501–2000 AD in total, and the strongest one is the Samalas volcano in 1257–1258, which is followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268, 1275 and 1284. These strong volcanoes do not allow the climate to recover, and might have triggered the Little Ice Age.”

Chart source: www.nature.com/articles/srep24331/figures/2. 
Other recently-published papers also document a strong correlation between volcanic eruptions and climate changes. Otterå et al. (2010)7 conclude that volcanoes have played a “particularly important part” in directly influencing sea surface temperatures and  in phasing multi-decadal variability for the last 600 years.  Ludlow et al. (2013)8 find 1,200 years of statistically significant (99.7%) associations between cooling events and explosive volcanism for the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Instead of asking what factors are contributing to ocean warming on decadal and centennial time-scales, perhaps there needs to be more of a focus on answering the question of what factors have contributed to the periods of ocean cooling during the last millennium.
Variations in CO2 concentrations or anthropogenic CO2 emissions cannot effectively explain the long-term cooling of the oceans (about -0.35 C per 1,000 years for the last 2,000 years per Ocean2k ). On the other hand, explosive volcanism and its dimming effect on surface solar radiation can much more readily explain decadal- and centennial-scale cooling and warming phases with both its presence (cooling) and absence (warming).

“Climate is variable. In historical times, many significant fluctuations in temperature and precipitation have been identified. In the period from 1880 to 1940, the mean temperature of the earth increased about 0.6°C; from 1940 to 1970, it decreased by 0.3-0.4°C.  Locally, temperature changes as large as 3-4°C per decade have been recorded, especially in sub-polar regions.  … The drop in the earth’s temperature since 1940 has been paralleled by a substantial increase in natural volcanism. The effect of such volcanic activity is probably greater than the effect of manmade pollutants.”
2. Mitchell, 1970
“[V]ariations of human-derived loading are an order of magnitude less than those of volcanic dust loading. For reasonable estimates of the thermal cooling effect of dust load increases, it is inferred that secular cooling due to human-derived particulate loading is currently of the order of 0.05°C per decade. Although changes of total atmospheric dust loading may possibly be sufficient to account for the observed 0.3°C-cooling of the earth since 1940, the human-derived contribution to these loading changes is inferred to have played a very minor role in the temperature decline.”
3. Budyko, 1969
“[A] rise in temperature that began at the end of the last century stopped in about 1940, and a fall in temperature started. The temperature in the northern hemisphere that increased in the warming period by about 0.6oC then decreased by the middle of the fifties by 0.2oC.  A comparatively short-period rise in temperature with smaller amplitude was also observed in the last years of the [19th] century. … Thus, it seems probable that the present changes in the Earth’s temperature are determined mainly by the atmospheric transparency variations that depend on the level of volcanic activity.”
4. Cobb, 1973
“It has been estimated (Squires, 1966; Selezneva, 1966; Hidy and Brock, 1970; Robinson and Robbins, 1970) that the anthropogenic component of the global particulate burden of the atmosphere amounts to 5-12%; not, it would seem a very alarming figure.”
5. Neely et al., 2013
“We employ model runs that include the increases in anthropogenic sulfur dioxide (SO2) over Asia and the moderate volcanic explosive injections of SO2 observed from 2000 to 2010. Comparison of the model results to observations reveals that moderate volcanic eruptions, rather than anthropogenic influences, are the primary source of the observed increases in stratospheric aerosol.”
6. Höpfner et al., 2013
“The increase in the stratospheric aerosol concentration observed in the past years is caused mainly by sulfur dioxide from a number of volcano eruptions. Variation of the concentration is mainly due to volcanoes.  Lower stratospheric variability of SO2 could mainly be explained by volcanic activity and no hint for a strong anthropogenic influence has been found.”

8. Ludlow et al., 2013
“Explosive volcanism resulting in stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosol is a major driver of regional to global climatic variability on interannual and longer timescales. Thirty eight (79%) of 48 volcanic events identified in the sulfate deposition record of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice-core correspond to 37 (54%) of 69 cold events in this 1219 year period. We show this association to be statistically significant at the 99.7% confidence level.”

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Entrepreneur Bill Gates has announced a one billion dollar green tech fund, to try to make renewables fit for purpose.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald;
If successful, the Paris meeting could spur a fundamental shift away from the use of oil, coal and gas to the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. But that transition would require major breakthroughs in technology and huge infrastructure investments by governments and industry.
Where that money would come from has been a question leading up to the Paris talks. Developing countries like India, the third-largest fossil-fuel polluter, have pushed for commitments by developed nations to pay for their energy transition, either through direct government spending or through inexpensive access to new technology.
India has emerged as a pivotal player in the Paris talks. The announcement by Mr Gates appears intended to help secure India’s support of a deal.
As US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton pledged that developed countries would send $US100 billion ($139 billion) annually to poor countries by 2020 to help them pay for the energy transition. Indian officials have demanded that the Paris deal lock in language that the money would come from public funds — a dealbreaker for rich countries.
This summer, Mr Gates pledged to spend $US 1 billion of his personal fortune on researching and deploying clean energy technology, but the people with knowledge of his plans said the new fund would include larger commitments.

This isn’t the first time a project to make renewables viable has been attempted. Back in 2014, WUWT reported about a similar attempt led by Google, which was a total failure.
At the start of RE<C, we had shared the attitude of many stalwart environmentalists: We felt that with steady improvements to today’s renewable energy technologies, our society could stave off catastrophic climate change. We now know that to be a false hope … Renewable energy technologies simply won’t work; we need a fundamentally different approach.”

I applaud Bill’s enthusiasm – who wouldn’t want cheap magic solar panels, which eliminated the need to ever pay another electricity bill. But if the Google experience is any guide, it seems unlikely that another billion dollars will make a significant difference.

I notice someone running advertisements saying that as livestock are greenhouse emitters, we should all become vegetarians.
But this business about blaming livestock for greenhouse gas emissions is nonsense. It’s true that livestock do emit CO2 and/or methane (CH4) – but that’s only part of the story. From where does the carbon come that comprises that CO2 or CH4? From the food that the livestock eat. That is plants, which extract CO2 from the atmosphere. So animals don’t generate carbon products – they simply recycle them. In short, livestock are already carbon neutral. Likewise, so are humans (as far as our eating, burping and farting goes) – we eat either carbon neutral animals, or plants.
In fact if the vegetarians claim livestock are bad with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, then becoming vegetarian makes themselves no better than those animals, because livestock are vegetarians, too!

Long‐​time establishment apologists Norman Ornstein (AEI) and Thomas Mann (Brookings) have generated a lot of ink lately, pro and con, over their claim that our “dysfunctional” government is the fault of Republican “extremists” whose party has become “an insurgent outlier in American politics,” blocking measures for economic recovery, climate change, health‐​care reform, and much else.



Well, for the legal branch there’s a more complex but not much more subtle variation of the Ornstein/​Mann thesis that academic lawyers of the progressive persuasion — I repeat myself — have been peddling in recent years. It’s that “a nascent movement of pro‐​business and libertarian federal judges and think tank activists” have been working for some time to resurrect “a series of legal doctrines that have been dormant since the New Deal,” all “to dismantle the post‐​New Deal regulatory state” and restore something called “the Constitution in Exile.” Coined by D.C. Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg in a 1995 Cato Institute article, that term refers to the limited government Constitution we all pretty much lived under for 150 years, before Franklin Roosevelt’s infamous 1937 Court‐​packing threat cowed the Court into crafting what now passes for “constitutional law” — not to be confused with the Constitution itself.



The legal version of the Ornstein/​Mann thesis is on display in, among many other places, The New Republic of May 4, in George Washington University Professor Jeffrey Rosen’s “Second Opinions,” from which the above quotes are taken. Rosen’s title alludes to the six and a half hours of Obamacare oral argument in the Supreme Court at the end of March — a “train wreck” for those who’d confidently predicted the Act’s constitutionality. But it alludes also, and more immediately, to an opinion that came down two weeks later from the D.C. Circuit, _Hettinga v. United States_. There the three‐​judge panel upheld a 2005 amendment to a complex system of milk marketing price controls dating back to 1937, the effect of which was to penalize an enterprising dairyman for the benefit of cartelized competitors — an egregious assault on economic liberty. As an inferior court, the panel had no choice, due to long‐​standing precedents, but to uphold the statute. But the decision generated a blistering concurrence by Judge Janice Rogers Brown, joined by Chief Judge David Sentelle, “notable not only for its anti‐​statist editorializing,” Rosen writes, “but also because it suggests that the Affordable Care Act will be far from the last federal regulation to be threatened by conservative judicial activism.”



And so we come to the heart of the problem for Rosen and his progressive colleagues — it’s the “conservative judicial activism” against which Obama himself railed after the High Court made it clear that his major legislative accomplishment was constitutionally suspect. Trouble is, though, you’ve got to say more than “activism” if you’re going to make the charge stick; you’ve got to show why, for example, it’s acceptable for judges to defer to the political branches when “mere” economic liberties are at issue, and Rosen’s piece is devoid of any such effort. As the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Tim Sandefur noted, nowhere in his article does Rosen even try to address the substance of the matter. Instead, he gives us a “caricature of a one‐​sided partisan cabal,” Sandefur says. He continues:



 _Rosen finds it easier to draw this conflict as a merely partisan one — and to emphasize not the broader legal debates, not whether or not Judge Brown’s criticism of modern constitutional law has merit, but instead simply to emphasize the vulgar personal benefits that the current, distorted constitutional doctrine brings to a specific class of people, and the risk to their personal income, should these disputes gain an audience at the Supreme Court._



Like the Ornstein/​Mann thesis, then, it’s all politics, not law. And for good reason: that’s what the New Deal constitutional revolution that Ornstein, Mann, and Rosen are defending was all about — politicizing law. This distinction between economic and noneconomic liberties, which so animates Judge Brown’s trenchant concurrence, stems not from the law of the Constitution but from the famous footnote four of the Court’s 1938 _Carolene Products_ decision. The Court drew it to enable the New Deal’s regulatory and redistributive schemes to pass constitutional muster — through a further distinction between “strict” judicial scrutiny, which the Court would give to statutes implicating noneconomic liberties, and “rational basis” scrutiny, which the Court would employ when _economic_ liberties were at issue, a test that in practice has removed virtually all constitutional protection from the kind of political assault Mr. Hettinga endured.



To be clear, it’s not that Rosen is oblivious to these issues — far from it. In fact, he asks why it was that “a relative moderate” like Judge Thomas Griffith, who did not join Judge Brown’s concurrence, would nonetheless “profess himself ‘by no means unsympathetic’ to the views of the most radical partisans of the Constitution in Exile.” He speculates:



 _Perhaps because the terms of legal debate have been so dramatically changed by [Georgetown University Law Professor Randy] Barnett. In less than two years, he has managed to transform the notion that the health care mandate was unconstitutional from a far‐​fetched idea into a principle that may soon be endorsed by all five of the Supreme Court’s conservatives._



Yes, Barnett has made a major contribution to shifting the constitutional debate over the health care mandate; and yes, that debate is just part of a much larger one about the role of the courts in restoring the “Constitution in Exile,” as Rosen goes on to say. But that debate has been going on for far longer than two years, since the mid‐​1970s, even if many in the insulated legal academy have been slow — or disinclined — to acknowledge it. (Cato’s 1984 conference on “Economic Liberties and the Judiciary” is but one example.) As Barnett wrote recently at the Volokh Conspiracy, comparing academic and media commentary on Obamacare:



 _The “mainstream” media coverage of the ACA lawsuits has been remarkably fair and balanced throughout. Not only have they been reporting what both sides say, and accurately conveying the color and substance of oral arguments below, but the reporters seem to have a more sophisticated grasp of the legal arguments — and their relative merits — than is evinced by some law professors._



This reluctance to grapple with the substance — casting opponents as “activists” pursuing a political agenda — comes starkly to the fore as Rosen draws his piece to a conclusion. “If the Roberts Court strikes down health care reform by a 5–4 vote,” he writes, the Court would be “resurrecting the pre‐​New Deal era of economic judicial activism with a vengeance” and returning us to “a time when crusading judges struck down progressive economic regulations in the name of hotly conservative economic doctrines that a majority of the country didn’t favor.”



There you have it. Echoing Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s infamous _Lochner dissent_ , Rosen invites us to believe that the old, pre‐​New Deal Court was invoking _economic, not legal doctrines_ , that the Constitution is neutral on the question of economic arrangements, and that transient majorities can determine those arrangements as they wish, even to the point of cartelizing much of the economy, as progressives have done, and all of that free from any constitutional constraints. That’s politics trumping law with a vengeance, and it undermines the very point of a written constitution.

David Burton has already done a wonderful deconstruction of Bloomberg’s absurd global warming attribution graph, by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi, contrived from data by the notoriously unreliable NASA GISS, purporting to demonstrate that 20th-century global warming was reely ’n’ truly all caused by our sins of emission, honest it was, guv’nor, cross me ’eart an’ ’ope to die.
What that graph really helps to indicate – though its fanatical originators would be horrified if they realized it – is just how little global warming we are likely to see this century, even if no one cuts emissions at all from now on and CO2 concentration continues inexorably to climb.
The usual suspects – such as the British Communist newspapers The Guardian and The Independent, for instance – have been telling us for the past few years that “scientists say” we are on track for 4 C° global warming this century. Well, we aren’t. Here’s why.
Version A of the Bloomberg graph shows the alleged temperature effects of various individual manmade forcings; version B shows the temperature effects of all the individual manmade forcings combined; and version C, scarcely different from B, shows the combined effect of all manmade and natural forcings.

David Burton has already pointed out numerous dodges deployed by GISS in the crafting of this characteristically misleading graph: the truncation of all but the temperature data after 2005 to conceal the rapidly growing and now irremediably serious divergence between prediction and reality, the GISS model’s estimates that in several of the past 100 years the greenhouse forcing actually fell; the model’s use of multiple pseudo-random number generators in the absence of sufficient climate observations; the bizarre choice of a faster greenhouse-gas influence half a century ago than today; the ex-post-facto guesstimates of both individual manmade and combined natural forcings; and the fiddled confidence intervals for greenhouse-gas influences on temperature that are as narrow for 140 years ago as they are for today.
But that’s not all, as the same graph overlaid with the natural 20-to-30-year cooling and then warming phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation reveals. The biggest omission from the GISS/Bloomberg graph is synoptic natural variability. Indeed, the graph goes to some lengths to conceal it, not least by removing the decade-lines (here reinstated). GISS also chose a negative or cooling PDO phase as its 30-year baseline, rather than the near-60-year baseline 1890-1946, which includes a full cooling and then warming phase of the PDO (all PDO dates are from JISAO).
The true baseline is a tenth of a degree above the artificially-chosen GISS baseline that makes the net 20th-century warming look quite a bit more severe than it was.

Note how the cooling phases (starting with green year-lines) show little or no global warming. See also how there was 0.3 C° warming coincident with the PDO warming phase from 1925-1946, when hardly any anthropogenic influence had been felt. See how the 0.7 C° global warming from 1977-2000 coincided with a positive or warming phase of the PDO.
See how little warming there has been since 2000, in the present negative or cooling phase of the PDO, even on the much-fiddled GISS temperature dataset, notwithstanding record increases both in CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration.
In the first PDO-influenced warming period, our influence was not large enough to cause all of the observed warming. Let us assume we caused as much as 0.2 C° of the 0.3 C° warming shown.
In the second PDO-influenced warming period, McKitrick & Michaels (2007) showed that warming over land had been overestimated by double, because the published data show a highly significant regional correlation with growth of population and urbanization that should not have been present if the urban heat-island effect had been properly allowed for. That alone leads to an overstatement of 0.1 C° in global temperature.
In addition, some 0.3 C° of the published terrestrial warming since 1900 arises from data adjustments by NCDC/GISS rather than from a real temperature change. Let us deduct from the record just one-third of that, or 0.1 C°:

Thus, out of the 0.9 C° 20th-century warming, 0.1 C° was natural; 0.1 C° was attributable to inadequate correction for urbanization; and at the very least 0.1 C° arose from over-enthusiastic tampering with the temperature record in a manner calculated artificially to steepen the apparent warming, leaving at the very most just 0.6 C° of anthropogenic warming over the 20th century.
Have we been reasonable in making this estimate of anthropogenic warming to date? We can check by reference to the IPCC’s estimates of total manmade forcings. These, given in Fig. SPM.6 of IPCC (2013), come out at 2.3 Watts per square meter since 1750 (or, effectively, since 1880, since our influence before that date was negligible):

The current best estimate of the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance caused by this forcing but thus far unresolved by increases in atmospheric temperature is 0.6 W m–2, so that the 0.6 C° anthropogenic warming realized to date was driven by the remaining 1.7 W m–2 of radiative forcing, implying a final or post-feedback transient-climate-sensitivity parameter of 0.6/17 = 0.353 Kelvin per Watt per square meter.
Now, the instantaneous or zero-feedback parameter is 0.313 K W–1 m2, and after 100 years the IPCC estimates that this will rise to 0.43 K W–1 m2, or about half, of the 0.86 K W–1 m2 that it expects to obtain at equilibrium.
Given that almost three-quarters of the anthropogenic forcing has arisen in the 70 years since 1950, so that much of the centennial forcing has not yet occurred, the implicit value 0.353 K W–1 m2 that we have derived on the back of an envelope for the transient sensitivity parameter is indeed in the right ballpark, suggesting that 0.6 C° is a reasonable estimate of the anthropogenic warming of the 20th century.
Armed with this information, we can proceed to work out whether we are going to see anything like the imagined 4 C° warming in the next 85 years.
The CO2 forcing for the remainder of the 20th century is 5.35 times the logarithm of the proportionate change in concentration, which is now 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume and, on business as usual, is projected by the IPCC to rise to 0.07%.
Thus, the CO2 forcing would be 5.35 ln 7/4, or 3.0 Watts per square meter. Since the IPCC’s current estimate is that CO2 accounts for five-sixths of all anthropogenic forcings, this should be increased by a fifth to 3.6 W m–2.
Next, one must allow for temperature feedbacks amounting to 1.55 Watts per square meter per Kelvin of direct warming:

That gives equilibrium warming of 1.8 C° as a result of 20th-century forcings.
If the forcings were to occur at once rather than spread over the coming century, only half of this, or 0.9 C°, would occur within a century, and the rest within 1000-3000 years (Solomon et al., 2009).
However, since the forcing will build up slowly over the century, perhaps with a slight increase in the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance as well, in practice only about a third of equilibrium warming is at all likely to appear by 2100. That is just 0.6 C°, of which precisely none has occurred in the first 15 years of the century.
One might add a little to this to allow for some further warming caused by past emissions, or take quite a bit away to allow for the strongly canceling influence from manmade particulate aerosols, the tiny parasols that increase the opacity of the atmosphere and shelter us somewhat from the Sun.
Murphy et al. (2009) go as far as to imagine that the negative aerosol forcing almost cancels out the CO2 forcing altogether.
If they are right, and if the increasing industrialization of China, India and Africa continue to increase particulate aerosols in step with CO2, very little warming can be expected in the 21st century:

So far, every step of our calculation has been rooted in mainstream, established climate science, published data and peer-reviewed papers.
Can one go still further? In one respect, no. As Roy Spencer pointed out with characteristic focus and concision in response to my previous posting, merely because the energy budget diagrams use the Stefan-Boltzmann equation at the Earth’s surface we must not assume that we can derive the Planck climate-sensitivity parameter from them. We must apply the equation at the characteristic-emission surface, which is the locus of all points at or above the Earth’s surface at which, under the assumption of a pre-existing radiative equilibrium, incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes are equal. We cannot take advantage of the far lower surface sensitivity parameter that obtains at the surface.
What if we assume that temperature feedbacks are net-zero, an assumption powerfully suggested by 810,000 years of near-perfect thermostasis, with global temperature varying by little more than 3 C° either side of the long-run mean (a variance about the same as that of your home thermostat)?
The “consensus” would have us believe that the temperature changes of the past 810,000 years, covering an interval of at most 6.5 C°, were driven by tiny forcings amplified by hefty feedbacks. It is no less likely, however, that the forcings from events such as supervolcano explosions and Milankovitch cycles were large and the feedbacks small – perhaps even net-negative.
If the feedbacks were net-zero, the instantaneous and equilibrium warmings in response to the 3.6 W m–2 manmade forcings expected in the remainder of this century, assuming none of the strongly negative forcings from aerosols, land-use changes and ozone effect that the GISS/Bloomberg graph assumes, will simply be 0.313 x 3.6 Watts per square meter, or 1.1 C°, of which about half would arise over a century because the change in concentration is not instantaneous but is spread over the next 85 years.
Result: about 0.5-0.6 C° of global warming, not much different in the medium term from the high-feedback case.
Whichever way you stack it, it is difficult to make a serious case for even 1 C° of anthropogenic warming by 2100, even on business as usual.
I shall probably not be around in 85 years’ time to find out. Yet perhaps the scholars of the future, peering at these postings at WattsUpWithThat, may one day marvel that, armed with nothing more than common sense, an ambition to find the truth rather than make a fast and dishonest buck, a pocket calculator and the simple model in Monckton of Brenchley (2015: just go to scibull.com, the website of the Science Bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and click “Most Read Articles”, as more than 30,000 others have done), we were able to reach a far more reliable estimate of this century’s global warming than the billion-dollar brains of the profiteers of doom.
4 C° global warming by 2100? Fuggedaboudid. Will someone tell the sanctimonious global-government wannabes in Washington DC, London, Bonn, Rome, and – above all – Paris?

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce welcome as a clean alternative for producing energy, wind turbines in Germany are today faced with ever more hostile political and social environments.
As the turbines increase in size, so do their impacts on people and ecosystems that are near them. In the southern German town of Winterlingen hundreds of people recently packed into a sports facility to listen to a talk by sound expert, Dr. Johannes Mayer on the effects of low frequency sound, so-called infrasound, on humans. Ten years ago not even a handful would have shown up. But today as interest in the adverse effects of infrasound from wind turbines are surfacing and becoming a major public issue, citizens who face the possible invasion by a wind park are taking a keen interest in the topic.
According to the online Schwaebische.de here, Mayer issued strong warnings on the adverse health-effects wind turbines can have on people.
Using the available research results, he emphasizes that people do not hear the infrasound emitted by wind turbines, but that they can feel them. “For 20 to 30% of the exposed persons there are massive consequences: The body comes under a state of constant, uninterrupted stress ,” said the speaker. Difficulty sleeping, disturbed concentration and irritability and depressive mood are the consequences says Johannes Mayer.”

The “green” forests of the future?
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Is the artificial tree the solution to climate change? There have been a number of stories advocating artificial trees recently. Proponents of artificial trees believe that normal trees haven’t got the capacity to deliver the CO2 reductions they want. They insist we should try to improve on nature, by replacing natural respiration, with industrial scale absorption and disposal of CO2.
For example, consider the following story;
Is an artificial tree part of the solution to climate change? These guys think so.
… What if we had a way to suck that excess the CO2 right back out of the sky?
Well, actually, we do, says Chris Jones, a chemical engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
“These are our best ways of capturing CO2 from the air,” Jones says as he walks under a canopy of trees on the school’s campus. “Trees evolved over millions of years to do this very efficiently.”
Physicist Klaus Lackner stands beside a miniature greenhouse in his lab at ASU’s Center for Negative Carbon Emissions, in which he’s testing out the properties of his “artificial tree. Lackner says he expects a square mile of artificial trees could suck as much as ten million tons of CO2 a year out of the atmosphere. Credit: Ari Daniel Thing is, we just don’t have enough trees to fix our CO2 problem. In fact, the earth has fewer acres of trees every year. But Jones says that even if we planted trees everywhere we could, they still wouldn’t be able to pull enough CO2 out of the air to offset our emissions.
Which for Jones means one thing. “We have to come up with a chemical tree that can effectively extract CO2 out of the air,” he says.
Essentially mimic nature, only do her one better.

Is it just me, or is there something deeply unsettling about the modern green movement, and its infatuation with technological monstrosities? They build bird frying solar collectors, and bird and bat chopping windmills, to save the birds and bats. They ignore devastating industrial pollution in China, to ensure the supply of Rare Earth elements required to build their wind turbines and electric cars. And now they want to build artificial trees, because they think natural trees aren’t up to the job.
How much of the natural world do greens intend to bulldoze, dig, pave over, pollute, incinerate or slice up, in order to save “nature”?

"“Global warming” is not a global crisis
We, the scientists and researchers in climate and related fields, economists, policymakers, and business leaders, assembled at Times Square, New York City, participating in the 2008 International Conference on Climate Change,

Resolving that scientific questions should be evaluated solely by the scientific method;
Affirming that global climate has always changed and always will, independent of the actions of humans, and that carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a pollutant but rather a necessity for all life;
Recognising that the causes and extent of recently observed climatic change are the subject of intense debates in the climate science community and that oft-repeated assertions of a supposed ‘consensus’ among climate experts are false;
Affirming that attempts by governments to legislate costly regulations on industry and individual citizens to encourage CO2 emission reduction will slow development while having no appreciable impact on the future trajectory of global climate change. Such policies will markedly diminish future prosperity and so reduce the ability of societies to adapt to inevitable climate change, thereby increasing, not decreasing, human suffering;
Noting that warmer weather is generally less harmful to life on Earth than colder:
Hereby declare:
That current plans to restrict anthropogenic CO2 emissions are a dangerous misallocation of intellectual capital and resources that should be dedicated to solving humanity’s real and serious problems.
That there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change.
That attempts by governments to inflict taxes and costly regulations on industry and individual citizens with the aim of reducing emissions of CO2 will pointlessly curtail the prosperity of the West and progress of developing nations without affecting climate.
That adaptation as needed is massively more cost-effective than any attempted mitigation and that a focus on such mitigation will divert the attention and resources of governments away from addressing the real problems of their peoples.
That human-caused climate change is not a global crisis.
Now, therefore, we recommend —
That world leaders reject the views expressed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as well as popular, but misguided works such as “An Inconvenient Truth.”
That all taxes, regulations, and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2 be abandoned forthwith.
Agreed at New York, 4 March 2008

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
__—__   
  
We’ll start out with one of the best quotes we’ve come across in recent memory. It’s from the inimitable Matt Ridley in his piece, ""The Green Scare Problem"" from the _Wall Street Journal_ last week:   




Making dire predictions is what environmental groups do for a living, and it’s a competitive market, so they exaggerate.



Ridley goes on to describe a growingly familiar list of now-failed environmental apocalypses that had been, at one point in time, predicted to befall us—pesticides, ozone hole, acid rain, GMOs, etc. Climate change calamity, as is being pushed by President Obama and the EPA to justify their ever-expanding restrictions of our carbon dioxide emissions, is the latest addition to Ridley’s list. Ridley’s main point is that the “we’re doomed if we don’t do what the environmental pressure groups tell us, and saved if we do” push “has frequently turned out to be really bad advice.” Ridley foresees more of the same from Obama’s Clean Power. We’re inclined to agree.   
  
Be sure to check out Matt’s full column in which he backs up his opinions. It well worth the time spent reading.   
  
When it comes to selling the Clean Power Plan, President Obama and his EPA go to such extreme lengths that they run up against (and often exceed) the bounds of sound science. We’ve addressed many of these transgressions. Climate impact of the Plan? Zilch. Health impacts from the Plan. Non-existent. Economic stimulus of the Plan? Negative. Validity of calling “carbon dioxide emissions” “carbon pollution”? None.   
  
To expand a bit upon the latter, we tracked the historical usage of the phrases “carbon dioxide emissions” and “carbon pollution” in press releases issued by the EPA since 1994. “Carbon dioxide emissions” is the scientifically appropriate description of well, carbon dioxide emissions, while “carbon pollution” is grossly inaccurate and, well, deceptive. Our figure tracks how the EPA has moved away from science and towards propaganda in recent years, no doubt, in concert with the President and his push for limits to carbon dioxide emissions under his Climate Action Plan announced in 2013 (and telegraphed years earlier).

Number of press releases each year since 1994 \(through August 11, 2015\) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which contained either the phrase “carbon dioxide emissions” or “carbon pollution.”](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/carbonpollutionepa.png?itok=2pki_tEZ)

_Figure 1. Number of press releases each year since 1994 (through August 11, 2015) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which contained either the phrase “carbon dioxide emissions” or “carbon pollution.”_



When a straight up telling of the situation fails to impress, try dressing it up with something a bit scarier-sounding.   
  
And finally, if the Obama Administration isn’t going to have its hands full dealing with challenges by states and industries who are opposed to the Clean Power Plan for myriad reasons, it’ll also have to defend itself against a lawsuit from a group of youths who think that the Clean Power Plan doesn’t go far enough:   




They are asking for a court order to force Obama to immediately implement a national plan to decrease atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide to 350 parts per million -- a level many scientists agree is the highest safe concentration permissible -- by the end of this century. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has already hit 400 parts per million.   
  
""It's really important that the court step in and do their jobs when there's such intense violation of constitutional rights happening,"" [Julia] Olson [lead council on the case] said.



Nothing like a lawsuit that is suing for the impossible!
"
"

Isn’t it odd that every proposed “solution” to climate change requires either massive overreach by governments, or mountains of taxpayer’s cash, or most often both?



The biggest, most expensive climate boondoggle foisted on long-suffering taxpayers is without a doubt “renewable” energy. Renewables, their advocates insist, are just great: so great, in fact, that they need the strong arm (not to mention money) of government in order to survive.



A sharp slump in new ­investment in wind and solar farms will continue unless a price is put on carbon or the Renewable Energy Target is extended beyond next year, the Clean Energy Council warns.



How very unusual – a mouthpiece for a rent-seeking industry almost entirely reliant on government handouts to survive is demanding **more** taxpayer’s money.



CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said ­investment in ­renewable energy had dropped by 60 per cent in the past year and declines would continue without government intervention. He said this would put pressure on power prices and ­reliability as coal generators aged.



The comments ignited a ­debate about whether renewable energy was the cheapest form of power, as advocates including Anthony Albanese and Malcolm Turnbull claim.



Anyone who’s watched their power bills spiral into the stratosphere as governments rush to foist renewable energy on us is well aware that Albanese and Turnbull are, not to put too fine a point on it, full of the proverbial. The [same dire scenario](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-deadly-cost-of-green-alarmism/) has played out across the world. Power prices surged in Germany. In Britain, poor households are increasingly suffering “energy poverty” – the inability to afford even basic heating. People are dying as a result.



The Australian government is almost coming to its senses.



Energy Minister Angus Taylor said large-scale renewables ­projects would not receive any further government support. “The clean energy industry has assured us that the cost of renewables is now competitive with alternatives so we would expect investment to continue in the ­absence of subsidies,” he said.



“An industry that is now ­competitive shouldn’t require ­additional subsidies, Mr Taylor said.



And there’s the basic lie of the renewables spruikers (who, like Turnbull, always seem to have purely coincidental, no doubt, ties to the renewable energy industry): **if renewables really ARE so cheap and reliable, WHY do they need government handouts to survive?**



The winners from this end to green-washing ripoff schemes will likely be ordinary consumers, rather than multi-millionaire investors.



Household power prices are set to fall by 7 per cent by 2022, easing several years of bill shocks, as green subsidies are wound up and a flood of new renewable supply enters the electricity grid.



The federal government’s policy adviser said consumers should see a $97 fall in their tariffs over the three years to June 2022.



Falling wholesale costs would be the largest contributor to declining bills, accounting for $62 of the projected total…



Of course, that new supply wouldn’t have been necessary if green-besotted governments hadn’t scrambled to shut down reliable coal-fired generators.



The projected figures would ease the pressure after several years of bill hikes for many Australian households sparked by the closure of the Hazelwood and Northern coal plants in Victoria and South Australia, which created supply shortages and price jumps across the national electricity market.



Government: is there anything they can’t screw up?

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo warming in Andes Mountains since 1950
By Dr.Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German translated by P Gosselin)
The unpopular hiatus just keeps coming up. But climate activists are remaining defiant and continue to deny it exists. They continue to claim that temperature is rising. Yet, the scientific community has long since accepted the pause and has written a series of papers on the phenomenon. For example Vuille et al. 2015:
Impact of the global warming hiatus on Andean temperature
The recent hiatus in global warming is likely to be reflected in Andean temperature, given its close dependence on tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1σ model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO.
65 years without warming
Take a look at Figure 2b of this paper. The blue curve is the temperature development in the extra-tropical Andes. Clear to see: No warming since 1950! That’s a full 65 years without warming. The scientists found a strong influence by the 60-year Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Most people think of scientists as disinterested nerds, doggedly pursuing truth while ignoring the world around them. Many of their spouses likely concur.



Being involved in the grimy political process seems especially divorced from the milieu of science, but not in the highly charged atmosphere of climate science. In fact, my lobby, the American Meteorological Society (AMS), actively recruits scientists to influence policymakers.



While this may appear unseemly, it’s a logical extension of human behavior. If many of us want access to the political process in order to get what we want, why can’t scientists?





In return for the largess of big government, higher education supports big government.



The AMS is now advertising for this year’s “Summer Policy Colloquium”, with an announcement that’s breathtakingly candid. Among other things, participants will “build skills, experience, and contacts they can use throughout their careers to understand and influence the atmospheric policy process”. And who is this pitched to? Here’s a direct cut from this year’s invitation:



Who can attend?



• mid‐​level federal managers and scientists



• mid‐​level private‐​sector executives



• university faculty



• selected graduate students of demonstrated scientific and leadership potential



• (under exceptional circumstances) undergraduate applications will be considered.



Apparently, AMS sees nothing unseemly about federal employees lobbying for their own interests, nor does it have a problem with university scientists, almost all of whom are on the federal dole for a million or so per year, doing the same.



This is a logical extension of what Nobel‐​Prize winner (and Cato Institute scholar) James Buchanan calls “Public Choice”, a theory elucidated in his landmark 1962 book, _The Calculus of Consent_.



Simply put, public choice theory explains how special interests are incentivized to influence the policy process, with much to gain for a few (like atmospheric scientists) at relatively little cost to the rest of us.



Unfortunately, it’s not just the AMS. On February 23, the American Geophysical Union, which covers atmospheric, oceanic and geologic science, transmitted the 14,000-member AMS announcement to its 50,000. And where is the AMS colloquium to be held? At the headquarters of the American Association for The Advancement of Sciences, in downtown Washington. AAAS is the world’s largest scientific society.



The American Geophysical Union is quite candid about the purpose of the colloquium, announcing that participants will “ build a network of contacts and resources that will help them going forward in science policy.”



Does anyone really expect graduates of the AMS program will go to Capitol Hill and argue against spending even more money on the biggest cash cow in the history of the atmospheric sciences, global climate change?



Our “independent” universities are in fact wards of the federal government, and their aspiring faculty are the chattel. Any professor who goes to Washington imperils his future if he lobbies that climate change isn’t the end of the world.



Like it or not, this is the way of our society. In return for the largess of big government, higher education supports big government.



Americans, who are increasingly restive about the cost‐​benefit ratio of college, are quite aware of what is going on, particularly with respect to the issue of climate change. In 2010, Gallup asked people what they thought about news accounts of global warming, with the following question:



 _Thinking about what is said in the news, in your view is the seriousness of global warming generally exaggerated, generally correct, or is it generally underestimated?_



The triplicate nature of the question means that the random expectation would be that one‐​third of us should feel that coverage is exaggerated, correct, or underestimated. In fact, a whopping 48% of respondents say the issue is exaggerated.



Most news stories about global warming are “pegged” to some new scientific publication or federal regulation. Exaggeration is the overhead that we pay for the unseemly marriage between government‐​sponsored science and federal policy that is being encouraged and fostered by our most prestigious scientific societies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLand area gains despite sea level rise: coastal areas have grown 13,500 sq km over past 30 years
By geologist Dr. Sebastian Luning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt.
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On August 25, 2016 there was in Nature Climate Change a small wonder was observed. A team of scientist led by Gennadii Donchyts of the Dutch Deltares Research Institute released a statistic on land area gain and loss in the coastal areas on earth. Given our rising sea levels, a loss of land area was expected. Thus the surprise was even more profound when the official figures were released: coastal regions didn’t shrink, rather they grew by 13,565 sq km over the past 30 years.
That’s a real sensation.
Unfortunately the German media chose to keep silent about it. Inconvenient data that they do not want the public to see. In the publication it is stated:
Earth’s surface gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years, including 20,135 km2 of water and 33,700 km2 of land in coastal areas. Here, we analyse the gains and losses through the Deltares Aqua Monitor — an open tool that detects land and water changes around the globe.
For what is interesting are the figures for the coastal areas (the other figures concern inland bodies of water that are independent of sea level). The calculation is trivial:
33,700 sq km of land gain minus 20,135 sq km of land loss = a net land gain of 13,565 sq km.
The people at the Deltares-Institute did have some fear of the figures. In the original press release, they refrained from presenting this important result:
How the earth has changed over the past 30 years
The world has gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years. The Dutch research institute Deltares developed an open tool that analyses satellite data and visualises land and water changes around the globe. The results were published today in Nature Climate Change.
First global-scale tool that shows water and land conversion
The Deltares Aqua Monitor was developed by Gennadii Donchyts, a remote sensing expert at Deltares. It is the first global-scale tool that shows, with a 30-metre resolution, where water has been transformed into land and vice-versa. The Aqua Monitor uses freely available satellite data and Google Earth Engine, a platform for the planetary-scale scientific analysis of geospatial datasets that is now open to the general public. Gennadii Donchyts: “The Aqua Monitor shows that, around the world between 1985 and 2015, about 173 000 km2, an area about the size of Washington State, has been transformed into land. At the same time, an area of 115 000 km2 has been transformed into water. Both documented and undocumented changes due to man-made interventions, natural variability, and climate change have now been revealed.”
Known versus unknown

While many countries report on dam construction, information about more remote or isolated areas has been lacking. In Myanmar, the Global Reservoir and Dams database shows an increase in the water surface between 1985 and 2010 of about 400 km2. Using the Aqua Monitor, we found 1,180 km2 of new surface water during the same period. The damming of the Rimjin River in North Korea close to the border with South Korea resulted in a storage surface of 12.4 km2 that was actually due to the Hwanggang Dam, which was thought to be located 35 km to the east. These unknown reservoirs may have had a severe impact on the displacement of people and on the ecology. These issues still have to be investigated.
Created by nature or humans
The results of the Aqua Monitor show only the compound impact of natural and human change or variability. It is often hard to tell what has caused a change without determining the details of the local water and sediment budget. While changes in meanders in the Brahmaputra delta are clearly natural, the Mondrian-like shapes near Taiji Nai’er lakes in China are clearly man-made.
Big data at everyone’s fingertips
Universally-available analytics for big satellite data may have major implications for monitoring capacity and associated actions. At the very local scale, members of the general public can now make assessments without expert assistance if their houses are threatened by coastal erosion. At the regional scale, a downstream riparian state can conduct year-to-year monitoring to see whether upstream neighbours are establishing new impoundments. Finally, at the planetary scale, global agencies such as the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction can monitor the appearance of new reservoir storage capacity that may reduce flood hazards.
Jaap Kwadijk, the Deltares scientific director: “This has never been done before. So it is difficult to imagine all the new applications that will be made using this tool. But the tool can be used by everybody and so I am sure multiple applications will emerge in the next few years”.
The BBC took on an approach of transparency and reported explicitly on the land area gain at the coasts:
Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists surprise, coastlines had gained more land – 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) – than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles). “We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,” said Dr Baart. “We’re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.”
Why is the result so? Every geologist learns in the first semesters that deltas expand out into the sea when the rate of sediment buildup is faster than then sea level rise. This appears to be the case here. Sea level rise is too small to lead to a flooding of coastal level areas. The system finds itself in a state of regression as many sand coasts are pushing out slowly into the sea.
Policymakers need to take Geology 101
After the end of the last ice age some 10,000 years ago, the case was very different. Back then sea level rise was multiple times greater than what it is today and coasts were covered by the sea. In geological terms this is called “transgression”. Perhaps political policy makers should be required to take Geology 101 so that they are better able to take part in the climate discussion.

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Rafael Nadal completed a slate of throwback singles finals at the Australian Open, beating Grigor Dimitrov,       (5)   (4)   in a battle of 4 hours 56 minutes that started Friday evening and ended at 12:44 Saturday morning. In Sunday’s final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at  . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by   and serve for the match. On Nadal’s third match point, Dimitrov’s final backhand landed long to end a   rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. “Difficult to describe the emotions,” he said in his   interview. “First of all, I was tired. ” That last point was emblematic of how the   Nadal managed to outlast the   Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already   to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal’s ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov’s   backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal’s attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. “It’s never easy to lose a match like that,” Dimitrov said. “I’m happy, though, with a lot of things. I’m going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he’s such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I’m in a good way, I’m on the right path. ” Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former   player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a   major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won. He last reached a final in Melbourne earlier that year, losing to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal has missed large stretches of competition in recent years because of various injuries, including a wrist ailment that forced him out of the French Open and Wimbledon last year. “I never, ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, the second tournament of the year, after a lot of months without competing,” Nadal said on the court after the match. “But here I am, and I feel lucky, and I feel very, very happy. ” Sunday’s match will be the ninth Grand Slam final between Federer and Nadal, and their second here. In their previous one in 2009, Nadal beat Federer,       (3)     a match perhaps best remembered for Federer’s tearful   speech in the trophy ceremony. That final was also preceded by an epic semifinal for Nadal, who needed 5 hours 14 minutes to put away Fernando Verdasco in five sets. Federer, the No. 17 seed, needed five sets Thursday to take his semifinal against Wawrinka, but that match was nearly two hours shorter than Nadal’s win Friday. Nadal has won 23 of 34 matches against Federer, and 9 of 11 meetings at Grand Slam events. Nadal’s 14 Grand Slam titles is second among active players, behind Federer’s 17. Federer has not won a major tournament since Wimbledon in 2012. “It’s special to play with Roger again in a final of a Grand Slam,” Nadal said. “I cannot lie. It’s great. It’s exciting for me, and for both of us, that we’re still there and we’re still fighting for important events. ” The women’s final Saturday night also will feature the two active players with the most Grand Slam singles titles, with the   winner Serena Williams meeting her sister, the   winner Venus Williams. This is the first Grand Slam tournament in the Open era in which all four singles finalists are 30 or older."

Does it feel like you’re walking on eggshells lately when talking about politics? You’re not alone. A new national survey of 2,000 Americans I conducted at the Cato Institute finds that 62 percent of Americans say the political climate these days prevents them from saying what they believe because others might find it offensive. This share is up from 58 percent in 2017.



Notably, self‐​censorship is not a partisan issue. Majorities of Democrats (52 percent), Independents (59 percent), and Republicans (77 percent) all agree they have political views they are afraid to share.



 **Only Far Left Feels Free to Express Political Opinions**



Only staunch progressives reach a majority (58 percent) who feel free to speak their minds. But centrist liberals disagree: a slim majority (52 percent) feel they _cannot_ say what they believe in the current environment—up from 45 percent in 2017. Yet, just a few years ago, liberals felt they could openly express themselves (54 percent). In fact, nearly all political groups are self‐​censoring more today.



Could this simply be people self‐​censoring bigotry and prejudice? Perhaps for some. But the survey found that large majorities or near majorities of people across race, sex, and income all feel like they can’t say what they believe. That means this effect is not simply concentrated in one identity group, but pervasive across all.



The survey found that nearly two‐​thirds of Latino Americans (65 percent), Asian Americans (65 percent), white Americans (64 percent), as well as nearly half (49 percent) of African Americans, feel uneasy sharing their views. Similarly, both men (65 percent) and women (59 percent) self‐​censor.



Some may ask, perhaps the 62 percent are simply being polite and avoiding unnecessary offense? This is likely true for some. But the survey data offer some warnings against this interpretation.



Causing offense isn’t the only thing people are worried about. Many are concerned about their livelihoods and ability to provide for their families. 



Self‐​censorship is on the rise since 2017. It’s up 12 points among progressives (30–42 percent), and up 7 points among centrist liberals (45 to 52 percent), moderates (57 percent‐​64 percent), and centrist conservatives (70–77 percent). Only staunch conservatives haven’t changed much, perhaps because 76 percent said they were already self‐​censoring three years ago.



Also, consider how the question was asked. Respondents were asked if the _political climate_ prevented them from saying things they believe because others might find their ideas offensive. It did not ask if standards of decency and politeness prevented them from being rude.



Also, centrist liberals flipped from feeling free to express themselves (54 percent) in 2017 to now feeling they no longer can (52 percent) in 2020. These data align with the largely liberal signatories of the Harper’s open letter defending political expression and criticizing cancel culture. These writers and scholars were not decrying being polite, but the spread of an illiberal zeitgeist that restricts free thought and discourse.



 **One‐​Third Worry about Their Views Affecting Careers**



Causing offense isn’t the only thing people are worried about. Many are concerned about their livelihoods and the ability to provide for their families. Almost one‐​third (32 percent) of employed people say they worry they could get fired or miss out on job opportunities if their political views became known.



It’s not just one side of the political spectrum who feels this way. Similar shares of liberals (31 percent), conservatives (34 percent), and moderates (30 percent) are all worried about their jobs. These fears cut across demographics as well: 38 percent of Hispanic Americans, 31 percent of white Americans, 22 percent of African Americans, 27 percent of women, 35 percent of men, 36 percent of people earning less than $20,000 annually, and 33 percent of those earning more than $100,000 annually all fear “cancel culture.”



People with more education are more likely to worry about their politics affecting their career trajectory. But Republicans and Independents are driving the difference. Sixty percent (60 percent) of Republicans and 49 percent of Independents with post‐​graduate degrees fear being penalized at work if their political opinions became known, compared to 25 percent of Democrats with post‐​graduate degrees. Less of a gap exists between Republicans (27 percent), Democrats (23 percent), and Independents (18 percent) with high school diplomas.



It could be that the industries that employ more people with college and post‐​graduate degrees are lopsidedly left‐​of‐​center, leading independents and Republicans to self‐​censor. It could also be that independents and Republicans learn in college and especially in graduate school that their political views are penalized.



 **Left Especially Supports Firing Opposition Donors**



Are people overreacting? Perhaps not. The survey found that nearly one‐​third (31 percent) of Americans would support firing a business executive who personally donated to Donald Trump’s campaign. This share rises to 50 percent among staunch progressives. It’s not just the far left willing to punish their political adversaries. Almost one‐​quarter (22 percent) of all Americans and 36 percent of staunch conservatives would support firing Biden donors as well.



Although most Americans _overall_ oppose firing either Trump or Biden donors, it’s important to recognize that many industries and regions may be comprised of people with rather homogenous political views. Take, for instance, industries like academia, media, Hollywood, and tech, which overwhelmingly employ people who are left of center. Or industries like mining, oil and gas, home building, automotive, and construction that are largely right of center.



Even within industries, you can find clusters of political homogeneity. For instance, The New York Times reports that 77 percent of infectious disease specialists are registered Democrats while 67 percent of surgeons are registered Republicans. So an industry that slants left or right could reach a majority (or close to it) in favor of firing Trump or Biden donors in their midst.



 **‘Cancel Culture’ Isn’t New**



In his 1940 essay, “On Freedom,” Albert Einstein argued that scientific progress depends on open discourse, and that “laws alone cannot secure freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance.” This spirit of tolerance goes beyond constitutional protections from government censorship. Private censorship can also raise the cost of expression and thereby stifle open discourse.



Although the principles of free expression and tolerance are deeply engrained in American culture, many throughout American history have resisted this pluralistic approach. In other words, so‐​called “cancel culture” is not new. Political scientists have long documented this urge in American political life, found on both the left and right.



Dating back to the early 1970s, the General Social Survey found that 60 percent of Americans supported firing a communist college professor, 52 percent supported firing an “anti‐​religionist” professor, and 48 percent thought a gay professor shouldn’t be allowed to teach at a university. Notably, there wasn’t much difference between Democrats and Republicans.



For example, in 1973, 53 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats thought a gay person shouldn’t be allowed to teach at a university. Although far fewer today, substantial shares continue to support severe economic penalties for professors who are gay (11 percent), communist (31 percent), or against organized religion (31 percent).



 **Why Some People Want to Punish Others for Their Ideas**



Why do some want to inflict severe punishment on their fellow Americans over political disagreements? This desire to silence one’s political opponents is separate from efforts to marginalize overtly bigoted speech and behavior—efforts most Americans support. But what explains the psychological motives behind cancel culture that increasingly capture innocent people and shut down political discourse?



Research in political psychology has found some personality styles are more demanding of conformity and more willing to squash dissent. In academic parlance, it’s called the “authoritarian personality.” (See here, here, and here.)



In response to World War II, academics tried to identify what personality types would be drawn to totalitarian ideologies. Much of this research inappropriately ascribed the authoritarian personality near‐​exclusively to the political right. However, new research is finding evidence that there is both a left‐​wing and right‐​wing variant of the authoritarian personality.



Thus, these authoritarian tendencies may manifest in different ways and in reaction to different issues, but there appear to be some core psychological tendencies shared between left‐​wing and right‐​wing “authoritarians.” Observing how both groups think alike can help pinpoint the core features of this illiberal style in American politics.



Surveys that identified left‐​wing and right‐​wing “authoritarians” found that both scored significantly higher on psychological measures of dogmatism, confirmatory thinking, moral disengagement, need for closure, affective polarization, political certainty, and tolerance of political violence, and both scored significantly lower on intellectual humility.



In other words, Americans with left‐​wing or right‐​wing authoritarian tendencies are more likely to be dogmatically rigid and eschew nuance. A key feature is a failure to recognize the possibility that some of what they assume, observe, or interpret might be wrong. They tend to believe they have all the facts.



Partly contributing to this is the tendency to discount or ignore disconfirming evidence. But it’s more than just rigid, confirmatory thinking. “Authoritarians” begin to dehumanize their political opponents, assume the worst possible of intentions, lack compassion for them, and then rationalize and even support harm against them. While each of these tendencies independently may not mean someone has authoritarian inclinations, these traits combined make one more likely to seek to squash political dissent when threatened.



Threat, particularly ideological threat, is the necessary ingredient to activate people with latent authoritarian tendencies and motivate their desire to punish others. Social media may have a catalyzing effect in activating latent authoritarianism on left and right, as it constantly barrages people with ideas, images, and videos that threaten their ideological boundaries, norms, and authorities. In short, some social media companies could be making Americans more authoritarian.



 **Why We Should Care**



There are many reasons to resist this authoritarian urge to squash dissent. The first is that scientific progress, and by extension, the improvement of human well‐​being generally, requires free thought and open discourse. As Jonathan Rauch explains in his book, “Kindly Inquisitors,” the scientific method breaks down when people become reluctant to ask questions, be creative, challenge each other, and seek out and understand evidence.



Further, as Thomas Chatteron Williams explained in a New Yorker interview, the culture of canceling signals to people what the boundaries of “acceptable” ideas are or else suffer severe economic and emotional punishment. Thus many “steer far clear of the boundary,” causing a “narrowing…stifling effect on not just speech but on thought,” he explained.



Yet silencing people and stifling free thought isn’t an effective long‐​run strategy. It rarely _changes minds._ It just shuts down civil discourse and prevents people from having opportunities to modify their ideas in the face of new information. Instead, people hold onto their opinions, and just sweep them under the rug.



Political opponents’ disengagement doesn’t necessarily mean victory. Americans still vote. And their political views, silent or expressed, affect how they vote. Persuasion is necessary to change how people think and thus who and what they vote for. But persuasion is hard and requires open dialogue.



Social psychologists have found evidence that we aren’t very good at updating our opinions by ourselves. We need other people we respect to ask us to explain our views and then challenge us with new considerations. It’s typically through this back and forth process that we update our views when people we trust present us with new, compelling information.



But this only works when we feel comfortable to engage in a dialogue. Thus it is only with open dialogue that people’s opinions can be examined, understood, or reformed. Thereby, the best long‐​term strategy is persuasion, not silencing. And persuasion requires open debate.



I propose we take this wise advice from social psychologist Jonathan Haidt: let us first try to “give less offense” and then let us make efforts to “take less offense” ourselves.

So Grant Robertson has [announced a massive spend up on roads](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/119117899/why-all-new-labour-roads-lead-to-grant-robertson-as-huge-new-funding-package-announced?cid=app-iPhone), especially in the north. On top of that, he’s given a sop to the Greens giving them $200m for decarbonisation but **$690m** for 22km of road to **NZ First**. Which one matters most? Clearly there is a disconnect between their green statements and the reality of having to build more roads. 



Grant Robertson has been a man out to prove himself. Labour ministers of finance feel the pressure to show the markets, the punditocracy – and possibly themselves – that they are just as fiscally responsible as National Party ministers in the same position.



Robertson, the son of a Presbyterian accountant, has done precisely that.



Luke Malpass, the writer of that piece, could easily have accurately described Robertson as[ the son of a convicted fraudster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Robertson#Early_life) and, based on what has been announced in the package, it really is a fraud on the taxpayers by Robertson.



So, having put in the ground work, he has now acceded to both pressure and reality and attempted to make a virtue of it, steering a [$12 billion infrastructure package](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/119121503/projectbyproject-where-the-infra-package-will-be-spent-around-nz) ($8b of announced spending, plus **$4b to be rolled out over the coming years) covering new roads, rails, hospitals and schools.** Some projects are expected to be approved by the end of 2020. Others are further out.



It **includes an emphasis on roads** , **reversing both the Government’s rhetorical and erstwhile ideological opposition to new highways.** Robertson knows that **electric vehicles will still need roads** and that public transport can’t easily help deliver goods to shops, kids to swimming practice, or take families on holiday. The Government sees climate change as important, but recognises that roads need not be a zero-sum villain in its efforts to cut emissions. 



It’s a fraud. They are spending up on roads that National had already allocated funds for and **the government cancelled.** Now three years later they are rolling it out as if it is new spending, and worse there has been a hiatus of three years while they dithered. No surprises that the Transport minister is **Phil Twyford**.



The announcement is also a useful political tool by which Labour can distance itself from the Greens in an election year. Twenty minutes after the plans were announced, Greenpeace denounced them as missing “an opportunity to clean up New Zealand’s transport system”.



Yet that notwithstanding, this will be disappointing for the Greens: they specifically got only $200 million for infrastructure decarbonisation, in a multi-billion package. 



There is also more money being spent on [schools and hospitals infrastructure](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/119105125/government-announces-billions-of-spending-with-roads-the-big-winner).



In comparison, NZ First gets $690m for a 22-kilometre road in Northland. Politically this is simple: NZ First’s return to Parliament is more important to the Government’s re-election prospects than if the Greens lift their party vote a bit.



Of course, all three Government parties will claims [ _sic_ ] credit for every cent spent on rail.



You’ve got to hand it to **Winston** , he seems to be a far better negotiator than the Greens and continually delivers for his constituency. This package shows that the green rhetoric from **Ardern** is just like everything else she says: a bumper sticker slogan with no real policy depth to back it up. No matter which way it is spun, you are left with the impression that NZ First and roads matter a lot more to Labour than the Greens and their nonsense.



Robertson is clever however because National can only come out and say “We will do it too, just a bit better”. I don’t know about you but “Vote National, not as shithouse as Labour” doesn’t seem to be a winning electoral proposition to me.



 **The National Party is inevitably countering that this is the Government simply reinstating National’s roading plans that it had initially ditched** when it came to office. And into the bargain, it argues, the Government has smashed both confidence and the procurement pipeline that big infrastructure companies rely on. It has argued, and will continue to argue, that Labour doesn’t really “believe” in roads.



The Government, and Robertson, won’t be overly worried by these claims. It figures that people only care about what will actually be built and how it will help them get to where they need to go, not how the Government got there. 



One thing is for sure, the winner of the infrastructure retail politics battle will set themselves up well for September’s election.



This is where the power of incumbency kicks it. The government has all the resources of government at their disposal. This was pointed out before the last election when some National backbenchers thought the best option was to lose, to clean out the old guard of National. That was a defeatist attitude that cedes power. Those same fools are saying the same thing with regards to the leadership of Simon Bridges. They’d rather see him lose than win power because it would get him and Paula Bennett out of the way. But it admits that they want to spend another 3 years in the wilderness. 



The power of incumbency is hard to defeat. Oppositions don’t win elections, governments lose them, and Jacinda Ardern will likely make a better case to continue than Bridges will make to change. Having a policy platform in almost every main instance that is similar to Labour but slightly better at delivery isn’t enough to win power. 



Advantage: Labour, right now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite hyped claims, much doubt has emerged over the years on whether or not renewable energies such as wind and sun would able to substitute fossil and nuclear energy.

Europe’s PV energy systems are not working out, new study finds. Photo: Prof. Knut Löschke. Source: www.eike-klima-energie.eu/. 
Getting a sound answer to that question naturally would have been a reasonable step to take long before countries rushed to invest tens of billions of euros in solar in cloudy northern Europe.
A brand new paper by Swiss researchers Ferruccio Ferroni and Robert J. Hopkirk published by the Journal of Energy Policy now further intensifies that doubt, finding that solar power remains an inefficient way to produce energy in most cases. It’s beginning to appear that Europe has wasted tens of billions of euros in a mass energy folly.

Thus it should not surprise anyone that Germany’s fossil fuel consumption has not been falling over the past years.
The paper’s abstract states:
Many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy. However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.
So is solar energy a worthwhile alternative in places like Europe? The authors conclude that it is not. They write in the conclusion that “an electrical supply system based on today’s PV technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather a non-sustainable energy sink” and that “it has become clear that photovoltaic
 energy at least will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel“.
The authors add that “photovoltaic technology would not be a wise choice for helping to deliver affordable, environmentally favourable and reliable electricity regions of low, or even moderate insolation“.
Sounds like much of Europe has wasted very huge sums of money.

"WASHINGTON  —   Vice President Mike Pence will speak on Friday to a gathering of   activists on the National Mall, a sign of the movement’s new and growing authority in a government now dominated by Republicans. The organizers for the event, the March for Life, had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence. A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers. Mr. Pence’s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year. Mr. Trump has said his pick, like Mr. Scalia, would oppose abortion rights, one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure. Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, have spoken to the march, but remotely.   leaders see the Trump administration’s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration. The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official, Kellyanne Conway, at the march is hard to overlook. Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant   leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a    role model for religious conservatives. Mr. Trump’s pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause. They include a vow to sign a nationwide ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and a commitment to ensuring that his Supreme Court appointments are against the procedure."

"**Some Tigrayans in Ethiopia have described to the BBC how they have been harassed, detained or discriminated against since fighting began in their home region on 4 November.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has emphasised that the conflict in the northern Tigray region is against a ""criminal clique"" within the dominant party there, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), but reports from elsewhere in the country suggest there is an ethnic dimension to the crisis.
Tigrayans make up around 6% of the Ethiopia's more than 110 million people and many live outside their regional state.
The government has denied that there has been ethnic profiling and said any action carried out against individuals was for justified security reasons.
Some in the security forces have told the BBC that they have been disarmed and ordered to stay at home.
One of those was a female officer who had been working as a policewoman for more than 20 years, but was once a member of the TPLF, which was originally a militia force.
She said that two days after the fighting began, she received a call from a superior who asked her to report to the office the next day.
On her arrival she was ""ordered to hand over all government property and my firearm"".
She added that some high-ranking officials, who were also Tigrayan, were given the same strict order.
The government has not commented on the allegation that police officers have been disarmed because of their ethnicity.
But speaking about the issue in general, Mamo Mihretu, a senor adviser to the prime minister, told the BBC that ""taking law-enforcement measures based on ethnicity and identity is something that we take seriously and would condemn - this is not acceptable"".
However ""there is a clear instruction to the security agencies to take their measures based on risk and actionable intelligence"", he said adding that it was aimed at ""hardliners - disgruntled and reactionary elements of the TPLF"".
Since coming to power in 2018, the prime minister has tried to emphasise national unity while also respecting the identities and rights of the different groups which govern the country's 10 ethnically based federal states.
But the fallout from this conflict has exposed the difficulties of maintaining that position.
The BBC has also heard from a federal soldier of 14 years' experience who alleged he and others were singled out because they were Tigrayan in what he described as ""shocking"" treatment.
He said he was detained in a warehouse by his fellow soldiers with nearly 90 other Tigrayan members of the armed forces. They had their phones confiscated and were ""treated as prisoners of war"", he alleged.
""It was only the Tigrayans who were disarmed and detained together. So, it's obviously based on our ethnicity,"" added the soldier, who wanted to remain anonymous.
When those detained challenged the people who were holding them ""they said: 'The TPLF attacked our [base in the north] and this order to detain you came from the top'"", he told the BBC.
Among those held were veterans of the TPLF's struggle against Marxist dictator Mengistu Hailemariam, who was toppled in 1991. The TPLF then became the dominant political force in the whole country but say they were sidelined by Mr Abiy when he came to power in 2018
Others were high-ranking military officials, some of whom had spent time in the African Union force in Somalia, he said.
""I had never imagined those people who had relentlessly served the national army and their country would be treated this way.""
He later managed to escape from the warehouse, disguise himself as a civilian and flee to a neighbouring country, from where he spoke to the BBC.
He said that as he was crossing the border, he was careful to hide his Tigrayan accent so as not to arouse suspicion, adding that he fears for the lives of his comrades who he left behind in the warehouse.
Others sources have told the BBC that many Tigrayans, who are either current or former members of the armed forces, have been detained or have had their homes searched, and some put under house arrest.
When asked for comment, Chief-of-Staff Gen Berhanu Jula told the BBC that this was ""a political matter"" and he was not in a position to respond.
This allegation of ethnic profiling is not limited to members of the military and the police.
A Tigrayan civilian, who asked to remain anonymous fearing for her safety, told the BBC that last week a group of armed people, who appeared to be members of the security forces, came to her home, searched it thoroughly, seized bank statements and took away her father, who makes his living as a driver.
She said he was then held for two days and was accused of having ""travelled to Tigray with six million birr ($160,000; Â£120,000) and returning to Addis Ababa with weapons"".
She disputed this and said that his work driving tourists took him all over the country. The accusation has now been dropped.
The issue has also allegedly affected some state-run organisations such as the national carrier Ethiopian Airlines.
Several Tigrayan employees there have been forced to take leave until further notice or work from home, sources at the airline told the BBC. Ethiopian Airlines did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
**More on the Tigray crisis:**
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) recently said that a police officer asked staff at its branch office in the Amhara region to give details of their employees including birthplaces.
The WFP said the information was not available and then confirmed with the regional police that the request was not part of official policy.
The federal government described reports that this was related to ethnic profiling as ""a complete misrepresentation of the event"". It said the police officer was acting on specific intelligence that TPLF ""operatives [were] embedded and active within various local and international organisations within the country"".
It added that the police officer had a list of names and went to the WFP office to see if anyone on the list worked there.
It is clear that the security operation does not only concern what is happening in Tigray itself as the federal authorities are worried about TPLF sympathisers elsewhere.
But people who have spoken to the BBC have said that they have been singled out because of their ethnicity rather than anything they may have done.
If the conflict is short-lived then concerns about ethnic tensions may go away but if it proves to be protracted then there are fears that life for Tigrayans outside Tigray may become more difficult.
Despite seeing the TPLF as a blockage in the plan to achieve national unity, the impact of the conflict could prove to be a major challenge to the prime minister's vision of bringing the country together.
""If there is anything that the government is doing, it's to create a society that emphasises the ties that bind all of us,"" his adviser Mr Mamo told the BBC.
But the conflict in Tigray could threaten that goal."
"Last year Lehman Brothers released a report about climate change. High profits from the Kyoto carbon trade scheme was the essence of it. It met with the applause of politicians, the entire media and the greens. PM Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull were very keen on it and remain so.
Lehmans predicted the climate 100 years ahead. Green militants have been using the Lehman report as a proof of global warming and impending chaos.
Lehmans scientific advisor is James Hansen, Al Gore’s scientific adviser.
The report is driving climate change policy in Europe, Argentina and several other countries; it is used by economy professors playing being climatologists; by newspapers editorials and essays and even by a U. S. State Secretary.
But Lehmans couldn’t even predict their own demise less than a month ahead, though there were many people that had been warning about this present crash for years.
Lehman’s failure provides a preview of our future if more nations and companies bank their future on the speculative advice of these advocacy scientists, politicians and environmental groups, while ignoring common sense.
If we let them, our politicians will drive the nation to bankruptcy, using the policies that have destroyed Lehmans.
China and India have been and remain much more sensible.

According to recently published scientific papers, the current sea level highstand, as well as the rate of glacier retreat and sea level change, are now significantly lower than they have been for much of the last 10,000 years — back when CO2 concentrations were stable and considerably lower (at about 265 ppm).

A flurry of new papers show today’s sea level rise is slower than in the Holocene past. Photo Tiago Floreze, CC BY-SA 3.0.
The most recent IPCC report (2013) indicates that sea levels have been rising at a rate of 1.7 mm/year, or 6.7 inches per century, since 1901 (through 2010).  This rate occurred synchronously with an approx. 100 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.
In contrast, scientists Hodgson et al., 2016 have determined that sea levels rose at rates of 1.2 to 4.8 meters per century (47 to 188 inches, or about 4 to 16 feet per century) between about 10,500 and 9,500 years ago near East Antarctica.  This sea level rate change occurred while CO2 levels were stable to modestly declining *.
In the paper: Rapid early Holocene sea-level rise in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica, the authors write:
Prydz Bay is one of the largest embayments on the East Antarctic coast and it is the discharge point for approximately 16% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. […] The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP [calendar years before present].”
The recently published scientific literature also indicates that not only was the historical rate of sea level rise significantly higher than it has been since the 20th century began, glaciers and ice sheets continued to rapidly retreat during the late Holocene, or within the last few thousand years.  During the Medieval Warm Period, for example, scientists Guglielmin et al., 2016 determined that glacier retreat rates in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were as high or higher than they have been in recent decades.
In the publication here, the authors write:
Here, we present evidence for glacial retreat corresponding to the MWP [Medieval Warm Period] and a subsequent LIA [Little Ice Age] advance at Rothera Point (67°34′S; 68°07′W) in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. … Based on new radiocarbon dates, during the MWP, the rate of glacier retreat was 1.6 m yr−1, which is comparable with recently observed rates (~0.6 m per year between 1993 and 2011 and 1.4 m per year between 2005 and 2011).”
Prior to the Medieval Warm Period, scientists Yokoyama et al., 2016 indicate that “the world’s largest ice shelf” collapsed due to a warming ocean and atmosphere, with ice shelf retreat rates of 100 km within a thousand years.
In the publication Widespread collapse of the Ross Ice Shelf during the late Holocene, the authors write:
The Ross Sea is a major drainage basin for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains the world’s largest ice shelf. … Breakup initiated around 5 ka [5,000 years ago], with the ice shelf reaching its current configuration ∼1.5 ka [1,500 years ago]. In the eastern Ross Sea, the ice shelf retreated up to 100 km in about a thousand years. … [I]ce-shelf breakup resulted from combined atmospheric warming and warm ocean currents impinging onto the continental shelf.”
According to other scientists Bradley et al., 2016, the melt water from the Antarctic ice sheet continued to contribute up to 5.8 meters of sea level rise equivalent until about 1,000 years ago.
In another recent paper here the authors found:
…a slowdown in melting at ∼7 kyr BP associated with the final deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by a continued rise in ESL [Holocene ice volume equivalent sea level] until ∼1 kyr BP of ∼5.8 m associated with melting from the Antarctic Ice Sheet.”

Due apparently to the high glacier-melt rates and warmer ocean temperatures (Rosenthal et al. [2013]** indicate that 0-700 m Pacific Ocean temperatures were still ~0.65° C warmer than present ~1,000 years ago), recently published scientific papers document that sea levels stood from 1 to 4 meters higher than now as recently as a few thousand years ago (see citations below).
The big mystery
These scientific conclusions beg the question: If CO2 is a primary determinant of changes in sea level, why is it that sea level highstands (and sea level rise and glacier melt rates) were significantly greater when CO2 concentrations were stable and low than they have been in recent decades?

The configuration suggests surface inundation of the upper sediments by marine water during the mid-Holocene (c. 2–8 kyr BP) [2,000-8,000 years before present], when sea level was 1–2 m above today’s level.

Human settlements were common on the ridge crests before and after the highstand. Regression to present-day sea level commenced after the highstand, which is when the sabkha began forming.”

"**Hong Kong has released the murder suspect whose case led to plans to change extradition rules which then triggered the city's mass protests.**
Chan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law.
He was in jail for withdrawing money from her credit card after she died.
Walking free on Wednesday after 19 months in prison, the 20-year old apologised to the victim's family for the great ""pain and agony"" he caused them.
""I am willing to surrender myself,"" he said, adding he was willing to ""go back to Taiwan to face the trial and serve the sentence"".
Hong Kong and Taipei have clashed though over how he should be transferred to face the murder charges. It is unclear what the next steps will be.
While Hong Kong said Mr Chan was free to go to Taiwan and surrender himself, Taiwan cited security concerns and wants to send officers to escort him - a proposal that Hong Kong has rejected.
The proposed extradition bill would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to places it doesn't have an extradition treaty with, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.
Critics of the planned law feared that extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials.
The controversial bill was formally withdrawn on Wednesday.
After the bill sparked city-wide protests, the government announced in July that it would suspend the bill.
The formal withdrawal could only take place after parliament resumed in October.
Last week, parliament proceedings were interrupted when opposition lawmakers heckled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
Although the Hong Kong protests started over the extradition bill, they have since widened to call for full democracy and less interference from Beijing."

As previously noted at WUWT, over at the COLA/IGES website, they had this response to the disappeared letter to the Obama administration calling for RICO act investigations of climate skeptics:

WUWT reader Dean P. writes in comments on the WUWT story from earlier today:
The updated website says that they’ve been planning to shut down IGES for over two years now. That makes no sense since in October 2013 they were awarded NSF Grant #1338427, which started in May 2014 and is expected to continue into 2017. Does that mean they were planning to shutter the doors while they were still applying for grants? Did they tell the NSF that they planned on shutting down?
As others have said – something smells fishy…
Fishy? I’ll say, that award was updated in June 2015, to the tune of over 4 million dollars (yellow highlights mine):

It seems this is an active grant, good for another two years. It is important to note the name James Kinter in that NSF page, who is part of the Shukla nepotism empire:
IGES Personnel:
President Shukla, Jagadish
Business Manager Shukla, Anastasia
Assistant Business Manager Shukla, Sonia
Director, COLA Kinter, James
Assistant to the President Shukla, Sonia

…and so far, that four million dollar plus NSF grant has produced only one paper. From the NSF grant page:

ABSTRACT

This award provides continued funding for the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA). COLA is a climate science research center established to explore, establish and quantify the variability and predictability of Earth’s climate variations on seasonal to decadal time scales, and to harvest this predictability for societally beneficial predictions. The Center is jointly funded by NSF, NOAA and NASA.
Work supported through this award includes activities devoted to 1) basic research on predictability on intraseasonal, seasonal, interannual, and decadal timescales; 2) evaluation of the predictability, skill, and fidelity of US national climate models; and 3) contributions to the development of next generation seamless prediction systems. Research performed under item 1 includes testing of land data assimilation schemes in multiple models, performing hindcasts of El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events investigate inter-event diversity of ENSO, performing dynamical prediction experiments for the Indian monsoon, and determining the dependence of drought probability on surface boundary conditions including land cover change. Work under item 2 focuses on the use of optimal spatial structures derived from information theoretic analysis, which represent the most predictable modes, or modes for which predictability differs the most between two models. This activity is intended to support climate prediction efforts at US national centers and contribute to COLA’s research-to-operations effort. Work under item 3 involves collaborators at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and includes the development of optimal methods of initializing high-resolution coupled models including version 2 of the Coupled Forecast System (CFSv2), a model used operationally at NCEP.
The work has broader impacts due to its focus on research leading to improved climate prediction, given the substantial societal consequences of climate variability and change. In addition, COLA benefits the US climate research enterprise through community integration, education, seminars, workshops, and software and information services. COLA also serves an important function in transferring the results of basic climate science research on predictability and prediction into operational use.

Now, you might say that COLA isn’t the same as the IGES organization, and that might be true on paper, but the fact is that the http://iges.org website, soon to be “decommissioned” according to them, shows clearly that COLA and IGES are part of the same group, all under George mason University: (yellow highlight mine)


Note the COLA page is a sub-page of the IGES website:
http://www.iges.org/cola.html
With 4 million dollars and counting, good to 2017 according to NSF’s own grant page, the claim of the IGES/COLA website being “decommissioned” just doesn’t make any sense. It doesn’t wash. And, with a web page that still looks like it was designed in 1995, one wonders why Shukla’s clan didn’t put some of that money towards making a decent web page. After all, they only were able to make ONE paper with that 4 million dollars, according to NSF.
It gets better. Have a look at their staff page:

Source: http://www.iges.org/people/people.html
Lest Shukla and associates try to claim that IGES and COLA are somehow separate, their own COLA staff web page puts the issue to rest.
COLA appears to be a subset of the Shukla family run IGES. So if the IGES website was going to be “decommissioned”,  and so by shutting down IGES, it would seem that would affect COLA too. I can’t find any plans or announcements on their website that says COLA is going to supplant/survive IGES.
A Google search yields no other “new” web pages for COLA. It only yields the IGES web page and COLA subset and the COLA webpage at George Mason University, which is an exact copy of the IGES/COLA front page:

Then there’s this symposium advert page at GMU:

Source: http://cola.gmu.edu/symposium/
Gosh, a COLA symposium and Shukla’s photo is prominently featured on it? It seems that IGES and COLA are indistinguishable when it comes to Shukla involvement. I wonder if Shukla predicted at that symposium on chaos, the current chaos he’s in the middle of as a result of the now disappeared RICO20 letter?
Let’s go back to the claim they uploaded in place of the disappeared RICO20 letter yesterday.

If COLA is a subset of IGES, and it appears to be so, with the same people running the outfit, their claim of “all research projects were completed in July 2015” seems more than a bit unbelievable. It also seems unbelievable to me that they’d “decommission” the only website (IGES.org) that represents COLA while it is receiving active NSF grants.
There’s quite a gravy train going on there it seems, and as Steve McIntyre pointed out in Shukla’s Gold, it seems there’s quite a bit of double dipping going on, despite GMU policy to the contrary:
Before discussing Shukla’s structure, I’ll first quickly comment on institutional policies, as both the federal agencies (NSF, NOAA, NASA) and the university (George Mason) purport to have policies that prevent double-dipping.
Perhaps the Shukla gravy train is about to be derailed once the true accounting is done. Read McIntyre’s excellent piece Shukla’s Gold, the monetary tentacles run deep and wide on this one, and I’m betting there are a lot of people at GMU, NASA, NOAA, and NSF fretting over damage control right about now.
Note: within about 10 minutes of publication, this article was edited for a spelling correction and a text formatting correction.
UPDATE:
If you search Shukla’s name on the NSF grants database it turns up 2039 results…

How many millions has this Shukla family organization taken from the American Taxpayer? How much of that money did they spend to create the RICO charge against climate skeptics?

"A statement by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
[PDF version of this document is here; 32KB]
As the TV turns nightly to Beijing, we can expect chilling pictures and doomsday comments about the “Asian Pollution” and the “Beijing Smog”. This will induce media and political scaremongers to use these images to sell dud products like the “Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme”.
It is not carbon dioxide from burning coal that pollutes the skies of Asia and Africa. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring, clean, invisible, beneficial gas. CO2 is an essential part of the natural world but a very minor trace constituent of our atmosphere.

The major gases in the atmosphere are Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%) and Argon (less than 1%). These three gases make up 99.9% of the atmosphere (ignoring the variable water vapour which can rise to 4%). Seven other trace gases, including CO2, together make up less than 0.1% and CO2 is less than 0.04%.
This trace amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is the aerial food store for all plants, and thus also sustains all animals, including humans. CO2 is a boon to life, not a pollutant.
Moreover, the claim that man’s emissions will cause dangerous global warming is strongly and increasingly disputed by scientists and is not supported by historical evidence. It also defies common sense to believe that such a minor natural gas can cause all the climate disasters that are blamed on it.
We are about to hang an innocent hero.
Asia’s visible pollution is largely caused by the crude and inefficient open air combustion of low quality fuels. It is caused by millions of open-air cooking fires in India, China, North Korea and Africa using scavenged fuels like cow dung, cardboard, wood, and low quality coal and coke; by thousands of backyard brickworks and small dirty furnaces along the Yangtze River and in other places; by forest clearing fires in Indonesia and bush and grass fires elsewhere; and by millions of small obsolete and dirty wood, charcoal and coal stoves, heaters, boilers and furnaces all over Asia and Africa. Similar pollution is obvious in places in South America. “Open fires” was the cause of similar smogs in England as recently as the 1950’s.
Open-air combustion of poor quality carbon fuels produces not only the harmless clean so-called “greenhouse” gases of water vapour and carbon dioxide, but also real pollutants such as soot, smoke, ash, dust, unburnt fuel and chemicals containing sulphur, chlorine, nitrogen, fluorine, and metals. In confined unventilated places, open fires can also produce the very poisonous gas, carbon monoxide – this is the one that will quickly kill the canary. China also emits more sulphur dioxide than anywhere else in the world. This chokes their people, causes acid rain and damages buildings.
The elements contained in smoke pollution all came from rich ancient soils in the first place, and are needed in soils today in trace quantities to maintain the health of plants and animals. In dilute quantities, they are not a problem in the atmosphere, and rain recycles them to enrich the soil. But when concentrated in city air, they can be visible, annoying, corrosive or even toxic.
The “Asian Brown Cloud”, is a haze of pollution about 3 km thick and sometimes covering an area as big as Australia. The brown haze obscures the sun in some polluted Asian cities and at times this cloud drifts right across the Pacific Ocean and is noticed as far away as the west coast of America.
This pollution is already affecting local climate and community health. In Arctic areas, soot drifts onto snow making it darker in colour which allows it to absorb more heat from the sun. This process may be contributing to melting glaciers in China and the Himalayas.
The western world went through this pollution phase half a century ago, and although improvements can still be made, we have banished the notorious smoke pollution in places like London, Manchester and Pittsburgh.
Today’s Beijing Smog is a tame affair compared some air pollution events of the past.
For the century ended in about 1960, London smoke pollution was so bad that the city became known as “The Big Smoke”. Children developed rickets from the lack of sunshine, plants and animals died and lung disease was widespread. Mike Williamson, a Brisbane resident who lived in Yorkshire at that time, says that the smog was sometimes so dense that a driver could not see the curb, and the passenger was obliged to walk along the edge of the road with a torch to lead the way. Mike says “Buses stopped running and trains ran with difficulty because signals could not be seen. Detonators were placed on the rail tracks to warn trains of potential dangers.”
England’s last and worst ever pollution event, “The Black Fog” of 1952, was triggered by a temperature inversion over London. Visibility was reduced to less than one foot and 4,000 Londoners died from SO2 poisoning (50 in one small London park alone).
This shock brought action.
Two things cleared the Big Smoke from London and Manchester. Firstly was the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1956 – cooking and heating with open fires of wood and coal was banned in big cities. But bans would not have worked without other better heating options. No matter what the laws say, people will use whatever fuel they can find to keep warm and cook their food. Londoners only stopped burning wood and coal in their homes when electricity and smokeless fuel came available. The government encouraged people to use electricity – it was called “Coal by Wire”. Clean coal-powered electricity saved the forests from destruction and cleared the smog from the air.
The western world has largely beaten its city smogs, firstly with inventions such as the chimney and the stove, secondly with clean air legislation and anti-pollution technology and finally with the magic of electricity – the clean, silent, invisible “Coal by Wire”.
This clean energy can be generated reliably 24 hours a day, using high quality coal in non polluting power stations located far from densely populated areas. It is then transported silently and cleanly with zero pollution and minimal loss of energy to deliver lighting, heating, cooling, cooking and motive power into the most humble home in the poorest suburb. It is the magic of the modern world.
To fly over a modern non-polluting coal-fired power station at say 10,000 m is to put things into perspective – a puny cooling tower or two emitting wisps of water vapour (steam). They also emit carbon dioxide, but this is invisible and harmless (in fact generally beneficial). These wisps of steam are regularly displayed dishonestly on TV to illustrate the supposed pollution caused by coal power (or they dig up a picture of an old dirty polluting power station). There is almost no pollution, no noise, no smoke and no landscapes of forests of whirling blades and solar panels in a modern coal burning power station. In fact those wisps of steam are often the only visible evidence that massive energy conversion is taking place inside – coal into electricity.
Yet that facility and its linked coal mine can supply a whole city with heat, light and power for machines as diverse as the handyman’s drill, the kitchen toaster or the locomotives that move train-loads of commuters in safety and comfort during rain, hail, snow or heatwave.
“Coal by Wire” has already banished most of the terrible pollution that affected cities such as London, Manchester and Pittsburgh, and allowed the regrowth of American forests. City pollution now comes not from coal, but from cars sitting in traffic jams caused by poor road design, inefficient traffic controls and lack of sensible pricing for congested roads.
Today’s irrational and hysterical focus on harmless carbon dioxide by governments and media is misdirected and counter-productive. It is diverting attention and resources from damaging pollution which is altering local climate and affecting many areas of the world. And it is delaying the spread of coal powered electricity to many areas now desperate for clean invisible power.
It is also giving an enormous boost to the demand for nuclear power, for all the wrong reasons.
The world pollution problem which is most obvious now in Asia, presents a real opportunity for Australian energy companies to make profits and clean up the environment. All Australians will benefit from a stronger economy and from the satisfaction that will come from being able to point to the contribution we can make to cleaning up the REAL pollution represented by the smog over the Olympic Stadium.
Instead of trying to lead the world to commit Kyoto suicide, Australian politicians should be promoting clean non-polluting modern power stations burning high quality Australian coals. Just one well designed, well scrubbed, Australian designed coal power plant running on Australian coal could provide the light, heating, cooling and entertainment silently and invisibly to the front door for about 3 million Asian homes, housing maybe 10 million people. No wonder the Chinese are importing coal and building modern power stations as quickly as they can. They recognise clearly that their huge cities need “Coal by Wire”.
History shows that people cannot and will not live without energy in their homes. Unless we allow coal to supply clean silent invisible electric energy, the people will continue to burn dung, wood, cardboard, trees, oil, charcoal or reject coal to get their warmth or cook their food.
If Asians had access to better fuel, it would allow cow dung to be used for soil improvement and would encourage forest regrowth in areas denuded by centuries of scavenging for fire wood.
Russian scientists are not conned by the Kyoto hysteria focussed on the harmless natural gas, carbon dioxide. In fact the Russian Academy of Science advised President Putin that the Kyoto Protocol had “no scientific foundation” (Putin joined Kyoto for other very sound political and economic reasons that had nothing to do with global warming).
Man’s emissions of CO2 are a miniscule factor in determining Earth’s temperature. But while we are wasting decades of time and buckets of money trying to catch and imprison this harmless Will o’ the Wisp, an ominous brown smelly choking cloud of real pollution is growing in our northern skies.
Russian ecologist Dr Sergei Golubchikov has the last word:
“Ecological treaties should seek to curb emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and other highly-toxic pollutants instead of targeting carbon dioxide, which is a non-toxic gas whose impact on global warming has not been proved.”

Libby, 1970
FIFTY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TIMELY IMPORTANCE
WEATHER MODIFICATION BY CHANGING CO2 CONTENT OF ATMOSPHERE [p. 48]
American Scientist, January-February 1970, p. 18, “‘Though dire effects on climate of an increase in CO2 have been predicted, they are far from being established. The cycle is not really understood; carbon dioxide may well prove to be the least objectionable or the only beneficial addition to the atmosphere from industrial sources‘”
Then, 40-some years later, Scientific American writers have changed their minds, claiming that the worst human-generated pollution (of all the possible polluting emissions) is carbon dioxide.


Back in the 1970s, a warming planet was good, and a cooling climate was bad.    Now, it’s the opposite.   Warmth is bad, and cooling is good.   And carbon dioxide, instead of being thought of as beneficial, is now considered a pollutant.
Fortunately, though, many modern scientists do not agree that warming and elevated CO2 are the scourge of the biosphere.  In fact, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that humans, plants, and animals are much more likely to adapt to and thrive in a warming climate than a cooling one.   For casual observers, this may seem obvious.   But for those who are convinced that it is essential to alarm the public about lurking climate catastrophes, good news about warming and elevated CO2 levels are not welcome, let alone worth considering.  It may be characterized as “anti-science” to even mention that (a) Gasparrini et al., 2015 “Cold weather kills 20 times as many people as hot weather, according to an international study analyzing over 74 million deaths in 384 locations across 13 countries”, or (b) Donohue et al., 2013  “[T]he 14% increase in atmospheric CO2 (1982–2010) led to a 5 to 10% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments.”   Dramatically reduced mortality rates due to warming, or a greener planet with enhanced crop yields and longer growing seasons due to CO2 rise…do not advance the humans-are-causing-climate-catastrophe agenda.  So instead of reporting on them, tendentious journalists and activists for the cause largely ignore the “good news” about global warming and elevated CO2.
So let’s uncover some of these recently published “good news” papers.  The below list of 20 new (2016) peer-reviewed scientific papers conclude that:
(a) modern mortality rates are lower with warmth they are in cooler environments;
(b) elevated CO2 ‘dramatically’ increases crop yields;
(c) elevated CO2 ameliorates the effects of drought and heat waves;
(d) elevated CO2 greens the Earth;
(e) elevated CO2 and warming lead to weaker hurricanes and storms and stabilize the climate;
(f) there is no significant evidence linking extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, droughts fires, tornadoes)… to CO2 changes, but there is…
(g) evidence that cooling temperatures lead to a more unstable climate.

Mortality Rates Lower With Warmth, Higher With Cold

Shaposhnikov and Revich, 2016
“Highlights: Cold spells seem to be more hazardous to human health than heat waves.
Heat waves and cold spells were identified during 1999–2007. Statistical analysis of mortality from all non-traumatic, cardiovascular, respiratory and all external causes among age groups 30–64 and ⩾65 allowed to obtain site-specific and then pooled estimates of relative increases in mortality separately for heat and cold waves. The evidence of impacts of cold on mortality was more robust than the same for heat.”

Arbuthnott et al., 2016
“Five studies examined the risk of cold. In contrast to the changes in heat related mortality observed, only one found a significant decrease in cold related mortality in later time periods. … There is evidence that across a number of different settings, population susceptibility to heat and heatwaves has been decreasing. These changes in heat related susceptibility have important implications for health impact assessments of future heat related risk. A similar decrease in cold related mortality was not shown.”

Elevated CO2 ‘Dramatically’ Increases Crop Yields

Fitzgerald et al., 2016
Elevated atmospheric [CO2] can dramatically increase wheat yields in semi-arid environments and buffer against heat waves
“Wheat production will be impacted by increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 [CO2], which is expected to rise from about 400 μmol mol−1 in 2015 to 550 μmol mol−1 by 2050. … The Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility was established to compare wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth and yield under ambient (~370 μmol−1 in 2007) and e[CO2] (550 μmol−1) in semi-arid environments. Experiments were undertaken at two dryland sites (Horsham and Walpeup) across three years with two cultivars, two sowing times and two irrigation treatments. Mean yield stimulation due to e[CO2] was 24% at Horsham and 53% at Walpeup, with some treatment responses greater than 70%, depending on environment. Under supplemental irrigation, e[CO2] stimulated yields at Horsham by 37% compared to 13% under rainfed conditions, showing that water limited growth and yield response to e[CO2]. Heat wave effects were ameliorated under e[CO2] as shown by reductions of 31 and 54% in screenings and 10 and 12% larger kernels (Horsham and Walpeup).”

Abebe et al., 2016
Highlights

Effect of elevated CO2 and temperature on maize was studied using open top chamber.
Grain yield and yield attributes increased with elevated CO2 in north–west India. 
 Elevated temperature decreased yield but improved grain nutrient contents. 
 Elevated CO2 reduced the negative effects of elevated temperature on maize yield.

“Elevated CO2 increased grain yield of maize by 53.7% and harvest index (HI) by 2.9% compared to ambient CO2. Stover yield and yield attributes such as cob length, cob diameter, grain weight cob−1, number of grains cob−1 and 100 grain weight also increased with elevated CO2.”

Elevated CO2 Ameliorates Effects Of Droughts, Heat Waves

Roy et al., 2016
“Extreme climatic events (ECEs) such as droughts and heat waves are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency and impact the terrestrial carbon balance. However, we lack direct experimental evidence of how the net carbon uptake of ecosystems is affected by ECEs under future elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations (eCO2). … Our results indicate that eCO2 [elevated CO2] not only slows down the decline of ecosystem carbon uptake during the ECE [extreme climate events] but also enhances its recovery after the ECE , as mediated by increases of root growth and plant nitrogen uptake induced by the ECE. These findings indicate that, in the predicted near future climate, eCO2 could mitigate the effects of extreme droughts and heat waves on ecosystem net carbon uptake.”

van der Kooi et al., 2016
“Exposure of plants to elevated CO2 (eCO2) has a number of physiological effects, including increased photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreased stomatal conductance, resulting in greater growth and yield and also improved water use efficiency. Therefore, eCO2 [elevated CO2] is considered to ameliorate the adverse effects of drought. … Our results suggest that crops grown in areas with limited water availability will benefit from future eCO2 [elevated CO2], regardless of their metabolism. Drought leads to stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in both C3 and C4 crops, which is alleviated when the plants are grown under eCO2.”

Lu et al., 2016
Elevated CO2 as a driver of global dryland greening
“While recent findings based on satellite records indicate a positive trend in vegetation greenness over global drylands, the reasons remain elusive. … Based on 1705 field measurements from 21 distinct sites, a consistent and statistically significant increase in the availability of soil water (11%) was observed under elevated CO2 treatments in both drylands and non-drylands, with a statistically stronger response over drylands (17% vs. 9%). Given the inherent water limitation in drylands, it is suggested that the additional soil water availability is a likely driver of observed increases in vegetation greenness.”

Zhu et al., 2016
“Global environmental change is rapidly altering the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, with consequences for the functioning of the Earth system and provision of ecosystem services.  Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982–2009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC) (4%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau.”

Thomas et al., 2016
“Observations show an increasing amplitude in the seasonal cycle of CO2 (ASC) north of 45° N of 56 ± 9.8% over the last 50 years and an increase in vegetation greenness of 7.5-15% in high northern latitudes since the 1980’s.  Modelled increases in greenness are primarily driven by warming whereas ASC changes are primarily driven by increasing CO2.”

Mao et al., 2016
“Significant land greening in the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) has been documented through satellite observations during the past three decades. Our findings reveal that the observed greening record is consistent with an assumption of anthropogenic forcings, where greenhouse gases play a dominant role, but is not consistent with simulations that include only natural forcings and internal climate variability. These results provide the first clear evidence of a discernible human fingerprint on physiological vegetation changes other than phenology and range shifts.”

Vejpustková et al., 2016
“Trees growing in a pure aspen stand were selected according to the CO-gas regime within their  rooting zone. Five high [CO2] trees (10–25% CO2 in the soil) and five low [CO2] trees (up to 3% CO2 in the
soil) were sampled. Stem growth analysis of each trunk was carried out to study growth pattern in detail.  High and low [CO2] trees significantly differed in a growth rate. At the age of 25 years, the basal area of high [CO2] trees exceeded low [CO2] trees by 39 %. The positive effect of CO2 on annual increment was pronounced particularly in the years with optimal growing conditions. Results suggest that trees can be fertilized not only by elevated atmospheric CO2 but also when fed with CO2 via the roots.”

Elevated CO2, Warming Weakens Hurricanes, Stabilizes The Climate

Chang et al., 2016
“Extratropical cyclones cause much of the high impact weather over the mid-latitudes. With increasing greenhouse gases, enhanced high-latitude warming will lead to weaker cyclone activity. Here we show that between 1979 and 2014, the number of strong cyclones in Northern Hemisphere in summer has decreased at a rate of 4% per decade, with even larger decrease found near northeastern North America. Climate models project a decrease in summer cyclone activity, but the observed decreasing rate is near the fastest projected.”

Gaucherel and Moron, 2016
“‘Tipping points’ (TPs) are thresholds of potentially disproportionate changes in the Earth’s climate system associated with future global warming and are considered today as a ‘hot’ topic in environmental sciences. In this study, TP interactions are analysed from an integrated and conceptual point of view using two qualitative Boolean models built on graph grammars. They allow an accurate study of the node TP interactions previously identified by expert elicitation and take into account a range of various large-scale climate processes potentially able to trigger, alone or jointly, instability in the global climate. Our findings show that, contrary to commonly held beliefs, far from causing runaway changes in the Earth’s climate, such as self-acceleration due to additive positive feedbacks, successive perturbations [associated with ‘global warming’] might actually lead to its stabilization.”

Kelly, 2016
“It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change.”

No Significant Evidence That Elevated CO2, Warming Lead To More Hurricanes, Floods, Droughts, Fires, Tornadoes

Boos and Sterelvmo, 2016
“Neither a physically correct theoretical model nor a comprehensive climate model support the idea that seasonal mean monsoons will undergo abrupt, nonlinear shifts in response to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosol emissions, or land surface albedo.”

van der Wiel et al., 2016
“[T]he observed record and historical model experiments were used to investigate changes in the recent past. In part because of large intrinsic variability, no evidence was found for changes in extreme precipitation attributable to climate change in the available observed record.”

Hoerling et al, 2016
“Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales. … Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change.”

Doerr and Santín, 2016
“Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth’s surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.”

Guo et al., 2016
“The combined spatial-temporal variability of U.S. tornado occurrence has remained nearly constant since 1950.”

Evidence That Cooling Is Associated With Extreme Weather Events, Instability

Dezileau et al., 2016
“Storms and tsunamis, which may seriously endanger human society, are amongst the most devastating marine catastrophes that can occur in coastal areas. … [T]hese extreme events occurred around 5250, 4000, 3600, 3010, 2300, 1350, 650, and 80 years cal BP. No comparable events have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. The results indicate little likelihood of a tsunami origin for these coarse-grained layers, although historical tsunami events are recorded in this region. These periods of surge events seem to coincide with the coldest periods in Europe during the late Holocene, suggesting a control by a climatic mechanism for periods of increased storm activity.”

Pratte et al., 2016
“The highest dust fluxes in the Baie bog were recorded from 1750–1000 cal. BP to 600–100 cal. BP and occur at the same time as periods of high variability in the macrofossil record (i.e. successive layers dominated by Sphagnum or Ericaceae). The timing of these events in the dust and macrofossil records also corresponds to documented cold periods. These two [cold] periods have been identified as episodes of climatic instability, which could have been caused by changes in the wind regime.”

"**Google has removed from its app store a mobile game that lets people role play as a Hong Kong protester.**
The tech giant says the app violated a policy against cashing in on conflicts, and the decision was not the result of a request to take it down.
A number of gaming companies have become embroiled in the Hong Kong protests.
Many are reluctant to offend Chinese consumers, but they have also drawn criticism from gamers over free speech.
The choice-based game, Revolution of Our Times, allowed users to play the part of a Hong Kong protestor.
Like real protestors, players could buy protective gear and weapons, but they could also be arrested and even extradited to China.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China, a move many feared would undermine the city's judicial independence and endanger dissidents.
The Chinese government has condemned the protests, and official media has often criticised companies overseas that appear to endorse them.
Protestors, on the other hand, have targeted businesses they perceive to be pro-Beijing.
Many companies worry about offending Chinese consumers, or falling foul of the government's sensibilities, because it could affect sales in a huge market.
That is particularly true for the gaming industry. Gaming market research firm Newzoo puts the global market for gaming at $152.1bn, with China ($36.5bn) and the US ($36.9bn) together accounting for nearly half of that total.
In a statement, Google said the game was removed because it violated Google Play's policies.
""We have a longstanding policy prohibiting developers from capitalising on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game,"" Google said.
Google noted it had pulled apps previously for attempting to profit from other high-profile events such as earthquakes, crises, suicides and conflicts.
The move comes just days after an online gamer from Hong Kong was removed from an international tournament for the game Hearthstone because he expressed support for the protestors during a livestream.
Activision Blizzard said the gamer, identified as ""Blitzchung"", had violated rules and would not be allowed to play in any Hearthstone e-sports games for the next 12 months.
The company said the competition rules banned any behaviour that might cause public disrepute or offend a portion or group of the public.
The official Chinese publication the Global Times said Chinese social media users thought Activision Blizzard's move was an example of ""how to be responsible in the Chinese market,"" but move has drawn protest on social media elsewhere, with many gamers calling for a boycott of Blizzard.
The boycott has been trending on Twitter and in some cases former fans have posted pictures of their cancelled subscriptions on the Reddit gaming thread.
On the Hong Kong subreddit a number of players have suggested turning Mei, a Chinese hero in the game Overwatch, into a pro-Hong Kong character.
They hope the move would hit Activision Blizzard's sales by getting the game banned in China.
Despite the boycott, a mobile version of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty video game has been downloaded more than 100 million times in its first week.
Chinese tech company Tencent owns a stake in Activision Blizzard, which generated $7.5bn in revenue last year."

Guest essay by Uli Weber, Geophysicist, Germany
Since the G7-summit at Elmau Castle (2015) and the climate summit COP21 in Paris (2015) the declared political aim of all governments of the world is a global decarbonisation until the year 2100 to save our planet from anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The AGW-paradigm is allegedly supported by 97% of all climate scientists worldwide and global decarbonisation has even been recommended by religious leaders.
And recently, on the 22nd of April 2016, representatives from about 170 nations officially signed the Paris Climate Convention for global decarbonisation at the United Nations in New York.
But are we really been forced by future anthropogenic global warming to ruin our life-standards through such a complete disruption of our present technological basis?
Mainstream climate sciences held carbon dioxide (CO2) from the industrial use of fossil energies responsible to amplify the natural greenhouse effect until the earth becomes uninhabitable. Legions of AGW-protagonists worldwide, paid with billions of dollars from official scientific funds, private foundations, and environmental NGOs promote the public perception of an anthropogenic climate warming and call their AGW-Paradigm to be “settled science”. Furthermore, these protagonists claim “the debate is over” for their paradigm in an adverse interpretation of the true spirit of sciences and become supported by a biased majority of the public media.
Unprofitable scientific arts from outside climate sciences push themselves next to the meat-pots of climate-alarm with a rising number of papers from psychologists and historians which criticise the heretical influence from a scientific minority, slandered as “climate-deniers”, on the public recognition of AGW arguments. Recently, some climate active politicians even aim to silence “climate deniers” by trying to criminalize their scientific standpoint. Such independent climate scientists with diverging scientific results on global warming are performing their scientific work mainly with poor budgets or even on a free voluntary basis. And instead of a fair and open scientific debate about their arguments they usually become publicly denounced in their personal credibility while mainstream climate sciences try to exorcize them from the scientific community.
It seems today that the moral of sciences has become progressively infected from its well-paid trustees and their political and medial supporters by the virus of noble cause corruption aiming for a better carbon-free world in future.
Facing such aimed global decarbonisation to happen we may not forget that through the cultural evolution of mankind the available energy per capita has been repeatedly multiplied and has improved the standards of living for us all:

Stone Age (= small local villages): Available energy per capita was about the 3-6-fold of the basic human need.
Times of Agriculture (= advanced regional civilisations): Available energy per capita was about the 18-24-fold of the basic human need.
Industrial Times (= networked global city): Available energy per capita is about the 70-80-fold of the basic human need.

The industrial use of fossil energies since begin of industrialisation has sustainable increased the public health, our individual life expectancy, our common life standards, the general quality and availability of food, the public and individual transport, communications, and the affordable technologies for everyone.
That means our recent civilisation is existentially dependent on technologies fed by fossil fuels.
The basic principle of anthropogenic global warming could be easily understood by everyone without any scientific education:
The higher the atmospheric CO2 content rises the more will the global mean temperature increase.
Consequently, it is believed by an overwhelming majority of citizens in the industry nations that mankind’s consumption of fossil energies will cause anthropogenic global warming through the emission of CO2.

But is the feared relationship between CO2 and global warming really settled science? 
The AGW-paradigm stands in fundamental contradiction to several scientific and economic facts:

Missing reversibility of climate models: Computer models for the future climate progression are not even capable to simulate the natural climate backward to the beginning of systematic temperature records about the year 1850. This inherent imperfection of recent climate models proves that neither all parameters which influence our climate, nor their effective magnitude, nor their factual interaction are correctly implemented in the climate computer models. With these imperfect models climate sciences calculate the course of global temperatures far into future while politicians anchor their arguments for a global decarbonisation on such results.
Climate sciences are incapable to separate the drivers of climate change: No quantitative separation between the factual contributions of natural and anthropogenic drivers to global climate forcing has been published to date. The measurements of global temperature data started around the year 1850, at the end of the historical “Little Ice Age” and begin of industrialisation. There must have been a natural rise of temperatures since then because this “Little Ice Age” has ended without manmade contributions. But in contrary, climate sciences account the whole temperature rise since on AGW with the argument of early industrialisation, although the rise of temperature was much faster than the global course of industrial development.
Climate models ignore the influence of the natural solar cycles on global climate. The known solar cycles (Schwabe, Hale, Yoshimura, Gleißberg, Seuss-de-Vries, Dansgaard-Oeschger, and Hallstatt) with periodicities between 11 and more than 2.000 years are not included in future climate models. Argument is the small absolute variation of solar forcing through such cycles although these variations were definitely the only source for natural climate changes in our recent climate optimum before industrialisation. The finding of Svensmark, the nucleation of clouds from cosmic rays which are controlled by the magnetic field of the sun, is still ignored by mainstream climate sciences. This effect acts as a natural atmospheric amplifier for the variations of solar forcing through a reverse variance of the Earth’s albedo from the global cloud coverage, i.e. a weak sun causes more clouds and conclusively additional cooling. The CLOUD-Experiment at the Zurich CERN Institute has disproved the aerosol formation in present climate models by a factor of one‐tenth to one‐thousandth and found an enhanced nucleation from the Svensmark-effect up to a factor of 10. http://press.web.cern.ch.pdf Last access dated May 13th, 2012
The well documented historical Medieval Warm Period (MWP) which preceded the “Little Ice Age” has been suppressed by the “hockeystick-curve” from Mann et al. in the IPCC TAR (report 2001), apparently to promote the AGW-Paradigm of a constant natural pre-industrial climate at “Little Ice Age”-average global temperatures. Since then, the “hockeystick” has been disproved while it’s still used as an important argument for AGW and the MWP was downgraded to a regional European phenomenon to comply further with the AGW-Paradigm. But in contrary, the analysis of hundreds of scientific papers worldwide by Luning and Vahrenholt proves that the Medieval Warm Period has truly been a global occurrence caused by natural solar variations and consequently questions the AGW-Paradigm vitally. Online atlas by Luning/Vahrenholt: kaltesonne.de/mapping-warm-period/


Climate sciences deny the natural orbital cycles in their climate models and try to defend their simple linear relation between global temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recently, AGW protagonists reduce their view on the past climate succession even further to the second half of the 20th century and try to establish CO2 as the main paleoclimate driver. Already in the year 1924 Wladimir Köppen and Alfred Wegener, the discoverer of modern plate-tectonics, have published the scientific proof that the paleoclimate variability of the past hundred thousands of years is directly related to the orbital Milanković cycles. Reprint “Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit” (Bornträger 1924) with an English translation: https://www.schweizerbart.deDE
Growing acidification of the oceans caused by anthropogenic CO2-emissions is feared to reduce the richness of marine species in future. Firstly, a specific quantity of CO2 could either act as climate active gas on global warming or could cause acidification being resolved in the ocean, not both at the same time. But usually, both effects are calculated with the maximum amount of anthropogenic CO2-emissions. Secondly, the maximum possible amount of dissolved CO2 is reversely proportional to the water temperature. Consequently, the warmer the water becomes the less CO2 could be resolved in the oceans and cause acidification. The delayed rise of the atmospheric CO2 content from increasing paleoclimate temperatures supports this causal relationship and is proven by ice-core analyses.
A global sea-level rise from melting glaciers caused by AGW shall flood the Pacific islands and drown lowlands and harbour cities all over the world. A dramatic retreat of glaciers causing a sea-level rise of about hundred meters is a natural phenomenon at begin of interglacial warm times. It seems that marine ice masses are completely controlled by the sea-water temperature while terrestrial ice masses are bound to vertical variations of the global climatic zones. As temperatures are not constant within interglacial warm periods, the lower margin of terrestrial glaciers uses to fluctuate uphill when it becomes warmer and downhill when it becomes cold. Retreating glaciers often release ancient trees which are proving that their margins have been located far uphill in historic times. What we could recently observe at Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula is a glacier retreat to higher altitudes and not a complete melting while at the same time the ice masses of East Antarctica are still growing further. Alarming satellite altimeter data for the sea-level rise of the open ocean are much more prone to errors from an exact correction of the local lunar tides, the local contribution of permanent water circulations, additional water masses driven by wind and local wave heights, and the actual local air pressure than the data from fixed costal gauges.     The usual coastal sea level gauge records show a global sea-level rise at a constant rate since Little Ice Age times without any AGW contribution and will probably continue to do so – if no purposeful corrections were applied in future…
The “hiatus” of the global mean temperature rise, lasting about twenty years now, has already caused multiple adjustments of the original historic temperature data. Updated climate models use then to transfer the “missing heat” into the deeper layers of the oceans. Obviously, digital climate models couldn’t foresee the actual “hiatus” of the global mean temperature rise. But instead of improving actual climate models by altering their false initial conditions to comply with the factual measured climate succession, these climate models are permanently adjusted in their results to meet the outmoded earlier published climate forecasts. Questions remains how that missing heat could escape to deeper ocean layers without been recognized by the ARGO buoy network which is globally distributed over the oceans.
Mainstream climate sciences restrict the effect of future global warming to the negative spectrum of their computer speculations and spread scientific horror scenarios about a manmade future global warming of about three degrees centigrade until the year 2100 into the public attention while every winter ten thousands of people die from cold. For the year 2014 about 40.000 winter deaths in Europe have been reported because people couldn’t pay their bills for electrical power.   http://www.focus.de/immobilien/energiesparen/energie-die-grosse-stromluege-warum-strom-zum-luxus-wird_id_5388458.html?fbc=fb-shares Last access dated April 9th, 2016
Climate sciences claim that global decarbonisation follows the precautionary principle for the future of all mankind in avoiding AGW. The last major climate prophecy was published just in time before the COP21 Paris summit by well pampered minions of the Apocalypse: Anthropogenic CO2-emissions will prevent the next ice-age to happen – in 50.000 years! Is it truly the precautionary principle to save an endangered ice-age in 50.000 years from now? No, it’s genuine science-fiction when mainstream climate sciences ignore solid geo-scientific knowledge from some hundred thousand years of paleoclimate succession and extrapolate a lost ice-age in 50.000 years from their reduced retrospective of a few past decades. With the provision to save the world from its natural climate succession we are devastating our present economies and the future of our children and grandchildren. But what’s about the real global hazards that may endanger mankind’s future within the next 50.000 years, what’s about super-volcano eruptions, asteroid strikes, and the decline of the geo-magnetic field, what is the precautionary principle against these realistic threads?
Renewable energies from sunlight and wind shall replace energy generated from oil, gas, and coal to avoid AGW through CO2 emissions. Recently, renewable energies could only be produced at uneconomic costs with huge subventions directly raised from the majority of consumers and hence indirectly generated from fossil-fed industrial production. To preserve our common standards of living and technology through a future global decarbonisation the required global energy amount must be fully replaced from renewable sources. There are numbers circulating in the media that global decarbonisation is affordable and executable until the year 2100. But the published investments to establish a complete renewable energy production do not even include the costs for the indispensable energy storages and new distribution networks to guaranty the energy supply through nights and windless times nor do they include the rising energy costs for almost every product to be supplied in future. From such rising costs at presumably decreasing production numbers national economies may suffer with less income for employees or even less employees at all. Question remains how the rising subventions for renewable energy shall be paid from decreasing industrial productivity.
The landscape consumption in natural environments for renewable energy production from sunlight and wind is thousand to ten thousand times greater than the areal demand of equal productive conventional power plants. Question must be raised then what will happen through a future decarbonisation to our global natural resources.
At the same time pressure is made on our industrial-scale agriculture to deteriorate to organic production without chemical fertilizers. Agricultural food production stands in competition with the land consumption for renewable energies. Through the ecological food-to-fuel program, i.e. the use of ethanol as a renewable fuel for cars, the effective agricultural acreage for global food production has already been decreased while millions of people worldwide still suffer from undernutrition and hunger. Consequently, the aimed global organic food production with a reduced per acreage productivity of farmland may not meet the demand of a further growing world population…

This synopsis provides evidence that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming has been built on failed scientific assumptions and economic speculations.
Nevertheless, the prophets of AGW are still spreading their speculations of doom further like an anthropogenic mass madness promoting a wide bunch of divergent objectives against our present economic system which is based on the availability of affordable energy from fossil fuels. The deep religious belief in AGW remains their ultimate tool to destroy our present technical civilisation and to misdirect mankind into a brave new carbon-free world.
We are living now in a next age of cultural evolution, the Anthropocene, where the fundamental differences between scientific facts, personal opinions and religious faiths have become successively blurred while sated people seem truly believe one can slaughter the cow and still drink the milk.
The true global problem of mankind remains the steady increase of the world’s population and its supply with sufficient food and energy as well as the preservation of the global natural resources which are a heritage of us all. 
Poverty in the Third World is basically caused by a lack of energy and democratic participation.
The only way out of this dilemma is a democratisation and economic development of the poor countries which would not be possible without fossil energies. Such development would prevent the world population to grow further as proven by the standstill of population growth in the industry nations since begin of industrialisation. Through a development process of the Third World the fossil energy consumption in the industry nations may be minimized at recent standards of living while the protection of the world’s natural resources could be successively improved.
But with their religious belief in AGW the elected and unelected political leaders all over the world, supported by fortune tellers from climate sciences, by biased mainstream media, by faithful heads of religions, and by misguided ecological NGOs and Malthusian foundations, have now decided that mankind shall take quite the opposite direction. Their roadmap into the urgently demanded global decarbonisation until the year 2100 may then cause a fall of democratic rights in the industry nations on the way into a sustainable global energy shortage with Malthusian perspectives for an agricultural Global Third World of organic smallholders. Or, to say it more clearly, in a carbon free world the majority of people worldwide, whatever their absolute number will be then, may work twelve hours a day in organic agriculture to produce one fourth of the present available energy per capita – just as it was in the good old pre-industrial times.
And now, on this eve of destruction, the majority of affected people stands silent aside while the apocalyptical riders of global decarbonisation are going to wreck the future of all mankind …

"They treaded water for seven hours before a neighbor heard their screams. On Oct. 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded Staten Island. As the storm surge peaked at 14 feet in the borough  —   among the highest levels across New York City  —   the water crashed through the walls of their house, and DeBraan Varvaro and her younger sister, Carolyn Varvaro, clung to the gutter of their roof and did not let go. They waved frantically as helicopters circled overhead, but no one saw or heard them over the roaring water. “We could swim before we could walk,” the elder Ms. Varvaro said of her childhood on Staten Island’s beaches and teenage years as a lifeguard. “We’re ocean people. That’s why we survived. ” Her sister grew tired in the water, and Ms. Varvaro held her up as she treaded water. In the second hour, a garden statue of the Virgin Mary floated past. The younger Ms. Varvaro saw it as a sign they would survive. She kicked with renewed hope. Finally, at 6 p. m. a neighbor, crouched in his attic, heard the women’s screams. He helped them get the attention of more neighbors, and a young man swam through the water, filled with sewage, dead fish and gasoline, to pull them out. They were safe. But everything changed after the storm. They no longer felt safe. Over four years later, the night of the hurricane, and all the nights after, still haunt them. The elder Ms. Varvaro, now 61, a pack of her favorite Seneca cigarettes within reach, recalled in a recent interview the continuing terror, while propping her legs on a stool to ease back pain from a 1993 car accident. She cried, stopping at times midthought to find the words to describe her ordeal. Ms. Varvaro had feared displacing her sister, who is schizophrenic, so they decided to stay. The night before Hurricane Sandy hit, however, they called 911 for help, but the line was busy and they could not get through. They were among 236, 000 residents in impacted zones who did not evacuate their home before the storm, according to city estimates. Now, the sound of sirens still puts Ms. Varvaro in a panic, jolting her back to the hours spent treading water and praying for help. When she tries to sleep, she said, she hears “the    of the helicopters circling overhead. ” She did not return to the beach until last summer. “I couldn’t even get to the boardwalk,” she said. “I’d have to stop. I could still smell the storm. ” In 2012, Ms. Varvaro was told that she had   stress disorder. Even before the storm, her life had its difficulties. Pregnant at 23, she almost lost the pregnancy twice because of medical complications, but gave birth to a healthy daughter. The next year, in 1979, she learned she had cervical cancer, underwent surgery and fought it off. But it returned aggressively 10 years later, and she fought it again. Everything seemed fine until 2000, when the cancer returned a third time. She has been free of cancer since surgery in May 2000, and hopes to keep the disease in the past. “I’ve met the devil and survived,” she said with a shrug. “I came out the winner. ” Before her last bout with cancer, she met Kevin Killea, a sales representative, and they were together for 16 years. He died of pneumonia in 2010, and she has been alone since, except for her sister. Ms. Varvaro has been protecting and caring for her sister, who is four years her junior, since they were young. As a child, her sister often had high fevers and seizures that led to a loss of hearing Ms. Varvaro learned sign language so they could communicate. Surgery restored her hearing several years later. Ms. Varvaro has also helped her sister cope with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression, diagnoses she received after their mother died in 1999. “They’re only labels,” Ms. Varvaro said. “I tell my sister, ‘Other people need them. You don’t. ’” She added: “I’m a shy person until it comes to my sister, and then the bulldog comes out. I fight for the people I love. I will go for the jugular and ask God for forgiveness later. ” When her sister, who had been living in a supportive apartment program, had a nervous breakdown in 2003, after verbal abuse and neglect, she moved her to another such program. Ms. Varvaro said she had lodged a complaint with local officials against the previous program. It was later shut down. But in August 2009, her sister had another breakdown at the second residence. Ms. Varvaro then brought her home to live with her in her apartment on Staten Island. When they moved in together, Ms. Varvaro promised to keep her sister safe. After the storm, she felt she had failed her. She asked for her sister’s forgiveness. “I think all the struggles I’ve survived in life were in preparation for taking care of my sister,” Ms. Varvaro said. By attending to her sister’s needs, however, Ms. Varvaro suppressed her own anxiety. In 2014, a friend referred her to an art class and other services provided by the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Working in watercolors and pastels, she painted a small sailboat flitting in the choppy water of a dark storm. “I’m no Picasso,” she said. “But it got me out of this house. It got me out of myself. ” The art classes have been a welcome break from financial troubles that were compounded after the hurricane. The family received $10, 000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover losses  —   well under what the sisters needed. They were unable to return to their first apartment together and the garden they tended daily with colorful annuals and window boxes by the kitchen. Since 2009, Ms. Varvaro’s back injury and other health problems have kept her from working as an emergency medical technician, a job she had held for 13 years. Her sister has never been able to work because of her mental illness. Together they receive $1, 736 in Social Security income and disability benefits. They also receive $375 a month in food stamps and a $575 rent subsidy from the city. They now share a     apartment that is accessible only by a long, narrow staircase, which is difficult for the elder Ms. Varvaro to climb because of her arthritis and fibromyalgia. The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, another   beneficiary, provided them with $850 in Neediest funds to cover one month’s rent in 2014. In September, they also received $1, 170 from the fund to replace the younger Ms. Varvaro’s broken bed and to buy a therapeutic mattress for her sister, which has greatly improved her sleep. The elder Ms. Varvaro hopes they can eventually move into a     apartment. “I’ve been to hell and back,” she said. “Now I just want to help my sister have peace of mind. I’m ready to live again. ”"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on all farmers and those who eat farm products to raise their voices in opposition to the silly proposals of Australian and New Zealand governments to include emissions and motions from farm animals as a taxable carbon emission.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense” Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that New Zealand has already agreed to include farm animal emissions in their taxable emissions output and Prof Garnaut is also thinking of driving Australian farmers to the Kyoto bail for a similar milching.

“We smart farmers in the South Pacific must have the longest cows in the world – they feed on farms in Queensland and Queenstown and are about to be milked in Canberra and Wellington.
Forbes, who is an animal breeder, pasture manager and soil scientist, said he could not believe the lack of noise from farm groups and consumers on this matter.
“Any farmer would know that no cow, sheep, pig or goat has yet managed to create carbon out of nothing. Nor do they eat fossil fuel. Every bit of carbon sequestered in meat, bones, wool and milk, or expelled in solid, liquid or gaseous animal waste, was extracted from the air by the pastures and grain crops the animals ate. Pastures, crops and soil fungi live on carbon dioxide, the universal plant food from the atmosphere, and water and minerals from the soil. Ultimately, all carbon in the food chain comes from the air (apart from some artificial “foods” made from coal or petroleum derivatives, and very minor soil humus derived from oxidised coal or oil shale).
“This carbon extraction process starts the day the animal is conceived and ceases on the day it dies. This is the carbon food cycle we all live by.
“In fact all farm animals should get a carbon credit, because they sequester part of the carbon extracted from the air in bones, meat, milk and wool. Much of this carbon then gets transferred to the bones and flesh of the growing human population, and eventually gets sequestered in sewerage (often, unfortunately, on the sea floor), bones in the coffins, and soil in the cemeteries. This is a proven process which provides more secure and far cheaper carbon sequestration than some of the billion dollar schemes being investigated.
“In this respect grazing animals are just like trees; both sequester CO2 for their lifetimes, sometimes much longer.
“Of course other parts of the food chain generate net carbon emissions for agricultural machines, processing, chemicals and transport. Each of these activities would attract its own carbon tax. None are essential elements in the raising of domestic animals – the essentials are soil, water, grass and the atmospheric gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide.
“No matter how you do the sums, farm animals cause a net removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Thus they should get a carbon credit, certainly not a carbon tax.
“We all know the moon is made of green cheese. It is time to educate politicians that “All cows are also green”.

Let’s get this out of the way right at the start: There is no excuse — no acceptable reason — for the rioting in Baltimore this week. But, that said, there are lessons to be learned about the failures of government and how those failures can create a climate of anger and frustration that just awaits a spark to ignite the flames of violence and destruction.



That spark in this case was the still‐​unexplained death of Freddie Gray in police custody, but the powder keg was put in place by decades of big‐​government liberalism, both in the city of Baltimore and in the state of Maryland.



For example, Maryland has one of the most generous welfare systems in the nation. A mother with two children participating in seven common welfare programs — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), food stamps (SNAP), Medicaid, housing assistance, Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), energy assistance (LIHEAP), and free commodities — could receive benefits worth more than $35,000. Yet, nearly a quarter of the people in Baltimore still live in poverty. In 1960, Baltimore’s poverty rate was just 10 percent. While some of the increase since then is a result of demographic and other structural changes, we’ve clearly been throwing a lot of money at poverty in the city without much result.





Freddie Gray’s death was the spark, but Baltimore’s governance was the powder keg.



And while Baltimore’s high welfare benefits haven’t reduced poverty, they may well have exacerbated other social problems. For example, some studies have long shown that high welfare benefits correlate with high out‐​of‐​wedlock birth rates. It should not come as a surprise, then, that two‐​thirds of births in the city are to unmarried mothers, and almost 60 percent of Baltimore households are headed by single parents.



The unemployment rate in Baltimore in February was 8.4 percent, compared with just 5.5 percent nationally. In the Sandtown–Winchester/Harlem Park area, which is near the center of the unrest, more than half of the people did not have jobs, according to a February 2015 report from the Justice Policy Institute and the Prison Policy Initiative.



One reason for this is the city’s — and the state’s — unremitting hostility to business. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that only seven states and the District of Columbia have a worse business climate than Maryland. The state’s tax burden is huge and growing. According to the Tax Foundation’s State Business Tax Climate Index, Maryland ranks a dismal 40th in terms of business taxes, and an even worse 45th in terms of personal‐​income taxes. According to this report, Maryland is one of just a few states where the personal‐​income tax creates “an unnecessary drag on economic activity.” The state’s small businesses face the nation’s seventh‐​highest marginal tax rates.



As if that were not bad enough, the city of Baltimore adds one of the highest property taxes among comparable cities. Despite a recent modest reduction in property‐​tax rates, Baltimore still has a tax rate more than twice the rate of most of the rest of the state. A recent study by the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy ranked Baltimore twelfth out of 53 major cities in terms of high property taxes. When the city taxes are combined with state taxes, Baltimore ends up with the ninth worst tax burden out of 50 major American cities.



The city’s economic stagnation has driven out much of the middle class, black as well as white. The result is tiny pockets of affluence surrounded by large concentrations of poverty.



The city’s schools represent another failure of government. Teachers’ unions are among the most powerful special interests in Maryland. To cite just one example, even as other states were enacting right‐​to‐​work laws for public employees, Maryland passed a law mandating that all teachers pay fees to the Maryland State Education Association.



Although Baltimore ranks fourth among major cities in per‐​pupil expenditures for districts with more than 40,000 students and spends $16,578 a year per pupil — roughly 52 percent above the national average — more than a quarter of Baltimore students fail to graduate from high school. Fewer than half of Baltimore high‐​school students passed the last Maryland High School Assessment test. SAT scores for Baltimore students are more than 100 points below the national average.



Yet Maryland has one of the nation’s most restrictive charter‐​school laws. There are just 52 charter schools statewide. In neighboring Washington, D.C., 44 percent of the city’s public‐​school students are educated in the District’s 112 charter schools, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Even within the public schools, choice is extremely limited in Maryland; parents are not generally allowed to send their children to schools outside their assigned district. Needless to say, any larger efforts to give parents more control over their children’s schooling — such as vouchers or tax credits — have gone nowhere.



Crime remains a major problem in Baltimore. Despite some of the nation’s toughest gun laws, there were 99 murders in Baltimore in the first six months of 2014 (the most recent FBI data available), making the city the fifth‐​most‐​deadly in America. But, while the city remained violent and crime‐​ridden, the police have pursued a policy of random stops and arrests for minor offenses that has alienated residents.



If you are looking for an example of the failure of the War on Drugs, Baltimore would be a showcase. Martin O’Malley, in particular, both as mayor of Baltimore and as governor of Maryland (he is now a Democratic presidential candidate), pushed a “zero tolerance” policy that resulted in the arrest of thousands of young black men for minor drug offenses.



This approach to policing has inevitably led to widespread abuses. Baltimore paid out more than $5.7 million in settlements for police‐​brutality complaints from 2011 to 2014, and spent another $5.8 million on legal fees defending police. While we shouldn’t leap to conclusions until the investigation is complete, it is very easy to see Freddie Gray’s death fitting into this context.



Again, none of this is an excuse for violence or the destruction of property. Moreover, the riots are counterproductive, destroying the very businesses and other resources needed to rebuild troubled communities. Businesses are not going to flock to inner‐​city Baltimore after this week’s mayhem. Taxes are not going to go down. Yet, it is hard to look at the results of decades of big‐​government failure and not understand the frustration and hopelessness of those victimized by such policies.



Once order is restored in Baltimore, there will be time to take stock. We can expect to hear the usual chorus about neglected neighborhoods and the need for government jobs programs or additional social spending. Instead, we should take to heart President Obama’s admonition that “When what you’re doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it’s time to try something new.”



Big government has failed Baltimore. If we learn nothing from what just happened — if we simply go back to throwing money at the same tired old programs — it will be just a matter of time until this happens all over again.

Recently when reading a newspaper I came across an article headlined – _Why Socialism became a dirty word in 2019._ The newspaper declined to give the author of the article so maybe it was from a right-wing source. The paper seems only too happy to publicise its friendly left-wing sources. The article concentrated on Britain and European countries. My distinction between the two is deliberate as I am of British heritage and don’t regard Britain as part of Europe or myself in any way European. By the by, neither does my wife and she is English. Britain has nothing in common with Europe, and indeed, some of the countries within Europe have nothing in common with each other. Hence the inevitable demise of the EU and its gang of highly paid left-wing henchmen. Thank God Britain is leaving.



Back to the point – the decline of socialism. The problem the left has, particularly the hard left, the Jeremy Corbyns of this world, is they want to return to the bad old days, which to them are the good old days, where the government controlled everything. The result is that for it to work everyone has to end up on the same level, thereby destroying ambition and the incentive to better oneself through hard work. The irony is that the left call this **“progressive”**. In the newspaper article Tony Blair says “The choice for Labour is to renew itself as the serious, progressive” (there’s that word) “non-Conservative competitor for power in British politics, or retreat from such an ambition, in which case over time it will be replaced.”



Using Italy as an example, the article says political fluidity is another challenge. Gone are the days when you stuck to your tribe for life. To me this is no better exemplified than by Trump’s and Johnson’s election wins. Trump may have had some luck due to the way elections are run under the electoral college system but what is relevant to this discussion is that he won in the rust belt with blue-collar workers. Johnson replicated this, winning over the workers in the north-east and the Midlands.



This is something the left, and definitely those on the far left, have to come to grips with. It is human nature with most people, apart from the likes of Shane’s nephews, that if you are brought into this world you want to make the most of your short time on the planet. That means having the ability to work hard and succeed. Those on the left, if our MPs are anything to go by, appear to be lacking in this regard and therefore support the socialist doctrine where the State does all the thinking for you mainly via their paymasters, the union bosses.



It stands to reason then that the only system that works is the capitalist one. It’s not perfect by any means but it allows human nature to behave as it should. To aspire to achieve, to take the ups with the downs, to cope with the school of hard knocks and to come out the other end hopefully a better person. The other option is the road our Captain is taking us down, the road of mediocrity where Shane’s nephews can sit on the couch all day because the so-called rich pricks, farmers, landlords and other hard workers will fund your lifestyle through paying exorbitant taxes. It probably won’t be too long before the nephews will only have to go as far as the front door where the courier man will be standing, welfare cash in hand.



This is why, this year, it is crucial to elect a right-wing coalition. I know those of us on _The BFD_ have differing views with regard to the minor parties but ACT, with its Epsom seat, is realistically, the most if not the only likely option to partner with National. Anything else risks staying on the road we are on which, in my view, can only come to a dead end. To avoid confusion, the dead-end will be due to leftie economics, not climate change.

The Don does not muck about. If rules and regulations are hampering progress, then ditch the rules and regulations. Especially if the progress is being hampered by unwarranted worrying about climate change.



Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of highways, pipelines and other major infrastructure projects, according to a Trump administration plan that would weaken the nation’s benchmark environmental law.



The proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act could sharply reduce obstacles to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects that have been stymied when courts ruled that the Trump administration did not properly consider climate change when analyzing the environmental effects of the projects.



According to one government official who has seen the proposed regulation but was not authorized to speak about it publicly, the administration will also narrow the range of projects that require environmental review. That could make it likely that more projects will sail through the approval process without having to disclose plans to do things like discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.



The new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the “cumulative” consequences of new infrastructure. In recent years courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.



The act requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have significant environmental effects, including long-term impacts that courts have said include climate change. Since 1970, when the law was enacted, it has undergone only one major change. That was in 1983, when the White House Council on Environmental Quality limited the use of worst-case scenarios in project reviews.



But the Trump administration has been aggressive in its efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The 50 or so pages of revisions that the Council on Environmental Quality is expected to make public on Wednesday would not amend the act itself. Rather, they would revise the rules that guide the implementation of the law.



Compare and contrast with New Zealand and the recently released Productivity Commission report.[ _Local government funding and financing_](https://www.productivity.govt.nz/).



A new, challenging and growing pressure on local government funding comes **from climate change in particular, the threats from sea-level rise and more frequent and extreme weather events.** The most direct threat for councils is climate-induced damage to local government infrastructure such as roads and bridges, and stormwater, wastewater and flood-protection assets.



Councils are responsible for planning and regulating development on at-risk land. **They therefore have an urgent and important role in reducing future climate risk exposure** and long-run adaptation costs. Councils must resist pressure for risky development, and deal with property owners who shun talk of retreat and demand councils invest in hard defences against sea-level rise and flooding. 



New Zealand’s laws and institutions acknowledge the risk from climate change, and **require local governments to plan for the approaching and rising hazards it will cause.** Yet, a significant shift in policy thinking and implementation is needed to deal with the nature of climate risk **even though how climate risk will unfold is very uncertain.** In contrast, much thinking and practice is still dominated by assumptions that risks are unchanging. 



Here, we are busily tying ourselves up in unnecessary worry, planning for and attempting to avoid something that the even Productivity Commission states has considerable uncertainty about it.



… even with the best available science, **deep uncertainties** exist about the course of climate change and the damage it will cause.

Share this...FacebookTwitter2016 Scientific Consensus: Climate Models Aren’t Working
By Kenneth Richard
In a 2015 editorial on the dire consequences of human-caused climate change, Marcia McNutt, editor of the journal Science, stated with conviction that “the time for debate has ended.”   It’s the “action” of reducing our CO2 emissions that is now “urgently needed” instead of debating what apparently is “settled” science. She even laced her opined declaration that the scientific debate is now over with some religious imagery, seemingly characterizing the “treacherous offenders” who remain skeptical or unconcerned about climate change as “sinners” deserving the hottest, innermost sections of Hell.
The time for debate has ended. Action is urgently needed. … In Dante’s Inferno, he describes the nine circles of Hell, each dedicated to different sorts of sinners, with the outermost being occupied by those who didn’t know any better, and the innermost reserved for the most treacherous offenders. I wonder where in the nine circles Dante would place all of us who are borrowing against this Earth in the name of economic growth, accumulating an environmental debt by burning fossil fuels, the consequences of which will be left for our children and grandchildren to bear? Let’s act now, to save the next generations from the consequences of the beyond-two-degree inferno.”
Apparently McNutt’s activist admonitions haven’t convinced scientists publishing papers in other journals that scientific debate about climate change is over.
The year isn’t even half over yet, and already there have been over 20 peer-reviewed papers published that confirm that the climate models relied upon by those advocating that the debate is over (a) do not match observations, (b) leave out important factors affecting climate, (c) don’t have predictive skill, (d) failed to simulate the warming “pause” or “hiatus” of the 21st century, (e) have large uncertainties and biases that impinge on their reliability, and/or (f) are based on assumptions that have been found to be wrong.
Here are some quick-hit examples of statements undermining the validity of climate models found in recently published papers:

“[C]onstraints are needed to guide model development and reduce uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing. Unfortunately, the preindustrial observations needed to constrain the sensitivities are not available.”
“[C]limate model runs … indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes.”
“This finding suggests that much work remains before we can model hydroclimate variability accurately.”
“The idea that the young Earth had a thicker atmosphere turns out to be wrong. … The results … reverse the commonly accepted idea that the early Earth had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for weaker sunlight.”
“There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing … the rate of warming slowed down at a time when greenhouse-gas emissions were rising dramatically.” 
“Climate models, however, have large uncertainties in representing dehydration and cloud processes in the TTL [tropical tropopause layer], and thus their feedback with surface climate, prohibiting an accurate projection of future global and regional climate changes”
“They found that the wave-like movements of the mantle are occurring at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster than had been previously predicted.”

Perhaps the scientists who have the audacity to report on the considerable uncertainty and unreliability inherent in climate models — or the wrongness of their previously-held assumptions about the Earth-Atmosphere system — can be excused for their lack of understanding of “settled science.” After all, as Marcia McNutt declares, the debate is over; the climate models tell us so; it’s now time to act.
Fortunately, those scientists who “don’t know any better” about the debate being over may be able to escape to the outermost corridors of Hell rather than the innermost ones — where apparently it’s much, much hotter. That’s apparently where we can find those who don’t yet agree that the debate is over, and that activism is now science.
Obviously, there are valid and very substantial reasons why many are skeptical.
21 Papers From 2016
Below are 21 papers published so far in 2016 (through mid-June) that do not support the contention that climate modeling is “settled science,” or that the scientific debate is now over.
1. Christy and McNider, 2016
Three time series of average summer daily maximum temperature (TMax JJA) are developed for three interior regions of Alabama (AL) from stations with varying periods-of-record and unknown inhomogeneities. The time frame is 1883-2014. … Varying the parameters of the construction methodology creates 333 time series with a central trend-value based on the largest group of stations of -0.07 °C decade-1 with a best-guess estimate of measurement uncertainty being -0.12 to -0.02 °C decade-1. This best-guess result is insignificantly different (0.01 C decade-1) from a similar regional calculation using NOAA nClimDiv data beginning in 1895. … Finally, 77 CMIP-5 climate model runs are examined for Alabama and indicate no skill at replicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes since 1895.”
2. Fyfe et al., 2016
It has been claimed that the early-2000s global warming slowdown or hiatus, characterized by a reduced rate of global surface warming, has been overstated, lacks sound scientific basis, or is unsupported by observations. The evidence presented here contradicts these claims.”
 (press release):
There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing,” says lead author John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria, British Columbia. “We can’t ignore it.” … Susan Solomon, a climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that Fyfe’s framework helps to put twenty-first-century trends into perspective, and clearly indicates that the rate of warming slowed down at a time when greenhouse-gas emissions were rising dramatically.“
3. Zhao et al., 2016
The authors demonstrate that model estimates of climate sensitivity can be strongly affected by the manner through which cumulus cloud condensate is converted into precipitation in a model’s convection parameterization, processes that are only crudely accounted for in GCMs. In particular, two commonly used methods for converting cumulus condensate into precipitation can lead to drastically different climate sensitivity, as estimated here with an atmosphere–land model by increasing sea surface temperatures uniformly and examining the response in the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. The effect can be quantified through a bulk convective detrainment efficiency, which measures the ability of cumulus convection to generate condensate per unit precipitation. The model differences, dominated by shortwave feedbacks, come from broad regimes ranging from large-scale ascent to subsidence regions. Given current uncertainties in representing convective precipitation microphysics and the current inability to find a clear observational constraint that favors one version of the authors’ model over the others, the implications of this ability to engineer climate sensitivity need to be considered when estimating the uncertainty in climate projections.”

We find a larger percentage of land area with relatively wetter conditions in the ninth to eleventh and the twentieth centuries, whereas drier conditions are more widespread between the twelfth and nineteenth centuries. Our reconstruction reveals that prominent seesaw patterns of alternating moisture regimes observed in instrumental data across the Mediterranean, western USA, and China have operated consistently over the past twelve centuries. …. [T]he intensification of the twentieth-century-mean hydroclimate anomalies in the simulations, as compared to previous centuries, is not supported by our new multi-proxy reconstruction. This finding suggests that much work remains before we can model hydroclimate variability accurately, and highlights the importance of using palaeoclimate data to place recent and predicted hydroclimate changes in a millennium-long context.”
Press release:
According to a new study, the Northern Hemisphere has experienced considerably larger variations in precipitation during the past twelve centuries than in the twentieth century. Researchers from Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland have found that climate models overestimated the increase in wet and dry extremes as temperatures increased during the twentieth century.”

A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. … However, we are most interested in the radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Because few relevant measurements are available from that era, relationships from recent variability have been assumed to be applicable to the preindustrial to present-day change. …
Given the diversity of the relationships, constraints are needed to guide model development and reduce uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing. Unfortunately, the preindustrial observations needed to constrain the sensitivities are not available. … One method would be to use recent trends in regions where emissions have changed substantially during the period when reliable measurements are available. For example, Cherian et al. used measurements of trends in the downward solar radiance at European sites from the period 1990–2005, when SO2 emissions declined threefold, to constrain global estimates of aerosol radiative forcing since the preindustrial era. Although such an analysis is highly informative, it does not provide guidance on removing biases in models that overestimate or underestimate the downward solar trend over Europe, which could be due to errors in any of the factors that produce the cloud radiative forcing change or the clear-sky change, as well as natural variability in cloud cover. Removing those biases is necessary if climate models are to be used for simulations of future climate change. Additional data characterizing each of the factors and components are needed. Some of the necessary data (L, re, aerosol optical depth) are available from 1990, but reliable estimates of Nd, τ, and R are not available for years before 2001, when the Earth Observing System satellite constellation was launched.”

The low agreement between models in simulating the impacts of solar variations on SAT in several regions suggests the different dynamical responses in these models, possibly associated with inaccurate parameterization of the processes related to solar forcing. Our analysis suggests that internal climate variability played a more significant role than external forcings in short-term SAT variability in the regions of the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, the Arctic, the Antarctic Peninsula, and its surrounding oceans. The possibility of long-term impacts of external forcings on SAT and the uncertainties that might be contained due to effects of internal climate modes other than El Niño–Southern Oscillation underscore the necessity for a more detailed understanding of the dynamical response of SAT to external forcings.”

The ocean has absorbed 41 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emitted as a result of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture. The magnitude and the large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for recent decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon flux trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those due to internal climate variability. Here we use a modelling approach that allows for this separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink may be expected to change throughout this century in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, owing to large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic regions at present, but that this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in some regions.”

Irreducible uncertainty in near-term climate projections
Abstract: These results suggest that climate projections need to be performed with many more ensemble members than at present, using a range of ocean initial conditions, if the uncertainty in near-term regional climate is to be adequately quantified.
Summary and Discussion: The presence of initial condition uncertainty and non-linearity produces significant irreducible uncertainty in future regional climate changes. For trends of 20 years, the climate change signal rarely emerges from the noise of internal variability in FAMOUS. Uncertainty in future trends of temperature and precipitation reduce for longer trends as the initial condition uncertainty saturates.”

Map of flow within the Earth’s mantle finds the surface moving up and down ‘like a yo-yo’
Researchers have compiled the first global set of observations of the movement of the Earth’s mantle, the 3000-kilometre-thick layer of hot silicate rocks between the crust and the core, and have found that it looks very different to predictions made by geologists over the past 30 years. … They found that the wave-like movements of the mantle are occurring at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster than had been previously predicted. The results, reported in the journal Nature Geoscience, have ramifications across many disciplines including the study of ocean circulation and past climate change.”

Our data indicate a surprisingly low surface atmospheric pressure of Patm = 0.23 ± 0.23 (2σ) bar, and combined with previous studies suggests ~0.5 bar as an upper limit to late Archaean Patm. The result implies that the thin atmosphere was rich in auxiliary greenhouse gases and that Patm [surface atmospheric pressure] fluctuated over geologic time to a previously unrecognized extent.”

Early Earth’s air weighed less than half of today’s atmosphere
The idea that the young Earth had a thicker atmosphere turns out to be wrong. New research from the University of Washington uses bubbles trapped in 2.7 billion-year-old rocks to show that air at that time exerted at most half the pressure of today’s atmosphere. The results, published online May 9 in Nature Geoscience, reverse the commonly accepted idea that the early Earth had a thicker atmosphere to compensate for weaker sunlight. The finding also has implications for which gases were in that atmosphere, and how biology and climate worked on the early planet. […]
For the longest time, people have been thinking the atmospheric pressure might have been higher back then, because the sun was fainter,” said lead author Sanjoy Som, who did the work as part of his UW doctorate in Earth and space sciences. “Our result is the opposite of what we were expecting. […]
“We’re still coming to grips with the magnitude of this,” Buick said. “It’s going to take us a while to digest all the possible consequences.” Other geological evidence clearly shows liquid water on Earth at that time, so the early atmosphere must have contained more heat-trapping greenhouse gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, and less nitrogen.”

Palaeoclimate assessment has demonstrated that changes in large-scale features of climate that are governed by the energy and water balance show consistent responses to changes in forcing in different climate states, and these consistent responses are reproduced by climate models. However, state-of-the-art models are still largely unable to reproduce observed changes in climate at a regional scale reliably. While palaeoclimate analyses of state-of-the-art climate models suggest an urgent need for model improvement, much work is also needed on extending and improving palaeoclimate reconstructions and quantifying and reducing both numerical and interpretative uncertainties.”

Comparisons of the observed global-scale cooling following recent volcanic eruptions to that simulated by climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) indicate that the models overestimate the magnitude of the global temperature response to volcanic eruptions. Here we show that this overestimation can be explained as a sampling issue, arising because all large eruptions since 1951 coincided with El Niño events, which cause global-scale warming that partially counteracts the volcanically induced cooling. By subsampling the CMIP5 models according to the observed El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase during each eruption, we find that the simulated global temperature response to volcanic forcing is consistent with observations. Volcanic eruptions pose a particular challenge for the detection and attribution methodology, as their surface impacts are short-lived and hence can be confounded by ENSO. Our results imply that detection and attribution studies must carefully consider sampling biases due to internal climate variability.”
Introduction: Estimates of the relative contributions by anthropogenic and natural forcings inform our attempts to constrain transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity [Collins et al., 2013]. Yet such attempts are inherently complicated by the fact that we observe only one of many possible climate trajectories. With internal variability contributing significantly to decadal-scale trends in certain quantities and regions, robust attribution of climate change can become challenging and sensitive to the particular realization of variability sampled in the observational record [Deser et al., 2012a].”

Temperatures in Asia, and globally, are very likely to increase with greenhouse gas emissions, but future projections of rainfall are far more uncertain. Here we investigate the linkage between temperature and precipitation in Asia on interannual to multicentennial timescales using instrumental data, late Holocene paleoclimate proxy data and climate model simulations. We find that in the instrumental and proxy data, the relationship between temperature and precipitation is timescale-dependent. While on annual to decadal timescales, negative correlations dominate and thus cool summers tend to be rainy summers, on longer timescales precipitation and temperature are positively correlated; cool centuries tend to be dryer centuries in monsoonal Asia. In contrast, the analyzed CMIP5/PMIP3 climate model simulations show a negative correlation between precipitation and temperature on all timescales. Although many uncertainties exist in the interpretation of the proxy data, there is consistency between them and the instrumental evidence. This, and the persistence of the result across independent proxy datasets, suggests that the climate model simulations might be considerably biased, overestimating the short-term negative associations between regional rainfall and temperature and lacking long-term positive relationships between them.”

Models suggest that climate change should weaken the AMOC as warmer Arctic temperatures, combined with buoyant freshwater from Greenland’s melting ice cap, impede the formation of deep currents. But so far, limited ocean measurements show the AMOC to be far more capricious than the models have been able to capture.”

An accurate assessment of the role of solar variability is a key step towards a proper quantification of natural and anthropogenic climate change. To this end, climate models have been extensively used to quantify the solar contribution to climate variability. However, owing to its large computational cost, the bulk of modeling studies to date have been performed without interactive stratospheric photochemistry: the impact of this simplification on the modeled climate system response to solar forcing remains largely unknown. Here we quantify this impact, by comparing the response of two model configurations, with and without interactive ozone chemistry. Using long integrations, we first obtain robust surface temperature and precipitation responses to an idealized irradiance increase. Then, we show that the inclusion of interactive stratospheric chemistry significantly reduces the surface warming (by about one third) and the accompanying precipitation response. This behavior is linked to photochemically-induced stratospheric ozone changes, and their modulation of the surface solar radiation. Our results suggest that neglecting stratospheric photochemistry leads to a sizable overestimate of the surface response to changes in solar irradiance. This has implications for simulations of the climate in the Last Millennium and geoengineering applications employing irradiance changes larger than those observed over the 11-year sunspot cycle, where models often use simplified treatments of stratospheric ozone that are inconsistent with the imposed solar forcing.”

Aerosol–cloud interactions are considered a key uncertainty in our understanding of climate change (Boucher et al., 2013). Knowledge of the global abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground-based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71 % of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN0.2 % at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25 % of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. The findings also suggest that vertically resolved remote-sensing techniques, such as satellite-based high spectral resolution lidars, have a large potential for global monitoring of cloud condensation nuclei.”

The early twentieth century Arctic warming (ETCAW) between 1920 and 1940 is an exceptional feature of climate variability in the last century. Its warming rate was only recently matched by recent warming in the region. Unlike recent warming largely attributable to anthropogenic radiative forcing, atmospheric warming during the ETCAW was strongest in the mid-troposphere and is believed to be triggered by an exceptional case of natural climate variability. Nevertheless, ultimate mechanisms and causes for the ETCAW are still under discussion. Here we use state of the art multi-member global circulation models, reanalysis and reconstruction datasets to investigate the internal atmospheric dynamics of the ETCAW. We investigate the role of boreal winter mid-tropospheric heat transport and circulation in providing the energy for the large scale warming. Analyzing sensible heat flux components and regional differences, climate models are not able to reproduce the heat flux evolution found in reanalysis and reconstruction datasets. These datasets show an increase of stationary eddy heat flux and a decrease of transient eddy heat flux during the ETCAW. Moreover, tropospheric circulation analysis reveals the important role of both the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors in the convergence of southerly air masses into the Arctic during the warming event. Subsequently, it is suggested that the internal dynamics of the atmosphere played a major role in the formation in the ETCAW.”

Cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and water vapor transported into the stratosphere have significant impacts on the global radiation budget and circulation patterns. Climate models, however, have large uncertainties in representing dehydration and cloud processes in the TTL, and thus their feedback with surface climate, prohibiting an accurate projection of future global and regional climate changes. Here, we use unprecedented airborne measurements over the Pacific to reveal atmospheric waves as a strong modulator of ice clouds in the TTL. Wave-induced cold and/or cooling conditions are shown to exert a nearly ubiquitous influence on cirrus cloud occurrence at altitudes of 14-18 km, except when air was very recently influenced by convective hydration. We further observe that various vertical scales of cloud layers are associated with various vertical scales of waves, suggesting the importance of representing TTL waves in models.”

The large heat capacity of the ocean as compared to the atmosphere provides a memory in the climate system that might have the potential for skilful climate predictions a few years ahead. However, experiments so far have only found limited predictability after accounting for the deterministic forcing signal provided by increased greenhouse gas concentrations. One of the problems is the drift that occurs when the model moves away from the initial conditions towards its own climate. This drift is often larger than the decadal signal to be predicted. In this paper we describe the drift occurring in the North Atlantic Ocean in the EC-Earth climate model and relate it to the lack of decadal predictability in that region. While this drift may be resolution dependent and disappear in higher resolution models, we identify a second reason for the low predictability. A subsurface heat content anomaly can only influence de atmosphere if (deep) convection couples it to the surface, but the occurrence of deep convection events is random and probably mainly determined by unpredictable atmospheric noise.“
21. Rugenstein et al., 2016
The ocean dominates the planetary heat budget and takes thousands of years to equilibrate to perturbed surface conditions, yet those long time scales are poorly understood. Here we analyze the ocean response over a range of forcing levels and time scales in a climate model of intermediate complexity and in the CMIP5 model suite. We show that on century to millennia time scales the response time scales, regions of anomalous ocean heat storage, and global thermal expansion depend non-linearly on the forcing level and surface warming. As a consequence, it is problematic to deduce long term from short term heat uptake or scale the heat uptake patterns between scenarios. These results also question simple methods to estimate long term sea level rise from surface temperatures, and the use of deep sea proxies to represent surface temperature changes in past climate.”

"By the time Donald Glover puzzled Hollywood’s finest by thanking Migos, the trendsetting Atlanta rap trio, during his Golden Globes acceptance speech this month, the group had already locked up its first No. 1 hit on the Billboard chart. Not that you would have known it by the behavior of the music industry’s mainstream gatekeepers. While “Bad and Boujee,” which Mr. Glover, the star and creator of “Atlanta” on FX, unexpectedly called “the best song   …     ever” onstage, had been building in clubs and online since its August release, it had only recently reached radio and was far from the   of other more anodyne (and, notably, whiter) streaming smashes. For weeks, as the song turned into a sensation through a torrent of internet memes and listens on YouTube and Spotify (with now more than 250 million combined streams) representatives for Migos had been trying to book the roguish group  —   made up of the rappers Quavo, Offset and Takeoff  —   a performance on   television, a rite of passage for rising acts. They were repeatedly brushed off. “They gave all kinds of excuses  —   not the right time, it’s not this, it’s not that,” recalled Pierre Thomas, better known as Pee, the chief executive of Quality Control Music, Migos’s label. “But as soon as Donald Glover did that, the next day, all the people who had just denied us wanted them on their show. ” The very next week, Migos took “Bad and Boujee” to “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Battling fickle tastes has been a constant for Migos since the trio stormed the   firmament in 2013, bringing a Gucci bag full of flashy new tricks, including their trademark stuttering,   triplet flow and an endless series of sticky catchphrases,   and vocal tics (“Grrr,” “That way! ”). But those who start trends don’t always reap the rewards. “Versace,” the group’s breakout song, was lifted, but then eclipsed, by Drake’s faithful remix, while “dabbing,” once Migos lingo, morphed into a   dance craze. As repeated arrests sidelined Migos’s members at crucial moments, like the   to their debut album, “Yung Rich Nation”  —   a commercial flop in 2015, selling just 15, 000 copies its first week  —   the group risked becoming another casualty of rap’s      culture, where younger viral artists are always bubbling, especially in Atlanta. With a refined strategy for harnessing the rise of streaming, where young listeners flock to rap, Migos is now zooming at an even higher level. With the release of its second album, “Culture,” out digitally on Friday, the trio focused its exuberant songwriting. It is choosing more airy, ornate trap beats and taming its staccato verbal onslaught to make better use of empty space, while tending to both its online and      boosters. In New York this week, Takeoff, 22, the group’s most reserved member, compared the album   to Christmas Eve, his sleepy eyes lighting up. “You just know that everything you asked for is going to be there up under that Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s our time now. ” Migos’s de facto leader, Quavo, 25, is its most alluring presence and a melodic songwriter. He was defiant about the group’s sometimes samey or excessive output, which has included more than a dozen free online mixtapes since 2011. “We’re doing the same thing we’ve been doing, making the same music,” he said “I feel like the world just caught up. ” The group’s business team is more realistic  —   and, by necessity, more strategic. “Truth be told, we did have a minor setback for a major comeback,” Kevin Lee, the Quality Control executive known as Coach K, said. After a rocky 2015, which, amid legal issues, still included the release of five   Migos projects with middling effect, 2016 was about slowing down and spreading out. Though Migos released just one official mixtape last year, its members appeared as guests on an unfathomable number of tracks by other artists, pop and street, expanding their sonic palette and fans’ understanding of their individual attributes. “I applaud them in stretching their tentacles and bringing it back to the nucleus,” said Kevin Liles, the veteran   executive whose label, 300 Entertainment, distributes Migos’s music in partnership with Quality Control. “That only made the nucleus stronger. ” Coach K said that Quavo’s blistering solo run, especially  —   honored in the hourlong D. J. mix “Featuring Quavo”  —   motivated Offset and Takeoff, adding, “Once it all came back together, it was an explosion. ” It’s fitting, then, that the group’s crowning achievement thus far was started by Offset  —   who spent two monthslong stints in jail on weapons charges and probation violations during Migos’s rise  —   one night while he was home alone. After creating the “  top” hook for “Bad and Boujee” that would go on to fuel endless Twitter chatter,  he sent it to the team for completion, certain it could be a hit. The Platonic ideal of a Migos song, the track mixes sensational    talk with an overriding sense of personal uplift. “Some opportunities were probably lost because of my situation, but I was fortunate to have brothers that could keep the train moving,” Offset, 25, said. “This song is like a rebirth. ” Migos’s labels put “Bad and Boujee” in the best position to succeed with a few deliberate distribution tweaks, giving it its premiere only on SoundCloud  —   “where the kids live,” Coach K said  —   to build buzz, and timing its wider release to Labor Day weekend, when rap radio relies on D. J. mix shows instead of more fixed playlists, leaving the door open for emerging sounds. (The next single, “” was released with similar precision, first with a majestic, arctic video, and then the official audio ahead of Martin Luther King’s Birthday.) Quality Control also sent Migos back to basics  —   working the Atlanta strip club scene  —   to build momentum and “get the vibe of the people,” Pee said. “When you see girls on that stage singing the words, you know you got a hit on your hands. ” Migos’s zealous army of online supporters (see the earlier “better than the Beatles” meme) also did its part, disseminating everything from an impromptu jingle for potato chips to a clip of the group performing “Bad and Boujee” live in Nigeria. Crucially, there has never been a dearth of Migos content to spread, even during seemingly fallow periods, thanks to the group’s commitment to creating constantly. In Manhattan on Tuesday, the trio had about three hours of downtime in between promotional obligations, but as the members pulled up to their Times Square hotel, they noted that the famed   recording space Quad Studios was just across the street. There was little discussion before a decision was reached. (When the group’s handlers called me to find out where the rappers were, a member of Migos’s inner circle grabbed the phone to hang up.) “Wake up,” Quavo said. “Time to work. ” Once inside, after some finagling, the group rolled weed and ate pepperoni pizzas as its recording engineer, who travels with the trio, set up. Alone in front of the microwave, Takeoff counted comically large stacks of money as Quavo changed into a fuzzy pair of “lucky studio socks. ” “What’s the point of going to sit at the hotel?” he said before entering the vocal booth. Four hours later, a   new song was done, but then Migos was late to a listening party for its own album. The rappers had been too busy making more music, refusing to leave the studio until all three had finished their verses."

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
In this post, we’re going to discuss one of the three adjustments with the greatest impacts on the new NOAA “pause buster” sea surface temperature dataset. That is, I’m going to discuss and illustrate that NOAA based one of their recent adjustments (the adjustment with the greatest impact during the slowdown in global warming) on the outputs of one climate model…clarification: one obsolete earlier-generation climate model…and that if we examine the consensus of the latest generation of climate models, we see that NOAA may have adjusted away a relationship that the consensus of newer models indicates should exist…assuming that yet another of NOAA’s assumptions is correct.
BACKGROUND 
NOAA revised their global surface temperature product earlier this year to show more global warming during the post-1998 period. Those data manipulations supposedly ended the slowdown in global warming over that period. The changes to NOAA’s global surface temperature product were presented in three studies. The greatest changes were made to the sea surface temperature portion, and those changes were discussed in the papers Huang et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2015). Those two studies published in February 2015 slipped by the mainstream media, unnoticed. The alarmists, however, did not miss the Karl et al. (2015) paper Possible Artifacts of Data Biases in the Recent Global Warming Hiatus (paywalled, full paper here). While the revisions included changes to the NOAA global surface temperature product since its start in the 1850s, Karl et al. (2015) focused on the periods of 1998 to 2014 and 2000 to 2014…periods during which NOAA had adjusted the sea surface temperature portion to the extent that they claimed the slowdown in global warming never existed.
The claims were misdirection of course, because, even with NOAA’s changes to the surface temperature record, there is still an ever-growing difference between observations and climate model-based predictions of global warming. In other words, the manipulations of the NOAA global surface temperature records decreased the difference between models and data, but those modifications did not eliminate them.
U.S. Congressperson Lamar Smith is the chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Like many persons, Representative Smith questions NOAA’s changes to their surface temperature record. Recently, Representative Smith has been formally requesting NOAA emails regarding the changes to the global surface temperature record, and, as of yet, Dr. Kathryn Sullivan of NOAA has not produced those emails. There are a multitude of news articles about the Smith-NOAA dispute, but they are not the subject of this post.
This post discusses the primary adjustment that had the greatest impact on the “pause busting” nature of the new NOAA global sea surface temperature reconstruction. My finding is that NOAA may have adjusted away a difference between ship-based sea surface temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the climate models used in the latest IPCC 5th Assessment Report. Once again, this assumes that yet another of NOAA’s assumptions is correct.
ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: OCEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURE BIAS CORRECTIONS 
Different methods were used to sample sea surface temperatures since the start of the surface temperature record in the mid-1800s: buckets of different materials (wood, canvas, insulated), engine room intakes, and buoys (moored and floating). Additionally, the temperature of the air above ocean surfaces has been recorded aboard ships…a metric called marine air temperature. Each method has its own sampling errors, uncertainties and biases. (For those new to the subject, see Kent et al. (2010) Effects of instrumentation changes on ocean surface temperature measured in situ. It has a detailed and relatively easy-to-understand overview. Also see Kennedy (2014) A review of uncertainty in in situ measurements and data sets of sea-surface temperature. A copy of the submitted paper is here.)
Beginning in the mid-1990s, data suppliers have been accounting for the biases that come from the different types of buckets and from the transition from buckets to ship inlets. Additionally, the ship-buoy bias has also been discussed in papers since the early 2000s. The ocean temperatures sampled from engine-room intakes (ERI) on ships are slightly warmer than the temperatures sampled by buoys. But data suppliers had not attempted to account for the ship-buoy bias until recently because of the large uncertainties of the ship-inlet and buoy temperature measurements and due to the massive uncertainties of the ship-buoy bias. (See Reynolds et al. 2002. Also see Kennedy et al. (2011) Part 1 and Part 2 for documentation of those uncertainties.)
For their new “pause-buster” data, NOAA:

adjusted the ship data using the UKMO HadNMAT2 night marine air temperature data as a reference. This of course assumes the night marine air temperature data vary at the same rates as sea surface temperatures (both day and night).
adjusted the buoy data to account for the difference in temperature between ship inlets and buoys where both exist. The effects of this would vary over the past few decades because the ratio of buoy and ship-based measurements changed with time. There has been an increase in buoy samples and a decrease in ship-based measurements.
weighted the buoy data more than ship data during periods when both ship and buoy data exist. This was done to account for the different accuracies of the ship and buoy temperature measurements…buoy data have been shown to be more accurate than the ship inlet data.

According to Karl et al. (2015) the adjustments to the ship data (based on night marine air temperature data) had the greatest impact on the trends from 2000 to 2014:
Of the 11 improvements in ERSST version 4 (13), the continuation of the ship correction had the largest impact on trends for the 2000-2014 time period, accounting for 0.030°C of the 0.064°C trend difference with version 3b. (The buoy offset correction contributed 0.014°C dec-1 to the difference, and the additional weight given to the buoys because of their greater accuracy contributed 0.012°C dec-1. See supplementary materials for details.)
In this post, we’re going to overlook the ship-buoy bias adjustment and the weighting of buoys and ship inlet data, they’ve been discussed in numerous other blog posts, and we’re going to concentrate on…
NOAA’S ASSUMPTIONS FOR USING NIGHT MARINE AIR TEMPERATURE DATA TO ADJUST SHIP-BASED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS
NOAA made numerous assumptions to justify using night marine air temperature data to adjust the ship-based sea surface temperature measurements. They’ve listed them in Huang et al. (2015) paper Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature Version 4 (ERSST.v4) – Part I: Upgrades and Intercomparisons. There they write on page 919 (where NMAT is night marine air temperature and SST is sea surface temperature):
The bias adjustment for ship SSTs in ERSST.v4 is originally proposed by Smith and Reynolds (2002) and involves using NMAT as a reference. NMAT is selected because the differences from SST are more stable than daytime marine air temperatures, which can have a large range due to solar heating of the ships decks and of the instruments themselves. To formulate the bias adjustment, however, it is necessary to assume that
1) the difference between SST and NMAT is near constant during the climatological period (1971–2000);
2) the climatological difference of SST and NMAT is constant in other periods;
3) the NMAT is less biased (more homogeneous) than the SST data to which it is being compared;
4) the mix of SST measurement methods (bucket or ERI) is invariant across the global oceans, and the spatial pattern of biases follows the climatological difference of SST and NMAT in the modern time (1971–2000); and
5) biases vary relatively slowly and smoothly with time.
We only need to examine the first two of NOAA’s assumptions.
NOAA then went on two describe how they tested their first two assumptions:
To test the first two assumptions, which are assuming broad physical coherence between two highly correlated but physically distinct measurands, the average difference between SST and near-surface air temperature (SAT) of day and night at 2m is calculated by subsampling monthly outputs of the GFDL CM2.1 coupled model with monthly observation masks from 1875 to 2000 (Fig. 4). The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime. It is found that the first two assumptions are valid since the model simulations indicate that the difference of SST and SAT is near constant and its linear trend is weak in all four different latitudinal zones (Fig. 4)…
Huang et al. are not very specific about the meaning of “monthly observation masks”. Does it mean that NOAA has masked all grids that do not contain ship data? I suspect that’s the case.
IMPORTANT NOTE: In the following, I have not taken the step of masking the grids without ship data, because I’m attempting to illustrate the global (without polar oceans) climate model-expected relationship between marine air temperature and sea surface temperature. [End note.]
Curiously, NOAA is assuming the modeled relationship between sea surface temperature and marine air temperature (both day and night) is the same as the relationship between night marine air temperature and sea surface temperature, the latter of which includes both day and night measurements. That is, NOAA is using night marine air temperature (not marine air temperature, both day and night) to adjust sea surface temperature, yet they’re presenting modeled sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures (both day and night) for justification. Is this addressed by “The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”? That seems to be the case.
My Figure 1 is Figure 4 from Huang et al (2015).

Figure 1
First, note that the climate model-based graph in their Figure 1 ends in 2000. That’s odd because we’re very interested in the period of 2000 to 2014. Second, they listed the trends for 1875 to 2000 in the caption for their Figure 4, but they failed to show the trend for their climatological period of 1971 to 2000 (See their assumption 1 above).
Third, and very important, the GFDL CM 2.1 coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model from the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) is a curious choice for use in a study in 2015. On the GFDL webpage about the new and improved GFDL CM3 model, they begin:
GFDL’s successful model, CM2.1 (Delworth et al., 2006), was used as the starting point to develop the next-generation CM3 coupled model.
In other words, the 10-year-old GFDL CM 2.1 climate model could be considered obsolete inasmuch as it has been replaced by the GFDL CM3. The GFDL CM 2.1 was supported by Delworth et al. (2006) GFDL’s CM2 Global Coupled Climate Models. Part I: Formulation and Simulation Characteristics. The abstract notes it was used for the IPCC’s 4th assessment report back in 2007.
We know from past experience that there can be wide ranges in the absolute values of surface temperatures from model to model and wide ranges in their trends. NOAA’s use of one earlier-generation climate model could lead anyone to believe NOAA selected (cherry-picked) that single earlier-generation GFDL CM 2.1 climate model because it provided them with the results they wanted.
So let’s take a look at the multi-model mean of all the new-and-improved climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report in 2013. Those models are stored in the CMIP5 archive, and their multi-model mean (along with the outputs of the individual models) are available at the KNMI Climate Explorer. The multi-model mean (the average of the models) basically represents the consensus (the groupthink) of the climate modeling groups on how sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures (in this example) respond to the climate forcings used to drive the models. Due to the wide ranges of climate model outputs, using the average of all of the models in the CMIP5 archive (the multi-model mean) assures that we cannot be accused of cherry-picking one climate model that supports an agenda. And, to give you an advanced warning, we only need to examine the climate model outputs for the global oceans, excluding the polar oceans (60S-60N); that is we won’t need to examine the additional subdivisions presented in Figure 4 from Huang et al (2015) (my Figure 1).
We’ll start with period of 1875 to 2000 shown in Huang et al. Figure 4. The top graph in Figure 2 presents the modeled difference between the simulated global (60S-60N) sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures during NOAA’s selected period of 1875 to 2000, with the marine air temperatures (TAS, with land surfaces masked) subtracted from the sea surface temperatures. Over this period, only the historic climate forcings were used by the modeling groups. For NOAA’s selected period of 1875 to 2000, the consensus of the latest generation of climate models show the modeled difference between the global (60S-60N) sea surface and marine air temperatures declining at a rate of -0.008 deg C/decade…exactly the same as the -0.008 deg C/decade (-0.08 deg C/century) claimed by NOAA for the period of 1875-2000. That would appear at first to confirm the results of Huang et al. (2025)  (2015). The bottom graph in Figure 2 illustrates, for the same timeframe, the multi-model mean of the simulated sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures, which serve as the bases for the top graph. I’ve included the model outputs for 2000 to 2014 (dashed curves) in both graphs as a reference as well.

Figure 2
Note, however, in the top graph of Figure 2 there is a noticeable change in trend starting in the mid-1970s, with a sharp decline thereafter.
So let’s examine the trend for NOAA’s climatological period of 1971 to 2000. See Figure 3. For NOAA’s climatological period of 1971 to 2000, the consensus of the latest generation of climate models show the modeled difference between the global (60S-60N) sea surface and marine air temperatures declining at an increased rate of -0.021 deg C/decade…far greater than the -0.008 deg C/decade (-0.08 deg C/century) claimed by NOAA for the period of 1875-2000.

Figure 3
Referring to the bottom graph of Figure 3, the modeled marine air temperatures are warming slightly faster than the modeled sea surface temperatures over NOAA’s climatological period. In other words, the consensus of the new-and-improved climate models contradicts the NOAA (Huang et al. 2015) finding about their first assumption for using marine air temperatures to adjust the biases in sea surface temperatures measured from ships…or any sea surface temperature data.
But we’re really not interested in the period of 1971 to 2000. We’re more interested in the period of 2000 to 2014, because it was the period NOAA (Karl et al. 2015) used for their claim, “the continuation of the ship correction had the largest impact on trends for the 2000-2014 time period, accounting for 0.030°C of the 0.064°C trend difference with version 3b.”
Figure 4 is similar to Figures 2 and 3, but in Figure 4 we’re illustrating the model results for the period of 2000 to 2014. The only difference is, these models now the models also include projected forcings, in addition to historic forcings. The transition from historic to projected forcings occurs at 2005/2006 in most models. (It’s not a feature I selected.) But I did select the RCP6.0 forcing scenario, because I did not want to be accused of cherry-picking the worst-case RCP8.5 scenario.
Not too surprisingly, in the top graph of Figure 4, the multi-model mean (the consensus) of the new-and-improved climate models shows a drop in the temperature difference between the sea surface temperatures and marine air temperatures. In fact, the -0.027 deg C/decade trend of the modeled temperature difference is comparable to the 0.030 deg C/decade adjustment NOAA made (using night marine air temperatures) to the ship data for the period of 2000 to 2014.

Figure 4
That is, using the newer models, the consensus (the groupthink) of the modeling groups expects that marine air would warm faster than the surfaces of the oceans for 2000 to 2014…at a rate that is comparable to the “correction” applied to the ship data using night marine air temperature. This invalidates the second of NOAA’s assumptions that “the climatological difference of SST and NMAT is constant in other periods”. It clearly is not.
Simply put, NOAA appears to have adjusted out a difference between ship temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the newer climate models. That assumes that NOAA’s other grand assumption…“The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”…is correct.
Let’s put that into perspective. NOAA appears to have assumed that night marine air temperatures warmed at the same rate as marine air temperature (day and night). They used marine air temperatures in place of night marine air temperatures to verify their first two assumptions. Also consider that the consensus of the latest generation of climate models indicate that marine air temperatures should be warming at a higher rate than sea surface temperatures since about the mid-1970s. Yet, taking those considerations into account, NOAA’s end product, their new “pause-buster” ERSST.v4 data, shows the opposite relationship. Their new sea surface temperature data show a noticeably higher warming rate than the night marine air temperature data (HadNMAT2) they used as a reference. See Figure 5, which is Figure 1 from the post Open Letter to Tom Karl of NOAA/NCEI Regarding “Hiatus Busting” Paper.

Figure 5
Note: That graph ends in 2010 because the HadNMAT2 data end then. That of course raises the question: how does NOAA (unjustifiably) adjust the ship data after 2010? [End note.]
Bottom line: according to the latest generation of climate models, marine air temperature should warm faster than sea surface temperatures, but not in NOAA’s much-tinkered-with world.
CLOSING
Again, my illustrations show the expected global (60S-60N) relationships between marine air temperatures (day and night) and sea surface temperatures because NOAA used them to verify a relationship between night marine air temperatures and sea surface temperatures.
Also, I have not masked the model results so that they only include the grids with ship-based sea surface temperatures, as NOAA appears to have done. But, according to the consensus of the climate models used by the IPCC for their 5th Assessment Report, the expected relationship globally (60S-60N) is that Marine Air Temperature has warmed faster than Sea Surface Temperatures since the mid-1970s.
I suspect, when Congressman Lamar Smith’s whistleblowers are concerned about rushing the Karl et al. (2015) study “before appropriate reviews of the underlying science and new methodologies used”, they’re discussing:

the uncertainties of the bias adjustments,
the uncertainties of the data,
of course the basic methodologies, including how NOAA distributed those adjustments around the oceans, and
most importantly, for the “underlying science”, how NOAA appears to have adjusted out a difference between ship temperature measurements and night marine air temperature that should exist according to the consensus of the newer climate models—once again assuming that NOAA’s other grand assumption…“The model SAT is used since the model bias is assumed to be the same during daytime and nighttime”…is correct.

Maybe, in time, Dr. Sullivan of NOAA will produce the emails requested by Representative Smith so that we can confirm my suspicions and the suspicions of many others.

Guest Opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
Every time a serious threat to IPCC climate science appears, whether scientific or political, diversions and counterattacks are implemented. It usually involves people and agencies at the highest levels, with dissemination and support through major media outlets. One of the earliest examples involved changes to the 1995 IPCC Report Chapter 8 comments agreed on in committee. The response is proportional to the political damage they perceive. Avery and Singer noted about Chapter 8 changes,
“Santer single-handedly reversed the ‘climate science’ of the whole IPCC report and with it the global warming political process! The ‘discernible human influence’ supposedly revealed by the IPCC has been cited thousands of times since in media around the world and has been the ‘stopper’ in millions of debates among nonscientists.”
The misleading item is then defended and substantiated by a cover-up and later cited as evidence that nothing was wrong. In that case, an article was quickly produced and published in Nature within a year (July 1996). The problem was it used a selected portion of a graph to show a trend that was not evident in the full record. See below:
John Daly recreated Santer et al’s graph (Figure 1) of the upward temperature trend in the Upper Atmosphere.

Figure 1
Then Daly produced a graph of the wider data set in Figure 2 and explains, “we see that the warming indicated in Santer’s version is just a product of the dates chosen” (Daly’s bold).

Figure 2
In addition, articles appeared in the New York Times attacking the credibility of Professors Fred Singer and Frederick Seitz. The attack on Singer began the now familiar connection of climate deniers as equal to the tobacco deniers because he had written a critique of the bad science in an article on second-hand smoke. His critique was later shown to be correct, but it was used to suggest he was supporting “big tobacco.”
A more challenging cover up was required after the 2009 release of emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. Recently, Elizabeth May, leader of the Canadian Green Party claimed official investigations exonerated the activities revealed by the emails. I responded that the investigations were corrupted, but did not have time to elaborate. May suggested my comments indicated I was looking for another lawsuit, referring to the lawsuits against me by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) members Michael Mann and Andrew Weaver. The latter is currently an elected Green Party member of the British Columbia legislature.
Michael Mann also claims these investigations exonerated him and the CRU activities in his lawsuits with Mark Steyn.
One of Mann’s arguments is that his work has been “exonerated” by a number of investigations, including that of EPA. As our reply brief shows, that is simply untrue. But one thing that EPA did examine was Mann’s own claim that the work of certain opposing scientists was a “fraud”. In EPA’s view, “fraud” is an “entirely acceptable and appropriate” term in scientific debate. (CEI Reply Brief at p.11.)
In short, EPA didn’t exonerate Mann, but it may well have exonerated the defendants.
The greatest threat to IPCC science came with the release of 1000 emails from the CRU in November of 2009. A further 6000 released in November of 2011 expanded and elaborated on the extent of activities and actions taken to produce a specific scientific claim. The emails provided evidence of the methods used to pursue what they referred to as “the cause” by key players in the IPCC Science and Summary for Policymakers reports. In their words, they tell us how they created the ‘scientific’ evidence to support the political agenda. CRU Director Phil Jones dismissed the material as normal scientific banter and added in a classic understatement to the UK Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee,
“I have obviously written some pretty awful emails.” 
It was no surprise that skeptics understood the significance of the emails because they confirmed what they were thinking and saying. A more accurate measure of their significance was the reactions of mainstream media who had pushed the IPCC AGW line. Andrew Revkin resigned from the New York Times and George Monbiot of The Guardian wrote,
“It’s no use pretending that this isn’t a major blow. The emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging. I am now convinced that they are genuine, and I’m dismayed and deeply shaken by them.
People like Monbiot were rattled, but some, possibly unaware of the implications of the emails, shrugged off the problems. Others, including a few politicians began to ask questions. It appears politicians spot scandals better than others as they are steeped in them directly or indirectly throughout their careers. Pressure to restore confidence in the IPCC and the CRU scientists was intense and growing. Both leaks achieved their objective of stunting advance of climate politics through the Conference of the Parties (COP) at Copenhagen, and ending support for the Kyoto Protocol while blunting the effectiveness of any substitute.
Response to Damage of Leaked CRU Emails
To salvage the entire IPCC process, it was essential to begin by restoring the credibility of the scientists exposed in the emails. Apparently the decision to pursue a cover-up was taken by major agencies directly involved, either because of political commitment, funding or both. They initiated five inquiries, apparently all orchestrated to mislead and cover up what the emails exposed.
Andrew Montford provided an excellent analysis of what went on in “The Climategate Inquiries.” The piece opens with a quote from Professor of Climatology Hans van Storch.
“We have to take a self-critical view of what happened. Nothing ought to be swept under the carpet. Some of the Inquiries—like—in the UK—did exactly the latter. They blew an opportunity to restore trust.”
The reason an insider like van Storch thinks they missed an opportunity is because he wanted explanations. Those carrying out the inquiries wanted to fool the public. Comments by Elizabeth May and Mann’s use of them in a court indicate their success. Disconnects between what “insiders” know and what the public perceive are central to other major deceptions. As David Wojick, IPCC expert reviewer, explained about the biggest deception, the Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
Glaring omissions are only glaring to experts, so the “policymakers”—including the press and the public—who read the SPM will not realize they are being told only one side of a story. But the scientists who drafted the SPM know the truth, as revealed by the sometimes artful way they conceal it.
Systematically omitted from the SPM are the uncertainties and positive counter evidence that might negate the human interference theory. Instead of assessing these objections, the Summary confidently asserts just those findings that support its case. These actions are advocacy, not assessment.
Leaked Email Inquiries
Lord Turnbull summarized the serious allegations in the Foreword to Montford’s report:

That scientists at the CRU had failed to give a full and fair view to policymakers and the IPCC of all the evidence available to them;
That they deliberately obstructed access to data and methods to those taking different viewpoints for themselves;
That they failed to comply with Freedom of Information requirements;
That they sought to influence the review panels of journals in order to prevent rival scientific evidence from being published.

Three United Kingdom Inquiries:
1. The UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee investigation was required because of the involvement of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) and its links with the CRU. A former Director of the UKMO, John Houghton was appointed the first head of the IPCC.
This inquiry seems pointless, other than as an opportunity for politicians to be able to say they had considered the issue of the leaked emails. They initially canceled their inquiry when the University of East Anglia said they were investigating. Apparently because of pressure or because some saw political opportunities they sought input from the public, but only received 58 submissions. They effectively deferred to the UEA. Sir Muir Russell, Chair of one of the UEA investigations appeared before them to explain what he was doing.
Four other panels were questioned, but nobody qualified or knowledgeable about climatology was included, knowledge essential to understanding what the emails were saying. They did not finish their work because of an election. They assumed the Oxburgh and Russell inquiries would resolve the matter. Attempts to strongly admonish the CRU for their actions were all defeated.
2. The Oxburgh panel was appointed and directed by UEA. It was likely the most compromised of the inquiries so much so that its findings are meaningless except as evidence of a cover-up.
There were no written terms of reference. UEA said Oxburgh was going to investigate the science. He didn’t. Oxburgh and his committee of six were recommended by the Royal Society, which was directly involved in promoting the IPCC and CRU. A recent article by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) exposed the Royal Society’s activities in distorting and misrepresenting climate science.
Oxburgh was compromised because he is a Fellow of the Royal Society, but more important, he is CEO of Carbon Capture and Storage Association and Chairman of Falck Renewable Resources that benefit from the claim that human CO2 is causing warming. He also promoted the warming claim as UK Vice-Chair of GLOBE International, a consortium of Industry, NGOs’ and Government that lobbies for global warming policy.
• The Oxburgh Inquiry was directed to examine the CRU science, but failed. The other failures;
• There were no public hearings:
• There was no call for evidence.
• Only 11 academic papers were examined; a list vetted by Phil Jones, Director of the CRU, the agency central to the investigation.
• Only unrecorded closed interviews with CRU staff were held.
• There were no meetings with CRU critics.
• UEA had effective control throughout the Inquiry.
• The UK House of Commons Select Committee grilled Oxburgh on the shallowness of his study and report and its failure to review the science as promised.
3. The Independent Climate Change Emails Review (ICCER), more commonly called the Muir Russell Inquiry, was also created by the University of East Anglia.
It was compromised from the start by the conflict of interest of members. One appointment was Philip Campbell, editor of Nature. He resigned when his bias was revealed. Another appointee, Geoffrey Boulton, had two major problems. He had signed a petition from the UK Met Office declaring full support for the CRU and IPCC science. He had been employed at UEA when the Inquiry said members had no links to the university. He said he was not a climate expert when a CV sent to a Chinese University stated the opposite.
There was a call for public submissions on February 11, 2010 with a virtually impossible deadline of March 1, 2010 (17 days). They did not hold public hearings and only interviewed CRU and UEA staff. Those items alone are sufficient to indicate the bias of the inquiry to a preconceived result. In a commentary on the Muir Russell Report, Fred Pearce of the UK Guardian, a paper long known for its strong support of the IPCC wrote,
“Secrecy was the order of the day at CRU. “We find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness,” says the report. That criticism applied not just to Jones and his team at CRU. It applied equally to the university itself, which may have been embarrassed to find itself in the dock as much as the scientists on whom it asked Russell to sit in judgment.”
Montford’s report showed all three Inquiries and their reports had serious flaws. Lord Turnbull summarized Montford’s findings as follows.
· These inquiries were hurried
· The terms of reference were unclear
· Insufficient care was taken with the choice of panel members to ensure balance and independence
· Insufficient care was taken to ensure the process was independent of those being investigated, eg., the Royal Society allowed CRU to suggest the papers it should read
· Sir Muir Russell failed to attend the session with the CRU’s Director Professor Jones, and only four of fourteen members of the Science and Technology Select Committee attended the crucial final meeting to sign off their report.
· Record keeping was poor.
Turnbull concludes,
“But above all, Andrew Montford’s report brings out the disparity between the treatment of the incumbents and the critics. The former appeared to be treated with kid gloves and their explanations readily accepted without serious challenge. The letter [sic] has been disbursed denied adequate opportunity to put their case.”
One North American Inquiry at Penn State:
1. Penn State University appointed an inquiry because of involvement of Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at that university. Penn State University has procedures for Inquiry and also Investigation of Academic wrongdoing. In the leaked emails case, they carried out an Inquiry. The rules require five (5) tenured professors with competency, but no conflict. The committee appointed included one tenured professor, one untenured with an MS in Psychology, and an administrator. The untenured professor left during the Inquiry and was replaced by another administrator.
There was no call for evidence or public hearings. They only interviewed three people. Michael Mann was asked about questions for which he had prior notice. Gerald North of Texas A & M and Donald Kennedy of Stanford were interviewed. Neither was involved with the emails, but were publicly sympathetic to the IPCC work.
Comments by Clive Crook about the Penn State Inquiry provide an excellent summary:
“The Penn State inquiry exonerating Michael Mann—the paleoclimatologist who came up with the hockey stick—would be difficult to parody. Three of four allegations are dismissed out of hand at the outset: the inquiry announces that, for lack of credible evidence, it will not even investigate them. (At this, MIT’s Richard Lindzen tells the committee, “It’s thoroughly amazing. I mean these issues are explicitly stated in the emails. I’m wondering what’s going on?” The report continues: “The Investigatory Committee did not respond to Dr. Lindzen’s statement. Instead his attention was directed to the fourth allegation.”) Moving on, the report then says, in effect, that Mann is a distinguished scholar, a successful raiser of research funding, a man admired by his peers- so any allegation of academic impropriety must be false.”
Steve Milloy, the founder of the web page JunkScience, explains why Crook was so dissatisfied and did a similar analysis of the Penn State Inquiry as Andrew Montford did for the UEA Inqurieis:
· “The review apparently extended little further than the Climategate e-mails themselves, an interview with Mann, materials submitted by Mann and whatever e-mails and comments floated in over the transom. Not thorough at all.
· Comically, the report explains at length how the use of the word “trick” can mean a “clever device.” The report ignores that it was a “trick… to hide the decline.” There is no mention of “hide the decline” in the report.
· The report concludes there is no evidence to indicate that Mann intended to delete e-mails. But this is contradicted by the plain language and circumstances surrounding Mann’s e-mail exchange with Phil Jones — See page 9 of Climategate & Penn State: The Case for an Independent Investigation.
· The report dismisses the accusation that Mann conspired to silence skeptics by stating, “one finds enormous confusion has been caused by interpretations of the e-mails and their content.” Maybe there wouldn’t be so much “confusion” if PSU actually did a thorough investigation rather than just relying on the word of Michael Mann.
· Although PSU is continuing the investigation, its reason is not to investigate Mann so much as it is to exonerate climate alarmism. On page 9 of the report, it says that “questions in the public’s mind about Dr. Mann’s conduct… may be undermining confidence in his findings as a scientist… and public trust in science in general and climate science specifically.”
One International Inquiry:
The Inter Academy Council (IAC) is a UN group designed to act as a public relations panel for national academies of science. It was commissioned by the IPCC to investigate their procedures. It is very limited because of previous close and conflicting connections with IPCC Chair, Rajendra Pachauri.
Brief Overview of the Inquiries:
A brief analysis of each inquiry explains why Clive Crook, Senior editor of The Atlantic wrote:
“I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific consensus. But no, the reports make things worse. At best they are mealy-mouthed apologies; at worst they are patently incompetent and even wilfully wrong. The climate-science establishment, of which these inquiries have chosen to make themselves a part, seems entirely incapable of understanding, let alone repairing, the harm it has done to its own cause.”
George Monbiot as a fierce advocate of the IPCC and the CRU wrote on his personal blog,
Yes, the messages were obtained illegally. Yes, all of us say things in emails that would be excruciating if made public. Yes, some of the comments have been taken out of context. But there are some messages that require no spin to make them look bad. There appears to be evidence here of attempts to prevent scientific data from being released, and even to destroy material that was subject to a freedom of information request.
Worse still, some of the emails suggest efforts to prevent the publication of work by climate sceptics, or to keep it out of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I believe that the head of the unit, Phil Jones, should now resign. Some of the data discussed in the emails should be re-analysed.
Overall Summary of the Investigations
There was a distinct pattern to the process used in each inquiry, which was clearly dictated by the cover up objective.

The people appointed to the inquiries were either compromised through conflict or had little knowledge of climatology or the IPCC process.
They did not have clearly defined objectives and failed to achieve any they publicized.
Interviews were limited to the accused.
Experts, who knew what went on and how it was done, that is understood what the emails were saying, were not interviewed.
Validity of the science and the results obtained as published in the IPCC Reports were not examined, yet the deceptions were to cover these problems.
All investigations were seriously inadequate in major portions so as to essentially negate their findings. It appears these inadequacies were deliberate to avoid exposure of the truth.
They all examined only one limited side of the issues, so it was similar to hearing only half of a conversation and what you hear is preselected.

The mock inquiries achieved their objective because the media stopped asking questions. People, like Elizabeth May, accepted their findings as legitimate. It also allowed those people identified in the emails to claim they were absolved of any wrongdoing.
Emeritus Professor Garth Paltridge said:
“Basically, the problem is that the research community has gone so far along the path of frightening the life out of the man in the street that to recant publicly even part of the story would massively damage the reputation and political clout of science in general. And so, like corpuscles in the blood, researchers all over the world now rush in overwhelming numbers to repel infection by any idea that threatens the carefully cultivated belief in climatic disaster.”
But it is more than that. It was a political agenda driven by an ideology that believes the end justifies the means, even if it requires misusing science or protecting the people who misuse science. It is an ideology that requires cover-up of evidence or actions necessary to advance the agenda.

"Kenny Wells, the feckless owner of a Nevada mining company, is the latest entry in the Matthew McConaughey gallery of charming rogues. Swaybacked and paunchy, with a thinning dome and an appetite for Winstons and Seagram’s that would keep both brands in business if the rest of the world went cold turkey, Kenny doesn’t quite have the wolfish charisma or the mystical intensity of some of Mr. McConaughey’s other recent characters. But like them  —   like Mick Haller in “The Lincoln Lawyer,” Ron Woodroof in “Dallas Buyers Club” and that guy in those car commercials  —   he is fun to watch and hard not to root for. “Gold,” which chronicles a few of Kenny’s rises and falls in the 1980s, describes itself as “inspired by actual events,” but inspiration is precisely what the film, directed by Stephen Gaghan from a script by Patrick Massett and John Zinman, seems to lack. Mr. McConaughey is a ball of profane, entrepreneurial energy bouncing around in a vacuum. The story swings from the Nevada desert to the Indonesian rain forest to Wall Street boardrooms, and the screen bristles with signifiers of capitalist activity: meetings, phone calls, stock tickers. But the movie isn’t really doing any work. It’s just looking busy. Having nearly run the family prospecting business into the ground (so to speak) Kenny gambles on the expertise of a Mike Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) a geologist with an almost mystical reputation. They strike gold in Indonesia, and a gilded future opens up for Kenny and his longtime girlfriend, Kaylene (Bryce Dallas Howard). There are shadows and complications, of course, including the corruptions of wealth, the treachery of rivals and Kenny’s own impulsiveness. Broad hints are dropped that things will end badly. But enough goes wrong along the way  —   with the movie, I mean, not with Mike and Kenny’s scheme  —   to make the outcome feel almost moot. The film is well cast: You can’t really go wrong with Bill Camp, Corey Stoll, Stacy Keach and Bruce Greenwood. It’s beautifully shot (you can’t go wrong with Robert Elswit, either). There is a pleasingly sleazy, swaggering,   ’80s vibe. And there are flickering reminders of other ambitious,   mock epics, as if the filmmakers were hoping an algorithm would deposit “Gold” in the queues of viewers who liked “American Hustle,” “The Big Short” and Mr. Gaghan’s own “Syriana. ” With this material, he could have gone in any number of interesting directions, which may have been part of the problem. “Gold” could have been a biting satire of greed and folly, a   tale of Western misadventure in Asia, a rousing fable of underdog triumph or a caper comedy. It tries, in its frantic, clumsy fashion, to be all of those things, and comes close enough to succeeding to qualify as an honorable failure. What holds your attention is the question of whether that description fits Kenny as well. He could just as well be the opposite  —   a dishonorable success. He is far from a subtle guy, but Mr. McConaughey is a sly enough actor to make us wonder whether we’re in the company of a fool or a con artist and to make us question whether there’s really a difference. His wild, abrasive and improbably delicate performance is what makes “Gold” watchable, even if the rest of the movie doesn’t supply sufficient reason to keep watching."
"[A journalist (“Louise”) asked recently who funds the Carbon Sense Coalition.]
I and a few friends around Australia and overseas founded the Coalition. I have paid for the business registrations, web servers and all such related matters. No one has reimbursed me. A computer friend built the web site and has not sent a bill. He maintains our web site and has not sent a bill.
Other members have helped with research, editing and writing, and none have been paid for it.

My wife and I have paid for all email, phone, copying, postage and printing costs. And I have never sent a bill or been paid for my considerable contribution of time. Carbon Sense occupies an office under our home on a farm at Rosevale in Queensland. You are very welcome to visit, inspect and chat if you wish. We have never submitted a bill for office rent.
One long acquaintance provided us, gratis, a second hand colour printer.
A cousin who is a farmer sent two donations, totalling $1,500 to cover general expenses. A long term friend, who is a retired engineer, sent a donation of $250. There have been no other donations of any sort since Carbon Sense was formed. And we have not asked for them.
So, in summary, funding to date for the Carbon Sense Coalition is $1,750 cash and a second hand colour printer. 
(I notice on this morning’s news that Al Gore has raised $150 million of a planned $300 million for a campaign against carbon. It looks like he will outspend us. I wonder who is looking at where that big money is coming from?)
 Volunteers
You see, Louise, for committed people, reading, thinking and writing do not cost much. On this issue, the key requirement is a logical mind and a good scientific education. Many of our activists were lucky to be educated in the days when science education was a serious subject, not yet another excuse to promote some sociological agenda.
We rely on a world-wide band of volunteers, members and correspondents who assist with ideas, editing, and distributing our reports. We rely heavily on the people’s media, the internet. Our latest report was distributed in Europe, America, South Africa and New Zealand by an enthusiastic and growing band of supporters. With our network of web sites, blogs and contacts, we are dodging past the media monoliths like rabbits racing thru a mob of dozing elephants.
None of our growing band of contact managers are paid. They are motivated by their concern for the future and desire to use their knowledge to expose the truth. This coalition continues to grow and its numbers and geographical reach extend as people start to see the reality. We collaborate with about 50 other such bodies in almost every country of the world.
However, since you have raised the subject of funding, it is time we raised some funds. Should anyone offer funds with no strings attached, we would take them, even from newspaper barons. My truthfulness, opinion, or reputation is not for sale.  
Vested Interests
Funding touches on the subject of vested interests. I cannot think of a single person in Australia who has no vested interest in the Global Warming debate.
Every tax payer is being slugged for the hundreds of millions already being spent by federal, state and local governments on what we believe is a totally wasted cause. Should I be gagged because I am a taxpayer?
Every farmer faces huge increases in power and fuel costs and also carbon taxes on animal emissions. Should all farmers be prevented from speaking out? If farmers cannot speak out about their industry, who has a better right, or more knowledge?
Every person who eats food faces huge increases in food costs because of the increasing fuel and transport costs and the competition for food and land from subsidised ethanol production and carbon-credit plantations.  (I assume that you are aware of the growing international alarm about increasing food prices due largely to grains being diverted from food to fuel production?) Should I be prevented from commenting because I have a continuing interest in consuming food?
The shareholders of every coal company face bankruptcy if Bob Brown achieves his aim of closure of every coal fired power station and every coal mine. Should I be prevented from speaking out because among my investments for retirement, my wife and I hold a small shareholding in a coal mining company? Have you checked where your super-fund invests its money?
Every mining company faces huge increases in costs for power and transport if “Emissions Trading” is introduced. Should every shareholder, employee, contractor and executive in Australia’s most important industry be muzzled? 
I still earn part time money from mining and farming. I always have, long before Global Warming became a media tart. I have never hidden that fact – I am proud of it. Does this disqualify me because mining and farming are the primary targets of the anti-carbon crowd?
I travel occasionally, and the cost of travel will increase hugely because of proposed taxes on fuel. Does this disqualify me from speaking out if I believe this policy harms all travellers and tourists? 
Look Also on the Dark Side
Do not forget to look at the other side. Al Gore is earning millions from lecturing and shareholdings in companies set to benefit directly from the Cap and Trade policies he promotes. 
Moreover, every official and representative who contributes to or attends IPCC regular meetings (in remote unattractive spots like Bali, Kyoto and Rio) gets paid to do so by some poor taxpayer, as does every grandstanding politician. They are all off again on another junket right now. Have you revealed their vested interest in maintaining the rage?
Another vested interest is that large body of climate “researchers” who have received a huge slice of the $50 billion spent on this scam to date by governments around the world. Many of them are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them (although, as a farmer producing some of their food, I see they are doing just that.)
A closely related vested interest is that of the large body of dedicated environmental journalists who need daily environmental scares to keep the papers selling.
And of course do not forget the banks, merchant banks, regulators, lawyers and auditors looking forward to the enormous profit or growth possibilities in Emissions Trading. Look to the money trail – who’s going to benefit? I hope you ask them the same question you ask me.
In case you are interested and want to start digging into a story of real conflict of interests, I suggest you check these web sites:

Look for the Big News
So, Louise, I’m sorry there is no big story in the funding of the Carbon Sense Coalition.
However, there is big news in the Global Warming scam.
Have you as a citizen explored the fact that CO2 is the world’s plant food and the basis for all food on earth? Have you looked at what could happen to world food supply if we did indeed manage to significantly reduce CO2 in the atmosphere?
Are you aware that a colourless, odourless, non-toxic gas comprising a miniscule 0.038% of earth’s atmosphere and which is the source of all food on earth has been labelled a pollutant by unthinking zealots in the EPA?
Have you realised that the famed “Hockey Stick Graph” that started this whole hysteria has been proved a fabrication?
Have you reported the fact that global temperatures have plateaued for the last ten years, despite continual increases in man’s emissions of CO2?
Have your readers been told that because of the very steep fall in temperature in 2007, the average global temperature in January 2008 was the same as in January 1900?
Are you aware of the work on past climate history of the world that indicates that we have had several warm benign periods like today, but they are generally short lived. We have more to fear from barren ice ages than from today’s flourishing warm world?
Are you aware of the fascinating research by Danish scientists on the way the sun controls the formation of low level clouds, thus playing a major role in controlling surface temperature?
Have you checked out whether producing ethanol does reduce greenhouse gases?
Have you looked at what would happen to your lifestyle if we did manage to eliminate man-made CO2 emissions?
Well Louise, I hope I have given you enough material. Sorry this letter went on so long, but there is much to say. I hope to see you say more and am happy to be prompted by more questions.
If you would like to talk to some local representative of Carbon Sense in Perth, please let me know.  We may lack funds, but we do not lack people.
And remember, “David did slay Goliath”.
Yours sincerely
Viv Forbes

 _Behold; the [ **redacted** ] speaks._



 _‘But, what podium would give [ **redacted** ] a voice?’  
Do you have to ask? Really?_



Yesterday’s contribution to the ‘climate debate’ the people at _Stuff_ are not having was delivered by avowed ecommunist **Lynley Tulloch** , a philosophical gnat from the world-famous intellectual-vacuum known as Waikato Uni, or ‘Le Tron’. Yep; she’s a Tronskyite, typically handicapped by the lack of critical thinking celebrated at said school.



She advocates the overthrow of capitalism; the imperfect but mutually agreeable system encouraging the pursuit of individual agency as the path to self-betterment, a system which has delivered immeasurable benefit to humankind. In Tulloch’s imaginings she dreams the downfall of the most successful economic order ever devised will cure us of all the imagined evils caused by exposure to Li’l Miss Climate’s changing of her underpants; that regular phenomenon performed al least every several hundred years.



Basking in the very dim spotlight of Stuff’s pulpit, Tulloch praises the [Climate-change programme ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/state-organised-bullying-of-kids/)to be introduced in schools, but then declares such trifle as mere window-dressing:



in short, we can’t tinker around the edges of capitalism and try to green it. We need a complete economic and social revolution – one that challenges the core assumptions of industrial capitalist development. We need economic de-growth.



De-growth? That would be collapse – **economic collapse.**



If 1080-hating, possum-loving, vegan Tinkerbell Tulloch wishes economic collapse upon herself she’s welcome to it, but the [ **redacted** ], [ **redacted** ] has her wretched toe in the water our children will be drinking, poisoning it. She’s a teacher of teachers, and her mindless meanderings of yesterday are not some sort of devil’s advocacy, she’s [ **redacted** ] enough to believe her own verbal diarrhoea.



Her magnum-dopus ‘The Transnational State, Neoliberalism and Environmental Education Policy’ is marinated in pseudo-intellectual gobbledy-gook, saturated with [ **redacted** ], obsessing: _“The neoliberalized global world capitalist order is characterized by the ability of an economic elite to establish power through ideological means.”_



She hopes “Education can be a critical part of a counter-movement” and dreams of turning out little Marxists, so-called environmental issues are simply the bait: _“An ecopedagogical approach can empower students to develop the critical thinking capacities to challenge the environmentally, socially and species exploitative norms of neoliberal logic.”_



Her aim is economic destruction to usher in the neo-enlightenment of Tullochism. Keep the [ **redacted** ] away from [ **redacted** ].



 ** _Editor_** : _This opinion piece has been edited as a result of a University of Waikato Academic making legal threats, stifling the free exchange of ideas and continuing the cultural jihad against freedom of speech via New Zealand’s Universities._

"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States on Saturday after an executive order signed by President Trump, which sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, led to chaotic scenes across the globe. The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s actions. The   legal case played out on Saturday amid global turmoil, as the executive order signed by the president slammed shut the borders of the United States for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Massachusetts, a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio and countless others across the world. The president’s order, enacted with the stroke of a pen at 4:42 p. m. Friday, suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the order also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States. In a briefing for reporters, White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a    waiver to return. Mr. Trump  —   in office just a week  —   found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the judge’s decision could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at American airports. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled just before 9 p. m. that implementing Mr. Trump’s order by sending the travelers home could cause them “irreparable harm. ” She said the government was “enjoined and restrained from, in any manner and by any means, removing individuals” who had arrived in the United States with valid visas or refugee status. The ruling does not appear to force the administration to let in people otherwise blocked by Mr. Trump’s order who have not yet traveled to the United States. The judge’s   ruling came swiftly after lawyers for the A. C. L. U. testified in her courtroom that one of the people detained at an airport was being put on a plane to be deported back to Syria at that very moment. A government lawyer, Gisela A. Westwater, who spoke to the court by phone from Washington, said she simply did not know. Hundreds of people waited outside of the courthouse chanting, “Set them free!” as lawyers made their case. When the crowd learned that Judge Donnelly had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a rousing cheer went up in the crowd. Minutes after the judge’s ruling in New York City, another judge, Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court in Virginia, issued a temporary restraining order for a week to block the removal of any green card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. In a statement released early Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would continue to enforce all of the president’s executive orders, even while complying with judicial decisions. “Prohibited travel will remain prohibited,” the department said in a statement, adding that the directive was “a first step towards   control over America’s borders and national security. ” Around the nation, security personnel at major international airports had new rules to follow, though the application of the order appeared chaotic and uneven. Humanitarian organizations delivered the bad news to overseas families that had overcome the bureaucratic hurdles previously in place and were set to travel. And refugees already on flights when the order was signed on Friday found themselves detained upon arrival. “We’ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. “They’re literally pouring in by the minute. ” Earlier in the day, at the White House, Mr. Trump shrugged off the sense of anxiety and disarray, suggesting that there had been an orderly rollout. “It’s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,” he said. “It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. ” But to many, the government hardly seemed prepared for the upheaval that Mr. Trump’s actions put into motion. There were numerous reports of students attending American universities who were blocked from returning to the United States from visits abroad. One student said in a Twitter post that he would be unable to study at Yale. Another who attends the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was refused permission to board a plane. A Sudanese graduate student at Stanford University was blocked for hours from entering the country. Human rights groups reported that legal permanent residents of the United States who hold green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they sought to return from funerals, vacations or study abroad. There was widespread condemnation of the order, from religious leaders, business executives, academics, political leaders and others. Mr. Trump’s supporters offered praise, calling it a necessary step on behalf of the nation’s security. Homeland Security officials said on Saturday night that 109 people who were already in transit to the United States when the order was signed were denied access 173 were stopped before boarding planes heading to America.   people who were stopped were eventually given waivers to enter the United States, officials said. Legal residents who have a green card and are currently in the United States should meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. Officials did not clarify the criteria that would qualify someone for a waiver, other than that it would be granted “in the national interest. ” But the   administration appeared to be implementing the order chaotically, with agencies and officials around the globe interpreting it in different ways. The Stanford student, Nisrin Omer, a legal permanent resident, said she was held at Kennedy International Airport in New York for about five hours but was eventually allowed to leave the airport. Others who were detained appeared to be still in custody or sent back to their home countries. White House aides claimed on Saturday that there had been consultations with State Department and homeland security officials about carrying out the order. “Everyone who needed to know was informed,” one aide said. But that assertion was denied by multiple officials with knowledge of the interactions, including two officials at the State Department. Leaders of Customs and Border Protection and of Citizenship and Immigration Services  —   the two agencies most directly affected by the order  —   were on a telephone briefing on the new policy even as Mr. Trump signed it on Friday, two officials said. The A. C. L. U.’s legal case began with two Iraqis detained at Kennedy Airport, the named plaintiffs in the case. One was en route to reunite with his wife and son in Texas. The other had served alongside Americans in Iraq for a decade. Shortly after noon on Saturday, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an interpreter who worked for more than a decade on behalf of the United States government in Iraq, was released. After nearly 19 hours of detention, Mr. Darweesh began to cry as he spoke to reporters, putting his hands behind his back and miming handcuffs. “What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Mr. Darweesh said. “You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?” The other man the lawyers are representing, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was en route to Houston, was released Saturday night. Before the two men were released, one of the lawyers, Mark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked an official, “Who is the person we need to talk to?” “Call Mr. Trump,” said the official, who declined to identify himself. While the judge’s ruling means that none of the detainees will be sent back immediately, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case expressed concern that all those at the airports would now be put in detention, pending a resolution of the case. The White House said the restrictions would protect “the United States from foreign nationals entering from countries compromised by terrorism” and allow the administration time to put in place “a more rigorous vetting process. ” But critics condemned Mr. Trump over the collateral damage on people who had no sinister intentions in trying to come to the United States. Peaceful protests began forming Saturday afternoon at Kennedy Airport, where nine travelers had been detained upon arrival at Terminal 7 and two others at Terminal 4, an airport official said. Similar scenes were playing out at other airports across the nation. An official message to all American diplomatic posts around the world provided instructions about how to treat people from the countries affected: “Effective immediately, halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing” of visas to the United States. Internationally, confusion turned to panic as travelers found themselves unable to board flights bound for the United States. In Dubai and Istanbul, airport and immigration officials turned passengers away at boarding gates and, in at least one case, ejected a family from a flight it had boarded. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a promising young Iranian scientist, had been scheduled to travel in the coming days to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise the research fellowship. But Professor Michel said the visas for the student and his wife had been indefinitely suspended. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. A Syrian family of six who have been living in a Turkish refugee camp since fleeing their home in 2014 had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Cleveland. Instead, the family’s trip has been called off. “Everyone is just so heartbroken, so angry, so sad,” said Danielle Drake, the community manager for US Together, an agency that resettles refugees. A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained on Saturday morning at Philadelphia International Airport despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. In the case of the two Iraqis held at Kennedy Airport, the legal filings by his lawyers say that Mr. Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20, the same day Mr. Trump was sworn in as president. A husband and father of three, Mr. Darweesh arrived at Kennedy Airport with his family. Mr. Darweesh’s wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Iranian green card holders who live in the United States were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran, finding themselves in a legal limbo and unsure whether they would be able to return to America. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car, and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAtmospheric research scientist Dr. Philip Klotzbach at Twitter here tweeted a chart showing that accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) has not risen at all in 30 years, despite earlier massive hype and hollering by climate scientists and media, who insist “man-made” global warming is causing more frequent and intense cyclones.

In fact Klotzbach’s plot above shows that there has even been a modest decline.
So I tweeted a question to Dr. Klotzbach, and he was kind to answer as follows:

As the reader will note, Klotzbach does not see any link between cyclone activity and global warming over the past 30 years.
If we roughly plot CO2 levels vs ACE, no statistical analysis is needed to tell us that there is no correlation, except of course that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration might be causing a little bit less cyclone activity (which is the OPPOSITE of what is claimed by alarmists):

Plot of ACE since 1980 vs atmospheric CO2 concentration. ACE has dropped a bit. CO2 chart from NOAA.
Global temperatures have also risen since 1980 (many arguing it has more to do with ocean and solar cycles, and less so with CO2). Yet, here as well a temperature increase over the period has not led to a rising trend in cyclone activity.
The paper Dr. Klotzbach refers to can be seen here. He writes in the abstract:
Ten years ago, Webster et al. documented a large and significant increase in both the number as well as the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes for all global basins from 1970 to 2004, and this manuscript examines whether those trends have continued when including 10 additional years of data. In contrast to that study, as shown here, the global frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant downward trend while the percentage of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has shown a small, insignificant upward trend between 1990 and 2014. Accumulated cyclone energy globally has experienced a large and significant downward trend during the same period. The primary reason for the increase in category 4 and 5 hurricanes noted in observational datasets from 1970 to 2004 by Webster et al. is concluded to be due to observational improvements at the various global tropical cyclone warning centers, primarily in the first two decades of that study.
Globally, the year 2015 saw brisk cyclone activity, and thus has caused the trend since 1985 to be less steeply downward.

"**Hong Kong stocks have fallen again as another day of anti-government protests cast a shadow over the city and rattled investors.**
The Hang Seng index lost 2.2%, outpacing falls across Asia, continuing a downward path since Monday.
It comes amid more clashes between protesters and police, and the partial closure of the transport network.
Unrest has gripped the Asian financial hub for nearly five months, knocking the economy and business confidence.
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
""The situation in Hong Kong has taken a decidedly dark turn this week with the violence and economic disruption seemingly gathering pace,"" Oanda analyst Jeff Halley said.
He said worries about intervention by Beijing have ""ratcheted materially higher"" keeping Asian markets ""cautious at best"".
The protests have dealt a blow to the local economy and Hong Kong recently tipped into recession. Tourism and retail businesses have been among those hardest hit as travellers stay away.
""Social unrest, coupled with uncertainty from the US-China trade tensions, have dampened overall business sentiment in Hong Kong,"" IHS Markit analyst Maojun Ye said.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters started fires and threw petrol bombs.
Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."

As the ashes cool from Australia’s catastrophic bushfires, there are big questions to be grasped. Why did they happen, and what can we do about it? To that end, the Morrison government is hinting that it will convene a royal commission. As the saying goes, never hold an inquiry unless you know the outcome; and, indeed, almost everyone in Australia is certain that they have all the answers, already.



For the green-left, the answer is the same one that they have for almost everything: **climate change**. Many others, though, are adamant that the answer is one already put forward by multiple bushfires commissions, for the last 80 years: hazard reduction and mismanagement of the landscape, especially the wilderness. It seems that state governments, who are responsible for the latter, are worried that a royal commission will come to the same conclusion. Hence, they’re already marshalling their political forces against a commission – especially in Victoria.



For Morrison, then, a royal commission must seem like an unmissable opportunity to seize the narrative and hold negligent (mostly Labor) states to account for the disaster.



Most of the fires have taken place in forests for which the states are solely responsible. State governments know they would be held hostage to a royal commission of which they are part and they are probably petrified that once the monster is out of its cage, it will come to the conclusion that state governments grievously failed to insist on more backburning and to ensure the fire services were properly funded, staffed and equipped. The cunning Victorian government has already voiced its opposition to a royal commission and it is no co-incidence that it has a discreditable history of neutering the volunteer firefighters’ service and expanding the power of **Daniel Andrews’** mates in the highly-unionised city fire brigades.



But there is every threat that the commission will run out of the government’s control and simply become a bully-pulpit for the loudest shouters – the [Krazy Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/).



It will be the main vehicle that the Labor party, the Greens and the whole climate change and media lobby will use to beat the government over the head […] anyone with the right to appear will have an open go to say whatever they want in their so-called evidence. Witnesses will disparage anyone they wish and make endless speeches about the evils of climate change, how it alone has caused the bushfires and how the government is solely responsible for the whole disaster […] Picture Greta Thunberg in full flight, scowling and screaming ‘How Dare You?’ and you have a good idea of what the atmosphere will be like in a royal commission into bushfires.



As per [O’Sullivan’s Law](https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/02/osullivans-first-law-in-action.php), unless the government keeps a firm rein on the commission’s terms of reference and the appointment of its commissioners, the whole thing will become yet another Green-left circus. The left will almost certainly attempt to shoehorn the likes of a Flannery, a GetUp! activist, or some spotty “yoof” representative into a position of control.



Some form of inquiry is absolutely necessary, if nothing else, to call to account culpable state governments who’ve so far taken shelter behind the Media-left’s unhinged pile-on on Scott Morrison. A royal commission is not altogether unmerited (indeed, the roster of those most loudly opposed to it suggests who has the most to fear). But, unless the Morrison government displays the steely resolve of a John Howard, as opposed to the watermelon spinelessness of a Malcolm Turnbull, there is grave danger of it becoming the Klimate Kult’s very own inquisition.

 **Bonner Cohen,** Ph.D.  
 **[PA Pundits – International](https://papundits.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/consumer-victory-trump-pulls-plug-on-plans-to-kill-the-lightbulb/)**



As the year came to a close, the nanny state took it in the chin. Plans by the usual suspects – environmentalists, Capitol Hill know-it-alls, and other assorted busybodies — to regulate the incandescent lightbulb out of existence were tossed aside by the Trump Energy Department (DOE).



In 2007, the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Bush White House teamed up to impose tighter energy efficiency standards for “general service” lightbulbs. The goal was to set federal energy efficiency standards so high that traditional incandescent lightbulbs would disappear from store shelves and be replaced by compact fluorescent and LED bulbs. People were assured this would save them zillions in electricity bills while saving the planet from catastrophic climate change.



Lightbulb manufacturers were given several years to comply with the government-mandated transition. For those pushing the scheme, consumer choice was never a consideration. Yet eleven days before stricter energy efficiency standards were to begin, effective Jan. 1, 2020, DOE announced the regulations “are not economically justified.”



 **Innovation and Technology, Not Government Overregulation**



“Today the Trump Administration chose to protect consumer choice by ensuring that the American people do not pay the price for unnecessary overregulation from the federal government,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a statement. “Innovation and technology are already driving progress, increasing the efficiency and affordability of lightbulbs, without federal government intervention. The American people will continue to have a choice on how they light their homes.”



The new rule affects pair-shaped bulbs and a range of other forms of lighting, including three-way bulbs, cone-shaped reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in chandeliers and sconces, and round globe-shaped bulbs used in bathroom fixtures.



People who use dimmers in their homes and offices should also be pleased, because all incandescent lightbulbs are dimmable. LED lightbulbs also work on dimmers, but only if you have dimmable LED bulbs.



DOE said in its analysis that bringing traditional incandescent lightbulbs up to higher efficiency standards would triple the cost of bulbs.



“The increase is not economically justified because the bulbs do not last long enough for the energy savings to surpass the higher upfront price,” DOE noted.



 **Undoing Past Mistakes with Toilets and Dishwashers**



Americans have already paid dearly for government meddling in household appliances and fixtures. Under previous administrations, the Energy Department mandated low-flow toilets that don’t flush properly, wasting an enormous amount of water. It also issued “energy efficiency” standards for dishwashers. And how did that work out? Today’s dishwashers don’t clean dishes properly, forcing many people to run the machines a second time to get them clean. That wastes both water and electricity, driving up utility bills for consumers. The Trump administration is now undoing DOE’s screwing up the nation’s dishwashers by considering new, more sensible standards.



So, we begin 2020 with a tip of the hat to Thomas Edison, who gave us the first fully functional incandescent lightbulb in 1879. A constant tinkerer, his persistence and creativity improved the lives of millions of people the world over.

Australian of the Year Tim Flannery attempted to scare the horses recently by baldly claiming greenhouse gases are now at levels far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before. Is this a cry of warning from an eco-warrior or yet another blast of climate-porn from one of the world’s leading climate pornographers?
Traditionally pornographers produce material their audience may regard as obscene, or at least titillating. Climate pornographers produce material that is obscene, regardless of your viewpoint – extremist, alarmist and designed to frighten regardless of the facts, or the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the information to hand.

And, no, pornographer is not too harsh a word to use in regard to the climate change debate. Polemics such as Flannery and Al Gore have taken to using very harsh rhetoric in an attempt to silence their critics and anyone who dares question climate change dogma. If you want to live by words you risk death by words.
According to one website the earliest use of the term ‘climate porn’ to describe the excesses perpetrated by the mass media, environmental groups, politicians and celebrity eco-warriors to attract attention was this, in the Financial Post, as long ago as 2004:
Parental warning: Better lock down the Discovery channel along with the Playboy channel next Thursday unless you want to subject your kids to hours of climate porn and scenes of polar bears being killed off by the evil legacy of the industrial revolution and human addiction to speed, technology, power, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.
The same site, wordspy.com, defines climate porn as ‘extremist or alarmist language or images used to describe the current or future effects of man-made climate change.’
Flannery’s latest claims are the very definition of climate porn. He revealed to Australia’s ABC the contents of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) update report not due to be released until next month.
Why? Could it not wait a few weeks? Perhaps to alarm? Perhaps to get his name in the news again? According to the ABC news website Flannery was able to reveal, no doubt in tones of impending doom, that greenhouse gases are at ‘dangerous’ levels ‘far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before.’ One presumes the reference to public admission was intended to imply that governments, presumably those headed by Bush and Howard, have somehow conspired to hide data from an unsuspecting public. The problem of course is that governments do not control this data. In fact, the IPCC consists of thousands of scientists and reports to the UN, which is not exactly a hotbed of right-wing pro-business, oil-company loving conspirators.
Flannery was quoted as saying the new figures (the ones he had rushed to reveal ahead of proper scrutiny and release by the scientific community) show greenhouse gases had reached levels already deemed dangerous by mid-2005. Of course he neglected to reveal that there is no consensus about what these dangerous levels should pegged at. Nor did he rush to explain why, if the levels are ‘already’ so dangerous, the dire predictions he constantly peddles had not already come to pass.
Worse, he claimed these new figures, which only he is currently privy to, were ‘beyond the worst-case scenario as we thought of it in 2001’; and that the levels of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere were far beyond those previously modelled by climate scientists. Which all begs another question – if these climate models, which vary from one researcher to another by orders of magnitude are so accurate, why should we put any faith in them now they are apparently all proven to be wrong? Even the ‘worst-case scenarios’.
Then, the climate pornographic climax from Prof. Flannery: ‘We are already at great risk of dangerous climate change – that’s what the new figures say. It’s not next year, nor next decade; it’s now’. Now – no ifs, buts or maybes, dangerous climate change is upon us.
Flannery is intent on making constant outrageous predictions. He has claimed ‘there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ and that ‘we face … rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’
Flannery is a man who likes to mix possibilities and imagination to come up with apocalyptic headline-grabbing scenarios. Try this one: ‘Let’s project ourselves 50 years out and imagine that the rate of melt has continued so that the sea level has come up three or four metres. What that means is there’s barely a functioning port facility on the planet. So how do we go about international trade which is actually the centre of our global civilisation?’ Discounting the likely response of engineers and government completely this whole nightmare is constructed on the term ‘imagine’, not on science. On fear, not fact.
These types of gloom and doom catastrophe claims are starting to have an impact quite the reverse of that expected by the claimants. Just last week a leftist Think-Tank in the UK released a report arguing the overwhelmingly alarmist claims about climate change and global warming peddled in the mass media is ‘confusing, contradictory and chaotic, and with the likely result that the public feels disempowered and uncompelled to act.’
Warm Words: How are we telling the climate story and can we tell it better? was published by the Institute for Public Policy Research. It declares that the use of the sort of alarmism in which Flannery and Gore specialise is counterproductive. They say eco-celebrities and the mass media largely portray climate change as ‘awesome, terrible, immense and beyond human control.’ As one might expect from a leftist think-tank they then go on to recommend ‘communications from government and green groups should treat climate-friendly activity as a brand that can be sold, making it feel natural to the large numbers of people who are currently unengaged with the problem.’ Marketing tactics are better than fear tactics, they seem to argue.
But the point they are making appeals to common sense – if extremist fear tactics are in constant use the masses will soon feel disempowered. Not long after that they will give up all hope of participating in the debate and whatever reasonable changes might actually be required.
In other words climate porn is likely to be counterproductive. That which outraged our grandparents is now standard fare on Channel 10 – to them it was pornography, to today’s teenagers it is but entertainment.
Much of the alarmism and the fear tactics may very well be misplaced. Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth implies, wrongly, that Hurricane Katrina’s devastation can be put down to global warming. Links between Australia’s recent drought and global warming are also unproven. Use of terms such as fear, inevitable, catastrophe, freak weather, chaos, the collapse of civilisation, submerged, global threat and disaster in every headline, article and press release is unreasonable and the common man senses it.
Not every bad weather event is related to global warming. Not every catastrophe predicted by Flannery will come to pass. In fact most of his claims are so extreme, so pornographic, that perhaps none ever will?
Who knows – it might even turn out to be the best thing for the environment if Prof. Flannery and his fellow travellers stuck to science and swore off climate porn.

"MOUNT GILEAD, Ohio  —   The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump’s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. “I’d give him an ” Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. “He’s doing what he said he was going to be doing. ” So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  —     and reluctant supporters alike  —   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward “exaggeration. ” “Honestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,” said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. “Just do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It’s fine. ” Gun rights top Mr. Wade’s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. “There’s no doubt: He’s good at showmanship,” said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. “But I think this first week is proving he’s capable of following through on that with real action. ” But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  —   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. “Trump’s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,” said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour’s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump’s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. “I’m 100 percent behind the wall,” said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. “If he asked me to lay the first brick, I’d sign up. I’m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. ” She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate’s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton’s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  —   but he blanched at welcoming them here. “It should be about America first,” Mr. Cottrell said. “We see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we’re helping refugees and immigrants. ” Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. “I have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,” he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. “We have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,” she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday’s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   “Rorschach test” for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump’s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead’s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of   regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40, 000 canning room for her   business. “He’s a    person,” Ms. Meimer said of the president. “I wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press’s mind off what he’s really doing. ”"

"Type the word refugees into Facebook and some alarming “news” will appear about a refugee rape crisis, a refugee   disease epidemic and a   risk of female genital mutilation  —   none of it true. For the months leading up to the presidential election, and in the days since President Trump took office, ultraconservative websites like Breitbart News and Infowars have published a cycle of   stories with misleading claims about refugees. And it is beginning to influence public perception, experts say. That shift was evident on Friday, as many Americans heralded the news that the Trump administration intended to temporarily curb all refugee resettlement and increase the vetting of Syrians. “There really is a kind of cultural battle going on,” said Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. “There’s no question that kind of xenophobic or   bias is infecting our political discourse about refugees. ” In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement, Americans tend to cite concerns about the country’s national security and economic health as their biggest worries, but they have also begun to point to disease or rape, experts say. “This is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1, 000 to 1,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people’s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage. “I think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization,” Mr. Galston said. Outside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla. Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news  —   first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates. Then, he scrolls through Facebook, where he’s read stories about refugees who commit violent crimes against women. “It’s one of them Facebook things where you see Muslim men are attacking women, and stuff like that, and having no respect for them at all. I’ve got a real issue with that,” he said. “I see story after story after story, and I don’t know how true it is. ” Mr. Eason said he was skeptical of stories by unfamiliar websites like American News, but he reads them anyway. He commented on one that was posted to Facebook: The post, which was shared 14, 000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled “Allahu akbar” during the episode. Nevertheless, the comment that Mr. Eason posted on the site, which he later said he could not remember making, garnered 87 likes. “If Muslims are taught hate by their religion,” he wrote, “then all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be treated accordingly. TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff. ” Sgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff’s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an   name is charged with a crime. “To be honest,” he said, “it’s embarrassing and it’s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news  —   the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: ‘Send them back and get rid of them,’ and, ‘We don’t need them. ’” Worries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1, 400 times: And this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3, 000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a  : The actual number of refugees who have become extremists in the United States has been estimated at between three and 12  —   out of the more than 800, 000 who have resettled here since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The online stories about refugees range from outright fake news to those based on a grain of truth and then stretched out of proportion. For example, the Breitbart article about genital mutilation was based on a study that estimated that a   women currently living in the United States have had their genitals mutilated. But most of them were immigrants who had fled here because of such treatment in their home countries. Mr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense. He pointed to the vetting of Syrian refugees, for example, which is currently under review as part of Mr. Trump’s executive order. As The New York Times has reported, the process involves dozens of layers of evaluation and can last up to two years. But Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees’ stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient. “They were saying with them coming from these areas, it’s hard to vet them,” Mr. Eason said. “And it makes sense. ”"

"On a chilly October morning, Talea Childs, 4, still dressed in pajamas, bounced along the living room rug of a United States map. “Konnichiwa,” she greeted in Japanese, and bowed. Surrounded by shelves of her favorite books, she selected a thin volume and sat to read. “She’s been interested in books since she could belly over and look at the pages,” her mother, Trenicia Childs, said as Talea settled into the story. Ms. Childs is applying to kindergarten for next year  —   a notoriously rigorous process in New York City schools  —   and nurtures her daughter’s learning at home. A schedule taped to a cupboard by the kitchen lists Circle Time,   Storytelling, Cooking and other activities. Brushes, thick with paint, sit in a canister by the sink, and evidence of recent art projects lines the walls  —   abstract strokes of pinks, purples and green glitter. Also on the walls are posters of the solar system, the human body, the numbers through 100 and the words “large,” “small,” “run” and “walk” and associated words. While Talea read in the corner, Ms. Childs sorted through piles of housing documents. The Childses, who are among almost 565, 000 people in New York State who receive some public assistance, according to state calculations in June, never expected to need help. Ms. Childs, 45, and her husband, Tarrell Childs, 40, an Air Force veteran, have college degrees and work force experience. While serving in the military for a decade as an account finance specialist, Mr. Childs worked through an injury in 1997 that gouged and blinded his right eye. A Bronx native, he returned there in 2003, working full time while studying English literature at Fordham University. He wrote short stories, plays and short film scripts late into the night. The couple met at Moca Bar and Lounge at a spoken word performance in Harlem in 2010. Mr. Childs wondered aloud what their children would be like on their second date. A year later they were married and expecting their daughter. With Mr. Childs’s steady income as a property manager, Ms. Childs postponed completing her master’s in education to raise their daughter. She was one certification shy of graduation. But Mr. Childs lost his job in 2014 when his company restructured because of financial problems. “That’s when we really started getting behind,” Ms. Childs said. With his G. I. Bill benefits set to expire, Mr. Childs dusted off his screenplays and applied to the New York Film Academy. He got in. He planned to work while going to school, but he found that an accelerated yearlong conservatory program packed with   days did not allow for extra time. Although the military covered his studies, the family exhausted its meager savings. With little time to search for jobs during school, Mr. Childs graduated in September 2015 without work. That month, bringing in just $594. 98 in disability payments from Veterans Affairs, the Childses applied for public assistance, confronting a frustrating labyrinth of city departments and aid applications, according to documents provided by the family. They hoped the assistance would be temporary  —   keeping food on the table and bills paid on time  —   until they gained   employment. In October 2015, a month after they applied for aid, the city’s Human Resources Administration lost their paperwork. A month after that, the Homelessness Diversion Units forced them to reapply. And a month after that: the same story. Their debt quadrupled while they waited for paperwork to be fixed, and they faced imminent eviction after missing rent payments, the family said. With a worsened financial situation, the family was told that December that its rent was too high and its arrears too steep to qualify for assistance from the Homelessness Diversion Units, so it was referred to the Neighborhood Association for   Affairs, a nonprofit organization providing housing intervention and assistance services. That same month, the Childses found out they had qualified for public assistance through the Human Resources Administration. But two days later, another error closed their case, halting all public assistance, including food stamps. In early 2016, the Human Resources Administration reopened the case, and the family reapplied to the Neighborhood Association for   Affairs. But a week later the nonprofit denied the application. Eventually, in February, the Human Resources Administration referred the family for an eviction prevention subsidy. “It felt personal,” Ms. Childs said. “It was one more stressor when there were already weeks we didn’t have enough food on the table. ” In March, HomeBase, an eviction prevention program administered by Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped them navigate the complicated application process  —   which included another errant application closing in April  —   and avoid eviction. By this time, the family was $12, 193. 46 in arrears. “It’s right out of a Kafka novel,” said Alice Kenny, the organization’s director of special projects. In May, Catholic Charities got the city to help settle the Childs family’s arrears with a lump sum of $12, 083. 46. Then in June, nine months after initially applying for a housing subsidy, they received their first payment, along with another conciliation notice threatening case closure. The family resolved the notice and now receives $960 a month toward rent from the city. Still, despite noting Mr. Childs’s veteran status in September 2015, the family was not referred to the proper office for public assistance for more than a year. Last summer, Mr. Childs got a job as a substitute teacher. Working toward a teaching license while interning on film projects, he anticipates additional film work this year. In January, he began a work training program at a martial arts school in the Bronx, learning to become an instructor. Ms. Childs also temporarily worked at a   job with the federal Women, Infants and Children program. She has also taught English to children in their Bronx neighborhood and plans to return to school to study early childhood education and later open a toddler education program, based on the family’s educational approach at home. The family brings in $950 monthly, and currently has about $2, 000 in rent arrears. HomeBase provided the family with $340 in July to buy a dresser and a toddler bed for Talea. Then in September, Catholic Charities provided $162. 85 in Neediest Cases funds to cover the cost of Talea’s school clothes and bedding. Through public assistance, the family can use child care centers that are suggested and subsidized by the city. The family tried several of those education programs last year, but the workload and environment were not stimulating, Ms. Childs said, so she enrolled Talea at a Montessori school, where the family receives financial aid, in late October and doubled her efforts at home. The Childses have applied to five independent schools, where they believe Talea could thrive next school year, but the costs  —   estimated at $25, 000 to $45, 000 annually  —   are high. They have applied for financial aid to the schools through Early Steps, a nonprofit intended to increase diversity within kindergarten and   classrooms in independent schools. Talea will find out in February if she is accepted to any of the schools. At night, the family dresses up and improvises plays, which Mr. Childs records. Many end in life lessons.   is not one of them. While sitting on a park bench on a recent   outing, Ms. Childs said, she had a conversation with another mother who did not agree that everyone deserved the same chances. Unaware that the Childs family receives welfare, the woman depicted recipients as sloths sitting at home, sending their children to overpriced day care centers. “But is that who we are?” Ms. Childs asked, recalling the conversation. “The assumption is if you’re on public assistance, you don’t want to work. Yes, we receive a check every month. But we also work and are involved in our kid’s life. We’re working hard to make something of ourselves. So, no, that’s not who we are at all. ”"

The Warmunists are fond of stating that the warming in the late twentieth century was unusual and unprecedented, and could only have been caused by rising CO2. They refuse to recognize that the early twentieth century warming was just as rapid. Of course that statement is also based on the lack of data for earlier times.
But there ARE data for earlier times. The Central England Temperature (CET) data set extends all the way back to 1659 and has been maintained to this day. Here is a window into an early 90-year section of that data set, overlaid with the last 90 years.

Figure 1 is CET and GHCN temperatures from 1925 to the present, compared to CET temperatures from 1660 to 1750. The 45-year span from 1692 to 1737 is highlighted in red.
If the trends for all three 90-year data sets are compared, they are nearly identical, from 0.084 to 0.091°C per decade warming.
But the 45-year span from 1692 to 1737 was warming at nearly five times that rate, 0.4°C per decade. This warming rate is more than twice as fast as the late twentieth century rate, for twice as long.
Central England warmed by two degrees, three degrees if one measures from the coldest year to the warmest in that interval. For comparison, here is the GHCN data for the modern period.

Figure 2 is the modern era from GHCN with the modern warming in red and the early twentieth century warming in green. 
Please note that I have picked the time period with the most warming in that interval, including from the bottom of the 1976 La Niña to the top of the 1998 El Niño. The early twentieth century warming began with the 1914-15 El Niño. If the El Niño and La Niña events are removed, both warming periods have a trend of about 0.16°C per decade. The 0.4°C/decade warming period from 1692 to 1737 must have been very scary for the eighteenth century climatologists.
It all came to an abrupt end, however, in 1739 and 1740. The temperature dropped three degrees practically overnight in climate terms. See figure 1. What caused that? A volcano!
On the southern end of Hokkaido, in Japan, there is a large caldera called Shikotsu. It is now filled with a lake. This caldera was formed about 35,000 years ago. On the edge of the caldera three volcanic vents have been intermittently active since then. One of those, Tarumai, (or Tarumae) is active to this day, including four VE5, very large eruptions in 6950 BCE, 800 BCE, 1667, and 1739. Though both the 1667 and 1739 eruptions were classed as VE5, the 1739 event pushed enough gas into the stratosphere to affect global climate.
“In the northern hemisphere density of yearly tree ring [sic] have changed in AD 1740 (Briffa et al., 1998) suggesting the eruption of 1739 affected global climate.”
Sheveluch, on Kamchatka, is also implicated, but that eruption was only a VE3.
The resulting cold caused the “Great Irish Frost” of 1740, where Irish harbors and rivers froze over, preventing import of grain, frost killed the potato crop, and 20 to 30% of the Irish population died of cold and famine. The cold affected all of northern Europe, but was a disaster for Ireland due to the politics of the time. For a scholarly treatise on it see The Irish famine of 1740–1741: famine vulnerability and “climate migration”, here. The implication is that the good years prior to 1740, made Ireland in particular, vulnerable to a cold snap. This is the thing to be feared in our future rather than continued warming.

"**Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says he is launching the ""final phase"" of the army's operation in the northern region of Tigray after weeks of fighting.**
He said the military would try not to harm civilians in the regional capital Mekelle - a city of 500,000 people - and urged residents to stay at home.
The TPLF party, which controls Mekelle, has vowed to keep fighting.
The UN warns of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacks Mekelle.
UN human rights chief Michele Bachelet told the BBC the city's inhabitants were in ""deep peril"".
""We're really alarmed by the dangerous situation particularly because of the civilians trapped in Mekelle,"" she said, adding that there was ""potential for serious violations of international humanitarian human rights law"".
The UN has also expressed concerns about the lack of access to the region for humanitarian workers.
The Ethiopian authorities on Thursday said that ""a humanitarian access route"" overseen by the government will be opened up, adding that they were ""committed to work with UN agencies... to protect civilians and those who need it"".
Mr Abiy's announcement on the military operation came after a deadline he gave for Tigray fighters to surrender passed on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed and thousands have been forced from their homes as Ethiopian forces have seized various towns in Tigray from the TPLF.
Details of the fighting are hard to confirm because all phone, mobile and internet communications with the Tigray region have been cut.
Journalist and political activist Daniel Berhane, who is in Mekelle, told the BBC there was no sign yet of any attack, and that shops, cafes and restaurants in the city were ""almost full"".
Three African Union representatives have arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to try to broker talks but Ethiopia has so far rejected all mediation attempts, saying the conflict is an internal matter and Mr Abiy's government is engaged in a law enforcement mission in Tigray.
The three envoys will not be allowed to travel to Tigray.
Also on Thursday, Ethiopian troops were deployed along the Tigray region's border with Sudan, where they prevented people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The BBC's Anne Soy, on the Sudanese side of the border, saw at least a dozen members of the Ethiopian military, leading to a marked decrease in the number of people crossing into Sudan.
More than 40,000 people have fled Ethiopia since the conflict began.
**By Kalkidan Yibeltal, BBC News, Addis Ababa**
In the ""final phase"" of the military offensive that PM Abiy launched following the expiry of the 72-hour ultimatum, he spoke of a military strategy in which top personnel of the TPLF would be brought to justice without harming civilians or properties in and around Mekelle.
It is not clear what that strategy is but it will not be easy to carry it out, particularly if there's active fighting in the city. Artillery attacks, as were suggested by an army official last week, and airstrikes are particularly difficult to conduct without killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure.
The federal government's troops could be met with a sort of guerrilla warfare from the area outside Mekelle.
And it could also take longer than the government would like to conclude the offensive. That could mean a worsening of the humanitarian crisis and consequently more international pressure.
In the past three weeks the government has taken control of a number of areas in Tigray but at a cost. An offensive on the state capital - believed to be the main stronghold of the TPLF - could be even more costly.
He ordered the Ethiopian military to launch an offensive on Mekelle in the ""third and final phase"" of the federal government's military campaign against the TPLF.
Mr Abiy said ""great care"" would be taken to protect civilians and ""all efforts"" would be made to limit damage to Mekelle.
He urged people in Mekelle and the surrounding areas to disarm, stay at home and keep away from military targets.
Religious and historical sites, institutions and residential areas would not be targeted, he said.
The leader of the powerful regional party, Debretsion Gebremichael, has said Tigray forces are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Some analysts fear that the situation could turn into a guerrilla conflict - with the TPLF continuing to mount attacks on government forces even if they take Mekelle.
One example of how this might play out is the battle for Aksum airport, which according to pro-government sources fell to Ethiopian forces on 11 November and is still controlled by them.
But 11 days after the capture state media published pictures of the runway apparently strewn with rubble and with trenches dug across it to prevent planes landing, accusing the TPLF of sabotage attacks. Mr Debretsion denied destroying the airport, saying his forces had put up obstacles to stop the Ethiopian army.
Reuters quoted a diplomatic source as saying the TPLF ""have mobilised lots of people in Mekelle"". The person added: ""They are digging trenches and everyone has an AK-47 [rifle].""
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed. The TPLF has denied involvement.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's central government and the TPLF, which was the dominant political force in the whole country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018 and introduced a series of far-reaching reforms.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle."

Nothing is more dangerous than bad science driven by arrogance. Readers here are very much aware of this when it comes to climate science. Yet, as surprising as it may sound, the problem of junk science is even far worse in the field of Nutrition.
Book (right) available at Amazon.
Recently I read a book written by Dr. Weston Price, published in 1938 – almost 80 years ago: Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.
Weston Price was an American dentist who had been shocked by the wave of physical degeneration he observed among patients, who suffered tremendously from caries and facial deformities, along with the number of crippling diseases that seemed to accompany it.
To find out what was happening, he journeyed to many remote regions across the globe to study “primitive” tribes and people who were still isolated from “modern” living. What he found was stunning and revealing: These people were in tremendous physical and mental condition. He observed that physical degeneration had little to do with genetics, was mostly nutrition-based, and that it took only one generation to turn a physically superior community of people into a health and societal basket case.
He journeyed to isolated areas of the globe where the so-called “primitive” people relied on their own local natural food sources and customs for nourishment and health. Their practices had been perfected over generations. Price examined tens of thousands of teeth, facial forms, dental arches of not only living persons, but also of exhumed skulls. He found near dental perfection and few modern diseases among them. Health was at an impeccable level.
No matter if it was a community in Switzerland or Polynesians in the South Pacific, those who relied on their traditional food staples were in a state of excellent health and near physical perfection.
Throughout the book Price describes natives of great physical strength, well-being, keen intelligence and near zero crime rates within their communities. Cancer, heart disease and metabolic syndrome – our modern diseases – were almost non-existent.  But as soon as these peoples and tribes came into contact with western “modern” nutrition, their health deteriorated rapidly and dramatically.
What follow are sample photos of what Dr. Price typically found. It did not matter where or what race he examined. They were all healthy and shared a common denominator: excellent animal-based nutrition.

Isolated communities living on “primitive” diets had near perfect health. Rates of caries were close to zero. Shown above is a sample of people from various locations around the globe. Modern diseases were rare. Photos: Weston Price Foundation
It was only when the “modern” western foods of “civilization” – comprising in large part sugar, white flour, syrups, polished rice and canned goods – were introduced by the whites did a profound and rapid deterioration in the health of these isolated tribes and groups take place.
Price often observed parents of superior physique, facial form and dental health –  but whose children had been ravaged by caries, deformed dental arches and poor health because they had switched to the “modern foods”.
As was common back in the early 20th century, “experts” often blamed the facial deformities and poor health on race mixing. Another scientific debacle.

What follows is a table showing a selection of isolated, “primitive” tribes and peoples that Price studied, and who had robust physiques and health. Note the very low rates of caries – all without the need for “modern” dentistry.


The above table is just a sampling of many tribes and peoples Price studied.
But once the modern western foods were introduced, many of these healthy societies literally collapsed. What the diseases of the encroaching “modern” civilization didn’t kill off, the newly introduced “modern” foods did the rest, laying many of these once healthy societies to waste.
When we look at the above tables, it is clear that one thing stands out: The common food staples necessary for good health are in large part made up of natural, animal-based foods such as fish, shellfish, organ meat, animal fat, dairy, vegetables, plant life, insects and some fruit.
In short: their diets were as remote of a vegan or vegetarian diet as one could possibly get. Price writes that many of these tribes and peoples also had advanced medical, veterinary and engineering skills, which also were lost since the invasion of “modern” junk food.
The key component to these healthy individuals was animal product. Price confirmed it in his book.
Western society is deep in the Nutrition Dark Ages
It becomes clear that our modern nutrition has completely diverged from what the human species was originally designed to consume. Worse, it is evident that modern nutrition risks diverging even further away as junk diet fads such as veganism are being promoted as the way to health. Here many greens are unwittingly advocating the worst of both worlds.
The truth today, as Price reveals, is that our modern society is deep in the Dark Ages of Nutrition and it’s going to take a lot of time, effort, education and resources to crawl back out of that abysmal pit. Unfortunately many more tens of millions in western society will further suffer from the ravages of our “modern” food before things get better. The burden risks collapsing our entire society if something is not done soon.
Of course no one advocates returning to “primitive” life standards. But why isn’t it possible to integrate the advanced nutrition of these isolated natives with our modern society?
Today tens of millions are suffering and dying from metabolic syndrome and its related diseases. Hundreds of millions more are at high risk. It is one of the great scientific catastrophes of human history.
What is needed is a Nutrition Renaissance – and quickly.

"**A former guerrilla fighter who used to jam the communication network of Ethiopian troops, Debretsion Gebremichael is now leading the fight against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government for control of the northern Tigray region, described as the ""womb"" of the nation.**
Mr Debretsion leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party which controls Tigray, and which has fallen out so dramatically with Mr Abiy.
Now married with a young child, Mr Debretsion cut short his studies at the University of Addis Ababa in the 1970s to join the TPLF in its 17-year war against Marxist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime.
He then went on to be a government minister after the Derg had been defeated and replaced by a coalition of parties dominated by the TPLF until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
His close friend and comrade Alemayehu Gezahegn said that after they had both completed their military training in the rugged and mountainous terrain of Tigray and, noting his comrade's technical skills, he suggested to TPLF commanders that Mr Debretsion should be deployed to the ""technical unit"".
For Mr Alemayehu, this was the logical place for Mr Debretsion, as he was a bright, but reserved, ""city boy"" who grew up in Shire, which, in a major blow to the Tigray leader, is now under the control of federal troops.
Coming from an Orthodox Christian family, the Tigray leader was named Debretsion, which means Mount Zion, while his second name is that of his father, Gebremichael, meaning Servant of Saint Michael.
""When he was in primary school, he used to collect old batteries, radios, electric equipment, and fix them. When no-one had electric power in our town, he made a lightbulb for himself from scraps,"" Mr Alemayehu recalled.
Mr Debretsion excelled in the TPLF's ""technical unit"", playing a vital role in developing intelligence capabilities so that the TPLF could eavesdrop on the conversations of the Ethiopian army and jam their radio communications.
""This helped us to win because TPLF freedom fighters knew about enemy movements in advance, and, being jammed, they could not communicate with each other when they were attacked,"" Mr Alemayehu said.
To further develop his skills, Mr Debretsion travelled to Italy on a false passport and returned to set up the TPLF's first radio station - Dimtsi Weyane, meaning Voice of the Revolution.
Another TPLF guerrilla fighter, Measho Gebrekidan, recalled that they used to go to the mountains at night, when the chances of being spotted by government spies were slim, to install antennas.
""One night, he slipped... and it was me and another comrade who saved his life. I always thought that if this had happened, would this radio have been created?"" Mr Measho said.
Now Dimtsi Weyane is part of a multilingual and multiplatform media group based in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, broadcasting TPLF statements about its military confrontation with the federal government.
The media station has broadcast fierce criticism of Mr Abiy, and as the conflict began its signal was jammed, but Dimtsi Weyane was back on air the next day.
Mr Debretsion and Mr Abiy seemed to be friends at the start of the prime minister's time in office in 2018. The Tigray leader even arranged a rapturous welcome for the prime minister in Mekelle.
""Tigray is a place where the history of our country is cooked, and it's the region where foreign invaders [including Italians and Egyptians] had been defeated and embarrassed. In modern Ethiopia, it is the womb of Ethiopia,"" Mr Abiy said in 2018.
For his part, Mr Debretsion hailed the prime minister's peace initiative with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki to end the ""no war-no peace"" situation that had existed between the two countries since the end of their 1998-2000 border conflict.
""[Mr Abiy] travelled to Eritrea and met Isaias. This was impossible for many years. It's a big deal because it is going to give a massive opportunity for the country,"" Mr Debretsion said when the deal was agreed.
But this display of comradeship appears to have masked the tensions that were brewing between the two men.
Mr Debretsion had ambitions to be prime minister himself and lost out to Mr Abiy in the 2018 contest within the ruling coalition.
**You may also be interested in:**
""I told him: 'You are immature. You are not the right candidate',"" Mr Debretsion told the UK-based Financial Times newspaper in 2019.
But his defeat did not come as a surprise, as the TPLF had become synonymous with repression and corruption during its 27 years as the dominant country's dominant political force.
Views about Mr Debretsion's performance when he was working in government are mixed.
His critics say that when he was the deputy head of the intelligence bureau in the 1990s, he was instrumental in spying on opposition figures, and helping to crush dissent.
But his supporters focus on the fact that he transformed Ethiopia's telecommunications infrastructure when elevated to the cabinet, where he served as deputy prime minister and as minister of communications and information technology.
He launched massive projects to expand mobile phone coverage across Ethiopia, though the state kept a monopoly over the industry, and the telecom company has been criticised for internet shutdowns aimed at curbing anti-government protests.
""Most of the power and telecom infrastructure projects were led by him,"" US-based public policy expert Dade Desta said.
""The IT Park that is now in Addis Ababa was his idea [and] his fingerprints can be found in many state-owned projects.""
This includes the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is now at the centre of diplomatic tensions with US President Donald Trump warning that Egypt might ""blow it up"".
The TPLF and the prime minister parted ways when Mr Abiy dissolved the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling coalition of ethnically based parties, to launch the Prosperity Party in 2019, arguing this would help unite the country.
The TPLF refused to join, arguing that Ethiopia's federal nature was a better way to manage the country's deep ethnic divides.
Mr Debretsion returned to Tigray where he was seen as a reformist. He allowed four new political parties to contest the regional election held in September in defiance of the federal government.
""My door is open to everyone,"" he often said.
""We want development; not war,"" was another common statement of Mr Debretsion.
But now, he finds himself at the centre of a conflict that is reported to have killed hundreds of people, forced more than 30,000 people to flee to neighbouring Sudan, and damaged crucial infrastructure - including roads and buildings - in a region with the highest levels of poverty in Ethiopia, according to the UN.
""Mr Debretsion counts this war as a curse,"" Mr Dade said.
But, he added, he expected the TPLF to strongly resist attempts by Mr Abiy to establish a new administration in Tigray.
""They [the TPLF] were in the war with Eritrea, and the struggle against the Derg. So they have enough experience. By its nature, war needs the will of the people to fight, which there is in Tigray,"" Mr Dade said, raising the prospect of a long conflict.
However, Mr Abiy is also confident that he can defeat the TPLF and bring Mr Debretsion, who is facing charges of treason and rebelling against the constitution, to justice.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.

Robert Bussard, one of the giants of the field, claimed to his dying day he had cracked the problem
Above: a homemade “fusor” similar to the Polywell nuclear fusion reactor
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Not many people have heard of Robert Bussard, but he was one of the giants of nuclear fusion research. But if an engineering solution for viable small, household size nuclear fusion reactors is ever discovered, they will almost certainly be largely based on Bussard’s work.
Bussard’s focus was on a field of Nuclear fusion research known as electrostatic confinement. Unlike the better known magnetic bottle reactors, such as the $20 billion ITER project, electrostatic confinement can be applied to fusion plasmas which are the size of a small glass fish tank.
Electrostatic confinement has been well known since the 1930s. Small electrostatic nuclear fusion devices are sold commercially – as neutron sources. A small nuclear fusion reactor is an incredibly convenient way to produce a dense stream of neutron radiation, because as soon as you switch off the power, the plasma cools, and the radiation stops.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_generator
The problem is nobody has figured out how to extract more energy out of an electrostatic fusor, than you put into it. There is a long list of problems to be solved. One of the big problems with viable nuclear fusion is keeping the plasma hot enough – when you heat something to millions of degrees, it really wants to shed some of its heat. In electrostatic confinement systems, the violent acceleration / deceleration, as charged plasma particles bounce off the high intensity electric fields, causes a significant cooling of the core. There are also problems with the electrodes – keeping an electrode from melting, when it is in close contact with a superheated gas, is a significant engineering challenge.
Bussard at the end of his life, claimed to have solved these problems. He built a small prototype using a grant from the US Navy. Right up to his dying day, he was trying to raise funds, to build a full scale prototype, of his Polywell nuclear fusion reactor design.

The late physicist Robert Bussard worked for decades to try to show Polywell fusion could work, using a variety of Wiffle-Ball configurations. Just before his death in 2007, he claimed that he was getting close to solving the challenge with his WB-6 device.
After Bussard passed away, other researchers picked up the baton at EMC2 Fusion in New Mexico and continued building test devices. Most recently, Park and his colleagues used a redesigned Wiffle-Ball test device in a San Diego lab to show the Navy that their configuration could enhance plasma confinement even under incredibly high pressure — pressure levels that could not be achieved by, say, the ITER reactor.

Bussard’s prototype might not have worked. However Bussard was an extremely credible fusion researcher – unlike some rather dodgy characters in the “bubble” fusion field, Bussard really might have made that crucial breakthrough. When you consider the eye watering sums which are wasted on renewables, such as the huge loss sustained by the Federal Government when Solyndra collapsed, it really seems a shame that Bussard never got a chance to take the final step, to realise his dream of seeing his ideas tested in a full scale prototype.

What is it about lefty types that they seem to imagine that Australia’s suburbs are as dark and distant as central Africa in the 19th century? When former prime minister **Julia Gillard** made the gruelling journey to Rooty Hill (50 kms, 40 minutes by car), she packed enough luggage for an Edwardian heiress doing a Grand Tour. As she and her entourage swanned into the local RSL club, all that was missing was a train of porters and a small boy waving a palm frond.



Likewise, nothing could have demonstrated in more stark terms the ABC’s elitism than last year’s trek by its senior management and journalists, in search of the great mystery of What Does Australia Think? Gamely leaving behind their Sherpas, the intrepid team of taxpayer-funded discoverers travelled all the way from inner-city Ultimo to…Bankstown. A whopping 20 kms away.



But, if the ABC’s great voyage of discovery (not to mention the billion-plus in taxpayer money they gobble every year) gave them any insight into what the poor, unwashed masses are interested in, we’re yet to see the evidence.



The ABC are still sticking to their trite, left-wing talking points, ordinary Australians be damned.



7.30…report[ed] on a climate change demonstration in Sydney.



This time ABC reporter Tracy Bowden did not make it to the southwest suburbs. She did not even go north over the Harbour Bridge. Instead the 7.30 crew travelled a few suburbs from Ultimo to Edge­cliff, which abuts Double Bay — one of the most fashionable, and expensive, parts of Sydney’s eastern suburbs.



Well, ABC types already know for a fact that anyone who doesn’t live with a harbour view is by definition an uncultured, uneducated redneck who probably didn’t even study Arts at Sydney University.



You’ve heard about the doctors’ wives phenomenon, used to portray the wealthy spouses of professional men who do not vote in accordance with their perceived economic interests but flirt with green-left causes. On Wednesday, 7.30 came across the phenomenon of doctors’ husbands.



It turned out that 7.30 was interested in a planned silent vigil for climate action scheduled for 9.30am last Saturday outside the Edgecliff office of Dave Sharma, the Liberal Party member for Wentworth. The organisers were semi-retired lawyer Rod Cunich and his medical doctor wife Margot Cunich.



Well, if an inner-city lawyer and a doctor aren’t representative of the **real** Australia, who is? Certainly not some bogan plumber or, shudder, shop assistant from Punchbowl.



On Wednesday’s 7.30, Sales also introduced a segment on the Prime Minister’s address to the National Press Club earlier that day by saying Tingle would explain that “in the short term Prime Minister Morrison has some pressing matters to deal with”. Tingle mentioned the response to the bushfire emergency and climate change, then showed footage of herself cross-examining Morrison on the sports grants controversy.



Certainly the bushfires are pressing matters. But so is the coronavirus outbreak, which has the capacity to adversely affect not only the health of Australians but also Australia’s mineral and service industries. Tingle did not mention this in her report of Morrison’s address, even though he had covered the issue in detail.



ABC journalists only expressed the most passing interest in Morrison’s outline of the government’s plans for bushfire recovery. For the whole address, only one journalist even bothered asking about the **coronavirus** and Australia’s response – but that was one of the wicked Murdoch press, so it’s obviously just a right-wing conspiracy.



Once again, so many of Australia’s leading journalists are out of touch with the public’s interest in matters such as how to clean up after a disaster and how to prevent a possible medical emergency.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou gotta wonder what President Obama will be thinking when he visits the northern city of Hanover later today. Ironically the US global warming president may be confronted with snow tomorrow morning as he gets set to pitch further steps with regards to TTIP and global warming to Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Temperature anomalies of more than -10°C are forecast to hit many areas of Europe in the days ahead.
A blast of polar air is now super-cooling the European continent and delivering unusual late April snows and frosty conditions even down in the lowlands, where the German city of Hanover is located.
“Wintershock”
The online SVZ daily here warns “Winterschock: In Germany the snow is back. Ice cold polar air delivers snowfall and storms.”
German weekly, Stern, writes at its online newsite: “Experts even advise putting the winter tires back on” and warns of icy streets in the lowlands by Monday morning! The Stern clip calls the snow for this time of year “unusual”.

High profile meteorologist Joe Bastardi tweeted: “rest of April in Europe.. about as cold as it can get this late.”
Online Bild here bears the headline: ” Polar air frosts the spring away– and will stay!”
The DWD German national weather service reported that the temperature at the Lower Saxony Brocken summit (1140m) was -5°C just some 100 or so kilometers away from Hanover, where President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive to open up the Hanover industrial trade show.
Al weather forecasts agree that the bitter cold will persist through much of the week. Experts warn of frost damage to blossoming plants.
To be fair, much of far eastern Europe and Russia are enjoying warmer than normal spring weather, and so we do not want to give readers the impression that the Europe cold means the globe is cooling. Such a trick, after all, is the kind of stuff the global warming alarmists routinely resort to. Remember how back around New Year’s the media and alarmists were jumping up and down, hollering that the North Pole was melting – trying to make us think it was all because of global warming? In fact that was just the reverse of what is happening in Europe right now. And never mind that snow was supposed to become “a thing of the past” even in the dead of winter.
Moreover the euro-warmunistas are now claiming that snow and cold we are seeing today has happened before at this time of year and thus is normal and we should not be surprised if it happens from time to time. But that’s just the point: our weather is no longer supposed to be “normal”. Climate change supposedly has changed all that. Yet there we have it: snow in late April, just like 100 years ago, back when that sort of thing used to happen once in a blue moon as well. Nothing (except the media reporting) has really changed that much.

"What follows is an expanded version of a complaint sent to the ACCC. (The ACCC complaint form limits the amount of text than can be entered.)

I wish to complain about the Australian Government “Climate Change” advertisement currently showing on Australian TV (August, 2008). The text of the advertisement is as follows:

“Scientists warn Australia will be hit hard by climate change, with temperatures rising, water more scarce, and economists warn to protect our economy we must act now. We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change, putting a limit on carbon pollution, and encouraging cleaner energy solutions. Think ‘climate’, think ‘change’. We can’t afford not to.”
I claim the advertisement fails these Advertising Standards Bureau Truth and Accuracy issues:

Misleading or deceptive advertising.
Misrepresentation in advertising.
The exploitation of community concerns in relation to portraying a product or service as benefiting the environment, if it does not.


The advertisement says, “scientists warn”, without qualification or reference to whom those scientists are. There are many scientists who dispute that climate change will cause significant problems. [http://www.petitionproject.org/; http://www.climatescienceinternational.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=1; http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.SenateReport]
There is no qualification of what “hard hit” means.
There is no qualification of how high temperatures are supposedly going to rise; thus it is impossible to know from the advertisement whether such rises are significant and will thus result in a “hard hit”.
There is no qualification of whether “more scare” water applies to certain areas of Australia, nor of how significant such scarcity will be.
The reference to “economists warn” does not reference those economists, or that there are dissenting economists with differing views.
The advertisement uses the term “carbon pollution”. That is a meaningless (and misleading and deceptive) phrase. Carbon is an element. In the context of the climate change discussion, carbon as an element is not part of the discussion. The advertisement should refer (at least) to carbon dioxide, which is a gas.
The advertisement states that “carbon”, hence carbon dioxide, is a pollutant. But carbon dioxide is an essential gas present in trace amounts in the atmosphere. Without it, life on earth would not exist. Except in high concentrations, carbon dioxide is harmless to humans. There is considerable doubt that increases in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are a significant cause of increased temperatures. [http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Evans-CO2DoesNotCauseGW.pdf; http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm]
The advertisement implies all climate change is something to avoid (“We’re developing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to tackle climate change…”), but does not mention that climate has been changing for thousands of years, with the earth having been both colder and warmer than it is now. That is a misrepresentation of facts. [http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The advertisement exploits community concerns by attempting to cause fear by using the phrases “hard hit”, “must act now” and “can’t afford not to”.
The claim that we “must act now” are misleading because it implies temperatures are rising at a dangerous rate. In fact, global temperatures since 1998 have not passed that 1998 peak, and early 2008 global average temperatures are marginally less than the equivalent period of 1988 (repeating: 1988, not 1998). [http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/what-a-difference-20-years-makes/; http://www.weatherquestions.com/Roy-Spencer-on-global-warming.htm#2000]
The claim that a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will “tackle climate change”, presumably successfully, is false and deceptive. Australian greenhouse gas emissions are less than 1.5% of global emissions, so even if such a scheme were to be totally successful in eliminating all Australian emissions, the effect globally would be minuscule.
The phrase “We can’t afford not to” is misleading and deceptive. There is no qualification as to what the costs will be, so it is impossible for the advertisement to so claim.
The advertisement displays images of both cooling towers and “smoke stacks”. Both are deceptive. In the case of cooling towers, the only emission is of condensed water vapour. In the case of the smoke stacks, there is a misleading confusion of particulate pollution with colourless carbon dioxide gas.

The advertisement thus fails, in many instances, the tests for truth and accuracy.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Theresa May, the British prime minister, Mr. Trump did not say whether he supports keeping sanctions that were put in place following Russia’s military involvement in Ukraine and its interference in the 2016 election. But he said he hoped to have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. “If we could have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I’m all for that,” Mr. Trump said in a brief answer to the question. Ms. May was more direct in her answer to the question about sanctions on Russia. She said the United Kingdom “believes that the sanctions should continue. ” The answers highlight what could be one of the differences between the two leaders, even as both of them insisted Friday that they plan to continue the close working relationship that has long existed between the two nations. President Trump’s phone call scheduled on Saturday with Russia’s president  —   their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office  —   has Republicans on edge. As one of his last acts as president, Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the election to help install Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting the sanctions. What came next was a list of Russian abuses: its invasion of Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea and its support of “the murderous Assad regime as it has waged war on the Syrian people and killed more than 400, 000 civilians. ” Then came this: “And in the most flagrant demonstration of Putin’s disdain and disrespect for our nation, Russia deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and discredit Western values. ” UPDATE: Another Republican senator, Rob Portman of Ohio, joins in: President Trump said Friday that he will let his secretary of defense “override” him by banning torture even though he believes the tactics do work in getting information out of terror suspects. In a remarkable show of deference to his own subordinate, Mr. Trump noted that Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief, does not believe torture is effective. The president, who serves as the commander in chief and usually makes the final call on military action, said he will let Mr. Mattis decide. “I don’t necessarily agree, but I will tell you that he will override because I’m giving him that power,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. ” Mr. Trump appeared to be struggling about the issue even as he spoke, returning several times to his own belief in torture’s effectiveness even as he stated several times that he would let Mr. Mattis would decide. “But I’m going with our leaders,” he said. “We are going to win, with or without. ” Then he added: “But I do disagree. ” President Trump spoke by phone on Friday with Enrique Peña Nieto, the president of Mexico, White House officials said, less than 24 hours after the Mexican president canceled a White House meeting over anger about Mr. Trump’s intentions to build a border wall. A senior White House official confirmed Friday that the call had taken place and said that an official description of what the two leaders said will be released soon. In the wake of the deepening diplomatic tensions on Thurdsday, aides to Mr. Trump had said they still intended to keep lines of communications between the two governments open. The call suggests that the two leaders may be attempting to reschedule the planned meeting. That could begin to repair the relationship in the short term, though differences will likely remain about construction of the border wall and who will finance it. Then again, Mr. Trump tweeted another salvo on Friday morning. Mr. Mattis on Friday ordered the review of the controversial   fighter jet program, which has been criticized by President Trump for its cost overruns. Mr. Mattis also ordered that plans for a new Air Force One  —   which has also come under fire from Mr. Trump  —  should be reviewed, “with the specific objective of identifying means to substantially reduce the programs costs while delivering needed capabilities. ” The   review, Mr. Mattis said in a memo, will also look at how to reduce costs while still meeting requirements set out for the fighter jet program. During his confirmation hearings earlier this month, Mr. Mattis defended tweets from Mr. Trump criticizing the   program. Mr. Mattis said at the time that Mr. Trump had “in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants more bang for the buck. ” The cost of building the   fighter jet, the   Joint Strike Fighter, has been an issue at the Pentagon for several years. At an estimated $400 billion over 15 years for 2, 443 planes, the fighter jet is the military largest weapons project. Mr. Trump is just not going to give up his claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton, but he’s grasping for evidence. On Friday morning, he looked to VoteStand, which calls itself “America’s first online fraud reporting app” for the smartphone but does not appear to actually exist beyond the Twitter account of its founder, Gregg Phillips. The president seemed to be responding to an interview with Mr. Phillips on CNN Friday morning that was, shall we say, inconclusive. Mr. Phillips at once said 3 million illegal immigrants voted and said he is still working to prove that. “You can reach a conclusion and still verify it,” he maintained. Mr. Phillips began pressing his case that 3 million illegal votes were cast shortly after Election Day in November, but pressed repeatedly, Mr. Phillips has never produced any evidence. As the debunking site Snopes. com wrote: Mr. Phillips has been adamant on Twitter of course. But as PolitiFact wrote, “There is no report. ” And that is not all Mr. Phillips has asserted. He now has an endorsement from the president of the United States. Mr. Trump’s fallacious argument that he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million because of illegal immigrant ballots started as the stuff of wonderment and ridicule. Now that the Trump administration has shifted to an investigation of the voter rolls, things have gotten serious. Democrats appear to be girding for battle, but if, as is likely, Senator Jeff Sessions, a conservative from Alabama, becomes the attorney general, it does not appear to be a fight that the minority can win. The Democrats fear the hunt for illegal voters will become a pretext to tighten voting requirements nationwide and bar many minority voters who tend to side with the Democrats. Even moderate Democrats are alarmed. Word from Politico is that President Trump will not be attending the fancy,   Alfalfa Club dinner Saturday night, a chummy gathering with many of Washington’s politicians, journalists and every president since Ronald Reagan. Lest we get too excited  —   could the White House Correspondents Association dinner be next? Please?  —   we should wait and see. It is true that every president since Mr. Reagan has attended the annual roast and silly cabaret dinner of the Alfalfa Club, a     Washington clique that seems like it was hatched from a bygone era. But not many of those presidents have attended each year. Mr. Trump may yet keep the soiree alive. Mr. Trump traveled to the City of Brotherly Love on Thursday to decry Philadelphia’s rising murder rate  —   “I mean, just terribly increasing. ” But it isn’t. Last year’s 277 homicides was down from 280 in 2015. That is up from 2014, when 248 were murdered, and in 2013, when 246 were killed. But recent years are markedly down from 2007 to 2012 when Philadelphia had more than 300 killings, 391 in 2007 alone. “President Trump’s false statements today were an insult to the men and women of the Philadelphia police force  —   the very same men and women who are working long hours today to ensure his safety,” Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement Thursday. Of course, in the era of alternative facts, Mayor Kenney may be spitting in the wind. The Trump administration’s decision to drop advertisements encouraging people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act was greeted with anger and alarm by supporters of the law  —   and a recognition that Mr. Trump wants the law crippled. “This is sabotage, pure and simple,” fumed Leslie Dach, a senior official in President Barack Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services who now heads a coalition to save the law. “This proves that this administration doesn’t care about people who need health coverage. And it clearly shows that they now own the consequences of their efforts to undermine the health care system. ” The ads were to have run only for a few more days, until the annual open enrollment period ends on Tuesday. In the last few years, large numbers of consumers signed up just before the deadline. But Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are determined to repeal Mr. Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Since Nov. 1, more than 11. 5 million people have signed up for insurance or had their coverage automatically renewed. And when the enrollment period ends, it’s anyone’s guess who will announce the total number of people who would lose their insurance if the law is repealed. The leading candidate to be the Pentagon’s new spokesman is John Ullyot, a former Marine Corps intelligence officer and veteran of Capitol Hill. Mr. Ullyot served as spokesman and deputy chief of staff for two Republican senators, John W. Warner of Virginia and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and as spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2003 to 2007."

Donald Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton last night is bound to stir up fears of instability and uncertainty in East Asia, a region that was almost entirely ignored during the campaign. Commentators have rushed to predict that Trump’s campaign rhetoric will turn into reality: the United States will pull back from East Asia, and China will take advantage of the ensuing chaos to seize geopolitical dominance of the region. This morning James Palmer at _Foreign Policy_ writes, “Chinese leaders near me in the palatial complex of Zhongnanhai are surely cracking open the drinks.” This is a pretty scary vision of the future. However, such assessments, which focus solely on Chinese benefits, don’t take into account the complex nature of U.S.-China relations.   
  
President Trump is by no means a clear victory for China. The uncertainty created by his victory could easily produce an economic and geopolitical climate that damages Chinese interests. For example, three of the seven points in Trump’s Plan to Rebuild the American Economy mention policies that would hurt the U.S.-China economic relationship: labeling China a currency manipulator; bringing trade cases against China in the World Trade Organization; and imposing tariffs in response to “illegal activities.” Igniting a trade war with China would pose a severe risk to China’s economy, which is already slowing down. Trump’s stated policies would likely deepen China’s economic woes, thereby increasing the domestic instability that Beijing is obsessed with avoiding, especially in the lead-up to the 19th Party Congress in late 2017.



  
  
In the realm of geopolitics, Chinese gains in the conventional balance of power resulting from a reduced U.S. commitment to traditional allies could be offset if other regional states turn to nuclear weapons. America’s regional partners have started to improve their conventional self-defense capabilities, but it will take a good deal of time and money to get their militaries to the point where they can resist Chinese coercion without U.S. help. With this in mind, and given the recent nuclear saber rattling by North Korea, if Trump starts shedding U.S. alliance commitments then partners may turn to nuclear weapons to defend themselves.   
  
Japan would likely be the first country to develop a nuclear weapon in such a scenario. Its limited conventional capabilities create a pressing need for a deterrent if the United States would not come to its rescue, and its highly-developed nuclear energy program makes it relatively easy for Japan to acquire the materials it would need. It would still take a good amount of time for Japan to develop such weapons. For example, a 2006 article by Jeffrey Lewis at the Arms Control Wonk blog suggested a timeframe of 3–5 years. If Japan goes down this road, there is a chance that neighboring countries, such as South Korea, would also push for their own nuclear weapons. While Japan would face enormous resistance to nuclear weapons development, support for having nuclear weapons among lawmakers has increased in recent years in response to growing tension in East Asia. A nuclear-armed Japan is completely anathema to Chinese security interests, and would be a serious setback for China’s geopolitical position in East Asia.   
  
While this analysis is almost purely speculative at this point, there is a case to be made that the Trump administration will not be as good for China as many commentators have suggested. China could reap some benefits from a United States occupied with domestic political turmoil and a president that disdains alliance commitments. However, the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that could be unleashed by his victory should curb Beijing’s enthusiasm. As Isaac Stone Fish recently stated in _Foreign Policy_ _,_ “the Chinese elite seem to prefer Trump’s opponent because they feel she would be better … [for] global stability, which remains of great importance to Beijing.” The officials in Zhongnanhai should save those drinks for another day.

“‘Global Warming’ is, and always was, a policy for genocidal reduction of the world’s population. The preposterous claim that human-produced carbon dioxide will broil the Earth, melt the ice caps, and destroy human life, came out of a 1975 conference in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, organized by the influential anthropologist Margaret Mead, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in 1974.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterEconomics editor Daniel Wetzel at Germany’s center-right national daily Die Welt here writes that the Brexit may be the end of the Paris climate treaty and that it is a climate-political nightmare for the EU.
Already, he notes, the price of CO2 emissions certificates has plummeted to near low-grade levels, see chart at Die Welt.
The Die Welt journalist writes that those holding these pollution-permitting certifcates saw a large chunk of value get wiped out. Already at the end of last year the certificates had a value of near 9 euros. Now they are hovering at less than 5 euros.
The reason for the plunge in price, Wetzel writes, is that Great Britain will no longer be bound to the European Emissions Trading system, and so dozens of UK power plants will no longer need their certificates and will likely dump them on the European market, causing their price to plummet further. The result, Wetzel writes:
For industrial plants all over Europe there will be hardly any financial incentive left to invest in CO2-saving efficiency technology.”
New political constellation at Westminster
Activists are still hoping that Britain will remain in the Emissions Trading Scheme, even after exiting the EU, just as non EU member Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein are currently doing. Wetzel asks whether Britain will continue staying commited to ambitious CO2 reductions as it has in the past. One factor that speaks against continued commitment to reducing CO2 emissions is that “among Brexiteers and EU-skeptics in Unitted Kingdom – as is the case with the German AfD – the number of climate skeptics is especially high“.
Wetzel adds:

/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In part not only is the man-made impact on climate questioned, but whether climate change is happening at all. In a new political constellation in Westminister, the high British climate targets may not be possible to maintain in the future.”
A weakened Europe in climate negotiations
Here Wetzel cites a recent research paper by the Chatham House that looked at the possible impacts on climate policy should Britain vote to leave the EU. The Chatham Report has in its conclusion:

A diminished EU, for its part, would be weaker in managing relationships with Russia, which already seeks to divide it and to negotiate bilateral energy deals with individual member states. The EU would also be less able to influence global climate negotiations alongside other major powers such as China and the United States, as it would represent a much smaller share of the global economy and of global emissions. This would not serve the longterm interests of either the UK or the EU.

The report concludes that in the event of a British exit (which is now the case), Britain would be freer to decide its energy policies on its own without meddling from Brussels.
Climate policy-making center of gravity shifts eastwards
What bodes especially ill for European climate policy, Wetzel writes, is that the “decision-making center of gravity” will now likely shift eastwards to more climate-policy obstinate countries, such as coal-producing Poland, and the Czech Republic.
Wetzel even warns, citing the Chatham House report, that should Britain not live up to its climate protection commitments, it could face “international criticism, and in the worst case sanctions from other countries“.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
A lot of buzz around the web was generated late this week with the announcement from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that 2014 topped their list as the warmest year since their records began in the late 1800s.   
  
While most of the mainstream media coverage focused on the record-setting temperatures and breathlessly spoke of how this was further indication that humans are warming the climate, the blogosphere was full of articles throwing cold water on this overheated rhetoric by pointing out that despite the past year’s warm temperatures, 1) global warming continues to occur at only a snail’s pace, and 2) this pace is far beneath that projected by the world’s collection of climate models—models developed for the specific purpose of projecting future climate changes. With each passing year, their performance becomes worse and worse. That is the big story about 2014’s temperatures.   
  
Here are some sites that astutely picked up on that:   
  
Over at _Climate Etc._, Judy Curry has her say in “‘Warmest year’, ‘pause’, and all that.” Her bottom line?   




Berkeley Earth sums it up well with this statement:   
  
_That is, of course, an indication that the Earth’s average temperature for the last decade has changed very little._   
  
The key issue remains the growing discrepancy between the climate model projections and the observations: 2014 just made the discrepancy larger.   
  
Speculation about ‘warmest year’ and end of ‘pause’ implies a near term prediction of surface temperatures—that they will be warmer. I’ve made my projection—global surface temperatures will remain mostly flat for at least another decade. However, I’m not willing to place much $$ on that bet, since I suspect that Mother Nature will manage to surprise us. (I will be particularly surprised if the rate of warming in the next decade is at the levels expected by the IPCC.)



At the Global Warming Policy Foundation, David Whitehouse takes on the 2014 temperature record and its implications in this article “2014: Global Temperature Stalls Another Year.” Like Curry, Whitehouse hits the nail on the head:   




The only conclusion to be drawn from the addition of 2014 data is that the post-1997 standstill seen in global annual average surface temperature has continued for one more year, making it now about 17 years in duration. This is the opposite of what is claimed in the NASA press release.   
  
It is clear beyond doubt by now that there is a growing discrepancy between computer climate projections and real-world data that questions their ability to produce meaningful projections about future climatic conditions.



And over at _Watts Up With That_ , Bob Tisdale has a guest post titled “Does the Uptick in Global Surface Temperatures in 2014 Help the Growing Difference between Climate Models and Reality?” You've probably already guessed his answer:   




As illustrated and discussed, while global surface temperatures rose slightly in 2014, the minor uptick did little to overcome the growing difference between observed global surface temperature and the projections of global surface warming by the climate models used by the IPCC.



As you may have noticed, we couldn’t agree more with all of this.   
  
For the background behind these conclusions, be sure to visit each of these fine blogs and have a look!

 **Promise** : _Electric Vehicles_



“This ambitious plan to take real action on climate change will involve all New Zealanders. This government will act as a role model, showing leadership by requiring State-owned enterprises and other government organisations to pursue low-carbon options and technologies, including electric vehicles for all Government vehicle fleets.



 **Altered Promise** :



The Government quietly dropped their commitment this year to making the entire Government fleet emissions-free by mid-2025.



“When the coalition Government came into power in late 2017, the agreement between Labour and New Zealand First stipulated that the entire fleet would be emissions-free by mid-2025, ‘where practicable.’ Although it was repeated as recently as June, that goal has been quietly revised to a commitment that, after mid-2025, all new vehicles entering the fleet will be emissions-free.”



 **Promise** : _Green Investment Fund_



“The agreement between Labour and the Green Party also provides for up to $1 billion of new investment to be stimulated in low carbon industries by 2020, **kick-started by a government-backed Green Investment Fund of $100 million.”**



 **Incomplete** **Promise** : 



The money is allocated, but not a single cent of the $100 million Green Investment Fund that was supposed to kick-start $1 billion of investment in ‘low carbon’ industries has been invested.



 **Promise** : _Low Carbon Investment_



 **“The agreement between Labour and the Green Party also provides for up to $1 billion of new investment to be stimulated in low carbon industries by 2020** , kick-started by a government-backed Green Investment Fund of $100 million.”



 **Broken promise** :



Answers to Written Parliamentary Questions say the Green Investment Fund is looking at a number of opportunities, but the bottom line is this Government hasn’t delivered.



Not a single cent of the Government’s side of the bargain has been invested, which is why not a single dollar of private sector money has been either.



 **Promise:** _Greenhouse Gas Emissions_



“Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world. If we do not urgently reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases, warming will disrupt the climate which our agriculture and other industries depend upon, and sea-level rise will affect our coastal cities, along with other profound changes.”



 **Broken promise** : 



Not only have they failed to deliver on this promise but emissions have gone up! 



The Climate Change Minister admitted emissions are increasing under this Government and will continue to for the next five years. National has supported a legislative framework in the form of the Zero Carbon Bill that will help deliver on everyone’s goal of reducing emissions.

The Aussies apparently want to take our PM to run their country. There are many here who would also like Ardern to be running another country but we are too kind to wish this on our Aussie ‘cousins’. Nevertheless, if those across the Tasman really want her, then I suggest we swap for Queensland Senator **Malcolm Roberts.**



Roberts recently tore **Michael Mann** a new one in a Senate speech.



Here is the transcript of the video:



How dare you, Michael Mann. I used tonight’s adjournment speech to challenge Michael Mann to a debate on climate science. Michael Mann is the fabricator of the completely discredited hockey stick temperature graph and is in Australia at the moment so logistics shouldn’t be a problem.



You come down here pretending you have evidence that CO2 from HUMAN activity affects climate and needs to be cut – when you have no such evidence. How do I know? Easy. You released papers that led to the infamous hockey-stick graph falsely fabricating high temperatures. Despite repeated requests from scientists you refused to hand over your data.



No evidence.



Scientifically, your claims should’ve been immediately dismissed. The state of Virginia’s Attorney General asked for your data from the University of Virginia because your research was reportedly taxpayer-funded. Your Uni refused. No evidence. You sued Prof Tim Ball – a real scientist – and then in court refused to provide evidence to support your case.



No evidence.



Didn’t the court find you in contempt?



Regardless, your claim was dismissed. And you failed to provide any evidence yet Prof Ball’s team provided plenty of solid statements from internationally reputable scientists. You are the one in the Climategate scandals who wanted to hide the temperature decline, aren’t you?



Hide the evidence?



You have sued any person that dared to question you – to shut them down. To stop the evidence.



You now say Senator Molan as a policymaker should ask some unnamed great Australian scientists for their opinion – name any with evidence proving HUMAN CO2 affects climate variability.



After 21 years you still have not released data for your hockey stick graph fabricating high temps yet many people have debunked it.



My understanding is that fraud can include the presentation of something that is not true with the intention of personal gain. You claim you were awarded a Nobel Prize.



That is false.



You contributed to the UN’s climate body the IPCC that was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Note that was not for science. After the UN IPCC was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize it dropped your graph. And if that shonky political body dropped it, that really kills your credibility.



You have a record of serially misrepresenting climate, serially misrepresenting science and serially misrepresenting humanity. The use of hydrocarbon fuels such as gas, coal and oil has liberated humanity and saved the forests and whales that previously fuelled civilisation and human progress.



Your advocacy to stop their use is anti-human and anti-environment. It hurts our security and our sovereignty. Your host, the ABC, has been a blind supporter of, and advocate for, others misrepresenting climate and science – including Al Gore, Rajendra Pachauri, Gavin Schmidt.



People advocating for cutting hydrocarbon fuels have branded those who dissent from your advocacy as climate criminals. I believe that in the very near future it is people like you, who misrepresent science and climate, who the public will see as climate criminals.



None of you have ever presented the empirical evidence proving HUMAN production of CO2 from our use of hydrocarbon fuels hurts our environment and future. You’re here in Australia now so I challenge you to a public debate on climate science and the corruption of climate science.



All you need do is provide me with the specific location of the empirical scientific evidence, the hard validated data, within a logical scientific framework that proves cause and effect, and I will retract this speech.



I need publication title, specific page numbers. No entity anywhere in the world has provided this: Don’t bother to smear me or get someone to smear me. That not only has no effect on me, I love it. I use it to prove that those who smear only do so because they lack hard scientific evidence.



How dare you Michael Mann. Provide the evidence.

Sen. Bob Casey has a loaded question for Education Secretary‐​designate Betsy DeVos. “Ms. DeVos must fully explain whether she supports the radical view that it should be more difficult for campus sexual‐​assault victims to receive justice,” said the Pennsylvania Democrat, who sits on the committee that begins confirmation hearings for Mrs. DeVos Tuesday.



Mr. Casey was apparently acting under pressure from groups, including the American Association of University Women, that support the Obama administration’s illegal reading of Title IX. The administration has construed Title IX—the federal law barring sex discrimination by federally funded schools—as a mandate to punish students and faculty accused of sexual misconduct using procedures that make it extraordinarily difficult for even an innocent person to defend himself. Campus tribunals routinely abandon many rights for the accused, such as the right to see and present evidence, be represented by a lawyer, confront one’s accuser, or even have a hearing.



According to a top AAUW policy adviser, Mrs. DeVos’s lack of experience as an “education professional” means she can be judged on her charitable contributions—including to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit I co‐​founded and on whose board I serve. FIRE vigorously defends the free‐​speech and due‐​process rights of college students and faculty.





Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey attacks her for donating to a civil‐​liberties group.



Philadelphia‐​based FIRE is nonpartisan and has defended students and faculty members on the left and right. FIRE has made common cause with politically diverse organizations ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to the Heritage Foundation, Young Americans for Liberty and the Cato Institute.



Mrs. DeVos has entered the political thicket that civil libertarians often encounter, wherein one is saddled with the actions of the accused rather than credited with advocating for fair procedures. As a criminal‐​defense and civil‐​liberties trial lawyer who has represented defendants ranging from student radicals to alleged child molesters, I can vouch for the virulence of guilt‐​by‐​association.



Higher education is currently embroiled in a contentious battle over campus sexual assault. The Obama administration and certain nonprofits, including the AAUW, want to make it easier for campus disciplinary tribunals to credit the complaints of alleged victims and to punish the accused, frequently by expulsion.



The Education Department has instructed universities to adjudicate claims of sexual misconduct using the low “preponderance of the evidence” standard, in which the mere 50.1% likelihood of guilt is sufficient. FIRE argues that a higher standard may be necessary—particularly given that campus judicial systems typically lack many if not most of the procedural protections available to defendants facing criminal charges, or even civil liability, in a court of law.



Lest anybody doubt the problem caused by the absence of due process, a quick scan of the landscape produces myriad examples. A Brandeis student sued the university after it found him guilty—without a hearing—of sexual misconduct for, among other things, staring at his then-boyfriend’s body while the two shared a bathroom. Judge Dennis Saylor, in a decision allowing the lawsuit to move forward, noted that Brandeis’s “inquisitorial” process “appears to have substantially impaired, if not eliminated, an accused student’s right to a fair and impartial process.”



Civil‐​liberties advocates have long defended free speech and fair procedures. Often that means standing up for the rights of people who hold odious views or have committed grave crimes, including sexual assault. Those whose views are merely unpopular, and the innocent who are wrongly accused, depend on the same protections.



If confirmed, Mrs. DeVos will have the opportunity to improve the climate for fairness and accuracy in campus judiciaries at universities that have obliterated due process for fear of losing millions in federal aid—to make American higher education free and fair again.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."
"President Trump’s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer’s 2026 World Cup. On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump’s executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial   period of the ban. “We are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes,” Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said in an email. “We know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events. ” At least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump’s decision. The delegate, Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia, said Saturday that he considered the executive order “very, very disappointing. ” He also called the United States a “haven” for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries. “Most of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States,” Mr. Peterkin said. “We don’t have an issue because we’re not on that list of seven, but if we were  —   there go hopes and dreams. ” On Saturday evening, a federal judge blocked part of the executive order, but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials. The most immediate effect may come in wrestling, given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump’s ban is Iran, which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport. Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief   for U. S. A. Wrestling and a 1984   Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran’s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet. “There’s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, ‘We can’t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,’” Mr. Fraser said. While Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the     diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s. In wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I. O. C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete. In 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump’s decision. “I don’t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,” Ms. Kelley said. The ban on visitors from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   comes at a delicate time for the U. S. O. C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games. (There is some speculation that the I. O. C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U. S. O. C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.) David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I. O. C. ’s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles’s bid with I. O. C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being “    and  . ” “This is worse,” Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, “I would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid  —   not fatal but a blow. ” At a meeting at the I. O. C. ’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, “What is wrong with your country?” he said. He said he sought to assure I. O. C. officials by explaining that   of the voters in Los Angeles had voted against Mr. Trump, describing the city to them as a “a multicultural,   zone. ” The United States is expected to bid to host the world’s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall across America’s southern border. “I think a   World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn’t in the White House,” Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump. After Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, “It’s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid. ” International perceptions of the Trump administration “matter, for sure,” Mr. Gulati said, “but I think those will be developed in the months to come. ” U. S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump’s order. Many questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N. B. A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump’s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.) Mr. Maker’s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order. Mr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen. The N. B. A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league’s   weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year’s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza   from Iran. Major League Soccer has two   players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran’s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday. Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5, 000 meters and 10, 000 meters, is a   athlete coached by Alberto Salazar. Early Sunday morning Mr. Farah’s Facebook page had a post that, among other things, said: “On 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years   working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. ” Abdi Abdirahman, a   Olympian for the United States who finished third in the 2016 New York City Marathon, was also born in Somalia, and the race regularly attracts runners from around the globe. The 2016 race featured three runners from Iran, nine from Syria and one from Sudan in the field of about 50, 000 runners. “Our goal is always to recruit the world’s best and cleanest athletes, regardless of where they’re from,” Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in an email. Jackie   a spokeswoman for track and field’s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, “We clearly need to understand the implications of this new U. S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect” the sport’s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore. in 2021. Phil Andrews, the chief executive of U. S. A. Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Mr. Trump’s ban on the world   championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, Calif. and on the American team’s participation at a competition in Iran. “Our view is that politics and sport should be separate,” Mr. Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. “We sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November. It is unimaginable to be able to host a true world event without their participation. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt BR Bavarian public broadcasting here, Judith Zacher writes how the Zöschingen wind park has lost the air under its wings and has disappointed investors. At the time it opened in 2013, it was Bavaria’s largest citizens-operated wind park. But the BR writes that “there’s not enough wind and the financial expectations can hardly be fulfilled.”
Back at the beginning of the decade when the park was under planning, there was considerable opposition to its construction. But the town’s mayor and the wind lobby prevailed and pushed the project through in 2011, in the wake of the German Fukushima hysteria. Moreover, studies and wind measurements showed there was enough wind to produce enough clean energy to make the project worthwhile. So construction was approved and the park with its 8 large turbines went into operation in the spring of 2013.
Only 1% return on investment
The Zöschingen project is called a citizens’ wind park because a number of citizens invested in the project with the hopes of seeing a strong return. However, Zacher writes at BR that those expectations have failed to materialize. Instead of the expected 9% return, the BR reports that investors received only 4.5% in the first year, and only a measly 1 percent over the following two years.
This seems to have become a typical story for many German wind park projects: big promises turning out to be huge disappointments. And every time the winners are few and always the same: the project planners and the land owner who makes easy money with leasing fees.

Wind has been much weaker than expected
So why isn’t the Zöschingen wind project delivering?
BR reports that although there have been productive months, overall wind energy output is still “20 percent below the expectations“. Before the project began, wind measurements had been taken over months, and three expert technical assessments showed the project would yield good returns. However since the wind park was built, the winds have not blown like they were expected to do. These things happen.
The BR report writes that the problem may have something to do with the turbines being located in a forest – too near to tree tops. Plant builder Georg Honold says the turbines should have been taller.
What’s left is a poor investment that has turned the landscape into an eyesore that everyone in the area will have to wake up and look at every day — for probably another 20 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe correlation between seismic activity (geothermal flux) as a natural mechanism in the 1979 to 2015 global warming is stronger than the correlation with carbon dioxide during the same period.
Hat-tip: Kenneth Richard
Viterito, 2016
The Correlation Of Seismic Activity And Recent Global Warming
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states with high confidence that the warming of global temperatures since 1901 has been driven by increased radiative forcing. The gases responsible for this enhanced forcing are ‘greenhouse gases’ of anthropogenic origin, and include carbon dioxide, methane, and halocarbons. The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change has challenged these findings and concludes that the forcing from greenhouse gases is minimal and diminishing. They add that modelling attempts of past and future climate states are inaccurate and do not incorporate important solar inputs, such as magnetic strength and total irradiance. One geophysical variable that has been overlooked by both groups is geothermal flux.
This study will show that increasing seismic activity for the globe’s high geothermal flux areas (HGFA), an indicator of increasing geothermal forcing, is highly correlated with average global temperatures from 1979 to 2015 (r = 0.785). By comparison, the correlation between carbon dioxide loading and global temperatures for the same period is lower (r = 0.739). Multiple regression indicates that HGFA seismicity is a significant predictor of global temperatures (P < 0.05), but carbon dioxide concentrations do not significantly improve the explained variance (P > 0.1). A compelling case for geothermal forcing lies in the fact that 1) geothermal heat can trigger thermobaric convection and strengthen oceanic overturning, important mechanisms for transferring ocean heat to the overlying atmosphere, and 2) seismic activity is the leading indicator, while global temperature is the laggard.
The paper concludes that the world should wait until all of the climate system is understood before enacting laws to curb GHG emissions:

To ameliorate the problems of rising global temperatures, legislative and taxing initiatives are currently being proposed and evaluated by governing bodies around the world. Most of these initiatives are designed to curb GHG emissions. However, this study shows that we may want to delay such actions until all of the climate system’s inputs are fully accounted for.”

The mainstream media has lit up the past few days with headlines of “alarming” news coming out of Antarctica highlighting new research on a more rapid than expected loss of ice from glaciers there.   
  
But, as typical with blame-it-on-humans climate change stories, the coverage lacks detail, depth, and implication as well as being curiously timed.   
  
We explain.   
  
The research, by a team led by University of Cal-Irvine doctoral candidate Tyler Sutterley, first appeared online at the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ on November 15th, about two weeks before Thanksgiving. So why is it making headlines now? Probably because the National Aeronautics and Space Administration issued a press release on the new paper on December 2nd. Why wait so long? Because on December 1st, the United Nations kicked off its annual climate confab and the Obama administration is keen on orchestrating its release of scary-sounding climate stories so as to attempt to generate support for its executively commanded (i.e., avoiding Congress) carbon dioxide reduction initiatives that will be on display there. This also explains the recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration speculation that 2014 is going to be the “warmest year on record”—another headline grabber—two months before all the data will be collected and analyzed.   
  
This is all predictable—and will essentially be unsuccessful.   
  
Missing from the hype are the broader facts.   
  
The new Sutterley research finds that glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment region along the coast of West Antarctica are speeding up and losing ice. This is potentially important because the ice loss contributes to global sea level rise. The press coverage is aimed to make this sound alarming—“This West Antarctic region sheds a Mount Everest-sized amount of ice every two years, study says” screamed the _Washington Post_.   
  
Wow! That sounds like a lot. Turns out, it isn’t.   




The global oceans are vast. Adding a “Mount Everest-sized amount of ice every two years” to them results in a sea level rise of 0.02 inches per year. But “New Study Finds Antarctic Glaciers Currently Raise Sea Level by Two-Hundredths of an Inch Annually” doesn’t have the same ring to it.   
  
Nor does the coverage draw much attention to the fact that the Amundsen Sea Embayment is but one of a great many watersheds across Antarctica that empty into the sea. A study published in _Nature_ magazine back in 2012 by Matt King and colleagues provided a more comprehensive look at glacier behavior across Antarctica. They did report, in agreement with the Sutterley findings, that glacial loss in the Amundsen Sea Embayment was rapid, but they also reported that for other large areas of Antarctica, ice loss was minimal or even negative (i.e., ice was accumulating). Figure 1, taken from the King paper, presents the broader and more relevant perspective (note that the Amundsen Sea Embayment is made up by the areas labelled 21 and 22 in Figure 1).   






  
  
_Figure 1. Best estimate of rate of ice loss from watershed across Antarctica. The Amundsen Sea Embayment, the focus of the Sutterley study, is encompassed by areas labeled 21 and 22 (taken from King et al., 2012)._   
  
We discussed the King and colleagues study in more detail when it first came out. We concluded:   




So King and colleagues’ latest refinement puts the Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise at a rate of about one-fifth of a millimeter per year (or in English units, 0.71 inches per century).   
  
Without a significantly large acceleration—and recall the King et al. found none—this is something that we can all live with for a long time to come.



The strategically timed new findings being hyped this week do not change this conclusion.

Many people, maybe most people in the media won’t care what an 81-year-old has to say about the roots of freedom in a democracy. And that is the problem; the failure to see the necessary connection between tradition, wisdom and freedom.



Every young journalist in New Zealand should carefully read Tom Holland’s recent and ambitious historical commentary “[Dominion; the Making of the Western Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Making-Western-Tom-Holland/dp/1408706954)”. They would discover the inestimable debt they owe to the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. They would learn from the agnostic Holland that the West cannot be understood outside its Biblical foundation. They might discover why “in a West often doubtful of religion’s claims, so many of its instincts remain–for good or ill–thoroughly Christian. It is–to coin a phrase–the greatest story ever told.”



The young journalist might discover, or at least be prepared to consider, that the universal message of the Christian gospel has been recallibrated into a disconnected and incoherent human rights theory which would retain and enforce the universality it has rejected.



Holland reminds us that the West is unique in its “visceral and momentous suspicion that God is closer to the weak than to the mighty, to the poor than to the rich. Any beggar, any criminal, might be Christ. ‘So the last will be first and the first last.”’



Holland points out that many of the human rights we hold to be self-evident, the equality of men with women, justice for the weak, freedom of religious belief and expression as well as free speech, are not self-evident at all. They are entirely biblical and are reinforced specifically from the life and teachings of Christ.



It would be gratifying to think that a deeper knowledge of our roots might restore some kind of equilibrium to the New Zealand media because it is being increasingly unbalanced by a usurping wokeness. 



Having lost belief in their own history, journalists are easily tempted by the chronological snobbery of the post-truth age. “We’re in the 21st century for goodness sake.” It has become very difficult to have a balanced debate in mainstream media on multiculturalism, human rights, climate change, transgenderism, same-sex marriage. Indeed, New Zealand is probably the worst country in the English-speaking world to have such a debate. Whatever happened to the fourth estate’s declared objectivity?



The media appears to take for granted a progressive (more accurately de-Christianising) consensus on what is right and what is wrong. For example, it is not self-evidently true that the individual man or woman has his or her own intrinsic dignity. The progressive mind might believe that everyone should be equal under the law but it has no foundation for thinking so; it is enthralled by the political subjectivism of contemporary ideology. The personal story assumes an authority above that fortuitous blend of tradition, accumulated knowledge and reason. The media no longer has the capacity to be the conscience of society; it has become the instrument of woke.



The Progressive de-Christianisers ridicule Christian history from the very perspective of the Christian morality they think out of date. Advocates of same-sex marriage and transgenderism reject Christian teaching but embrace a vision of monogamous marriage that has its origin in the same rejected teaching. Even the right for women to consent in sexual matters has its origin in their shared dignity with men.



Pro-choice abortion activists who argue for the right of women to control their bodies do so on the basis of the Christian explanation of human dignity. Feminists claim a common dignity with men but deny the authority of having been created in God’s image.



Presumably, in the alleged search for social justice, a point will be reached when we arrive at the promised Utopia and will hardly need government anymore. However, democracy is not “like a train that you get off once it has reached its destination”. We will not be met by peace, joy and freedom. 



Having rejected the redemptive concept of sin and forgiveness it must be replaced by an incoherent mix of victimhood and belief in essential human goodness. When everything is a social construction, equality cannot be the consequence. Instead, we will breed a virtue-signalling elite more hypocritical than the one rejected. Dissenters by their very nature must be evil, fit only for the rubbish dump.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
In Australia a fierce debate is raging, between people who want to reduce the rising risk of shark attack on swimmers, by culling dangerous sharks, and greens, who often give the impression that losing a few people to shark attacks every year is acceptable. Now Professor Rod Connolly has added a new argument to the debate – he claims culling sharks exacerbates climate change.
According to the Brisbane Times;
As debate over shark culling continues along Australia’s coastline, a Queensland researcher has thrown another consideration into the mix – climate change.
Gold Coast-based marine scientist Professor Rod Connolly looked at data from coastal wetlands around the world and found those with fewer predators were less effective at storing carbon.
Simplistically, this meant less greenhouse gas locked away in plants and more floating free in the atmosphere contributing to warming and climate change.
The findings, published Tuesday in journal Nature Climate Change, came a few days after a seven-year-old girl was apparently bitten by a shark off Russell Island, near Cairns.

The abstract of the study;
Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth’s ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth’s most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of ‘blue carbon’ (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

I’m personally disgusted that anyone could put the welfare of a few sharks, even an entire species of sharks, ahead of the safety of Australia’s children. As for the alleged “climate risk” associated with shark culling – lets just say I’m prepared to take that chance.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
  
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set to release its _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the physical science of climate change at the conclusion on its editorial meeting in Stockholm scheduled from September 23-26th.   
  
A version of its Summary for Policymakers (SPM)—perhaps the most influential portion of the report as it is the widest read—has been “leaked” to generate media interest in the upcoming release. It certainly has, but perhaps not in the manner intended. The leaked SPM has revealed a document so flawed and removed from current science that it has been described as not only being “obsolete on the day that it is released, but that it will be dead wrong as well” (okay, we wrote that).   
  
Examples already abound as to the problems evident in the leaked SPM. Here we add another—this one having to do with the recent rate of sea level rise.   
  
In the Summary for Policymakers section of its _Fourth Assessment Report_ (published in 2007) the IPCC had this to say about the rate of sea level rise:   




Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961-2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear.



Since then, we have highlighted numerous findings in the scientific literature that present strong evidence that the increase in the rate of sea level rise since 1993 is largely _not_ an increase in the longer-term trend (or at least not from human-caused climate change which is the IPCC’s implication) and that the short-term rate of sea level rise has been slowing, and returning back towards the long-term average.   
  
But the IPCC’s heart remains hardened.   




The leaked version of the AR5 SPM includes this description of sea level rise:   




It is _very likely_ that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm yr–1 between 1993 and 2010. Tide-gauge and satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate of the latter period. It is _likely_ that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950.



Notice that they dropped any statement wondering whether the recent rate of rise was an increase in the longer-term trend or the result of short-term variability or other non- climate-change-related factors—even though the difference between these cases has implications for our understanding of sea level rise and how it may evolve into the future.   
  
We repeat— _recent scientific findings argue that rate of sea level rise since 1993 is little different than the long-term (20th century) rate of sea level rise once natural variability and non-climatic influences are accounted for_.   
  
Here are two papers demonstrating this fact.   
  
The first was published by a research team led by Yoshide Wada and which we covered last summer. Wada and colleagues examined how much of an influence human pumping of groundwater for irrigation etc.—water which eventually finds its way into the global oceans—was having on the sea level. They found the impact to be quite significant, concluding:   




[O]ur results compare well with independent estimates for the present groundwater depletion rates… and show that groundwater depletion is likely to be the major component of terrestrial contribution to sea-level change in the coming decades.



The data that they compiled on ground water depletion and surface impoundments (dams) show that for the period from 1993-2011, the net contribution (termed “dewatering” of the continents) has resulted in a sea level rise of about 0.44 mm/yr (+/- 0.1mm/yr)—and they predict this rate to increase by mid-century.   
  
This 0.44 mm/yr (of the observed 3.2 mm/yr) of sea level rise since 1993 is not related to anthropogenic climate change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
A second relevant paper was published a few weeks ago. In this one, a team led by University of Colorado’s Ben Hamlington examined how large an influence multi-decadal natural oscillations of an important Pacific Ocean climate state—called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)—has on global sea level. Since the PDO oscillation is pretty slow, approximately 60 years or so, the researchers note that it is “difficult to assess the contribution of decadal to multi-decadal climate signals to the global trend” using a record that only begins in 1993. By attempting to identify the influence of the PDO, Hamlington and colleagues could then estimate the PDO’s effect on the global mean sea level (GMSL) trend. They write:   




We estimate the PDO contribution to the GMSL trend over the past twenty years to be approximately 0.49 ± 0.25 mm/year, and find that removing the PDO contribution reduces the acceleration in GMSL estimated over the past sixty years.



As the PDO is a natural phenomenon, that’s another 0.49 mm/yr (of the 3.2 mm/yr since 1993) not caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
A quick review of the math shows us that of the IPCC’s 3.2 mm/yr of sea level rise from 1993 only 2.27 mm/yr is left after accounting for natural oscillations in the Pacific and the “dewatering” of the continents.   
  
Color us jaded, but 2.27 mm/yr doesn’t sound all that much different from the long-term 1.7 mm/yr, especially when the confidence intervals of the calculations are all included.   
  
In other words, had the IPCC accurately reported the extant science on the factors behind the reported increase in the rate of sea level rise since 1993, the reader of the SPM would have been left with a much different impression of its evolution—one which the current situation is not that much different from the past (and to which we have largely adapted), instead of one in which the reader is left to think that anthropogenic climate change has resulted in a near doubling of the long-term rate of sea level rise.   
  
Isn’t the IPCC supposed to be giving the _best_ scientific explanation of what it taking place, not one which is colored by trying to support a fracturing consensus?   
  
As Georgia Tech’s Judith Curry points out in an astute op-ed published in the _Australian_ over the weekend (paywalled, but Judy discusses her piece here), that doesn’t seem to be the case at all.   
  
We think it is high time for the IPCC to end its charade (and save the global tax-payer huge sums of money in the process).

"The White House floated an idea on Thursday afternoon that, in initial reports, sounded like a major tariff on Mexican imports  —   something that would have gone a long way toward unwinding one of the United States’ deepest economic relationships. The reality of what Sean Spicer, the press secretary, suggested is a lot less dramatic. But it sends important signals about how people in the Trump administration are thinking about overhauling the tax code  —   and how they’re thinking about claiming victory on some of the president’s audacious campaign promises. It is a sign of just how fluid things are in this moment when so much of American public policy around taxes, trade and diplomacy is in flux. Mr. Spicer suggested a way the administration could accomplish President Trump’s goal of building a border wall paid for by Mexico. A 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico would do the trick, Mr. Spicer said. That might sound as if Mr. Spicer was proposing that the United States slap a new tariff meant to punish Mexican exporters. Such a move would result in higher prices for American consumers, create profound challenges for industries with supply chains that span the border, and possibly prompt the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But you get a different picture when you put Mr. Spicer’s words into the context of the rapidly evolving debate in Washington around overhauling corporate taxation. He was pointing out that in an overhaul of taxes that House Republicans are considering, imports from all countries would be taxed at 20 percent while American exports would be tax free. It’s called border adjustment, and it would make the United States corporate tax code more closely resemble the   tax that is commonplace in other countries. House Republicans see the policy as a way to reshape the tax code to give businesses less incentive to move operations overseas while also generating revenue they can use to reduce tax rates. Opponents of the plan, which include major retailers, are skeptical. Among the risks: It could drive up consumer prices for all sorts of imported goods, from German cars to Mexican avocados, if the dollar does not rise as much as economists predict. And the policy may violate World Trade Organization rules, which could tangle it up in legal proceedings. But that Mr. Spicer was floating that plan as a way to fulfill Mr. Trump’s Mexican wall promises is interesting on two levels. First, less than two weeks ago, the    threw cold water on the House plan. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Mr. Trump told The Wall Street Journal. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. ” On Thursday, Mr. Spicer was explicitly suggesting that a border tax could be used to pay for a border wall. Referring to the tax plan, he said, “This is something that we’ve been in close contact with both houses in moving forward. ” The border adjustment strategy has plenty of enemies, and there’s no certainty that it will become part of a tax overhaul bill. But the latest tea leaves suggest the administration is more open to it than it may have seemed. The second lesson from the incident is that the Trump administration looks inclined to be flexible in finding ways to satisfy campaign promises without doing major damage to the economy or international relations. Thursday was one of the roughest days for relations between the United States and Mexico in some time, with the cancellation of a planned visit by President Enrique Peña Nieto and tough talk from Mexico City, which adamantly refuses to pay for an expansion of a border wall. But Mr. Spicer’s comments, which he later said were meant more to offer an example than a concrete policy proposal, suggest that the administration will look for creative ways to proclaim victory on Trumpian promises. In other words, he will proclaim that Mexico has paid for the wall as promised  —   even if the Mexican government never literally cuts a check to pay for new concrete. Advocates of the border adjustment tax have been fond of it because it would produce enough revenue to allow a deep reduction in tax rates. But money is fungible. So if the president can claim political victory by stating that the revenue from Mexican imports is going to pay for the wall, no one is going to stop him. It is a messy time for the making of economic policy. The Trump campaign was notoriously light on policy detail, and the Trump administration still has many key vacancies in economic policy jobs. Nominees for Treasury secretary, commerce secretary and U. S. trade representative have not yet been confirmed, and key jobs on the Council of Economic Advisers and most undersecretary and assistant secretary jobs remain unfilled. So the gaps are still being filled in on what the Trump administration economic policy will really mean in practice. The way to read the latest Mexico comments is as one more hint."
"Abortion opponents gathered on Friday in Washington for their annual march, which has taken place every year since 1974 to protest the Supreme Court’s    Roe v. Wade decision from 1973. ■ Vice President Mike Pence, the   official to ever speak in person at the march, told the crowd that “life is winning. ” ■ Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, also addressed the crowd. ■ The march drew thousands of activists. Mr. Pence, using the refrain “life is winning,” assured the crowd that Mr. Trump shared their opposition to abortion and would appoint a justice to the Supreme Court who held that view as well. “We will not rest until we restore a culture of life in America,” Mr. Pence said, and thousands in the crowd cheered. He also said that by many measures  —   the views of members of Congress and advances in science among them  —   “life is winning in America. ” Standing where other Republican leaders have usually just sent video or audio recordings of their message, Mr. Pence said the   movement should embrace the moment. Kellyanne Conway may have sprung onto the national political scene largely unknown. But inside the movement of those opposing abortion, she has been a leading figure for two decades. “Kellyanne is one of us,” is how she was introduced at the March for Life. As a pollster and political strategist, she advised numerous groups like the Susan B. Anthony List and the March for Life, urging them to adopt what she often described as a more   approach that avoided some of the more incendiary language of the movement in the past. Opponents of abortion gather every year on the National Mall and march to the Supreme Court. Usually their defiance is not much more than symbolism  —   the court is the origin of Roe v. Wade, the decision in 1973 that they have sought for more than 40 years to overturn. This year they have ample reason to believe that under a   government, they will begin to see movement for the first time in more than a decade. In previous years, no president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. This year, the Trump administration will be out in full force with the appearances of Mr. Pence and Ms. Conway. President Trump, in one of his first official acts, signed an order prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad who discuss abortion as a   option. And in a break with previous Republican presidents, he has embraced the idea of a litmus test for his Supreme Court nominees and pledged explicitly to name someone who opposes abortion. He said he would announce his choice on Thursday to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February. Mr. Trump has become an unlikely champion for the movement, with abortion opponents saying he is probably their most unflinching White House ally since President Ronald Reagan. Though Mr. Trump spent much of his life as a supporter of abortion rights, he spoke more vividly and forcefully on the issue during the campaign than any recent Republican nominee. And while many groups opposing abortion were vehemently opposed to Mr. Trump during the Republican primaries last year, almost all of them came around. Today, however unexpectedly, they march in a Washington suddenly more friendly to their interests. Many of the activists said they were looking forward to President Trump appointing Supreme Court justices who might overturn the right to abortions and to the defunding of Planned Parenthood. Marchers waved signs spelling out their beliefs in messages like “Save the babies,” “    ” and “Trump for Baby Bumps. ” Still, some of the marchers remained wary of the new president. Kathleen Crank, 19, a sophomore at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan. traveled on a five bus caravan of 260 students to come to the march. She said she was happy to have a president who would oppose abortion but wasn’t excited about much else about Mr. Trump. She said she waited until the last minute and decided not to vote for either him or Hillary Clinton. “Their stance on abortion is probably the only issue I’m glad about for this administration,” she said. “I’m glad that after eight years of reading Obama’s tweets celebrating Roe v. Wade, I’m glad we finally have an administration that is recognizing we need to cut funding for abortions in other countries and bringing it back down to the state level. ” Ms. Crank also said she saw abortions as less about religion than about preserving the rights of unborn children. “It’s more a social justice issue for unborn babies than a religious one to push an agenda,” she said. “Everyone should be able to live their life and live it however they want to. ” Annette Saunders, 60, drove five hours with her husband from Norwalk, Conn. to volunteer with Save the Storks, a group that opposes abortion, and to hand out signs that said, “For those who can’t. ” Though she voted for Mr. Trump, Ms. Saunders said she agonized over the decision because she found him to be “crass” and was frustrated by the tape of him using vulgarities to talk about women. “I was concerned but I felt like God told me to vote for Donald Trump,” she said. “He is standing up for   and his vice president certainly is and I’m excited about seeing a turnaround. ” Jon Banks and Josie Rauh, both 18, were taking photos of each other in front of the Washington Monument clad in red and blue   President caps. They were part of a group that traveled to Washington from Archbishop Hoban, a private Catholic high school in Akron, Ohio. Both said Mr. Trump’s opposition to abortion were the centerpieces of their support for the new president. They grew up in families dedicated to the cause. Ms. Rauh had supported former President Barack Obama but became enthusiastic in 2016. “I thought Obama was a pretty good president,” she said. “I think there are some things that need to be changed, like Roe v. Wade. I think Trump has got a plan and is ready to do it. ” “I want women to have their rights,” she added. “But I think there are a bunch of women in the womb that are being killed, too. ” Mr. Banks, the son of a police officer, said he was thrilled by Mr. Trump’s patriotism. He said he hoped the new president found a way to outlaw abortion. As Mr. Pence, Ms. Conway and several other speakers celebrated what they described as a new phase for the   movement, thousands of people shouted “Trump” and “Life” while happily waving their hands. Anne Nudi, 49, a nurse and college professor who flew to Washington from her home in Kenosha, Wis. to come to the march, said she enthusiastically cast her ballot for Mr. Trump and has been encouraged by his first busy week in office. “I feel empowered. I feel positive. I feel encouraged about the future and I feel blessed that I have a president who is supportive of our cause,” she said as she shivered while watching the speakers. “I believe he’s a good person. He’s made his own way and I believe he wants what’s best for our country regardless of party affiliation. ”"

What’s going in Europe? Are we witnessing another historic retreat into scientific barbarism?



How else to explain three disturbing irrationalities in recent times: distortion of genetic science resulting in massive African starvation; perseveration on a global warming treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which Europe knows will have no effect on climate; and the public show trial of Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg, for writing a book that reveals what they already knew about Kyoto.



A glance at a world map shows Europe to be a pretty small place compared to the rest of the world that is chomping genetically engineered corn and soybeans or their by‐​products (like that plate of ribs) with reckless abandon. On Kyoto, Europe lost a critical referendum last year when radical green Robert Watson was voted out as head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On Lomborg, well, Denmark is even smaller than Europe.



Each of these stories merits elaboration, as each represents a triumph of irrationality in the face of some pretty obvious science‐​all with disastrous consequences.



In response to pressure from the European Community, and in the face of a terrible famine, Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa refused to allow the distribution of 27,000 tons of genetically modified corn. Mwanawasa chose to starve his people because Europe was afraid that some of the corn would be planted, and the genes would “escape,” contaminating subsequent corn that could then not be exported to the Continent. Never mind that “outbreeding” is extremely rare and that it doesn’t matter anyway. Europe eschews genetically engineered corn to protect its own, more inefficient varieties, propping up the local price. 



U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick minced no words, calling Zambia’s action “immoral” and “Luddite.” Not being diplomatic, I’ll add another: “murder.” The main genetic modification is the insertion of genetic material from Bacillus thuringensis, which is lethal to the European Corn Borer, requiring much less use of much more expensive (and, to some, distasteful) pesticides. Organic gardeners in the United States sprinkle this bacterium everywhere as a natural pest control. 



While genetic scare stories abound, hyped by European greens, the experiment has already been run. American agriculture and consumers prosper because of genetic engineering, with no demonstrable negative effect (except lower corn and soybean prices because of abundant production).



The Kyoto and Lomborg stories are related. In his book, “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” Lomborg demonstrated that planetary warming is likely to be at the low end of projections, and that Kyoto wouldn’t do anything measurable to stop it. Every serious scientist knows the basis of his argument: Kyoto really doesn’t reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide much, observed increases in this gas are falling far beneath the dire predictions made only 10 years ago, and warming has been modest. Because the tendency of most sophisticated climate models is to produce a constant (not increasing) rate of warming, we therefore have a good idea of how much it will warm, a mere three‐​quarters of a degree Celsius in the next 50 years. Variants of this calculation have been repeated in at least three separate instances in the refereed scientific literature.



In response, the Danish “Committees on Scientific Dishonesty” accused Lomborg of “scientific dishonesty.” Did they cite one fact that he had gotten wrong? No. His crime? He failed to endorse the pro‐​Kyoto insanity. He refused to act irrationally.



One Kyoto would reduce U.S. GDP by about 2 percent per year, depending upon assumptions. The 20‐​or‐​so Kyotos that European greens say are necessary? Do the math. U.S. capital is precisely what is required for investment in the miserable, starving, death‐​ridden world of Africa. As an example, the less we invest in things like clean power plants and water treatment facilities, the more they die from the complications of indoor smoke inhalation from cooking fires and water‐​borne diseases. Together, these kill millions‐​while Kyoto does nothing and takes away that capital. 



The Danish “Committees” cited not one scientific finding against Lomborg. Instead, they referred to four anti‐​Lomborg essays published in Scientific American by known environmental ideologues, which themselves have been heavily criticized. Lomborg was allowed no defense. 



He’s got an issue now. He’s been blackballed. No more government research money for him. The Danish “Committees” citing Scientific American as evidence have irrevocably damaged his reputation. 



Should Lomborg sue Scientific American as the ultimate cause of this damage? The result would be a highly publicized trial that would reveal for all the descent of Europe into yet another scientific Dark Age, as well as the bullyboy tactics that are now rising in America to quash rational scientific dissent. He may have a case.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeorg Etscheit at the climate alarmist Klimaretter here whines about the Greens in Munich setting a poor example when it comes to (ab)using jet-fuel burning commercial airlines.
This reminds us of serial private jet flier Leonardo DiCaprio, who took his private jet 12,000 kilometers and burned 30,000 liters of jet fuel to pick up an environment award.
Munich Green official took airliner to attend “bicycle traffic conference”. Public domain photo.
It turns out that in the Bavarian capital city of Munich the opposition Greens were looking for a way to create an issue with which to put the ruling socialist-conservative coalition administration on the defensive, and so they sent a query to the city government demanding to know who abused (ab)used commercial flights the most. They hoped to place the blame for damaging to the environment squarely on those responsible. Before 2014, Munich was governed by a SPD socialist/Green coalition. Since then it has been governed by an SPD (socialist)/CSU (Christian conservative) coalition.
Surely the recent government must be abusing air travel and irresponsibly damaging the environment.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne.
Fliegen für mich, nicht für dich
It turns out the opposition Greens should have never posed the question. The answer came back from the Munich city administration, and it is truly embarrassing for them. According to Etscheit:

It’s the Greens. By a wide margin who fly the most often, more often than members of the other political fractions. According to the SZ [Süddeutscheteitung] 23 flights were logged by the Greens, while the members of the SPD party, which is twice the size, flew half the number [12], the CSU even less [6].”
Etscheit bemoans that this is in line with a 2014 survey conducted by news weekly Der Spiegel, which found that greens are “passionate fliers”. I wrote on this here, whereby a reliable survey found that:
…Green Party voters fly the most: 49% have flown at least once in the past 12 months. They were followed by the communist Die Linke (42%), the conservatives CDU (36%) and lastly by the socialists SPD (32%).”
That’s remarkable behavior given that the Greens are the most vocal when it comes to protesting airport expansions or nighttime landings and takeoffs. They loudly protest such projects, but then end up being the ones using them the most.
Air travel to a “bicycle traffic conference”
The Munich Greens write here that they were surprised to discover that they are the biggest abusers of air travel, despite being a comparatively small party.
But they had good reasons, blaming: “inconvenient connections”, and official business such as being the only party to send an official to attend “Kiev Pride”, or to participate at a “bicycle traffic conference” in Rostock, or to visit a day-conference in Venice.
So why is it that Greens in general are most often involved in widespread (ab)use of the commercial airlines? Etscheit writes it is because they tend to be high income earners.

"**After being ensconced in power in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region for nearly three decades, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) could be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.**
But the Ethiopian military believes that it can prevent this from happening through the offensive it launched on 4 November to oust the TPLF and arrest more than 70 of its leaders and military officers.
They include veterans of the 17-year guerrilla war that led to the TPLF seizing power in the federal capital, Addis Ababa, in 1991 and who then controlled the country's military and intelligence services until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed purged them when he took office in 2018. He accused them of being repressive and corrupt - charges they deny.
Having retreated to their strongholds in Tigray while Mr Abiy established his control over the rest of Ethiopia, earlier this month they seized control of a key federal military base - which is part of the Northern Command - located near Tigray's capital, Mekelle, apparently without much resistance.
The International Crisis Group (ICG), a non-governmental organisation which focuses on conflict-prevention, described it as the federal military's largest regional military command.
The TPLF seized an array of weapons, including rockets and missiles, though the Ethiopian military still has considerable air power, including fighter jets and helicopter gunships.
Their operation came after Mr Abiy's government decided to redirect funding away from the Tigray leadership, accusing them of holding an ""illegal"" election for the regional legislature in September, rather than abiding by a federal decision to postpone all polls because of coronavirus.
TPLF officials say they took the parts of the Northern Command because they believed that federal intervention was imminent. Mr Abiy responded by accusing the TPLF of crossing the ""final red line"", and ordered air strikes and the deployment of troops to Tigray.
Twenty-two days into the conflict, Mr Abiy says the army is now launching the ""final phase"" of its operation in Tigray to take control of Mekelle, which will be over in the ""coming days"".
But TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael has been defiant, telling AFP earlier in the week: ""We are people of principle and ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region.""
ICG Ethiopia analyst William Davison says the TPLF may be able to call on more than 200,000 fighters - from militias in villages to special forces in the regional government.
""Because of the changed political dynamics over the last two years, there has been significant recruitment and training in Tigray,"" he told the BBC.
The ICG does not give an estimate of the strength of the Ethiopian military, but Reuters news agency quotes the Janes security data group as saying that it has around 140,000 active personnel, most of them in the army.
If these estimates are correct, the Ethiopian military may have fewer soldiers than the TPLF, but it can bolster its numbers by drawing on the special forces of other regional governments - Ethiopian law allows each of them to have these paramilitary units to provide security within their territory.
Significantly, special forces from the Amhara regional government - which has a long-running land dispute with Tigray - helped federal troops secure territory in western Tigray when the conflict started.
""In the west, joint federal and Amhara control may be more established because those forces outnumbered and overpowered local Tigray forces,"" said Mr Davison.
""There are also more flat areas in the west, giving a conventional army more advantage,"" he said, adding that this was unlike the terrain in the ""core"" of Tigray, around cities in the east, like Mekelle, where it was rugged and mountainous, making it more conducive for guerrilla warfare.
Arhe Hamednaca, who took part in guerrilla wars against previous Ethiopian governments and went on to become an MP in Sweden, said the offensive in the west had also been aimed at securing the border with Sudan.
He said this was vital - to prevent the TPLF from setting up bases there as it had done when it fought the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam 29 years ago.
""The only way for the TPLF to escape and to get fresh supplies is through Sudan,"" he said.
Furthermore, there is also no outlet to the Red Sea through Eritrea, as there was in the 1980s, when Eritrea forces were allied with the TPLF against Mengistu.
Prime Minister Abiy has become a staunch ally of Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, who fought a bitter border war with the Ethiopia, when it was under TPLF control.
""Times have changed. The TPLF's supply routes are not flowing, and to its north is President Isaias Afwerki's Eritrea, its principle enemy,"" BBC Tigrinya editor Samuel Ghebhrehiwet said.
Several sources in Eritrea have told the BBC that Ethiopian troops have been crossing the border to regroup and to treat their wounded in military hospitals - though both governments deny Eritrean involvement in the Tigrayan conflict.
""Tigray is blockaded. The TPLF cannot sustain a conventional war,"" Mr Davison said.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that federal forces will have the quick victory they hope for.
Mr Arhe notes that there are numerous examples of guerrilla fighters taking on better armed opponents.
""The Americans had all sorts of drones and fighter jets in Afghanistan, but the Taliban survived,"" he said.
""The Houthi rebels in Yemen have survived UAE and Saudi weapon superiority.""
Mr Davison said that while federal troops were advancing towards Mekelle, it was unclear how many towns and cities they had actually taken control of along the way and how many they had just passed through.
Either way, many Tigrayan fighters may eventually retreat to villages and surrounding mountains to prepare for a guerrilla war that could receive significant public support, he added.
""Though federal officials claim the opposite, many Tigrayans seem to oppose the intervention because they believe it is to remove a legitimately elected regional government,"" Mr Davison said.
Moreover, they generally support the federal system that the TPLF helped introduced after it took power in Addis Ababa in 1991, as the best way to protect their political, linguistic and cultural rights, he added.
In contrast, the TPLF accuses Mr Abiy of trying to establish a more unitary type of government.
The BBC's Tigrinya editor says that while a surge in Tigrayan nationalism could work in the TPLF's favour, the possibility that many people may instead back the federal government cannot be ruled out.
""During the armed struggle [against Mengistu], the people of Tigray were fully behind the fighters. But in the nearly three decades that the TPLF has been in power, many Tigrayans objected to the leadership because of systemic corruption and oppression,"" Mr Samuel said.
He believes that the outcome of the battle for Mekelle will determine whether or not the TPLF can wage a guerrilla war, but even if the Ethiopian military gains the upper hand, he does not envisage the conflict ending without proper negotiations between the different sides."

Europeans in general enjoyed a mild winter this year. But apparently it looks like it’s set to get colder and snowier as the calendar turns to March.
The site writes that the mild weather of the past weekend will be pushed out of Central Europe by Arctic wind and snow by Wednesday, as the following wetteronline chart illustrates:

 
Chart by http://www.wetteronline.de/14-tage-wetter
The reason for this of course is global cooling. Just kidding.
The late winter will be due to a low over positioned over Scandinavia and a high over Iceland. The two systems will act to pump polar air over a western and central Europe that is by now now longing for signs of spring. The gardening tools and are going to have to wait awhile longer.

Wetteronline.de says that today will see very springlike temperatures down in southern Germany, with readings reaching above 15°C. But it adds the weather will cool with each passing day – with “snow reaching down into the lowlands” already by Tuesday. It warns of heavy snowshowers by midweek.



Video by: http://www.wetteronline.de/14-tage-wetter
The good news is that Europe will have a chance to dry out as high pressure pumps in drier air. Early March is forecast to be more on the wintry side. Wetteronline writes of “snowfalls down to the lower elevations with high temperatures near 5°C likely“.

The history of economic thought is replete with examples of economic ideas that are politically attractive and persist even after they have little empirical support or theoretical validity. That has certainly been the case with the Phillips curve.



The Federal Reserve continues to incorporate the Phillips curve in its macroeconomic models even though the empirical evidence for a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is weak at best. In a recent study by the Brookings Institution, the authors note that the Fed still relies on the Phillips curve as a “key factor” in setting its policy rate and as a “tool … to forecast what will happen to inflation when the unemployment rate falls, as it has in recent years” (Ng, Wessel, and Sheiner 2018: 1–2).



This article traces the history of the Phillips curve and argues that it is a poor guide for monetary policy. The underlying problem is that the Phillips curve misconstrues a supposed correlation between unemployment and inflation as a causal relation. In fact, it is changes in aggregate demand that cause changes in both unemployment and inflation. The Phillips curve continues to misinform policymakers and lead them astray.



In 1958, New Zealand economist A. W. Phillips published a landmark paper showing an inverse relationship between unemployment and the rate of change in money wages in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1913. He also found that relationship persisted when the data set was extended to 1957 (Phillips 1958).



R. G. Lipsey (1960) provided further support for Phillips’s findings, as did Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960), who coined the term “Phillips curve.” In their version of the curve, price inflation (rather than wage inflation) is plotted against unemployment. Using U.S. data for 1934 to 1958, they found a negative relationship between the rate of change in the average level of money prices and the level of unemployment. By viewing the Phillips curve as a “menu of choice[s] between different degrees of unemployment and price stability,” Samuelson and Solow opened the door for policymakers to believe they could fine‐​tune the economy by choosing a socially optimal point on the Phillips curve, at least in the short run (see Humphrey 1986:100–03).



Although Samuelson and Solow (1960: 193) stated that their analysis pertained to the short run, and that the shape of the Phillips curve could change in the long run, or the curve could shift, those caveats were largely ignored in the 1960s. There was a strong sense that the Phillips curve was stable and that there was a _permanent_ tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. That belief fostered the idea that mild inflation was beneficial in reducing unemployment. In such an environment, inflation increased from 1.2 percent in 1962 to 5.8 percent in 1970 (see Hall and Hart 2012: 62–64).



In his monumental _History of the Federal Reserve_ , Allan Meltzer, paints a succinct picture of the raise of the Phillips curve as a policy guide in the 1960s:



In a separate study of the Samuelson‐​Solow Phillips curve, Hall and Hart (2012: 63–64) note:



With high and variable inflation in the 1970s, reaching 13.5 percent in 1980, the Phillips curve lost its luster as both inflation and unemployment soared. Peter Ireland, a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee notes, “Despite the occasional appearance of a statistical Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment in the United States data, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to exploit that Phillips curve led, during the 1970s, not to lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation but instead to the worst of both worlds: higher unemployment and higher inflation” (Ireland 2019b: 5).



The stagflation led Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to proclaim before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in 1981: “I don’t think that we have the choice in current circumstances — the old tradeoff analysis — of buying full employment with a little more inflation. We found out that doesn’t work” (Volcker 1981: 28). Volcker’s war on inflation was not popular with many members of Congress, who continued to think that higher inflation could help reduce unemployment. However, he proved to be correct in arguing that lowering inflation and achieving long‐​run price stability would help calm markets and improve the prospect for growth in employment and output (see Steelman 2011: 3–4).



Milton Friedman (1968, 1977) and Edmund Phelps (1967) recognized that when inflation expectations are built into the Phillips curve, and individuals fully anticipate inflation, unemployment will settle at its “natural” level as determined by market forces, and the long‐​run Phillips curve will be vertical — that is, there will be no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.



In his 1976 Nobel lecture, “Inflation and Unemployment,” Milton Friedman (1977) traced out three stages in the evolution of the Phillips curve. The _first stage_ featured the simple curve in Figure 1, showing a stable, negative relationship between inflation and unemployment.





The _second stage_ featured Friedman’s “natural rate hypothesis,” which he first described in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association. In this stage, the short‐​run Phillips curve is adjusted for expectations and the long‐​run curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (Friedman 1968). An unexpected increase in inflation initially reduces unemployment. However, once workers and employers fully anticipate higher inflation, they will revise their plans and unemployment will return to its “natural” level consistent with equilibrium real wages and the overall structure of the labor market.2



Figure 2 shows an increase in inflation from 0 percent to I1 temporarily reduces unemployment below its long‐​run “natural” level UN to U1, say from 4 percent to 3 percent. (No one knows for certain what the actual “natural rate of unemployment” is; it is not observable.) The movement from point _a_ to point _b_ on the initial Phillips curve (PC1) is posited on the assumption that the initial inflation rate is 0 percent. However, once the higher inflation rate is fully recognized by market participants, unemployment will return to UN and PC2 will become the relevant Phillips curve — provided expected inflation remains at I1. Points _a_ and _c_ now lie on the long‐​run Phillips curve (LRPC), where each point represents a state of full adjustment between actual and expected inflation. Thus, the long‐​run Phillips curve is vertical. As Meltzer (2009: 287) writes, “The long‐​run Phillips curve must be vertical because inflation is a nominal variable and unemployment is a real variable. Rational behavior require[s] that any influence of nominal variables on real variables last only as long as it takes markets to learn and adjust.”





The concept of “rational expectations,” first developed by John Muth (1961) and later elaborated upon by Robert Lucas (1987) and Thomas Sargent (1986), provided a strong theoretical case that there could be no tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment — even in the short run. Hence, under the rational expectations framework, systematic monetary policy can have no impact on relative prices, output, or employment. However, if wages and/​or prices are sticky and there are costs to acquiring information about job openings, and so on, then activist monetary policies can still have real effects — perhaps for a considerable time (see Humphrey 1986: 126).3



The _third stage_ in the evolution of the Phillips curve is the hypothesis that high and variable inflation plants the seeds for higher future unemployment by distorting relative prices and increasing “regime uncertainty,” thus producing a positively sloped long‐​run Phillips curve as shown in Figure 3 (adapted from Humphrey 1986: 108).4 As Humphrey explains:





Milton Friedman considered the possibility of a positively sloped Phillips curve, given the stagflation that occurred in the 1970s. Using inflation lagged one‐​half year (n 5 0.5), Friedman (1977: 461, Table 1) found that unemployment averaged 6.1 percent from 1971 through 1975 while inflation averaged 6.7 percent. His “tentative hypothesis” was that the positively sloped Phillips curve may be “a transitional phenomenon that will disappear as economic agents adjust not only their expectations but their institutional and political arrangements to a new reality.” He therefore thought that the natural‐​rate hypothesis would still hold in the very long run, but the “transitional period may well extend over decades” (Friedman 1977: 464–65).



Friedman (1977: 467) recognized that, during the transitional period, “increased volatility of inflation” can distort relative price signals and increase unemployment. Moreover, he believed that, “in practice, the distorting effects of uncertainty, rigidity of voluntary long‐​term contracts, and the contamination of price signals will almost certainly be reinforced by legal restrictions on price change” (i.e., wage and price controls).



During the Great Moderation, roughly from the mid‐​1980s until 2007, the transition to a more systematic monetary policy that implicitly followed a Taylor‐​type rule reduced the volatility of inflation and output compared to the stop‐​go monetary policy that preceded it (see Hakkio 2013). By anchoring inflation expectations and stabilizing the growth of nominal GDP (NGDP) around a trend rate of about 5 percent per year, the Fed improved its credibility and reduced regime uncertainty.



Jerry L. Jordan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, described the atmosphere surrounding the Phillips curve during the last two decades of the 20th century:



The global financial crisis of 2008 ended the Great Moderation and ushered in a new wave of uncertainty associated with unconventional monetary policies. After more than a decade, the inflation rate has remained low despite historically low unemployment, a result that challenges those who continue to place faith in the Phillips curve’s credibility as a forecasting tool to guide monetary policy. As St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (2017) has stated, “the idea that unemployment outcomes are a major factor in driving inflation outcomes in the U.S. economy” cannot be substantiated by the data. “A more important determinant” appears to be “inflation expectations.” He goes on to say:



Even in the face of strong evidence for the flattening of the short‐​run Phillips curve (i.e., decreases in unemployment have a much smaller impact on inflation than in earlier periods), central banks are reluctant to omit it from their macroeconomic models.5 As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted in his April 6, 2018, speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, “Almost all of the participants [at the January 2018 Federal Open Market Committee meeting] thought that the Phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding inflation.” Yet they recognized “that the link between labor market tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, reflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and in other advanced economies” (Powell 2018: 6–7).



The real problem with the Phillips curve is not that it supposes that inflation and unemployment are related, especially in the short run, but that it misconstrues that relation as involving a direct causal influence of unemployment on inflation, and vice versa, when in fact it is changes in aggregate demand that cause changes in both unemployment and inflation. According to Mickey Levy, chief economist at Berenberg:



The Phillips curve is a distraction to the main function of a central bank — namely, to “prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance,” as Milton Friedman observed in his 1968 presidential address (Friedman 1968: 12).



At a press conference following the Fed’s Open Market Committee meeting on June 14, 2017, Janet Yellen remarked: “We continue to feel that, with a strong labor market and a labor market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up” (Yellen 2017). Likewise, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell believes the Phillips curve “continues to be meaningful for monetary policy” even though the strength of the relationship between unemployment and inflation “has weakened” (Powell 2018).6



A few years earlier, in 2015, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis Lockhart, in an interview with the _Wall Street Journal_ , stated:



A final example of how the Phillips curve continues to be treated by Fed officials as a useful guide to policy, even in the face of strong evidence during the last 20 years that the degree of unemployment is a poor indicator of inflation, comes from a working paper prepared by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board’s Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs in 2018:



All of the forgoing examples show that central bankers are not yet willing to discard the Phillips curve as a policy tool, even though the evidence for a downward sloping curve is meager. Indeed, as early as 2002, William Niskanen, a former member of President Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, declared: “The concept of a Phillips curve should be considered empty when most of the variation in the data must be explained by shifts in this presumed relation. In any case, the Phillips curve proved to be a poor basis for forecasting and a worse guide to policy” (Niskanen 2002: 194).



Using annual data from 1960 through 2001, Niskanen found that “there is _no_ tradeoff of unemployment and inflation except in the same year,” and that “in the long term, the unemployment rate is a _positive_ function of the inflation rate” (Niskanen 2002: 198). During the 1970s, inflation and unemployment both increased, as the United States experienced stagflation, and since 2009, unemployment has turned sharply lower while inflation has remained low.



Nevertheless, the existence of even a transient and loose relation between inflation and unemployment provides policymakers with the illusory hope that they can exploit that relation to achieve desired policy goals. The idea that a little more inflation is desirable in return for a little less unemployment is appealing to both policymakers and politicians, both of whom are inclined to overemphasize the short run and discount the long run. That is why economic fallacies have a tendency to reappear, especially when politicians can win votes by resurrecting them. Protectionist rhetoric is one common example; the idea that a little inflation is a good thing is another.



Although the Phillips curve has been discredited, it is not really dead and so distracts from alternative ideas for conducting monetary policy that offer a better chance of achieving long‐​run price stability and promoting economic stability and growth. The still‐​lingering influence of circa. 1965 Keynesianism — with its emphasis on short‐​run remedies for long‐​run problems, its distrust of the market adjustment process, and its dismissal of the quantity theory of money — downplays the point, clearly recognized by F. A Hayek in 1960, that “the stimulating effect of inflation will … operate only so long as it has not been foreseen; as soon as it comes to be foreseen, only its continuation at an increased rate will maintain the same degree of prosperity” (Hayek 1960: 331). Hayek went on to criticize the myopic view of policymakers:



The Phillips curve gives policymakers a justification to try to fine‐​tune the economy, but it is a weak reed on which to base policy — and it fails to recognize the limits of monetary policy.7



Instead of relying on a flawed Phillips curve analysis to guide policy, Fed officials should focus on the underlying causes of both undesired changes in inflation and cyclical fluctuations in unemployment. In turn, the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability, which is flawed by assuming a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, should be replaced by a single target, preferably keeping NGDP on a level growth path.8 Doing so would increase the credibility of monetary policy, reduce regime uncertainty, mitigate business fluctuations, and avoid stop‐​go monetary policy. Niskanen (2008: 377) argued that “the intent of Congress would be better served and monetary policy would be more effective if Congress instructed the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that reflects both their concerns in a _single_ target.” He did so because he clearly recognized the failure of forecasting inflation under a Phillips curve framework and, hence, the merits of a nominal income target over an inflation target (with the unemployment rate serving as a poor proxy for likely inflation).9



One benefit of a rule designed to keep nominal income on a steady growth path is that it bypasses the issue of assigning weights under the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve price level stability and maximum employment. All that needs to be done is to set a target path for the growth of nominal spending (i.e., the sum of real output growth and inflation). Market forces will then determine real growth.



Peter Ireland nicely summarizes the benefits of NGDP targeting over a problematic reliance on the Phillips curve as a guide to monetary policy:



As the sum of real GDP growth and nominal price inflation, NGDP growth conveniently captures, in a single number, the Fed’s performance in satisfying both sides of its dual mandate for maximum sustainable growth with stable prices. At the same time, however, NGDP, precisely because it is a nominal variable, measured in units of dollars, is under the central bank’s control in the long run.… Moreover, the Fed’s ability to regulate the growth rate of NGDP does not depend on the stability of the Phillips curve.… [I]n the current environment, where various nonmonetary forces may well be causing the very low rate of measured unemployment to overstate the true degree of resource utilization in the U.S. economy, focusing instead on the real component of NGDP growth guards against one of the risks alluded to in Powell’s remarks: a policy stance that becomes inappropriately restrictive out of concern for inflationary pressures working through a misperceived Phillips curve.



Finally, as noted by Tobin (1983) and McCallum (1985), the equation of exchange MV5PY identifies nominal income (PY) as a measure of the money supply (M) that gets adjusted automatically for shifts in velocity (V). Thus, analyses based on the behavior of NGDP growth provide a monetarist cross‐​check against mainstream Keynesian approaches, like Powell’s, organized around the Phillips curve instead. According to this monetarist view, interactions between trends in M, reflecting monetary policy actions that affect the money supply, and V, interpreted following Friedman (1956) with reference to the determinants of money demand, replace those between the actual and natural rates of unemployment as the key mechanisms determining inflation [Ireland 2019a: 52–53].



Congress should put the Phillips curve to bed and consider the case for a nominal GDP (or domestic final sales) target. One step toward that goal would be to add nominal GDP growth to the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, a proposal first made by Jeffrey Frankel (2019: 461–70).



Instead of continuing to hold onto the discredited presumption of a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, policymakers should focus on the misallocative and distributive effects of activist monetary policy. The Fed needs to recognize that the Phillips curve is not a reliable policy compass. A monetary policy based on short‐​run activism, such as that implied by a “data‐​dependent” Fed, is not a good substitute for one based on a transparent, long‐​run strategy guided by a robust monetary rule. Policymakers should heed the advice of Hayek, who in 1975 wrote:



What we must now be clear about is that our aim must be, not the maximum of employment that can be achieved in the short run, but a “high and stable level of employment.” We can achieve this, however, only through the reestablishment of a properly functioning market which, by the free play of prices and wages, establishes the correspondence of supply and demand for each sector.



Though monetary policy must prevent wide fluctuations in the quantity of money or in the volume of the income stream, the effect on employment must not be its dominating consideration. _The primary aim must again become the stability of the value of money._ The currency authorities must again be effectively protected against the political pressure that today forces them so often to take measures that are politically advantageous in the short run but harmful to the community in the long run [Hayek (1975) 1979: 17].



It has been more than 40 years since Hayek made those recommendations for changes in the framework for monetary policy, yet we are still in search of a monetary constitution.10



The Phillips curve has diverted attention from the search for a monetary constitution and a rules‐​based regime by promoting the idea that central banks can use expansionary monetary policy to lower unemployment — and, hence, that discretionary policy is to be preferred to a rules‐​based regime. Macroeconomic models used by the world’s central banks still rely on the Phillips curve as a tool for their inflation forecasts, even though those forecasts have been unreliable.



Today, the United States has historically low unemployment while inflation has stayed at less than 2 percent for more than a decade. Those facts alone should convince policymakers that the Phillips curve is a poor guide for monetary policy.

1 In an endnote, the authors suggest: “The diagrams for the sub‐​periods in Phillips’s paper might also have alerted Samuelson and Solow to the fact that the Phillips curve relation only seemed to be stable under fixed exchange rates which helped to anchor inflation expectations” (Hall and Hart 2012: 69, n.7).



2 For a more detailed description of the adjustment process from an unanticipated increase in nominal aggregate demand, see Friedman (1968: 100–11; 1977: 456–57). Friedman gives credit to Edmund S. Phelps for his groundbreaking work in developing the natural rate hypothesis, for which he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2016 (see Phelps 1967, 1968).



3 Friedman (1968: 11) estimated “that the initial effects of a higher and unanticipated rate of inflation last for something like two to five years; that this initial effect then begins to be reversed; and that a full adjustment to the new rate of inflation takes … a couple of decades.” The adjustment process would be faster, he said, in countries experiencing “more sizable changes” in the rate of inflation.



4 Robert Higgs (1997) coined the term “regime uncertainty,” which he used to refer to the uncertainty caused by fiscal and regulatory policies that attenuated private property rights by decreasing expected returns on capital. In the case of a discretionary government fiat money regime, moving to a monetary rule would help reduce uncertainty about the future value of money and improve the climate for making private investment decisions (Dorn 2018, 2019).



5 Stock and Watson (2019: 1) find that the slope of the Phillips curve (measured by the change in inflation relative to the change in the unemployment gap), has gone from 20.48 in 1960–83 to 20.26 in 1984–99, and to 20.03 in 2000–2019Q1, which is not statistically different from zero.



6 By “weakened,” Powell means the slope of the Phillips curve has flattened: large decreases in unemployment have not had much impact on inflation. The rate of unemployment has gone from 10 percent in October 2009 to less than 4 percent today, while inflation has remained relatively low at less than 2 percent per year.



7 On the limits of monetary policy, see Friedman (1968), Plosser (2014), and Dorn (2001).



8 On the case for an NGDP target, see Sumner (2014); Selgin, Beckworth, and Bahadir (2015); and Beckworth (2017). Earlier proponents include Gordon (1985), McCallum (1989: chap. 16), and Meltzer 1989). Niskanen (1992: 284) favors targeting nominal domestic final sales (NDFS) and argues that keeping nominal demand on a stable growth path is superior to a “price rule” and a “money rule.” Unlike a price rule (e.g., inflation targeting), “a demand rule.… does not lead to adverse monetary policy in response to unexpected … changes in supply conditions.” Even more important, a demand rule, unlike a money rule, “accommodates unexpected changes in the demand for money” (i.e., in the velocity of money). See also Frankel (2019: 464–65).



9 On Niskanen’s ideas for reforming the monetary framework, see Selgin (2017).



10 On the search for a monetary constitution and stable money, see Yeager (1962); Dorn (1987); and White, Vanberg, and Köhler (2015).

Sea levels have commonly risen and fallen at amplitudes much greater than two-tenths of a meter.   As Harris et al. (2015)  confirm, “relative sea-level variations of ∼1 m were common throughout the Holocene.”
For example, consider Bracco et al. (2014).  These scientists found that sea levels along the coasts of South America were a full 4 meters higher than they are now between 5,500 and 6,000 years ago.  Then, over the course of just a 400-year time span  (between 4,700 -4,300 years ago), sea levels dropped by a full 3 meters (to +1 meter above today’s levels), then rose by 2 meters (to +3 meters above today’s levels), and then fell to current levels after 4,300 years ago.   Here’s what these long-term sea-level oscillations look like graphed (Fig. 5):

These rapid variations in sea levels pose critical explanatory problems for advocates of the AGW (anthropogenic global warming) supposition that human CO2 emissions, and not internal Earth-system dynamics, are what drive sea level changes.  Specifically, AGW advocates presume that rising CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to rise (and lowering CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to fall).  A large volume of rapidly accumulating scientific evidence not only does not support this CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise supposition, it suggests that a long-term  inverse correlation could just as easily be formulated: As CO2 rises, sea levels decline.
To illustrate this, consider the Bracco et al. (2014) graph above depicting meters-per-century variations in sea levels with the corresponding CO2 concentration recorded for each period.   Notice that the highstand period (5,000 to 6,000 years ago) had lower concentrations of CO2 than the following millennia that subsequently had higher CO2 concentrations.  Also, consider that there was no significant change in CO2 levels during the 400 years of rapid sea level changes.  Finally, notice that the last 200 years of sea level changes (if there have been any) are undetectable on this scale at this location even though CO2 concentrations were rising from 280 ppm to 400 ppm during this period.

And this isn’t just true for the coasts of South America.  In the peer-reviewed scientific literature, a non-correlation — or inverse correlation — for CO2 and sea level (as CO2 rises, sea levels fall) has been reported by scientists for dozens of locations across the globe just in the last few years alone.  Graphs (with CO2 ppm concentrations, text, and arrows added) for a few other locations are shown below.

But not only is the CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise AGW supposition dubious, so is the entire paradigm of an alarming and catastrophic human-caused sea-level rise future.
Consider Bangladesh.   According to Rashid et al. (2013), the mean sea level was “at least 4.5 to 5 m higher” 6,000 years ago than it is today.  At that time, CO2 levels ranged close to 265 ppm, or 135 ppm lower than today’s 400 ppm.   Not only that, but for the last 1,500 years, there has been no noticeable difference in the shoreline near Bangladesh — despite the rapidly rising CO2 levels during this period.

“[T]he highest RSL [relative sea level] transgression in Bangladesh at approximately 6000 cal BP, being at least 4.5 to 5 m higher than the modern m.s.l. [mean sea level]  After this phase, the relative sea level started to fall, and consequently, a freshwater peat developed at approximately 5980–5700 cal BP. The abundant mangrove pollens in the salt-marsh succession shows the regression at approximately 5500 cal BP, when it was 1–2 m higher than the modern sea level. The curve indicates that at approximately 5000 cal BP and onwards, the RSL started to fall towards its present position, and the present shoreline of Bangladesh was established at approximately 1500 cal BP and has not noticeably migrated inland since.”

It was recently pointed out that there are 4 newly published papers confirming that natural variability largely explains recent sea level fluctuations, not anthropogenic CO2 emissions.    Scientists also continue to publish papers (about 30 are compiled here) that indicate relative sea levels across the globe were often meters higher than they are now as recently as a few thousand years ago . . . when CO2 concentrations were much lower and anthropogenic CO2 emissions were non-existent.
In sum, scientists are increasingly finding that is difficult to even detect an anthropogenic signal in the noise of strong natural sea level variability spanning decades to millennia.  So at what point did it become “settled science” or “basic physics” that raising or lowering CO2 concentrations cause sea levels to rise or fall?

Prieto et al., 2016  (Argentina, Uruguay)
“Analysis of the RSL [relative sea level] database revealed that the RSL [relative sea level] rose to reach the present level at or before c. 7000 cal yr BP, with the peak of the sea-level highstand c. +4 m [above present] between c. 6000 and 5500 cal yr BP (depending on the statistical method used) or at c. 7000 cal yr BP according to the ICE-6G model prediction, gradually falling after this time to the present position … Particularly for the Río de la Plata (RDP), a Holocene RSL curve was presented by Cavallotto et al. (2004) based on 14 uncalibrated 14C ages from selected samples from the southwestern coast of the RDP (Argentina). This RSL curve was re-plotted by Gyllencreutz et al. (2010) using the same index points and qualitative approach but using the calibrated ages. It shows rising sea-levels following the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), reaching a RSL [relative sea level] maximum of +6.5 m above present at c. 6500 cal yr BP, followed by a stepped regressive trend towards the present (Fig. 2a).”

“Caspian Sea (CS) water level has fluctuated repeatedly with an amplitude of larger than 25m during the Holocene without any link with the eustatic sea level. …. The data from the Langarud sequence indicate that the CSL [Caspian Sea level] rose to at least −21.44m during that time (i.e. >6m higher than at present), as Langarud was probably not on the shore itself but was affected by distal brackish water flooding. This result is in line with historical findings about the CSL high-stand during the 14th and the early 15th centuries.  … This massive brackish water invasion would have caused a serious disruption to food supply to Persia.”

“In North Island locations the early-Holocene sea-level highstand was quite pronounced, with RSL [relative sea level] up to 2.75 m higher than present. In the South Island the onset of highstand conditions was later, with the first attainment of PMSL being between 7000–6400 cal yr BP. In the mid-Holocene the northern North Island experienced the largest sea-level highstand, with RSL up to 3.00 m higher than present.”

As a scientist, I bristle when lies dressed up as “science” are used to influence political discourse. The latest example is the global‐​warming disaster flick, _The Day After Tomorrow_.



This film is propaganda designed to shift the policy of this nation on climate change. At least that’s what I take from producer Mark Gordon’s comment that “part of the reason we made this movie” was to “raise consciousness about the environment.”



Fox spokesman Jeffrey Godsick says, “The real power of the movie is to raise consciousness on the issue of (global warming).”



‘Nuff said.



Oh, the plot. Global warming causes the Gulf Stream to shut down. This current normally brings tropical warmth northward and makes Europe much more comfortable than it should be at its northerly latitude. The heat stays stuck in the tropics, the polar regions get colder, and the atmosphere suddenly flips over in a “superstorm.” The frigid stratosphere trades places with our habitable troposphere, and in a matter of days, an ice age ensues. Temperatures drop 100 degrees an hour in Canada. Hurricanes ravage Belfast. Folks in Japan are clobbered by bowling‐​ball‐​size hailstones. If we had only listened to concerned scientists and stopped global warming when we could.



Each one of these phenomena is physically impossible.



Start with the Gulf Stream. Carl Wunsch, a professor of physical oceanography at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, knows more about ocean currents than most anyone. He thinks the nonsense in _The Day After Tomorrow_ detracts from the seriousness of the global‐​warming issue. So he recently wrote in the prestigious science journal _Nature_ that the scenario depicted in the movie requires one to “turn off the wind system, or to stop the Earth’s rotation, or both.”



The stratosphere will become the troposphere when all three laws of thermodynamics are repealed. Hailstones can’t reach bowling‐​ball size because their growth is limited by gravity. Hurricanes can’t hit Belfast because the intervening island of Ireland would destroy them.



How do I know so much about a movie that isn’t out yet? I’ve seen the promos, and I’ve read and reviewed the book upon which it is based, The _Coming Global Superstorm_ by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. In Strieber’s previous work, _Communion_ , he explained that he was told of the Earth’s upcoming apocalypse by aliens. And how this knowledge was communicated is much more the purview of an adult Web site than a family newspaper. What’s on the movie’s Web site is worse — nothing but out‐​and‐​out distortion.



It also insists that what is depicted on the screen has already started.



“Did you know,” says the site, that there were more tornadoes recorded in May 2003 than in any other month?



I looked up federal tornado statistics, and indeed they’re going up, and there was a peak in May 2003. Then I determined the number of radar stations and their type. When our first radar‐​tracking network was established in the 1960s and ‘70s, the number of tornadoes rose proportionally, then leveled off until the new Doppler radars came online in 1988. It took a decade to put this system in place, and the number of reported tornadoes went up accordingly.



Then I plotted the number of severe tornadoes. If anything, it’s going down. So the flashy Doppler radars are merely detecting more weak storms that cause little, if any, damage.



The Web site also implies that global warming is making hurricanes worse. Christopher Landsea, the world’s most aptly named hurricane scientist, has studied the maximum winds in these storms as measured by aircraft and finds a significant decline.



Global warming? Some scientists think climate change strengthens El Niño, the large atmospheric oscillation responsible for a variety of weather — both good and bad. El Niños are known to rip apart hurricanes. So it’s more likely that climate change is weakening these storms than enhancing them.



Will Godsick and Gordon get their way? They’re sure being aided and abetted by MoveOn​.org, the liberal advocacy group and billionaire George Soros’ policy toy. They’ve got Al Gore front and center, plumping the film. They’ve got their Web site using the movie to drum up support for legislation by Sens. John McCain, R‐​Ariz., and Joe Lieberman, D‐​Conn., to reduce carbon‐​dioxide emissions, which only failed by 12 votes last fall. There’s a huge drought out West, which a _New York Times_ editorial blamed on global warming. The issue is hot enough to influence votes out there.



Remember that humans have slightly warmed the planet some in recent decades, but the correlation between Western drought and warming is zero.



Far be it from me to criticize anyone’s freedom of expression. But remember that propaganda can have consequences. McCain’s and Lieberman’s measure mimics the United Nations’ infamous Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which many scientists know will do nothing measurable about planetary temperature within the policy‐​relevant future. But it will cost money.



This isn’t Hollywood’s first attempt to scare people into its way of thinking. How about Jane Fonda in the 1979 anti‐​nuclear‐​power flick, _The China Syndrome_?



Twelve days after its release, the accident at Three Mile Island occurred. Despite the fact that it released only tiny amounts of radiation, the politics of that hysteria effectively killed any new nuclear plant.



Analogize the Western drought to Three Mile Island, and you get the idea.



Or how about the 1983 movie _The Day After_ , whose purpose was to strengthen the nuclear‐​freeze movement. It failed.



 _The Day After Tomorrow_ is only one more day than _The Day After_ , and it deserves the same fate. Lies cloaked as science should never determine how we live our lives.

"PARIS  —   The ability of an   Iranian director to attend the Academy Awards ceremony next month has been thrown into question by President Trump’s order temporarily banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The director, Asghar Farhadi, whose film “The Salesman” is nominated in the best   film category, was not immediately available for comment. But early Saturday, Trita Parsi, director of the National Iranian American Council, based in Washington, said in a Twitter post: “Confirmed: Iran’s Asghar Farhadi won’t be let into the US to attend Oscar’s. He’s nominated for best   film. .. #MuslimBan” In a telephone interview hours later, Mr. Parsi said he had heard only second hand that Mr. Farhadi would not attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. Mr. Parsi said his intention with the message posted on Twitter was to show that under the new immigration policy announced on Friday, no Iranians would be allowed entry into the United States for 90 days. “The clarification of the law made it very clear that he can’t come, whether a green card holder or an Iranian citizen,” Mr. Parsi said of Mr. Farhadi, whose film “A Separation” won an Oscar for best   film in 2012. Mr. Parsi added that he had not meant to imply that the United States government had requested that Mr. Farhadi not come to the Oscars ceremony, but to call attention to the ban itself. “It is so stunning and shocking  —   so profoundly    —   that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it,” Mr. Parsi said. It was unclear whether Mr. Farhadi would request an exemption to the visa ban or be granted one by the United States government. Earlier this week, one of the stars of “The Salesman,” Taraneh Alidoosti, said in a message on Twitter that she would boycott the Oscars to protest the visa ban, which she called “racist. ” The ban was not policy at the time. “I decided not to go even if I could, because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students,” Ms. Alidoosti told The New York Times in an interview. The government of Iran approved the “The Salesman” for submission to the Academy Awards it is one of five films vying for best   film. The film tells the story of a couple in Tehran whose lives are upended when they move from one apartment to another while they are acting in an amateur production of “Death of a Salesman,” a play by Arthur Miller. In a statement, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it was “extremely troubling” that Mr. Farhadi and the cast and crew of “The Salesman,” could be “barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin. ” The Academy gives an allotment of tickets to distributors and representatives of all nominated films, who are responsible for securing visas when necessary. The proposed ban has affected those connected to other films. The Iraqi director Hussein Hassan withdrew his visa application to the United States, where he was expected to attend the United States premiere of his film “Reseba  —   The Dark Wind” at the Miami Film Festival, Variety reported."
"**The United Nations has expressed concern about possible war crimes after a threat by the Ethiopian army to start an assault on the northern Tigray region's capital.**
A deadline set by the government for fighters in the region to surrender is due to expire on Wednesday.
Fighting between the government and regional forces in Tigray has been going on for almost three weeks.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed and tens of thousands have fled.
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise East Africa.
The UN said it was alarmed by the threat of major hostilities if the Ethiopian army advanced on Tigray's capital Mekelle, home to about 500,000 people.
However, a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the fighting in Tigray ended without a statement, according to AFP news agency, with African countries reportedly requesting more time to allow for diplomatic efforts by the African Union to continue.
On Sunday, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed issued a 72-hour ultimatum to Tigray's forces, telling them to surrender as they were ""at a point of no return"".
But Tigray's forces have vowed to keep fighting, with their leader Debretsion Gebremichael saying they are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Meanwhile, Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a youth group from the Tigray region of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 civilians were killed.
The commission says the group stabbed, bludgeoned and burned to death non-Tigrayan residents of the town of Mai-Kadra with the collusion of local forces.
Human rights group Amnesty International first highlighted reports of a massacre in Mai-Kadra but was unable to confirm who was behind it, or exactly how many died.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, denied involvement, and called for an independent international investigation into the killings.
The conflict started after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons.
In response, Mr Abiy - a former Nobel Peace Prize winner - ordered a military offensive against forces in Tigray, accusing them of treason.
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed ""alarm at reports of a heavy build-up of tanks and artillery around Mekelle"".
She called on all sides to give ""clear and unambiguous orders to their forces"" to spare civilians.
""The highly aggressive rhetoric on both sides regarding the fight for Mekelle is dangerously provocative and risks placing already vulnerable and frightened civilians in grave danger,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I fear such rhetoric will lead to further violations of international humanitarian law.""
The rhetoric has been ramped up in recent days. On Sunday, the Ethiopian army said there would be ""no mercy"" for Mekelle's residents when its soldiers ""encircle"" the city.
Such talk could constitute a war crime, Ms Bachelet said.
Mr Abiy has repeatedly said the Ethiopian army would protect civilians in its campaign against forces in Tigray.
But Ms Bachelet said a virtual communications blackout in Tigray was making it difficult for the UN to monitor the human rights and humanitarian situation.
""Reports continue to emerge of arbitrary arrests and detentions, killings, as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of ethnic Tigrays,"" the UN said.
At least 40,000 refugees have already crossed into neighbouring Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
A couple sit looking pensive by the wall of the UN building in Hamdayit in eastern Sudan's Kassala region.
Smoke rising from a charcoal burner partially blurs their faces. The woman lines up tiny cups as she waits for coffee to boil in an earth kettle.
A traditional coffee ceremony is performed even in the worst of circumstances.
They've recently arrived at the transit camp, having fled from Tigray.
A young man interrupts this moment when he walks up to me. He worked as a customs official in the Tigray town of Humera but fled three days ago, he tells me.
I ask why he hasn't yet moved to the refugee camp further away from the border. ""I am waiting for my family,"" he says.
They are still trapped inside Tigray. Families have been torn apart by the conflict.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Analysts believe the conflict could be long and bloody given the strength of Tigray's forces."
"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."

Shane Jones is a bit of a rascal, and it is hard to fault him when he attacks Greenie Wombles. He’s given them a serve over opposition to a Wairarapa dam proposal:



[…] my colleague, the deputy leader of our party Fletcher Tabuteau the secretary – he’s been in Wairarapa doing something that’s overdue – announcing the seven-odd million dollar contribution to water storage and water proofing the Wairarapa.



Now this has attracted a great deal of criticism from Greenpeace. **I’ve had a gutsful of these aphid lovers. They don’t seem to understand in the hierarchy of economic, social, customary and environmental interests – human beings are never, ever going to play second fiddle to aphids.** I just really despair. This lobby with their well-organised, well-funded attacks on rural industries are getting worse and they seem to misconstrue where the Kiwi spirit is actually heading.



We all realise that the climate is changing and weather is becoming more difficult to manage, but unless we future-proof and start to store water and adapt to changing circumstances then it’s difficult to see how I as a politician can assist rural New Zealand.



So **every time Greenpeace bellows, I tend to do the opposite.**



Onya Jonesy, keep slapping the “aphid lovers”. He doesn’t hold back on Mike Joy either when asked about him by Hamish Mackay:



Look, I personally have never met this character Mike Joy. I know that he fell out with Prime Minister John Key. But he has no mandate to continue to stigmatise and demonise rural New Zealand. **He strikes me as some sort of Jerry Springer character. Some faculty fusspot who wants to enjoy the celebrity side of constantly being interviewed.**



I say to Mike Joy, **if you want politics, hang up your academic spurs and join the fray. Other than that, stop auditioning as some sort of university-orientated Jerry Springer character.** I don’t know the chap, but I like my scientists in the dispassionate form. Kind of like friends of the court.



 **The reason I’m losing confidence in a lot of the scientific commentary on environmental matters is they’ve become far too shrill and their agenda is to close down rural industries** – and **until my dying political breath, I will stand against them.**



So I don’t know the chap but **he certainly is a killjoy isn’t he** in terms of economic development.



There can be no misunderstanding there. But Jonesy continues against academics:



[…] look our ancestors created dams, obviously the Benmore Dam, that’s why we’re able to boast internationally that we’ve got clean, green energy in a huge proportion. So if we took his view, we would continue to allow all the water to flow down the rivers and into the Pacific Ocean.



Look the man is entitled to his view, but **his view in my view has no credibility in terms of future-proofing and boosting the sustainability of rural New Zealand**. I thoroughly understand that he’s got an academic background but **I find that a lot of academics – they’re not practical people.**



Spot on. Academics these days tend to be vocal against almost anything. They certainly seem to be a bunch of lemon-sucking negative people.



Dams have their place, but they have to make both economic and environmental sense. Jonesy is right, if Benmore was attempted today it would never get past the Resource Management Act. Ruataniwha in the Hawkes Bay was also different. That project never made economic sense, it also didn’t make environmental sense and worse still was going to require the stealing of a good part of protected Conservation land to benefit a small commercial group.



The one thing Greenpeace, **Mike Joy** and other politically active academics never tell us is what they would approve of. They always demand taxes, or bans or other miserable potential solutions to the worst things their fevered imaginations dream up. They almost always ascribe negative and pejorative descriptions of the people they oppose and the actions that are proposed. Mark my words, **Greenpeace** and Mike Joy will come out and label Shane Jones as being in the pockets of “Big Dairy”. They always use ‘Big’ to slander their opponents because usually, their ‘small’ ideas are simply to oppose for the sake of opposing. 



Occasionally it’s good to see them get a beat down.

Our friends at www​.real​cli​mate​.org and www​.ryanavent​.com have been taking shots at the statements in our ad, so I’d like to offer a little commentary.   
  
  
We make three factual assertions.   
  
  
First, we say that “surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest”. We cite Brohan et al., _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (2006 and updates) and Swanson and Tsonis, _Geophysical Research Letters_ , 2009. The first is the latest update of the East Anglia temperature history, which long has been the IPCC staple. It is the one most cited over the years by the IPCC because it was the first long history that contained much more than simply World Weather Records data updated with local records at the end of a month. At any rate, both it and other global histories indeed show modest warming, about 0.8degC from 1900–2000, and indeed it is episodic. Everyone (well probably almost everyone…there are some real people who don’t believe it is right) pretty much agrees that there are two periods of warming, 1910–45 and 1977–98, with a slight cooling in between and no trend after. If that’s not “episodic”, I don’t know what is. The Swanson paper in fact specifically quantifies these episodes. The paragaph near the end of it that says this may mean that warming will be faster than we thought was pure speculation. It could just have easily been argued (as I do) that the lack of recent warming more likely indicates that 21st century warming will be lower than forecast by oceanic feedback because lack of warming simply delays any water vapor amplification. Pure and simple.   
  
  
The second assertion is that, “after controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather events”. The citation is short — a note in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_ , by Pielke Jr. et al, 2005. The et al. numbers over ten other large‐​name scientists/​analysts, and the reference list is the important part. There are a large number of citations on climate‐​related damages for various places and/​or periods. We couldn’t list them all in this format, so we chose a single citation that could be consulted and an interested reader would find all the subsidiary supporting material.   
  
  
Finally we state that “the computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior”, citing Douglas et al., _International Journal of Climatology_ , 2007, which showed the major disparity between forecasts of the upper tropospheric tropical “warm spot”, a hallmark of greenhouse projections, and observations in the radiosonde record. Yes it is true that Santer et al. have published a lengthy rebuttal, but it is extremely dense and marks just another go‐​round‐​and‐​round over this issue. Douglas et al. have a response but it hasn’t been published yet. The debate will go on and on. Further, it is quite apparent from comparing midrange multimodel estimates from the IPCC to observed temperatures, and those indeed projected for coming years, that there is a signficant disconnect developing between the models and surface temperature. They simply don’t anticipate multidecadal periods without warming. Oh yes, since this has happened, all of the sudden models can be forced to “explain” it, but that’s not prospective. Instead, it is retrospective adjustment. Such work wouldn’t be performed if there weren’t something wrong.   
  
  
That’s more than enough to negate President‐​elect Obama’s statement that “The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear”!
"
"

There’s a very disturbing tendency among academics — though many people in policy fights do it — to dodge substantive debate by declaring, basically, “the other side is full of garbage so just ignore them.” You probably see it most glaringly about climate change — no one credible disagrees with Al Gore! — but I see it far too frequently regarding the possibility that government student aid, the bulk of which comes from Washington, is a significant factor behind college price inflation.   
  
  
Today, we are treated to this lame dodge in a letter to the _Washington Post_ from Terry Hartle, Senior Vice President at the American Council on Education, arguably the most powerful of Ivory Tower advocacy groups. He writes: 



Second, we must do away with one of the most persistent and pernicious myths of higher education: that increases in federal aid drive up the cost of college. Several studies, including two by the Education Department, show there is no link between federal student aid and tuition increases. But there are still those who would have people believe that modest increases in student aid programs are the driving force behind institutions’ decisions about tuition and fees.



I would love to put this “myth” myth to rest. Yes, as I discuss in my recent policy analysis, there are serious challenges in trying to _prove_ that aid fuels price inflation. Lots of variables affect what colleges charge; you need to study long time frames encompassing several business cycles; and you have to account for the fact that aid automatically rises when prices do. So while there is tremendous logical reason to think aid has enabled price inflation — former college presidents acknowledge as much, basic economics says subsidies drive up demand, etc. — like any social science there is no definitive proof.   
  
  
That sure as heck doesn’t mean, though, that there isn’t any research showing government aid driving price inflation, even if it doesn’t prove it. In addition to the incredibly powerful rational reasons to strongly suspect aid plays a big role in out‐​of‐​control college pricing, there is, indeed, empirical evidence. For the benefit of the whole debate I offer a smattering of it below, hopefully putting an end to the disturbing denial tactic employed by Hartle and others. Hopefully, but not likely.…

"**The leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups has been taken to hospital after being attacked.**
Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) lying in the street, covered in blood.
From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"".
Mass protests in support of greater democracy in the territory, which began in June, show no sign of abating.
The attack on Mr Sham came hours after the territory's leader suspended her annual address after being heckled in parliament.
The CHRF said he was set upon by a group of up to five hammer-wielding men in the Mong Kok district of the Kowloon peninsula, and left with head injuries.
It added that he was conscious as he was taken to hospital, and was in a stable condition.
It was the second time Mr Sham had been attacked since the protests began.
The CHRF linked the attack to government supporters, who are suspected of assaulting other pro-democracy activists in recent months.
""It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,"" it said in a statement.
Jimmy Sham is a long-time political activist in Hong Kong, mostly known for campaigning for LGBT rights.
In the anti-government protests he has been one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front, one of the non-violent protest groups behind several of the huge marches since June.
The group said it was applying for a police permit to hold a new march on Sunday.
Its recent requests have been rejected, while more hardcore activists have held protests in defiance of bans and clashed with police.
While still in hospital, Mr Sham released a statement on Facebook, saying the attack ""only enables me to connect even more"" with fellow protesters.
He also thanked the police for swiftly arriving to help him and urged them to find who was behind the assault.
Amnesty International urged the authorities to launch an investigation into the attack on Mr Sham.
""Jimmy Sham was left bleeding on the street and has been hospitalised with head injuries.
""Even in the context of increasing attacks on activists, this incident is shocking in its brutality,"" said the head of the rights group's East Asia regional office, Joshua Rosenzwei.
Opposition lawmakers disrupted the Legislative Council (Legco) session as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam tried to make her annual address.
After a first interruption, the session resumed only to be interrupted again.
It was then suspended - and a pre-recorded speech by Ms Lam was made available on the Legco website instead.
It was the first time a Hong Kong chief executive had been unable to deliver a policy address in the chamber.
It meant a controversial extradition bill - the trigger for the months of protests - could not be withdrawn formally.
During a news conference after the video address, Ms Lam rejected claims that her speech had ignored the demands of the protest movement.
But she said it was not the time to consider voting reform, while insisting Hong Kong did have freedom of speech and freedom of the press without Chinese interference.
Hong Kong is part of China but, as a former British colony, has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The government in September promised the bill would be withdrawn once parliament resumed but demonstrations continued.
Protesters are now calling for five key demands:
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past month and in every district, causing widespread disruption.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo far this week where I live here in the North German flatlands people have woken up to surface frost three times already. And although temperatures are forecast to be pleasant today under sunny conditions, the temperature will drop rapidly come weekend.

Joe Bastardi at his Daily Update here says it’s going to get “as cold as you’ll ever see it at this time of year”.
It’s going to get uncharacteristingly cold – not something we ought to expect after one hundred years of alleged accelerating global warming. In fact the 25-year trend in Germany shows spring arriving later and later – something the media will never tell us.
How icy is it supposed to get? German CHIP magazine here writes: “It sounds like a bad joke: This weekend it’s going to snow in many areas in Germany. Are we about to get hit by snow chaos in April?”

There is a little [graph, which is updated daily](https://globalcryospherewatch.org/state_of_cryo/snow/fmi_swe_tracker.jpg), that I have been watching for a couple of months now. It seems that the northern hemisphere has not yet gotten the memo about global warming melting all the snow.



The snow was all meant to have gone by now and yet this year the snow mass is well above average.



As you can see, the dotted line is the average snow mass for the years 1982-2012, the shaded area is ±1 standard deviation from the average and the red dots are the daily data for this northern hemisphere winter. Almost all of them above the one standard deviation line.



Note also the much earlier start with the dot in early October.



We know that “one swallow does not a summer make” but this clearly seems to be heading in the wrong direction from that predicted by the doomers.



With the sunspot cycle heading for a grand minimum, the future versions of this graph are going to be very interesting.

"**China's president has issued a warning against dissent, saying any attempt to divide China will end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"".**
Xi Jinping's comments came during a state visit to Nepal on Sunday, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.
He didn't mention any particular region but it was seen as a warning to Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing protests have been ongoing for months.
Peaceful rallies in Hong Kong again descended into clashes on Sunday.
Public transport stations and shops deemed to be pro-Beijing were damaged.
""Anyone who attempts to split any region from China will perish, with their bodies smashed and bones ground to powder,"" Mr Xi said, according to a foreign ministry statement issued on Sunday.
""Any external forces that support the splitting of China can only be regarded as delusional by the Chinese people,"" he said.
Since the start of the Hong Kong protest movement four months ago, China has blamed ""external forces"" for fuelling the unrest, and accused the US and UK of interfering in Chinese domestic affairs.
Xi Jinping has yet to make any direct comment on the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, so this will be seen as a rare and strong warning.
Beijing has so far said it believes Hong Kong's police force is capable of handling the crisis. But protesters fear Beijing could send in troops to end the violence on the streets.
This is widely seen as an unlikely scenario because of the serious consequences. Few observers believe China would repeat its 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, for examples where hundreds are believed to have died.
Hong Kong is a part of China, but has a high level of autonomy - it has its own legal and justice system and far more freedoms than people have on the mainland.
There has been growing anti-Beijing sentiment for some time, but the latest wave of protests started in June. It was triggered by a proposal to bring in a new law which would have meant criminal suspects could be sent to mainland China to stand trial.
Many were afraid this law could end up being used by the government in Beijing to persecute Hong Kongers who criticise it. Critics said it would undermine Hong Kong's judicial independence.
The government responded to the initial massive protests by saying the bill would be withdrawn, but by that point the protests had escalated.
The protesters now want their ""five demands"" to be met, which include full democracy for Hong Kong and an inquiry into what they say has been an excessive use of force by the police.
Protests have taken place every weekend since June and have happened in every district of the territory, causing widespread disruption.
More than 2,300 people have been arrested since the civil disobedience began.
On Sunday, several neighbourhoods saw rallies, and by the afternoon at least 27 stations on the MTR - Hong Kong's metro - were closed.
Police said they had used ""minimum force"" to disperse protesters, but television footage showed weekend shoppers caught in the chaos. Some were filmed screaming and apparently injured as officers rushed into a shopping centre.
Petrol bombs were thrown at Mong Kok police station, and one officer was slashed in the neck, authorities say. He is in a stable condition in hospital, the South China Morning Post reports.
Overnight on Sunday, one group of protesters hauled a three-metre-high (9ft) statue of a protester on to Lion Rock, a famous outcrop overlooking Hong Kong.
The statue, Lady Liberty, has become a symbol of the rallies, and sports a gas mask, goggles and a helmet.
She represents an injured protester who demonstrators believe was shot in the eye by a police projectile.
The group of several dozen, some wearing head lamps, climbed the 500m peak during a thunderstorm. The statue held a black banner that read: ""Revolution of our time, Liberate Hong Kong."""

Increasingly, federal monies have been disbursed to the various departments and agencies in support of the Obama administration’s politically strange perseveration on global warming. Specifically, many millions go out each month for “public outreach,” more properly labeled propaganda, on the horrors of climate change.   
  
  
To show how well‐​spent this money is, we draw attention to today’s posting from the Department of Energy’s communication director Marissa Newhall, featuring pumpkins with windmills (the correct name for “wind turbine”) and solar panels carved on them. A quote:   




Last week, we shared some energy‐​themed pumpkin carving stencils to help you “energize” your neighborhood—and teach trick‐​or‐​treaters about energy—this Halloween. On our own time after work, we put the patterns to the test and carved some energy pumpkins of our own.



We note that they didn’t say they created the “energy‐​themed pumpkin carving stencils” “on their own time after work.”

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations  
Environment Program’s climate body, has said for over a decade that there is “unequivocal” evidence that the planet is warming, and that the **temperature increase is “very likely” due to human-made greenhouse gas emissions.**



It is **unequivocal** that it is **very likely**.



Everything the IPCC says must be true as there is an appeal to authority further down the page:



The Panel is made up of 2500+ scientific expert reviewers, 800+ contributing authors,  
and 450+ lead authors from 130+ countries.



Can’t argue with those numbers!



So let’s check on the [principles governing](https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf) the IPCC shall we?



The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of **human-induced climate change,** its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. 



If one only looks for human-induced, aka man-made, aka anthropogenic, climate change, take a wild guess at what you are going to find.



Stacked deck, anyone?

Excerpt:
‘In recent years another Czech threat expert has been sounding the trumpet for freedom. Vaclav Klaus was born in Prague in 1941 and became an outstanding student in economics, graduating from the University of Economics in Prague in 1963. He was allowed to study abroad in Italy in 1966 and in the USA in 1969, where he came under the influence of Milton Friedman. In 1968 he was awarded his PhD from the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. From 1970 until 1987 he was kept under wraps in the State Bank of Czechoslovakia, but after the successful uprising of November 1989 he was appointed Federal Minister of Finance, and he became Prime Minister in June 1992. In February 2003, and again in February 2008, he was elected President of the Czech Republic.
‘The presidency is a non-executive role and so Vaclav Klaus has been able to immerse himself in the global warming debate. He has written a book entitled Blue, Not Green Planet, published in Czech last year and due out in English translation (as Blue Planet in Green Shackles) in the USA this May. He has spoken regularly on the issue at home and abroad. In February 2007 he was interviewed by a Prague journalist who took him to task for his refusal to accept the global warming thesis now hegemonial throughout Europe. Klaus was very blunt: “Global warming is a false myth and every serious person and scientist says so.”’

The U.S. economy is slowing down. Trends for all the major components of growth are now uniformly unfavorable: labor participation is falling, the pace of human capital accumulation is slackening, the rate of investment is in long‐​term decline, and growth in total factor productivity has been low for three of the four past decades. A sudden turnaround is always possible, but there are strong reasons for believing that U.S. economic growth in the coming years will fall well short of the long‐​term historical trend.



Progressives, conservatives, and libertarians have a strong common interest in reversing this growth slowdown. They may have different ideas about what to do with the extra money yielded by higher growth, but all sides have a stake in getting a chance to fight it out.



Agreement on ends, however, need not translate into agreement on means. Indeed, the U.S. political debate today is beset by intractable ideological conflicts over tax and budget policy, financial regulation, health care financing, and many other issues with a strong bearing on the climate for economic growth.



Despite today’s polarized political atmosphere, it is possible to construct an ambitious and highly promising agenda of pro‐​growth policy reform that can command support across the ideological spectrum. Such an agenda would focus on policies whose primary effect is to inflate the incomes and wealth of the rich, the powerful, and the well‐​established by shielding them from market competition. A convenient label for these policies is “regressive regulation”—regulatory barriers to entry and competition that work to redistribute income and wealth up the socioeconomic scale. This paper identifies four major examples of regressive regulation: excessive monopoly privileges granted under copyright and patent law; restrictions on high‐​skilled immigration; protection of incumbent service providers under occupational licensing; and artificial scarcity created by land‐​use regulation.



Although there are vigorous debates about proper policy in all of these areas, the contending sides are not divided along left‐​right or Republican‐​Democratic lines. And it’s not simply the case that one can find policy experts on both sides who favor reform. Rather, it’s very difficult to find disinterested experts anywhere on the political spectrum who support the status quo. Such support is largely confined to the well‐​organized lobbies that profit from the current rules.



Hence the title of this paper. For all who are interested in better long‐​term U.S. economic performance, rolling back regressive regulation is the low‐​hanging fruit. Reforming these policies is something we know will make a positive difference, and by “we” I mean the vast majority of disinterested experts. Unfortunately, though, this lowhanging fruit is guarded by “dragons”—the powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo, all of which can be counted upon to defend their privileges tenaciously.



Although opposition to progress would be formidable, pursuing an agenda of curbing regressive regulation would open up a new front in the ongoing policy fight. Instead of another left‐​right conflict, the contest could be framed as a choice between the public interest and vested interests. With an unprecedented deterioration in the long‐​term growth outlook now looking likely, this novel approach is well worth trying.

"WASHINGTON  —   With Twitter posts, leaks and executive orders, President Trump is moving quickly to show he will make good on some of his key campaign pledges. Within a   period this week, he ordered or signaled significant new policies on border security, terrorism, crime and voting. But as Mr. Trump’s predecessor learned in 2009 when he ordered the military prison at Guantánamo Bay closed, implementing policy is not as easy as the stroke of a pen. Details to carry out security policies exceed Twitter’s   limit and in some cases the public can only infer Mr. Trump’s plans. Here is what he has promised, and what authority he has to carry it out. No political promise came to symbolize Mr. Trump’s candidacy like his pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. The costs and logistical headaches of such a project  —   which would cut through private property  —   have always been daunting, but Mr. Trump’s supporters were unfazed: “Build the wall!” they chanted. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an order to build it and announced that work would begin immediately on a project that is estimated to cost more than $20 billion. He offered few details, including any that would address the fact that Congress, not the White House, writes the checks. The Antideficiency Act prohibits the government from spending money for any reason that Congress has not appropriated. The president can announce whatever plans he wants. But whether the plan is “build a wall” or “close Guantánamo,” if Congress does not go along, it can amount to wishful thinking. As one Republican lawmaker said of Mr. Obama’s 2009 order on Guantánamo, “This is an executive order that places hope ahead of reality. ” Mr. Trump, a real estate developer by trade, seemed undeterred. “We do not need new laws,” he said Wednesday. “We will work within the existing system and framework. ” While that appeared to mean that he intended to shift some already appropriated money to the wall’s construction, it was unclear where the funds would come from. He cannot easily cannibalize one program to pay for the wall. “It doesn’t work out like that,” said William C. Banks, a Syracuse University law professor. So is Mr. Trump’s executive order meaningless? Not entirely. The Department of Homeland Security can start planning and discussing the project now and ask for the bulk of the money later. And if Mr. Trump really wants to break ground immediately and avoid Congress, there is  —   as always in Washington  —   a workaround that would let him do so at least in theory. Two laws, the Economy Act of 1932 and the Feed and Forage Act, give the president some spending wiggle room. The Economy Act allows presidents to move money between departments in some circumstances. The Feed and Forage Act, first enacted in 1799, was intended to allow military leaders in the field to spend money on essential clothing and medical supplies. But presidents have used that power broadly. Former President George H. W. Bush started the first gulf war under that authority, Mr. Banks said. In theory, Mr. Trump could order the military to spend extra money to protect national security, then move around the funding within the bureaucracy to pay for a wall built by the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Banks said. But such an accounting trick has never been used to go around Congress on such a large scale, Mr. Banks said. Lawsuits would be inevitable. It would be much easier to simply ask Congress for the money. But for now, Mr. Trump gets to say he is making good on a political promise. And if Congress scuttles the plan later or lawsuits hold it up? “He can say he did his part,” Mr. Banks said. He compared the move to the playbook of former President Barack Obama: “It is very Obama. ” Mr. Trump is preparing an executive order that would clear the way for the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen overseas “black site” prisons. According to a draft of the order, Mr. Trump also intends to review the agency’s   interrogation program, in which interrogators tortured some suspected terrorists through waterboarding and extensive sleep deprivation. Other suspects were shackled in painful positions, doused with water and menaced with dogs. Mr. Trump can revoke the current ban on C. I. A. prisons, but it would take much more than his signature to restore the interrogation program. Federal law now restricts interrogation techniques to those authorized by the Army Field Manual. And unlike when the tactics were first authorized  —   when government lawyers said no   harm would come from the tactics  —   it is now clear that many prisoners suffered persistent psychological damage. That would make the program even more difficult to justify under   laws. Mr. Trump could try to ignore all this, saying he has the authority to do so as commander in chief. But his cabinet nominees seemed to reject that theory in their confirmation testimony. As a practical matter, reopening the secret prisons would require finding countries willing to host them. Those who did so for former President George W. Bush have faced a decade of investigations, lawsuits and recriminations. Mr. Trump threatened federal intervention in Chicago if the city does not address violent crime. Chicago saw at least 762 homicides in 2016, the highest figure in two decades  —   more than Los Angeles and New York combined. It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant by “feds. ” But Mr. Trump has wide latitude in this area. The Justice Department could dispatch more agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration to Chicago. In more extreme situations, presidents and governors have activated the National Guard, but usually to keep the peace during riots and unrest. In a series of Twitter posts, Mr. Trump reiterated his false assertion that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2. 8 million ballots only because undocumented immigrants and others voted illegally. There is no evidence of such widespread fraud (as Mr. Trump’s campaign lawyers have acknowledged) and Mr. Trump offered none. Nor did he say what sort of investigation he had planned. Voter fraud is a crime, so Mr. Trump may have been referring to an F. B. I. investigation. But the president does not have the authority to direct F. B. I. criminal investigations. Those require a criminal predicate, or reasonable suspicion. Generally, though, Mr. Trump has the authority to order a   investigation  —   call it a commission, task force or working group. That would allow the White House to make its findings public."

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden (D‐​Del.), recently claimed that an American‐​led nation‐​building effort in Central and South Asia is the long‐​term solution to the terrorism problem. For Biden, this nation‐​building effort should focus on changing the economic and social climate of Afghanistan and its neighbors, and include something akin to the Marshall Plan’s reconstruction of Europe after World War II. Besides setting an awkward precedent — that harboring terrorists will eventually bring new roads and heaps of foreign aid — Biden’s nation‐​building recommendation overlooks the obvious: Postwar Afghanistan will look nothing like postwar Germany, or for that matter, postwar Japan.



For starters, the high level of education and industrial know‐​how in postwar Germany and Japan helped launch an economic recovery in both countries that is inconceivable almost anywhere else. Germany also had a strong tradition of the rule of law, property rights, and free trade before the Nazi era. Japan’s elite embraced an honorific culture that respected and obeyed the wishes of the victor in battle. Afghanistan and its neighbors, in contrast, have little in the way of either liberal traditions or cultural attitudes that are agreeable to massive foreign interference.



What’s more, the leaders of Germany and Japan were not just utterly defeated in war. Their ideology was totally discredited in the eyes of their own people by war’s end. This made both countries prime candidates for nation building. It’s premature to assume the same pattern will hold for the leaders of the Taliban. Radical Islam could remain dominant, and its defenders could be seen as national heroes or martyrs.



Another probable difference: Even before World War II ended, the Germans and Japanese had become amenable to Washington’s policy prescriptions. In fact, according to University of Illinois political scientist Richard Merritt, by the time the war ended, substantial numbers of Germans “were disgusted by what the Nazis had done and increasingly realized that Nazi actions were not accidental but were consistent with and even prefigured by Nazi ideology.… To some measure, then, the American Military Government enjoyed a ready market for its product.” By the end of the war the Japanese, too, had become receptive to profound political change in ways not replicated since.



There’s little evidence the United States will enjoy a “ready market” for its product in Afghanistan. History, in fact, points in the opposite direction. The Afghans did not attack Moscow’s puppet regime in Kabul and fight a war with Soviet invaders in the 1980s because they wanted democracy, liberalism, and free markets. They did it because they opposed forces trying to secularize and modernize their country; i.e., nation build. This presents a major problem for those who would equate nation building in Afghanistan with nation building in postwar Germany or Japan.



Or take Biden’s idea of a Marshall Plan. It is telling that one has to go back more than 50 years to find an example of such a scheme that worked. Similar plans since then have routinely failed. Indeed, since World War II the United States alone has provided $1 trillion in foreign aid to countries around the world. The result? According to the United Nations, 70 of the countries that received aid are poorer today than they were in 1980, and an incredible 43 are worse off than in 1970. Good intentions must be matched by an effective, non‐​corrupt administration on the receiving end.



The failures are not so surprising if one studies the Marshall Plan experience in detail. If massive government spending could work anywhere, it was in 1948 Europe: Skilled labor was largely available, the rule of law and property rights had a long history, and the customs of a commercial society were recoverable. All it needed was physical capital. But even under those circumstances, there is no real evidence that the Marshall Plan alone was responsible for Europe’s regeneration. U.S. assistance never exceeded 5 percent of the GDP of any recipient nation, and there seemed to be an inverse relationship between economic aid and economic recovery. In fact, France, Germany, and Italy all began to grow before the onset of the Marshall Plan, and Great Britain, the largest recipient of aid, performed the most poorly.



The real lesson of the Marshall Plan is that the rule of law, property rights, free markets, and an entrepreneurial culture are what are necessary for economic success. Afghanistan has none of these things. And well‐​meaning senators in Washington can’t make it otherwise.

I have never known of a person who does so little and yet gets so many accolades. Jacinda Ardern, our laziest and most ineffective prime minister of all time has now been given yet another award. She has been named [‘Pacific Person of the Year’](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/face-of-the-day-110/)… although exactly what she has done for the Pacific to actually deserve this title is not exactly clear.



New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been named ‘Pacific Person of the Year’ by regional publication _Islands Business_ magazine. 



The magazine’s editor Samisoni Pareti said each year his publication attempted to look at the person, people or organisations that had made an impact on the Pacific. 



Pareti said Ardern was given the 2019 title because of [her work at the Pacific Islands Forum](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/115010777/australia-has-to-answer-to-the-pacific-on-climate-change-pm-ardern) to bring consensus around the issue of climate change. 



Ah right. She has been given the award for virtue signalling. She talked a lot about climate change at the Pacific Island forum but as we all know, she has done very little to actually help the islands. Well, I guess we give them a lot of money, but so does Australia. However, it would be a cold day in hell before they would have given that award to Scott Morrison, as he is – in their view – an evil promoter of fossil fuels.



So is China, with whom some of the islands are negotiating significant loans, but hey… what is that to do with anything? Let’s just hammer Australia, shall we?



“It was Prime Minister Ardern’s skills at negotiation, diplomacy and her charisma […] that saved the day for Pacific Island countries, Pacific Island leaders. 



Saved the day? How did she ‘save the day’? What exactly has she done to improve the lot of the Pacific Islands? Nothing, of course. It was merely ‘her charisma’. Yes, of course. The forum was a fashion shoot.



Pareti said her handling of the [Christchurch terror attacks](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2019/03/end-of-our-innocence/) was also commendable. 



Nothing to do with the Pacific Islands though.



“That really drew our attention to Prime Minister Ardern and from then on we started watching how she performed, not only in parliament but in her dealings with crisis and her own electorate and country.”



They have been watching her in parliament, protected by her henchmen, failing to answer any of the questions? That is when she is there. She is usually at some primary school, talking to children who don’t ask any difficult questions. They did well to find her in parliament at all.



PARETI SAID ARDERN HAD BEEN A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN TERMS OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE ISLANDS.



“SHE IS A YOUNG PERSON, SHE IS A WOMAN, SHE IS A MOTHER. SHE HAS GOT EVERYTHING THAT I GUESS ONE WOULD WISH UPON A PACIFIC ISLAND LEADER.



So there you have it. She got the award, not for doing anything remarkable, or for improving people’s lives, but because she is young, a woman and a mother. That’s it.



Just like all of her other accolades really. I hear she has been nominated for an Oscar this year too.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




Despite predictions of runaway ecological destruction, beginning in the 1970s, Americans began to consume less and tread more lightly on the planet. Over the past several decades, through technological innovation, Americans now grow more food on less acres, eat more sources of meat that are less land-intrusive, and used water more efficiently so that water use is lower than in 1970. The result: lands that were once used for farms and logging operations are now returning as forests and grasslands, along with wildlife, such as the return of humpback whales off the shores of New York City. As Jesse Ausubel elucidates in a new essay for Breakthrough Journal, as humans depend less on nature for the well-being, the more nature they have returned.



Ausubel’s full article is really well-worth a detailed look.   




Another look at our impact on the environment was presented by Cato Adjunct Scholar Alex Epstein during his conversation with Glenn Beck this week. Alex says, “Of everything I have ever done in front of a video camera, this appearance on Glenn Beck was my favorite.”   
  
Here’s an excerpt of the conversation a reported by TheBlaze.com:   




“This is a battle, not about green energy versus fossil fuels, but about anti-humanism and anti-impact,” Epstein asserted. “If your ultimate goal is to maximize human well-being, then you care about your environment as a means to maximize human well-being.”   
  
But Epstein said the green movement advocates minimizing human impact as its ultimate goal.   
  
“So let’s take the decision to build New York City,” Epstein said, offering an example. “If New York City was up for a vote today, does anyone believe that the environmentalists would yes? What about Chicago? What about the first hospital? What about any given baby? No. So the idea is that if humans have an impact, it’s bad.”   
  
Epstein said there is a “fundamental bias against humans” in the green movement, and “everyone has bought into anti-impact as an ideal,” when the philosophy really should be determining what has an “anti-negative impact for humans.”



Alex’s book is an excellent read and a persuasive case for how best to talk about global warming and the humanity’s contribution to it. If you don’t have a copy of it, You Ought to Have a Look!   
  
Our quest for energy is also the subject of Cato’s Johan Norberg latest documentary _Power to the People_. This program, which recently aired on PBS, is a look at the impact that energy (or lack there of) has around the world and the best ways that are available to meet this urgent need.   
  
The production quality as well as the informational content of _Power to the People_ is very high, and just watching the two minute intro—cleverly spliced together from Johan’s travels around the world—is almost certain to draw you into watching the entire program. A good thing—we promise! Have a look:   




And last, perhaps at least recognizing some of the above realities—that energy access/reliability/expansion (aka. economic development) is going to trump climate change concerns around the world—U.N. top climate officials continue to play down expectations of what is going to be achieved at the U.N.’s Climate Conference this December in Paris and its hopes of a meaningful international agreement to limit climate change. According to Reuters:   




Christiana Figueres, laying out her recipe for a deal meant to be agreed by almost 200 nations at a summit in Paris, said it would be part of a long haul to limit climate change and not an ""overnight miraculous silver bullet"".   
  
The looser formula is a sharp shift from the U.N.'s 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which originally bound about 40 rich nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions and foresaw sanctions that were never imposed even when Japan, Russia and Canada dropped out.   
  
Figueres dismissed fears by many developing nations, which have no binding targets under Kyoto and fear that a Paris accord due to enter into force from 2020 could force them to cut fossil fuel use, undermining economic growth.   
  
""The bottom line (is that) this is an agreement and a path that is protective of growth and development rather than threatening to growth and development,"" Figueres told an online news conference.   
  
The deal would be ""enabling and facilitating"" rather than a ""punitive-type"" agreement, she said. The deal's main thrust would be to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from gross domestic product growth.



At this point in time, being “protective of growth and development” is not going to lead to emissions reduction necessary to mitigate climate change to the degree or in the time frame envisioned by the U.N. But, regardless of any existence of international climate agreements, “growth and development” will lead to enhanced environmental protections—as today’s _You Ought To Have a Look_ articles attest.   
  
Rather than just being “protective” of growth and development, the U.N. ought to be encouraging it—which it could do better if it weren’t preoccupied with mitigating climate change.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
According to Gizmodo, Carbon Emission Trading is one of the five stages of grief.
“The interplay between the climate realities we likely face and the potential psychological fallout from them was the subject of a conference convened in Washington D.C., in March 2009,” write Lise van Susteren, MD, and Kevin J. Doyle, JD, introducing their work. “A highly respected group of experts offered insights. Their thoughts, recommendations and supporting evidence are presented in this report.”
“The Psychological Effects of Global Warming on the United States,” examines the hitherto undiscussed effects of increasingly prevalent extreme weather, sea level rise, drought and other impacts of climate change on mental health. How will we cope with a changing world?
“The incidences of mental and social disorders will rise steeply. These will include depressive and anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse, suicides, and widespread outbreaks of violence. Children, the poor, the elderly, and those with existing mental health disorders are especially vulnerable and will be hardest hit.”
…
The report’s findings are the subject of the first episode of Bill Nye’s new show, “Global Meltdown.”
He compares our gradual acceptance of the realities of global warming to the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
Denial and anger we see every day, in our politics. Bargaining we see with carbon emissions trading. Depression has become a well known problem for climate scientists. Acceptance? That’s where we need to be so that we can do something about climate change, even if much of its future impact is already guaranteed.
Read more: http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/12/200-million-americans-will-suffer-psychological-distress-from-climate-change/
I’m glad that greens are starting to admit carbon trading is a complete waste of money and effort, but I must say the prediction of a steep rise in psychological problems, is a bit like failed predictions that we shall be overwhelmed by hordes of climate refugees.
So far the only people getting depressed about climate change are green fanatics and climate scientists, whose obsession with the predictions of their broken models appears to be causing real psychological difficulties.
There is one source of future climate related psychological problems which concerns me – the ongoing efforts by green fanatics to infect school children with their depressing life view. Growing up is challenging enough; trusted teacher authority figures telling kids that they have no future, because the world is about to end, cannot be helping the children in their charge, to safely navigate their path to well adjusted adulthood.

"Calling your local lawmaker to express your opinion is generally seen as more effective than sending emails. But legislators have been experiencing such a high volume of calls from constituents recently that their voice mail inboxes have been filled to capacity. High on the agendas of callers: President Trump’s cabinet nominations and the flurry of actions taken in his first week in office. J. P. Freire, a spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday that the office had doubled its voice mail capacity in the past few months when it became clear that, with the new administration, “we were going to play an even larger role. ” “Certainly we have a high call volume,” Mr. Freire said. While he declined to comment on the topics discussed with constituents, he attributed some of the high volumes to Senator Hatch’s position on several congressional committees. With votes scheduled to take place on Jan. 31 on his nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and his pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, online campaigns promoting telephone activism are also picking up steam. Constituents and political activists are organizing to try and influence lawmakers’ votes on the nominations, and are tagging them on Twitter or Facebook if they are unable to reach staff members by telephone. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, took note of the feedback in her home state, California, with notes tacked onto her Twitter timeline by people trying to reach her and blaming telephone backlogs. At 10:17 Eastern on Friday morning, for example, no one picked up the telephone at the main number for the senator’s office in Washington. Two minutes later, when a call was placed to Ms. Feinstein’s San Francisco office, a recording said the voice mail box was full. The mailbox was still full at 1:17 p. m. But someone did pick up the phone at her office in San Diego, referring a reporter to a spokesman, said they were aware of the heavy call volume and were working on it. “All office lines in California and Washington are being answered, and voicemails are being taken down as quickly as possible,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, said in an email on Friday. “When phone lines are overwhelmed, we also encourage constituents to use the senator’s website to contact her online. ” This week, Concerned Student 1950, a student group  named in honor of the year the first black students were admitted to the University of Missouri, promoted a telephone campaign to oppose Mr. Sessions’s nomination. It published on Twitter a register of phone numbers for key legislators whose votes could be pivotal, along with advice on who was picking up the phone and who was not. People urged others on Twitter to use the   fax machine, to send emails or to reach out to their local legislators’ offices if phone lines on Capitol Hill were not being answered or if voice mail messages were no longer being accepted. Sometimes, residents expressed their displeasure about the jammed lines. Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, was the subject of protests in his home state this week by some constituents over what they said was their inability to contact their elected official by phone, The Durango Herald reported. “I just don’t understand why Cory Gardner is not responding to the people he’s supposed to represent,” said Gail Harriss, a Durango resident who was one of about 50 protesters who converged on the senator’s office. “Especially when time is of the essence with Trump’s nominees,” the newspaper quoted her as saying. Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Senator Gardner, said in a telephone interview on Friday that in the past week or two, the senator’s office had switched over to a system that has a “virtually unlimited” capacity that sends voice mail messages digitally to an email inbox that make it easier for staff members to work through the calls. Mr. Siciliano said later in an email: “Nothing is more important to Senator Gardner than providing the best constituent service possible to all Coloradans. Since January 1st, our office has received a large volume of emails and phone calls, and we have responded to more than 25, 000 letters and fielded thousands of phone calls. ” The Twitter timeline of Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, was littered with messages on Friday saying her phone lines were jammed. Ms Murray replied with an announcement telling people to send emails, instead. Taylor Haulsee, a spokesman for Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Friday that the office was busy fielding a high volume of calls from constituents with opinions about the nominees. Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said in a telephone interview that the office has received about 6, 000 calls this week and 5, 000 more voice mail messages, between the Washington, D. C. offices and the Seattle office. “Most of them are coming in about the nominees,” he said. “We have seven phone lines. If they are currently busy, then that person will be kicked to voice mail. ” He added, “For the most part, we are able to keep up and listen to as many people as possible. ” Perhaps the calls had some effect. Senator Cantwell announced on Thursday that she would not back Ms. DeVos’s nomination for education secretary."

A runaway JLENS aerostat highlights the uncertainty and risks of pie-in-the-sky green energy schemes.
JLENS blimp (US Army photo)
Guest essay by Tom Scott
One reason that a fragile naked human species has adapted to conditions in every corner of every continent is its ingenuity. Its is simply impossible to know the limits of homo sapiens. That said, one tactic of the green blob, used to rationalized the destruction of existing energy infrastructure, has been to throw out the possibility of one “free energy” scheme after another while ignoring or actively hiding the unknowns, risks, costs, and public dangers associated with each new proposal.
But first a quick review for those who did not see the news reports. On October 28th a 240 foot long (80 meter) aerostat, or tethered blimp, broke loose from its mooring and drug 6,700 foot of cable for some distance, apparently knocking out power for about 20,000 customers. This blimp was one of several in a multi billion dollar Federal system call JLENS. Two aerostats have been in service for less than a year in a Baltimore suburb, but this is at least the second time one of the devices has broken loose.
How could such a thing happen? At least one comment to the Baltimore Sun article referenced below was right on point.
“I worked on the PTDS (very similar) balloons in Afghanistan for a year and what they don’t tell you is that it’s not really the “wind” that makes them break free, it’s the slack and then sudden tension applied to the tether. You are NOT going to stop it. We lost millions of dollars worth of balloons over there.”
The JLENS aerostat operates on a 10,000 foot long cable. Consider for a moment some of the proposed power schemes wherein huge fleets of devices would float 20,000 feet overhead, tethered by 30,000 foot long cables, and collect/generate lots of “free” power.

What could possibly go wrong with that scheme? Not to mention the huge areas of airspace which must be confiscated from public use because of the cables and their swing and unpredictable catenary.

It would be impossible to make a blanket claim that pie-in-the-sky energy schemes could never work. And I applaud anyone who would apply intellect, hard work, and their own investor’s money toward innovative schemes. But a bird in hand is worth 100s of unproven ideas.
Until a concept is tested and proven by experience and a long operating record, and its costs and benefits are truly known, it can never be properly compared to a real production system, much less serve as a rationale for destroying existing infrastructure. If you think otherwise, I suggest you browse the past 90 years or so of “Popular Mechanics”, “Mechanics Illustrated”or “Popular Science” and then ask yourself why so many of those great-sounding ideas never made it past a drawing board and into everyday life.

These are meltwater streams and rivers on the surface of the western area of the Greenland Ice Sheet.CREDIT Dr Andrew Sole, University of Sheffield
From the UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH and the “note the soot on the ice in the image they included above” department:
Satellites shed light on Greenland Ice Sheet response to warming
Parts of Greenland’s ice sheet have been found to be less vulnerable to climate warming than was thought – a discovery that could have a small but beneficial impact on sea level forecasts.
Satellite images have revealed that despite dramatic increases in ice melt across Greenland in recent years, the speed of ice movement in some areas has slowed down rather than accelerated.
The finding, observed on a sector of the ice sheet that terminates on land rather than in the ocean, will help scientists improve predictions of how quickly Greenland’s ice will be lost in a warming climate.
Until recently, scientists thought that the increased volumes of meltwater from Greenland’s ice in response to climate warming would speed up the motion of all parts of the ice sheet by helping the ice slide more rapidly.
However, their latest study shows that in recent decades, ice movement in some areas that terminate on land has slowed down rather than accelerated. The discovery suggests that further increases in ice melting, fuelled by climate change, may further slow movement of these sectors of the ice sheet.
A team of researchers from the University of Edinburgh used satellite data to track the shift of ice features such as crevasses in an 8000km2 area of Greenland over three decades. They found that, despite a 50 per cent rise in meltwater from the ice surface in recent years, overall movement in the past 10 years was slower than in previous decades.
They found that this was caused by large amounts of meltwater produced in summer producing channels at the base of the ice sheet, which drain away water efficiently, slowing the glacier’s movement the subsequent winter.
Scientists say more research is needed to understand the movement of other parts of the ice sheet, which terminate in the ocean and which have seen acceleration in recent decades.
The study, published in Nature, was carried out in collaboration with the Université Savoie Mont-Blanc in France and the University of Sheffield.
Andrew Tedstone of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, who led the study, said: “A large sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down, despite sustained warming in the past decade. However, the ice sheet’s overall contribution to sea level rise continues to accelerate in two ways – through increases in surface melting and the movement of glaciers which terminate in the ocean.”

Guest essay by Dr. Norman Page

 1.  Introduction
Dr. Leif Svalgaard said in a comment on a WUWT post:
August 17, 2015 at 2:27 pm     

“If you cannot explain your finding to an [attentive] eight-year old, you don’t understand it yourself.”


I agree entirely.

Miriam – Webster defines Epistemology as


” the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge especially with reference to its limits and validity “



2.  Granddaughter – You asked – Is the world going to burn up and how do we know?
Ava – Lets  think about when  the temperature is warmer and colder outside. It is hotter when the sun shines during the day and colder at night when our part of the earth is turned away from the sun .You know already that it takes 24 hours for the earth to turn around once to make what we call a cycle from warm to cold and back again.
You also know that it is much hotter in summer than winter and that is because the sun shines longer   and is higher in the sky in summer than in winter. Each year there is a cycle  from warm to cold and back again which takes 365 days.Scientists have  measured or estimated in various ways what the earth’s temperature was  back for hundreds and thousands of years and  can see that there are other hot – cold cycles. Two of the most important ones have cycle lengths of about 60 and 1000 years. Here is a picture showing some of the 1000 year cycles.

Fig 1 (http://www.climate4you.com/)  -(See Humlum’s overview section)




To know what is going to happen in the future we first  have to know where the earth is in the 1000 year temperature cycle. Here is another picture that shows what the temperatures were in the northern part of the earth over the last 2000 years. Look especially at what happened during the last 1000 years.

Fig 2  http://www.clim-past.net/8/765/2012/cp-8-765-2012.pdf




See the warm peak at the year 1000 – then look where we are now at the right hand side of the picture. You can see that the earth is just getting near to, is just at or just past the peak warmth of a 1000 year cycle.
How can we tell which it is. We know that the amount of sunshine which reaches our bit of the earth often changes the temperature by tens of degrees between night and day and as much as 100 degrees sometimes between cold winter nights and the hottest summer days. We also know that the sun itself puts out more energy and its magnetic field is stronger at the activity peaks of its various  cycles.
What is the sun doing now? Here is a picture that shows us what has been going on.
You can see that sun itself also has cycles of activity of 11-12 years in length. When the red line gets nearer to the bottom of the picture the sun is more active, its magnetic field is stronger and fewer Galactic Cosmic Rays hit the earth.


Fig 3 ( http://cosmicrays.oulu.fi/       )



You can see that  solar activity was increasing , that is, the red line  got closer to the bottom of the picture, in each cycle until about 1991 and that the solar  cycle peaks and lows since then are closer to the top of the picture showing a decline in solar activity. This suggests that the 1000 year peak in solar activity may  now be behind us in about 1991.
Because it takes some time for the oceans to warm up and cool down, there is a delay before  the peak in solar activity  shows itself in the earth’s temperature. The best measure we have of global temperatures is made by satellites. Here is a picture of how temperatures have changed in the satellite age.

Fig 4


You  can see how the 1991 peak in solar activity in Fig 3 shows up in the peak in the average global temperatures  ( the green rising  and blue- falling lines) about 12 years later  at 2003 in Fig 4. and that the earth has been cooling slightly since then just as the solar activity declined from 1991 to today.

Ava – you ask.- What about the future.?
Well the simplest and most likely  guess for starters  is that the 1000 year cycle from 2003 – 3003 will have a temperature curve whose general shape is similar to the cycle from 1000 – 2003. see  Fig 2 .
If you look at that Figure again you can see that the Northern Hemisphere average temperature cooled by a bit under 2 degrees from 1000 to about 1635 so that we might expect a similar cooling from 2003 to 2638 – of course with various ups and downs along the way .
The warm peak at about 1000 was a good time for people when the Vikings were able to live  in Greenland.  Harvests  were good and  people in Europe had time  and money to spare to start building cathedrals  The cold period around 1635 – to 1700 is called the Maunder Minimum when the Sun was so quiet that the Sun  spots disappeared. Most people living before about 1850 grew their own food. Before then, if  just a few extra- cold years followed one after the other, millions of people starved to death because their harvests failed.
Man made CO2 had no effect on these temperature changes. In fact President Obama is very wrong to call CO2 a pollutant. It is the absolutely essential plant food. Without it life as we know it could not exist. Plants grow better as CO2 increases. About 25% of the increase in food production in the 20th century was due simply to the increase in CO2 in those years –  a great benefit to mankind.

Ava asks – the blue line is almost flat. – When will we know for sure that we are on the down slope of the thousand year cycle and heading towards another Little Ice Age.

Grandpa says- I’m glad to see that you have developed an early interest in Epistemology. Remember ,I mentioned the 60 year cycle, well, the data shows that the temperature peak in 2003 was close to a peak in both that cycle and the 1000 year cycle. If we are now on the downslope of the 1000 year cycle then the next peak in the 60 year cycle at about 2063 should be lower than the 2003 peak and the next 60 year peak after that  at about 2123 should be lower again, so, by that time ,if the peak  is lower,  we will be pretty sure that we are on our way to the next little ice age.
 That is a long time to wait, but we will get some useful  clues a long time before that.Look again at the red curve in  Fig 3 – you can see that from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 solar activity dropped to the lowest it has been for a long time. Remember the 12 year delay between the 1991 solar activity peak and the 2003 temperature peak, if there is a similar delay in the response to lower solar activity , earth  should see a cold spell from  2019 to 2021 when you will be in Middle School.
It should  also be noticeably cooler at the coolest part of the 60 year cycle – halfway through  the present 60 year cycle at about 2033.
We can watch for these things to happen but meanwhile  keep in mind that the overall cyclic trends can be  disturbed  for a time in some years  by the El Nino weather patterns in the Pacific and the associated high temperatures that we see in for example  1998 and 2010  (fig 2) and that we might see  before the end of this year- 2015.

3. Ava says -It looks like the Earth is going to cool down- Why is my teacher and  President Obama saying the earth is going to get very hot and the Polar Bears are all going to die
unless I walk to school ?

Well Ava – I would have to write a book to explain how so many different people came to be so wrong for so long about so much- sometimes with the best of intentions. Here is a short story telling what happened.
In 1968 a man called Ehrlich published a book called the Population Bomb. He thought the number of people on earth was growing so fast that there soon wouldn’t be enough food to feed everybody, He said in the book.
“ In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate” 
Some people at the time got very worried and put their guesses about such things as future population growth, food production ,oil supplies, industrial production and mineral reserves into a computer program.. They intended to look at possible future problems and also  explore the possibility  that the peoples and governments of the earth could agree on a way of running the worlds economy  that could besustainable, that is, go on for a long time. They put all this in a book called The Limits to Growth published in 1972.
 A very energetic business man called Maurice Strong who knew a lot of very influential people persuaded the United Nations that, as he himself believed and indeed still strongly believes,  this sustainability problem was very serious.The UN and Sweden organized a meeting in 1972 in Stockholm to discus the interaction of humans with the environment. Strong was appointed  by his UN friend U Thant , to be  the General Secretary of the meeting. Strong,  by nature, is very determined and action oriented and he and the conference produced an incredibly detailed 109 point  action plan designed to give the UN input and even control over individual Government environmental  policies world wide. As  one of the actions, the United Nations Environmental Program  ( UNEP) was organized in 1973 with Mr Strong himself as Executive Director.
Ten years later it was obvious that the predictions of imminent death and disaster were wrong. The people at UNEP still wanted to take global control of the worlds economy. They realized that if they could show that the CO2 ( carbon dioxide) produced by burning coal and oil to make electricity and drive our cars might cause a dangerous warming of the earth they would  be able to scare the Governments and people into writing laws giving the UN ( and them) control over the world’s economy by controlling the type of energy used and its price.
UNEP organized a meeting of scientists at a place called Villach in Austria in 1985 to see if they could show that CO2 was dangerous. The scientists said

“Although the observed global-scale warming experienced over the past ~100 years is compatible with model estimates of the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, unequivocal, statistically convincing detection of the effects of changing CO2 and trace gas levels on climate is not yet possible. An important problem in the positive identification of a greenhouse gas effect on climate is to explain the medium to long time scale (~decades or more) fluctuations in the past record. Attempts to model such changes have, to date, suffered from a number of deficiencies.”

Ava – In other words they couldn’t prove  any effects of man made  CO2 on climate.

But whoever  wrote the official summary statement and recommendations said:

“As a result of the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it is now believed that in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history. “

The report made two important recommendations. As a result of one ,the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was set up to select from the  evidence and from time to time produce reports which would show that CO2 was the main driver of dangerous climate change and a second recommendation resulted in a meeting in Rio in 1992 chaired by Maurice Strong himself which produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , later signed by 196 governments.
The objective of the treaty is to keep greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that they guessed  would prevent dangerous man made  interference with the climate system.
This treaty is really a comprehensive, politically driven, political action plan called Agenda 21 designed to produce a centrally managed global society which would control every aspect of the life of every one on earth.
It says :
“The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the
causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or
irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing
such measures”

In other words if the models show there  is even a small chance of very bad things happening the Governments who signed the treaty should act now  to stop it. But how good are the  computer Models?
The successive five  reports of the IPCC  in the Summaries for Policymakers written by Government representatives  have clamed increasing certainty for the outcomes of their Model based projections  of future temperature which is not supported by  the Science sections of the reports or the actual data.
Remember the Villach meeting said
 “in the first half of the next century a rise of global mean temperature could occur which is greater than any in man’s history.”
All the models and projections made since 1985  were built in the assumption that CO2 was the main climate change driver- for that and for many other reasons they are in reality useless for forecasting future temperatures.
Here is a picture of what really happened as CO2 levels rose rapidly in the 21st century





As you can see there has been no global warming at all since about 1997.

The climate models on which the entire Catastrophic Global Warming delusion rests are built without regard to the natural 60 and more importantly 1000 year cycles so obvious in the temperature record. The modelers  approach is simply a scientific disaster and lacks even average commonsense .It is exactly like taking the temperature trend from say Feb – July and projecting it ahead linearly for 20 years or so. They back tune their models for less than 100 years when the relevant time scale is millennial. This is scientific malfeasance on a grand scale.
 The temperature  projections of the IPCC –  UK Met office models and all the impact studies which derive from them have no solid foundation in empirical science being derived from inherently useless and specifically structurally flawed models. They provide no basis for the discussion of future climate trends and represent an enormous waste of time and money.  As a foundation for Governmental climate and energy policy their forecasts are already seen to be grossly in error and are therefore worse than useless.
 Here is a picture which shows the sort of  thing  they did when they projected a cyclic trend in a straight line..



 

 A new forecasting method needs to be adopted. For forecasts of the timing and extent of the coming cooling based on the natural solar activity cycles – most importantly the millennial cycle – and using the neutron count and 10Be record as the most useful proxy for solar activity check my blog-post at
 http://climatesense-norpag.blogspot.com/2014/07/climate-forecasting-methods-and-cooling.html
(Section 1 has a complete discussion of the uselessness of the climate models.)

“In the Novum Organum (the new instrumentality for the acquisition of knowledge) Francis Bacon classified the intellectual fallacies of his time under four headings which he called idols. The fourth of these were described as :
Idols of the Theater are those which are due to sophistry and false learning. These idols are built up in the field of theology, philosophy, and science, and because they are defended by learned groups are accepted without question by the masses. When false philosophies have been cultivated and have attained a wide sphere of dominion in the world of the intellect they are no longer questioned. False superstructures are raised on false foundations, and in the end systems barren of merit parade their grandeur on the stage of the world.”
Climate science has fallen victim to this fourth type of idol.

In the September/​October issue of _Renewing American Civilization,_ Frank Gregorsky, while suggesting that Gingrich probably has read some Hayek, maintains that other books offer a better understanding of the professor turned-Congressman’s mind. At the top of the list: science fiction author Isaac Asimov’s epic Foundation trilogy. Since the top Republican is quick to pass out reading lists to college and Congressional freshmen alike, this battle of the books merits serious attention.



 **Hayek’s Order**



F.A. Hayek was perhaps this century’s greatest classical liberal thinker. His insights into the nature of free societies helped to preserve the West as it indulged in socialist and welfare state policies, and are key to restoring it to healthy freedom.



A first crucial insight of Hayek and other classical liberal thinkers is that the actor and unit of analysis for any study of human history, society, or institutions is the individual. Society is constituted by aspects or priorities in the action of individuals that are shared with others. There is no collective entity, be it material, dialectic, Weltgeist, or historical wave apart from individuals.



A second Hayekian insight concerns the nature of order. Most people conceive of order in the world as falling into one of two categories. First trees, mountains, and solar systems arise and evolve naturally. Second, watches and tables, statues and rockets result from intentional human planning and action. This latter conception gives rise to the belief among socialists and statists that all‐​wise, caring bureaucrats can plan and benevolently guide economies to prosperity, and among social conservatives that censors and vice squads can create civil societies.



But Hayek identifies a third type of order: spontaneous order that arises from human action but is not specifically planned by men. A classic example of this type of order is money. In primitive societies, individuals might need to travel long distances to trade with one another. But it is difficult and costly to tote four cows, seven bales of hay, and a slab of copper over a mountain, all to be exchanged for a dozen sheep, six large jars of barley, and a handful of gold nuggets. Many merchants hit on the strategy of trading their goods simply for those small yellow pieces of metal rather than sheep, which tend to wander off, and the rest of it. Gold is easy to transport, difficult to counterfeit, durable, rust‐​resistant, and easily divisible. Traders can take the metal home to exchange for what they really need. Thus as individuals sought to exchange goods more efficiently, the institution of money emerged and became an economic institution as an unintended consequence. No one invented it.



A third Hayekian insight, best seen on the market, concerns the limits of individual knowledge. It is impossible for any individual to know what mix of goods and services will best satisfy consumer needs, what prices goods, services and labor should fetch, and which individuals are most efficient at performing particular jobs. As with science and other human institutions, the market is a discovery process with workers and owners, merchants and manufacturers— entrepreneurs all—experimenting to determine what they can offer in trade to others to maximize their own values.



What Hayek’s insights imply is that at best men can glimpse the probable outcomes of proposed public policies. For example, a welfare system that pays people not to work and punishes productive people will produce a lazy and unproductive population. Attempts to use political power to manipulate entire systems will result in adverse, unintended consequences; most certain, political power rather than mutual consent and free exchange will become the social coin of the realm



Hayek thus maintains that individuals in a society would do best to establish very general rules, protecting individuals from assault, theft, fraud and the like, and leave individuals free to work out the best ways to meet their various needs and the challenge of life.



 **Foundation and Fallacies**



Hayek’s views can be contrasted with some of those presented in fictional form by Isaac Asimov. Asimov is one of the all‐​time greatest science fiction authors. At his best he is highly imaginative, with an intelligent style and well‐​integrated plots.



The first three Foundation novels, written in the early 1950s, trace the decline of the Galactic Empire. To save humanity, the brilliant Hari Seldon develops the science of psychohistory, which can predict the behavior of masses of human beings. Seldon engineers the establishment of a Foundation on the planet Terminus, isolated at the edge of the Galaxy, to serve as the core of a second Galactic Empire a thousand years in the future. After various crises over the ensuing centuries, the prerecorded image of Seldon appears to explain what had just occurred and to ensure them that history was preceding according to the Seldon Plan.



The events in the first three Foundation novels contain aspects of spontaneous order and unintended consequences. For example, Asimov’s description of an Empire growing stagnant, corrupt and repressive, weighted down by heavy bureaucracy, certainly rings true.



In another example, after the periphery of the Galaxy breaks away from the Empire, the region’s strongest planet seeks domination over defenseless Terminus. But other, weaker armed worlds in the region also fear attack. A clever Terminus mayor plays the planets off one another in a classic balance‐​of‐​power strategy to preserve his planet’s freedom. Terminus, over centuries of history predicted by Seldon, at various times uses religion and economic manipulation to stave off attacks and rise to dominate its sector of the Galaxy.



But in his fictional universe, Asimov conceded that perfect prediction was not possible. He hides in the Galaxy a Second Foundation of psychohistorians as guardians of the Seldon Plan. They possess powers to detect and manipulate human emotions, and intervene to place the Plan back on course when it strays.



Asimov’s fiction reflected two fundamental premises of 1950s liberalism: (1) social and economic sciences can predict the future of a society; and (2) philosopher‐​kings with knowledge of how societies can or should work should rule. Hayek calls such premises fatal conceits.



Starting in the early 1980s Asimov added four more Foundation novels to the original trilogy. In these he shows the Seldon Plan collapsing and a nascent collective galactic consciousness as the only hope for a peaceful human future. This reflects the New Age mysticism that is still festering in popular culture. From a science fiction perspective the device had its place in Asimov’s work. But clearly it provides no useful insight into political and social reality.



 **Toffler’s Constitution**



Asimov’s faulty premises are also found in part in the works of Gingrich’s favorite futurists, “Third Wave” theorists Heidi and Alvin Toffler. The Tofflers maintain that human history’s first great wave of advance was the agricultural revolution some 10,000 years ago, with the second wave, the industrial revolution, beginning some 250 years ago. Men are now moving into the third wave, the information revolution. So far, so good.



But the Tofflers maintain that futurists such as themselves were able to predict this coming wave, and will be able to accurately predict about tomorrow. Yes, some have glimpsed trends 20 or 30 years out. Some have seemingly seen centuries ahead. Da Vinci attempted to invent a submarine and flying machine. Jules Verne saw men traveling to the Moon. Yet just as many predictions have been wrong as right. Perhaps one could argue that the head of IBM who, in the 1950s. maintained that the country would never need more than five or six computers, was not, after all, a college trained “futurist.” But surely a capitalist has a strong incentive to predict correctly.



Even granting that some futurists are better than others, how do men in society separate the best from the worst or, to put it in contemporary parlance, a good operating system from a computer virus? The only way, as with products, ideas, or institutions, is through competition in a free, open society—Hayek’s way.



This does not suggest that it is a useless enterprise to try to determine, however imperfectly, what the future will bring. It does, however, call into question the role that the government should play in helping the third wave along. While the Tofflers openly distinguish themselves from Gingrich on a number of issues, the futurists seem to accept a more active role for government than would others on the right of the political spectrum.



The Tofflers, for example, would amend the U.S. Constitution, which they say is a second‐​wave document. They are not clear about just what must be changed. But which Constitution are they talking about? The one we study in high school has long since been eroded. The tenth amendment which states that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or the people” has been inoperative for many decades. Article I, which lists the limited powers given to the federal government, also gives the U.S. Congress the exclusive power to make federal laws. But for decades Congress has abrogated this power, giving broad and open‐​ended mandates to un‐​elected bureaucrats in federal agencies who then, in effect, make laws. America has a government of would‐​be philosopher kings, the kind of which the Tofflers might approve.



A Hayekian approach suggests that the country return to the original Constitution of limited federal powers, with more responsibilities left to the states, localities and, most important, most freedom left to individuals. Such a system is best able to deal with the future complexities.



 **Connecting Technologies**



Those who are intrigued by the future but who want a Hayekian perspective on things to come would do well to consult the popular science works of James Burke. In his television series and accompanying books “the Day the Universe Changed” and “Connections,” Burke traces the development of television to telecommunications, aircraft and atomic weapons. He shows how seemingly unrelated events and inventions build on one another to produce unpredictable results. He shows how the silk loom and the 1890 U.S. census helped give birth to the computer, how gaslights and the American Revolution were responsible for raincoats, and hoe Italian Renaissance water gardens contributed to the invention of the internal combustion engine.



Consider an example of Burke’s connections. In Florida in the 1830s John Gorie experimented with curing illnesses believed to be caused by “bad air,” from whence we get the word malaria. Since tropical diseases do not occur in winter or in cold climates, he reasoned that cold air was the answer. (It wasn’t) To avoid the high costs of obtaining ice cut from lakes and stored in New England during winters for shipment South in the summer, he used the fact that compressed air heats up and reducing compression cools air to produce air conditioning.



Later in that century, Germans sought a way around the fact that their bottom‐​vat brewing of beer required very cold temperatures and thus could only be done in the winter. Using Gorrie’s piston approach, as is found in Von Linder compressed ammonia. The result: refrigeration as is found in nearly every kitchen today.



But to refrigerate and keep liquefied large quantities of ammonia and other gasses for industrial use, James Dewar, knowing that a vacuum does not transmit heat or cold, invented a flask with two walls containing a vacuum in the space between. The resulting thermos bottle is found in millions of lunch boxes.



Finally, Robert Goddard in the United States, and in Germany Herman Oberth with his young protégé Werner von Braun essentially burned huge quantities of liquid hydrogen with oxygen, both stored in what amounted to giant thermos bottles, to produce the type of rockets that eventually lifted off from Florida and landed on the Moon.



Burke’s review of the actual history of science and technology confirms the basic Hayekian insights. First, knowledge is always uncertain. Experimentation best facilitates progress. Predictions about the unintended consequences of particular discoveries are impossible. Second, advances usually come as individuals, doing their best in the face of uncertainty, trying to solve a particular challenge facing them, build on the works and discoveries of the past.



 **Future Philosophy**



The fascination on the part of Gingrich and others with the future and with science and technological innovation is in keeping with the American tradition. But equally part of this tradition is the freedom of individuals to act in entrepreneurial manners.



While it is not possible to predict specifics of the future, it is possible to determine which institutional arrangements best allow for change in the face of uncertainty and innovation in the face of needs. The genuinely forward‐​looking policy‐​maker should look to Hayek. This thinker, born in the last year of the 19th century, is a true philosopher of the 21st.

That climate change is sneaky, it hides the ‘damage’ via ‘weather variations resulting from climate change’ in record high soybean yields, as seen in this graph I located from Kansas State University:
Color me unimpressed with this press release, which boils down to nothing more than a statement of “we could have had a better year if the weather was better”.

Climate change costing soybean farmers
Form the University of Wisconsin-Madison
MADISON – Even during a good year, soybean farmers nationwide are, in essence, taking a loss. That’s because changes in weather patterns have been eating into their profits and taking quite a bite: $11 billion over the past 20 years.
This massive loss has been hidden, in effect, by the impressive annual growth seen in soybean yields thanks to other factors. But that growth could have been 30 percent higher if weather variations resulting from climate change had not occurred, according to a study by University of Wisconsin-Madison agronomists published last month in Nature Plants.
“We are still making yield gains because of breeding and other strategies, but those numbers aren’t as big as they could be,” says lead author Shawn Conley, a UW-Madison agronomy professor and UW-Extension soybean and wheat specialist.
Averaging the data across the United States, researchers found that soybean yields fell by around 2.4 percent for every one-degree rise in temperature. In Wisconsin and most other northern states, including South Dakota and Minnesota, the changes in climate factors actually led to higher soybean yields. Wisconsin, for instance, saw an increase of 17.5 kilograms per hectare per year over the 20 years studied. However, most soybean-growing states farther south, including Ohio, Arkansas and Kentucky, experienced decreases in yields.
These divergent responses have to do with historical norms. In colder northern states, soybeans seem to be enjoying the new warmer weather, while in states farther south – where conditions had previously been fairly ideal – the additional heat is causing stress.
Conley’s team isolated the impacts of changing temperature and precipitation on soybean yields in a much more precise way than previously done. While earlier approaches relied on estimates, UW-Madison researchers gathered their own data field trials, giving them access to more reliable and consistent information about the genetics of the soybeans being grown, the management practices being used and the weather the fields saw throughout the growing season. Spyridon Mourtzinis, a post-doctoral fellow in Conley’s lab, then removed the effects of the management strategies and genetic improvements so the team could focus their analysis on the impacts of weather variability.
Because the states with the biggest yield losses are also the nation’s biggest soybean producers, the national impact comes out to a 30 percent yield loss overall.
Conley says that the next step is to help growers minimize this loss by starting or expanding practices such as earlier planting, no-till practices and growing later maturing soybeans. Researchers can help by producing region-specific suggestions that account for weather patterns at different times of the growing season.
Only then, says Conley, can the full potential of soybean yields be realized.

"A group of Australian and New Zealand organisations and scientists today called on the governments of Australia and New Zealand to set up an Australia New Zealand Royal Commission on the Science of Global Warming (to be known as “The ANZIG Royal Commission” – the Australia New Zealand Inquiry into Global Warming).
The chairman of Australia’s Carbon Sense Coalition, Mr Viv Forbes, said that many groups and individuals in Australia and New Zealand had listened with alarm and disbelief to plans of both governments to saddle their people and industries with the burdens of carbon taxes and the risks of carbon trading which he described as “an open invitation to massive fraud”.

By Michael Krueger 
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Germany’s Federal Ministry for Commerce And Energy (BMWi) presents a brochure every year with the feed-in act in figures. The brochure lists the costs of the Energiewende (energy transition) in detail. Germany’s EEG feed-in act total subsidy for supporting the Energiewende and expanding renewable energies in 2014 cost approx. 24 billion euros. In 2015 the cost is projected to be some 27 billion euros. From the BMWi figures, it is clear that the major cost driver in Germany’s Energiewende is photovoltaic power.
The following table lists the photovoltaic (PV) power produced in the years 2000-2015 (which was subsidized by the EEG), the average EEG subsidy per kilowatt-hour of solar energy 2000-2015, and the total EEG subsidy for solar energy for PV power ín billions of euros 2000-2015.
The total EEG subsidies paid for PV power rose from 0.015 billion euros in 2000 to almost 11 billion euros in 2015! This is increase is completely due to the installation of total PV capacity shown by the blue bars in the following chart.

The red bars in the above chart show the total subsidies paid each year for PV power. 2015 will see close to 11 billion euros paid in subsidies to support solar power. The heavy black line shows the amount of new installations. New PV installations have trailed off since subsidies for solar energy were scaled back in 2012.

Total installed photovoltaic capacity in Germany has risen from 1 GW in 2003 to almost 40 GW today. The average EEG subsidy for PV power has fallen from 50 cents per kilowatt hour to 30 cents today. Thus the addition of PV capacity continues to surpass the significantly reduced EEG subsidy for PV power, which means total subsidies doled out continue to rise.
With 11 billion euros, PV is the major cost driver of the Energiewende, and accounts for 40% of the total EEG subsidies of 27 billion euros to be paid out this year.
For the 11 billion euros in subsidies, about 1 billion euros of power is actually marketed. That means the subsidies cost a net 10 billion euros annually, which power consumers are forced to pay. That turns out to be about 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. For an average household that means about 90 euros per year in extra costs.
For the photovoltaic producers, it’s a great business: Many get 50 cents per kilowatt hour (guaranteed 20 years) while the same kilowatt gets sold for only 3 to 4 cents on the market.

"**A Hong Kong student has died after falling during protests on Monday - sparking impromptu protests and vigils from pro-democracy activists.**
Alex Chow fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation to clear the area on Monday morning.
The exact circumstances of his fall are unclear, but reports say he was trying to get away from tear gas.
The 22-year-old's death came after another week of political violence in Hong Kong.
On Wednesday a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a person pretending to be a supporter.
Mr Chow had been in a coma since Monday and was certified dead early on Friday, according to the hospital he was treated in.
Fellow students at the city's University of Science and Technology called for an investigation into how Mr Chow fell, and why it took paramedics nearly 20 minutes to arrive. Amnesty International echoed that call.
At the time of his fall, dozens of riot police were approaching, firing tear gas into the car park and surrounding areas to clear away protesters.
Police said they used tear gas to disperse protesters near the site but denied any wrongdoing, saying their actions had been justified.
But Mr Chow's death is expected to fuel more anger at the police, who are already under pressure as Hong Kong faces its worst crisis in decades.
""Today we mourn the loss of the freedom fighter in HK,"" Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy campaigner, said on Twitter. ""We will not leave anyone behind - what we start together, we finish together.""
Protesters gathered across the city, taking part in mourning events. Thousands left flowers at the spot in which he fell at the car park. Some people sang hymns.
A 23-year-old student, who said she attended the same university as Mr Chow, told AFP news agency: ""I think there should be an independent inquiry commission to investigate his death and other incidents that happened during the movement.""
Other people gathered in the shopping district of Causeway Bay, lining the streets in silence.
At Hong Kong's University of Science and Technology, dozens of protesters vandalised a Starbucks, Bank of China and at least three cafeterias on site, the South China Morning Post reports.
They wrote ""condemn police brutality"" on the walls of the Starbucks store.
Protesters are calling for more demonstrations this weekend.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."
"BANJUL, Gambia  —   A week after he was inaugurated in another country, Adama Barrow landed in Gambia on Thursday afternoon, setting foot inside his own national borders for the first time as the new president. Throngs of supporters, some holding Gambian flags, lined the roads to greet Mr. Barrow, who had flown in from Dakar, Senegal, where he had fled more than a week earlier out of security concerns after his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, refused to step down. As he entered Banjul, the capital, Mr. Barrow, dressed in all white, poked out of a white Land Cruiser surrounded by military vehicles and waved to onlookers. “Today is freedom day,” said Mariama Bah, a nurse from Serekunda, a town nearby, who came to the airport to welcome President Barrow. “We now have a president that we can be proud of. ” Mr. Barrow defeated the longtime president, Mr. Jammeh, in a surprising outcome to an election in December. Mr. Jammeh, who had been in power since 1994, when he led a successful coup, initially accepted defeat. A few days after the vote, he changed his mind, declared the election results invalid and vowed to use the power of his military to stay in charge. It took repeated personal overtures from West African presidents and finally a regional coalition of troops that crossed into Gambia to persuade Mr. Jammeh, known for human rights abuses, to step down. He flew out of the country on Saturday, accompanied by a cargo plane containing his   and other luxury automobiles, and has settled in Equatorial Guinea, which has its own record of human rights violations. Mr. Barrow’s arrival capped a tense period for many Gambians who had feared a bloody end to the presidential standoff. Tens of thousands of residents had been so worried that they fled the country, though many have already returned. But Mr. Jammeh still has supporters left in Gambia, and some residents worry that divisions could lead to problems in the new administration. Mr. Barrow has dismissed his predecessor’s supporters as a minority. Most of all, many residents said they were weary of the regional troops who were still roaming the capital. They had arrived at the statehouse to search it and make sure all was safe for Mr. Barrow’s return, but their presence on the streets was unsettling to many. Mr. Barrow’s aides said the soldiers were likely to remain in Gambia for weeks as the new administration makes the transition. Some Gambians worried that it was still too early for Mr. Barrow to come home. “Yahya Jammeh was not acting alone,” said Ishmael Ceesay, 24, a mobile phone salesman in Serekunda. “His people are still around. ” Mr. Barrow’s aides said the president would stay at a private residence until the regional troops finished securing the statehouse. Mr. Jammeh’s rule penetrated the psyche of many Gambians who feared him, so much so that thousands fled years ago. Their departure further damaged an already shaky economy that Mr. Barrow has said will be a priority for him. Mr. Jammeh jailed journalists and his opponents, some of whom died in prison, carried out hunts for people believed to be witches and forced patients to stop taking medication so he could test what he said was his homemade cure for AIDS  —   herbs, prayers and a banana. Residents of Gambia talked about Mr. Jammeh only in hushed tones, and rarely in public, and even some members of the diaspora said they were convinced he was monitoring their communications. Mohamed Jalloh, who sells fabric at the entrance to the statehouse, said he had spent the past two decades praying a bullet would not come flying toward him. “Yahya Jammeh brought so much fear in us,” Mr. Jalloh said. The paranoia was evident even this week, with Mr. Jammeh hundreds of miles away, when a Gambian newspaper reported that he had left toxins in the vents in the statehouse to poison his successor. Mr. Barrow’s team said the report was false. For many Gambians, the pain of Mr. Jammeh’s rule was all too real. Some residents said part of Mr. Barrow’s new job would be comforter in chief. Mr. Barrow has vowed to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into injustices during Mr. Jammeh’s more than   administration. On Wednesday afternoon in Brikama, the region where Mr. Barrow received the most votes, three women sat on a long wooden bench. They wore yellow #GambiaHasDecided   a motto adopted by the opposition that wanted Mr. Jammeh to leave. Like many others across Gambia, each of the women said a relative had been killed by security forces loyal to Mr. Jammeh. As they sold sugar at the market, the three spoke of their losses. It was during the 2011 presidential election campaign that Nyima Jabang’s father, an ambulance driver, was tortured and killed while in custody at the National Intelligence Agency. His crime: driving two men to a hospital who had been wounded at a rally in a clash between Mr. Jammeh’s party and the main opposition party, the United Democratic Party. The next day, the brother of Nyima Sanyang, another of the friends selling sugar, was arrested by security forces in connection with the campaign clash and was beaten to death. The third woman, Bintu Sonko, 30, described the long, speeding motorcades that carried Mr. Jammeh and his aides, who would toss packets of cookies to supporters. In 2013, Ms. Sonko’s son, Lamine, 7, heard Mr. Jammeh’s cars approaching. He ran out with his friends to wave to the passing president. Lamine darted into the street to catch a cookie and was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade. “They did not even stop,” Ms. Sonko said. “They kept going and throwing cookies at the rest of the kids. We can’t even report the matter to the chief or the police. ” “That was my only child. ”"

German public television TV host/science journalist Harald Lesch (astrophysicist) attacks climate skepticism
By Carl-Otto Weiss, Physicist PhD

German public television science journalist Harald Lesch plays it loose with the facts to mislead the public. Image cropped from ZDF, Fair Use.
Many opposition parties in Europe, the GOP party in the US, as well as governments of various countries like Australia, Poland, etc. view “global warming” with healthy amount of scepticism, or even as a “hoax”.  In Germany the newly minted AfD protest party added to its programme that the party does not support so-called “climate protection” schemes. The AfD is to Germany what the UKIP is to the UK, i.e. a very inconvenient thorn in the side of the splintering euro-political establishment.
The AfD justifies its opposition to climate protection initiatives based on three factors: 1) all predictions of global warming rest solely on model calculations which have failed all tests, 2) there is no single scientific result published proving significant global warming by man-made CO2, and 3) there is a large number of publications definitely disproving any possibility of a sizeable influence of CO2 on the Earth’s temperature.
On ZDF German public television, Harald Lesch one-sidedly challenged the AfD’s climate science position. On the argument that the models are unsuitable for predictions, he stated bluntly:
No model that has not stood the test against measurements or experiments can be published in the scientific literature.”
Mr. Lesch, an astrophysicist, is surely familiar with scientific literature, and thus really must know that any number of model calculations are published without being tested by experiments/measurements. Every natural scientist knows this. Very often a model rests on a new idea or insight, something, which in itself is certainly worth publishing, and, consequently, gets published.
Thus Lesch’s statement is, to say the least, quite surprising. Would any experienced scientist really have no idea of the scientific publication process – even of his own field?
Readers may find it of interest that the AfD is right now the only political party in Germany that is expressly against action to “fight climate change”, and has been very successful in convincing plenty of voters, thus making the other parties very nervous.
Lesch in fact never contacted EIKE

Next Leach attacked the climate science critics:
It is always the same people who try to undermine the credibility of trusted experts.”
Here the trusted experts are in fact not trusted by everyone – rather only by much of the mainstream media, and of course the governments who happen to pay the experts.
Here Lesch points the finger at EIKE (European Institute for Climate and Energy), which operates the most widely viewed German speaking website (here) on issues concerning climate science and energy policy and is the only independent German association of scientists that discusses climate questions. Lesch added:
Of course I try to discuss this with them. I even tried to get in contact with them by phone, but they do not answer.”
This is untrue. A check among all EIKE members reveals that no EIKE member has ever received any inquiry from Leash in any way, shape or form. In return, however, EIKE requested the ZDF TV station to arrange contact with Lesch. Sadly the public-funded ZDF TV station refused to let EIKE contact Lesch.
ZDF refuses to give sceptics time
Requests for a public discussion between EIKE and the publicly-paid Mr. Lesch continue to go unanswered.

Florida Tech lightning research deepens understanding of sprite formation – link specific atmospheric conditions to exuberant, luminous displays above thunderstorms
From the FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

MELBOURNE, FLA. — A new study led by Florida Institute of Technology Professor Ningyu Liu has improved our understanding of a curious luminous phenomenon that happens 25 to 50 miles above thunderstorms.
These spectacular phenomena, called sprites, are fireworks-like electrical discharges, sometimes preceded by halos of light, in earth’s upper atmosphere. It has been long thought that atmospheric gravity waves play an important role in the initiation of sprites but no previous studies, until this team’s recent findings, provided convincing arguments to support that idea.
The research, published in the June 29 issue of Nature Communications, includes comprehensive computer-simulation results from a novel sprite initiation model and dramatic images of a sprite event, and provides a clearer understanding of the atmospheric mechanisms that lead to sprite formation.
Understanding the conditions of sprite formation is important, in part, because they can interfere with or disrupt long-range communication signals by changing the electrical properties of the lower ionosphere.

Predicted by Nobel laureate C. T. R. Wilson in 1924 but not discovered until 1989, sprites are triggered by intense cloud-to-ground lightning strokes. They typically last a few to tens of milliseconds; they are bright enough to be seen with dark-adapted naked eyes at night; and only the most powerful lightning strokes can cause them.
The study, conducted by Liu, a Florida Tech professor of physics and space sciences, and collaborators Joseph Dwyer, a former professor at Florida Tech now at University of New Hampshire, Hans Stenbaek-Nielsen from University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Matthew McHarg from the United States Air Force Academy, investigated how sprites are initiated.
According to Liu, the perturbations in the upper atmosphere created by atmospheric gravity waves can grow in the electric field produced by lightning and eventually lead to sprites.
“Perturbations with small size and large amplitude are best for initiating sprites,” Liu said. “If the size of the perturbation is too large, sprite initiation is impossible; if the magnitude of the perturbation is small, it requires a relatively long time for sprites to be initiated.”
To validate their model, the team analyzed a sprite event captured simultaneously by high-speed, high-sensitivity cameras on two aircraft during an observation mission sponsored by the Japanese broadcasting corporation NHK. The high-speed images show that a relatively long-lasting sprite halo preceded the fast initiation of sprite elements, exactly as predicted by the model.
Hamid Rassoul, an atmospheric physicist and the dean of Florida Tech’s College of Science, said the findings will be critical to future researchers.
“They will allow scientists to study not only sprites but also the mesospheric perturbations, which are difficult, if not impossible, to observe,” he said.
Liu added, “Our findings also suggest that small, dim glows in the upper atmosphere may be frequently caused by intense lightning but elude the detection. There may be many interesting phenomena waiting for discovery with more sensitive imaging systems.”

President Obama is neither a committed free‐​trader nor a hard‐​core protectionist. But his continuing failure to commit to a pro‐​trade agenda amounts to de facto protectionism and subverts his economic and foreign policy objectives. 



Reacting recently to a provision in the climate change bill that would impose trade penalties against nations that do not limit carbon emissions enough, the president said, “At a time when the economy worldwide is still deep in recession and we’ve seen a significant drop in global trade, I think we have to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals.” 



In that mild rebuke of protectionism lingers the essence of the administration’s nascent trade policy: conditional, ambiguous and not particularly reassuring. 



Earlier this year, the president suggested that Congress avoid language in the stimulus bill that could provoke a trade war. Congress responded by pruning the bill’s most overtly protectionist provisions. But “buy American” fever has nonetheless permeated the government procurement market. Uncertainty surrounding the arcane rules has caused contractors to render their own judgments about what qualifies. Not only have eligible foreign firms been excluded from the market, but U.S. firms that use imported raw materials (including California’s entire steel industry) also have been shut out.





The president speaks of a renewed internationalism and multilateralism in foreign policy, yet his trade policy whiffs of nationalism and unilateralism. 



Canadian municipalities have responded with “don’t buy American” rules, while the Chinese and others have introduced their own buy‐​local provisions, all to the chagrin of U.S. exporters and the general economy. 



One would expect the president to respond with dispatch, at the very least issuing clear implementing guidelines. Instead, the Obama administration has done nothing but “seek comment.” Our comment is this: The president’s disregard for the matter is slowing economic recovery, tempting further escalation by our trade partners and cementing the United States’ reputation as an international trade scofflaw. 



Likewise, when Congress defunded a program that enabled Mexican trucks to operate on our roads — placing the U.S. in violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Obama offered assurances of a quick resolution. Five months later, there is no fix in sight. To hasten a resolution, the Mexican government imposed $2.4 billion in retaliatory duties on about 90 U.S. exports, and a Mexican trucking association filed a $6‐​billion lawsuit against the U.S. government. 



The reduction in cross‐​border trade and investment cannot be the economic elixir the president had in mind, nor is the dispute his preferred launching point for diplomatic relations with Mexico. Yet the administration is content, after five months, to just study the problem. How much study is needed to conclude that blatant violation of our NAFTA obligations, plus potentially $8.4 billion in direct costs, plus higher transportation costs on the entire North American supply chain for the benefit of the Teamsters, is a bad idea? 



Meanwhile, despite claims that the administration would work with Congress to pass long‐​pending trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, those deals remain hostage to cynical politics. 



The president speaks of a renewed internationalism and multilateralism in foreign policy, yet his trade policy whiffs of nationalism and unilateralism. That won’t help restore America’s image abroad, where most countries regard U.S. trade policy as the face of U.S. foreign policy. 



The inconsistency between the president’s words and deeds betrays a man concerned with politics above all else. But the politics of trade are changing, and Obama has an opportunity to shepherd his party back from the fringe. 



Recent polls indicate that Americans are shedding their skepticism about trade’s benefits. The founding of the Congressional Pro‐​Trade Caucus by Rep. Henry Cuellar (D‐​Texas) this year suggests that protectionism is not the Democratic Party’s creed but rather that of a loud minority led by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D‐​Ohio) and Rep. Michael Michaud (D‐​Maine). 



Democrats who seek to restrict trade must be held accountable when they also claim to speak for Main Street. Middle‐​income Americans spend more of their paychecks on imports than do wealthy Americans. Lower‐​income families spend a higher percentage of their budgets on necessities such as food, clothing and shelter (steel, lumber, cement), all of which face above‐​average import duties because of the efforts of unions and other protectionist lobbies. Tariffs are a highly regressive tax, which is supposed to be anathema to every card‐​carrying Democrat. 



In the coming days, Obama will make his first major speech on the future of U.S. trade policy. If he really wants to bring his party into the 21st century and is truly committed to economic recovery and diplomatic fence‐​mending, he must ditch the flaccid rhetoric and launch an unabashedly pro‐​trade agenda now.

"Question:
I think that companies that are making millions of dollars should be forced to use renewable energy, and/or invest in it; they should be doing their bit for the planet. The government should not be forcing householders to pay a tax or more for living, food, electricity etc., especially when they can’t stop what big business does to the environment, or what the government spends the carbon money on.
You can’t be serious that the burning of fossil fuels doesn’t hurt the environment; even if you don’t believe in climate change, this would be one point that I don’t agree with. Also I don’t agree that the planet needs more emissions to be able to grow food, as plants were growing on this planet long before companies started burning fossil fuels to fuel factories.

Answer:
The key thing to grasp is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, not poisonous and is a beneficial gas in the atmosphere. It is colourless, odourless and non-toxic. It is the holes in your bread and the bubbles in your beer. And it is present in the atmosphere in minute quantities. Over 99.9% of the atmosphere is other gases, but every living creature relies on there being enough CO2 in the air to survive.
People who run greenhouses pump CO2 into them to help the plants grow. More CO2 in the air has allowed us to produce more food, and makes plants stronger and more resistant to heat, cold and drought. People have done careful experiments on this, and warmer temperatures and more CO2 are significant factors in all plant growth.
You are of course correct that plants grew long before we started to burn coal and oil, but food production (and population) were far, far lower then. Aerial fertilisation by man-made CO2 is a significant factor in allowing the growth in world population (as is in-ground fertilisation by nitrogen fertilisers from the same fossil carbon industry). No doubt people will say our population is too large, and in places that may be true, but it is not sustainable without carbon fuels and the food they help to produce and transport. That is the ugly truth, which will be illustrated in several countries soon.
There is also no essential difference between wood, grass, natural gas and coal – all are natural non-toxic hydro-carbon materials with all the elements of life in their structure. Ethanol and whiskey are man-made versions of the same things. Burning any one of them will produce mainly two harmless gases – water vapour (which is what you can see emitting from power stations) and carbon dioxide (which is invisible).
That is not to say that burning these materials in open fires does not cause addition of some gases that are noxious to humans in heavy concentrations (like oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, metals, ash and other particles, or even the poisonous carbon monoxide). The cause of the bad pollution in Asia is not coal fired power stations (modern ones remove almost everything except the beneficial gases of life: water and carbon dioxide). The clouds of pollution choking Asian cities is caused by bushfires in Indonesia, cow dung cooking fires in India, dirty smelters and open fires in China and North Korea and the occasional volcano. Most of these problems have been largely solved in the rich developed world by using clean silent invisible electricity in our cities. Cars are the big polluters in our cities, but even they improve every year.
It always seems attractive to tax the hell out of those rich corporations. But corporations are just people at the end. Our biggest coal company in Queensland is BHP, owned by millions of little people like public servants via pension funds, your parents via savings, and lots of other little people.
And we cannot contain taxes – they keep spreading around – if we tax more heavily every tonne of coal burnt, one of two things will happen (probably a bit of both) – power prices will rise, or some power stations will close down (the huge brown coal stations in Victoria, who supply massive power to the Australian electricity grid will be the first to close). Again, blackouts or increases in power costs will follow (and both are already happening because of carbon hysteria in several countries). And the share prices for coal mines and power stations will fall, making it difficult to raise more money to build wind farms, solar cities or anything else. (Why do you think the government of NSW is desperate to sell their power stations?)
There are direct taxes and sneaky taxes.
If I decide to reduce pollution in the city of Brisbane, I could put a toll gate on every main road, collecting a central city pollution tax from every vehicle. That is a direct tax. Everyone can see what it is for and what it achieves. If you don’t pollute the city with car fumes, you don’t pay it. Honest and open.
Or I could decide to force Energex to get 18% of their power from “renewables”. That costs them money for wind farms and things. There are only two places for them to get the money – from consumers like you via increased electricity charges or from shareholders like your parents via reduced dividends. These are the sneaky taxes which only one person in a hundred will recognise. And the posturing politicians who levy them can blame the increased costs on wicked corporations. (As an aside, the government of Queensland does force Energex and other suppliers to get 18% of electricity from expensive “renewables”.)
But no matter how much we wish for it, wind and solar will never supply the quantity of electricity we are using now for our survival and comfort. There is just not enough sun, wind or geothermal where we need it. Solar is good for hot water systems, but not for powering processing plants, factories and big cities. The carbon cutting goals can only be achieved by either a massive switch to nuclear power, which seems politically unlikely in Australia, or a severe reduction in power use per person.
And what about the cars, trucks, planes and ships that supply us all with daily food, travel and goods? There is no feasible option for replacing carbon fuels in less than decades, and then the only real option yet visible is hydrogen fuel generated by coal or nuclear power!
So, we cannot cut carbon usage significantly, or punish carbon using companies, without punishing ourselves severely and in unexpected ways. Already the costs of food and power are spiralling up, and the major cause is fear of carbon taxes, or subsidies that are diverting food to produce motor fuel or using up other resources to produce renewable energy.
It is a long complicated story, and most people do not go past catchy slogans. Chanting the slogans are people with other agendas, which do not include our prosperity or jobs for our kids.
Lots of people also think, deep down, that “we are a wasteful society and some good may come of all this”. Everyone thinks those other people are wasteful. But waste is a value judgement. I do not drink beer or eat bread, unless there are no polite options. Therefore the massive resources devoted to making bread and beer are “waste” in my eyes. We could turn those fields of wheat and barley to native grasses and “waste” would be reduced.
Other people do not eat meat, and thus believe people like us who breed cattle and sheep should be closed down and the land restored to national parks. What is “waste” and what is “essential” industry is a value judgement and we will never agree on any government enforced measure to “reduce waste”. In fact every law will create more waste, as it will stop some things that some people value and encourage other things that other people consider waste – no one will be completely happy. The total “waste” in society is a reflection of the amount to which government distorts things. Left to ourselves, liable for the full cost of every thing we choose to use, and not taxed for a single thing we do not want, we will minimise the total waste in society.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Helmut Kuntz writes that Germany’s all-time record high temperature recorded last year, 2015, is likely an artifact of the urban heat island effect (UHI) and instrumentation error margins.
In 2015 the Kitzingen weather station located in southern Germany set a new all-time high when it reached 40.3°C — twice: on July 5 and August 7 — breaking the earlier record of 40.2°C set on 27 July 1983 in Gärmersdorf. The whopping margin: a whole 0.1°C! Photo right: Kitzingen station.
So why is Kitzingen suddenly so hot?
EIKE guest writer Josef Kowatsch has often claimed that the UHI has played a major role in producing the warming effect over the past decades. Recently that claim got a boost of support from University of Wurzburg climate researcher Prof. Heiko Paeth, who in an interview with MAIN POST daily here on September 7, 2016, stated that it likely has more to do with station siting then it does with a climate trend.
According to Prof. Paeth, the high reading can be traced back to Kitzingen having certain special features.
First the town of Kitzingen is located at a relatively low elevation some 20 km east of Wurzburg — situated in the Main Valley at the bottom of a sort of a bowl where heat can collect.
Secondly, he tells the MAIN POST that fresh, westerly winds that normally act to cool Germany in the summertime have been obstructed by a commercial district built not long ago where once a US base had been located. The Main Post writes:

What remains is an obstacle for the air flow from the west. The town has blocked off its fresh air feed-in duct, says Paeth. ‘That could be an explanation for the heat.'”

Instrumentation error margin of +-0.4°C
Moreover Kuntz reports that the Kitzingen station was first put into operation in 2005 and the German DWD weather service equipped it with the electronic PT 100 instrument, which in comparison tests has been shown to produce considerably higher readings. Also such a weather station has a temperature measurement error of +-0.4°C at temperatures of 40°C:

Accuracy of the WXT 520 sensor for weather stations. As the ambient temperature rises over 0°C, so does the margin of error. 
Kuntz adds that if the urban heat island effect is the reason for the 0.1°C temperature increase over the last 32 years in Germany, then the supposed climate change warming of the planet looks like as follows:
– Globally it has not gotten warmer over the past 103 years.
– The global temperature upper limit temperature has not changed at all in 74 years.
– It has not gotten warmer in Germany over the past 32 years.
– If the “discarded” older measurements were used, it would be much warmer earlier than currently stated.

"**Ethiopia took the lead in creating Africa's continental organisation, the African Union (AU), but Ethiopia analyst Alex de Waal argues that its actions are now jeopardising the body's founding principles.**
Shortly before three former African heads of state arrived in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the northern Tigray region, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered what he called the ""final phase of our rule of law operations"".
This was a remarkable rebuff.
Former Presidents Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Joachim Chissano of Mozambique and Kgalema Motlanthe of South Africa met Mr Abiy on Friday, but were told that the Ethiopian government would continue its military operations.
Mr Abiy also said that they could not meet any representatives of the group Ethiopia is fighting in Tigray, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which the prime minister has dismissed as a ""criminal clique"".
Citing the Charter of the United Nations in a statement earlier in the week, the prime minister insisted that the federal government was engaged in a domestic law-enforcement operation and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation applied.
But Nigerian legal expert Chidi Odinkalu argues that Ethiopia is using the charter to escalate a war, the opposite of its pacific intent, saying that the ""audacity of this position is disconcerting"".
He points out that the conflict is already internationalised, because Eritrea is entangled and refugees are crossing into Sudan.
Also, the United Nations has adopted principles to prevent states abusing the doctrine of non-interference to give themselves impunity to commit atrocities.
Since 1981, conflict resolution has been a duty and a right. Since 2005, states have had the responsibility to protect civilians in conflict.
In rebuffing the African mediators, Mr Abiy is not just turning down a peace initiative. He is challenging the foundational principles of the African Union itself.
Article 4(g) of the AU's Constitutive Act - to which Ethiopia acceded in 2002 - does specify ""non-interference by any member state in the internal affairs of another"".
But this is immediately followed by Article 4(h), which gives the AU the right ""to intervene in a member stateâ¦ in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity"".
This so-called ""duty of non-indifference"" was adopted in the wake of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
It was first formulated by an International Panel of Eminent Personalities, strongly supported by Ethiopia, which was brought together to recommend how Africa should prevent such atrocities in the future. ""Non-indifference"" is Africa's version of the UN's ""responsibility to protect"".
The Ethiopian government has itself accused the TPLF of carrying out atrocities, and observers fear that when the news blackout is lifted, evidence of war crimes by both sides will come to light.
There are unconfirmed reports that Eritrean troops have crossed the border and rounded up Eritrean refugees in United Nations camps in Tigray, which would be a violation of the United Nations convention on refugees.
The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was founded in 1963, with its headquarters in Addis Ababa, with the aim of consolidating the newly won independence of African states.
Locating the OAU in Ethiopia was a diplomatic triumph for Emperor Haile Selassie, who had long championed international law.
Famously, his 1936 speech at the League of Nations predicted that if Italy's invasion of Ethiopia were to go unpunished, the world would be bathed in blood.
The OAU was a common front for Africa's liberation from colonial and racist rule.
But it also served as a club of autocrats, who held to their common interest of staying in power no matter what. Tanzania's founding President, Julius Nyerere, lamented that it had become ""a trade union of heads of state"".
By the 1990s it was clear that the OAU needed to be refashioned to be able to respond to Africa's wars, coups and atrocities, and in 2002 the AU was created with a far more ambitious agenda of promoting peace and democracy.
Since then it has developed a set of mechanisms that include suspending countries where there is an unconstitutional change in government, and offering help to mediate conflicts, along with an obligation for conflict-afflicted countries to welcome good-faith peacemaking efforts.
Mr Abiy himself intervened in the Sudanese crisis last year when he sought a peaceful resolution to the confrontation between the pro-democracy movement and the military, which had unseated President Omar al-Bashir.
The formula for Sudan's transition to democracy was drawn up on the AU's template.
But the AU is not a strong institution. It has a low budget and cannot impose its will.
More powerful states and organisations can overrule it - as Nato did when the AU sought a negotiated settlement to the Libya conflict in 2011, but the United States, European and Arab countries pursued regime change.
The AU's real value lies in its soft power: it articulates the norms of peace and cooperation and persuades African leaders to go along, knowing that they rise together and sink together.
Over time, it has proven its value: Africa has become more democratic and peaceable.
A generation ago, African diplomatic efforts to avoid conflicts or resolve them were rare. Today, they are standard practice.
In a statement announcing the three envoys' mission, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is the current AU chairperson, reaffirmed the organisation's position that the conflict ""should be brought to an end through dialogue"".
But it was couched in standard diplomatic courtesies and lacked bite.
In comparable situations - such as Libya or Sudan - the AU chair has convened a special heads of state meeting of the AU's Peace and Security Council. Mr Ramaphosa has not done that.
South Africa - which is currently one of three African nations on the UN Security Council - postponed a discussion on Ethiopia at the UN on Monday, citing the need to hear the envoys' report first.
Because it hosts its headquarters, Ethiopia has an outsized influence on the day-to-day affairs of the AU.
Other African countries have long suspected that it has a double standard, giving Ethiopia leeway that it does not accord to other countries. That did not matter so much when Ethiopia was active in supporting mediation efforts and peacekeeping operations, especially in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.
Now, many are asking if it has brazenly crossed a red line.
The Ethiopian government has purged Tigrayan officers from AU and UN peacekeeping missions, according to a report in Foreign Policy magazine quoting a UN document. It also demanded that the AU Commission dismiss its head of security, who was a Tigrayan and whose loyalties were questioned because of the conflict.
And now Mr Abiy has effectively rejected Africa's highest-level mediators, politely recording only that they ""imparted their wisdom, insights and readiness to support in any way they are needed"".
After Ethiopian federal troops occupied the Tigrayan capital Mekelle on Saturday, Mr Abiy declared his operation complete - implying that he doesn't need peacemakers. But the African mediators - all from countries that have long experience of armed conflicts - are not likely to be so confident.
The AU headquarters was built on the site of Ethiopia's notorious central prison, known as Alem Bekagn - meaning ""farewell to the world"" in Amharic.
Thousands of political prisoners were imprisoned there, many tortured and executed, during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. That symbolism is not lost on African civil society activists, who wonder if they are becoming prisoners of their Ethiopian hosts.
A senior AU diplomat remarked on Friday: ""Abiy thinks that the AU is for others, not for Ethiopia.""
Mr Abiy's rejection of mediation harkens back to an earlier era in which African civil wars were ended by force of arms, not peace agreements - leaving grievances to fester.
It threatens to make a mockery of the African Union's hard-won norms and principles of peacemaking.
Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Global Affairs at Tufts University in the US. He worked for the AU on Sudan in different capacities from 2005 to 2012."
"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The   defector from North Korea in years said on Wednesday that the days of the country’s leadership were “numbered,” and that its attempts to control outside information were not working because of corruption and discontent. “I am sure that more defections of my colleagues will take place, since North Korea is already on a slippery slope,” the defector, Thae   said during a news conference in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. “The traditional structures of the North Korean system are crumbling. ” Mr. Thae had been the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until he fled to the South last summer with his family. South Korea has hailed his defection as a sign of growing disillusionment among North Korean elites with the country’s leader, Kim  . Since December, Mr. Thae has given a series of interviews to share his dire view of today’s North Korea. Mr. Thae’s diagnosis of Mr. Kim’s rule is hardly new. Defectors from the North, as well as some conservative analysts and policy makers in the South, widely share that view. Still, it signaled a drastic change of roles for Mr. Thae. Before his defection, he was a career diplomat, fluent in English, who had served in Britain, Denmark and Sweden, often delivering passionate speeches glorifying the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades. In the South, Mr. Thae, now affiliated with the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank arm of the National Intelligence Service, has vowed to spend the rest of his life trying to bring down the North Korean government. Mr. Thae said he had high expectations when Mr. Kim took power after the death of his father, Kim   in 2011. Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Mr. Kim was expected to help modernize his impoverished country. Instead, he resorted to a “reign of terror” by executing scores of officials, including his uncle Jang   whom he thought posed a challenge to his power, Mr. Thae said. The former diplomat said he had come up with a detailed plan for his defection, first ensuring that his two sons joined him and his wife in London. (North Korean diplomats are required to leave a child in the North, a measure intended to prevent their defection.) He declined to reveal details of his defection plan and the circumstances. While in London, his sons began asking questions, like why the North Korean government executed people in public without a proper trial, Mr. Thae said. Their English friends taunted them with questions, like why Mr. Kim had smoked a cigarette inside a nursery. The day Mr. Thae broached his plan for defection with his sons, he told them that he wanted to break the “chain of slavery” for them, he recalled. They wanted to know if they would have free access to the internet, books and movies in the South, he said. The best way to force change in the isolated North, he continued, is to disseminate outside information there to help ordinary citizens eventually rebel. South Korean TV dramas and movies smuggled from China are already popular in the North, he said. Another sign of Mr. Kim’s weakening control, Mr. Thae said, is evident at the unofficial markets in North Korea where women trade goods, mostly smuggled from China. The vendors used to be called “grasshoppers” because they would pack and flee whenever they saw the police approaching. Now, they are called “ticks” because they refuse to budge, demanding a right to make a living, Mr. Thae said. Such resistance, even if small in scale, is unprecedented, he added. The spread of outside news and market activities could eventually doom Mr. Kim because his government “can be held in place and maintained only by idolizing Kim   like a god,” Mr. Thae said. “If he tries to introduce a   economy to North Korean society, then there will be no place for Kim   in North Korea, and he knows that. ” But the leader’s efforts to clamp down on information and products from outside North Korea have been unsuccessful because the police accept bribes in exchange for freeing smugglers and people caught watching banned movies and dramas. “Kim  ’s days are numbered,” Mr. Thae said on Wednesday. After months of debriefing by the authorities in South Korea, Mr. Thae used meetings with the country’s politicians and the news media to suggest that North Korea was determined to be recognized as a nuclear power, just as India and Pakistan are. Last year, the North conducted two nuclear tests and launched more than 20 ballistic missiles, and it has openly vowed to develop the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear warhead. “It won’t happen,” Donald J. Trump, then   said at the time. During the election campaign, Mr. Trump had said he was willing to sit down with Mr. Kim and perhaps have a hamburger with him. On Wednesday, Mr. Thae warned against compromising with the North, arguing that sanctions were effective. In recent interviews with local news outlets, he said that North Korea had lost annual income worth tens of millions dollars, after Britain froze accounts last year held by its   insurance company as part of sanctions recommended by the United Nations. Until then, the company had claimed large insurance payments through fabricated documents, he said. Mr. Kim wanted to negotiate a compromise, under which the United States and South Korea would cancel their annual joint military exercises and lift sanctions on the North in return for a moratorium on North Korean missile and nuclear tests, Mr. Thae said. But such a deal would validate Mr. Kim’s argument that he had been forced to develop nuclear weapons as a reaction to American hostility, he said. “That is really a trap Kim   wants,” Mr. Thae said."
"PARIS  —   At the end of the Jean Paul Gaultier couture show  —   after a stream of etched tuxedo suits, 1980s Crayola leathers and   furs with hibiscus prints after the models had finally left the runway and the audience started packing up  —   a man with a guitar slung around his neck appeared and perched on a stool by the side of the stage. Oops. Guess it wasn’t over after all. Then up the curtain went again, to reveal   …     a barefoot girl standing on a swing in an angelic silken nightie with a long blond braid trailing down her back and lacy sleeves like wings. She swayed to and fro for awhile to the strumming, then hopped off the swing and twirled down the catwalk before being swept off her feet by a shirtless stud in denim overalls, deposited in a wheelbarrow and carted off with great fanfare, into the sunset. Or at least backstage. It was a vignette sweetly meant. But couture bills itself as “the dream. ” And are women’s dreams these days really about being spirited into the future by a    of burning man flesh? That was mostly a rhetorical question. There’s a reason that Isabelle Huppert, just off her best actress Oscar nomination for playing a woman in “Elle” who, instead of falling to pieces after an attack, takes her vengeance into her own hands, attended the Armani Privé show not in the usual elaborate cocktail gown that celebrities favor for the front row, but rather a turquoise trouser suit and black mock turtleneck, and looked the cooler for it. When her fellow   celeb, Nicole Kidman, in a classic little black dress with statement jewels, knelt down to pay homage, you thought, “I know what you mean. ” It was, on the other hand, more difficult to figure out what Mr. Armani meant with the tangerine dream on the runway, from orange croc jackets to orange sequined slithers to long jeweled orange vests (there was some black, too). To paraphrase Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, it’s 2017. The issue of how relevant a historic discipline that is defined by making handmade clothes to order for the very few can be in a world roiled by social and political disruption was unavoidable this week  —   in part because the couture shows began just after the Women’s March on Washington, not to mention its sister marches all over the world, including Paris, and ended just before the March for Life. It seemed, at least to start, an unfortunate juxtaposition. It was hard not to think we were in the middle of a Marie Antoinette moment in the making. Especially when Giambattista Valli situated his show of   ball gowns, minidresses cut to the thigh in front and streaming trains of mousseline and silk faille behind, in the Archives Nationales. The historic venue, that is to say, where the young queen’s papers are kept (including the final letter she wrote before her beheading). The idea did not go over well with a French national trade union, which handed out leaflets in protest of the   . Still, after it was all over, after we had finished the trek from one cultural monument to the other  —   from the Musée Rodin, Invalides, the Centre Pompidou, the Palais de Chaillot, the Cirque D’Hiver (in case, you know, anyone was in any doubt about whether the French consider this particular discipline part of their patrimony)  —   it was clear that behind the tulle and chiffon, the crystals and crepe, efforts were being made to bridge the gap between escapism and the contemporary. Couture is often treated as synonymous with the most extreme form of   in part because of designers’ own tendency to   with the decoration (more sequins! more encrustation!) and the show décor. But at its essence it is, or is when it succeeds, about empowering the individual. A point made crystal clear by John Galliano in a perfectly judged Maison Margiela show that was a graceful meditation on the connection between foundation and presentation. Silk trench coats were sliced away and reduced to checkerboards to give glimpses of the garments beneath a tweed blouse over a bias satin skirt unspooled on one side. Faces, from the filters we use to transform ourselves on social media, were traced on sheer overcoats or cut into cascading gowns, or imprinted on tulle. In those eyes, you saw yourself. Elsewhere, the difference was in the details. At Christian Dior, the first woman to run the house, Maria Grazia Chiuri, performed a deceptive sleight of hand. In a tent in the gardens of the Musée Rodin, she constructed a verdant   maze around a magical tree dripping jewels and trinkets that recalled nothing so much as “A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ” She populated it with Little Black Riding Hood tailleurs and an array of evermore romantic evening dresses clasped at the waist by sculptural belts and crowned at the head. Yet, fancy though they were, the clothes had a   insouciance. Oh, this old ball gown? Paired with barely there kitten heels that kicked up the moss as the models strode along, they looked as comfortable as a sweatshirt. Ms. Chiuri said she had been fascinated by the concept of transformation (hence the masked ball theme, and the set) but the real transformation was in taking a formal garment and giving it a palpable ease, so the woman inside could just, well  —   get on with it. Likewise, at Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli accessorized his Grecian columns and palazzo pants and Aphrodite dresses with flat   sandals, the kind found at many an Italian resort, and loosed  —   or lost  —   the structure from his clothes. Instead of being armored, or preserved in amber, femininity was being unbound, shrouded in crepe pleats and veils of tulle. (Mr. Piccioli and Ms. Chiuri worked together as design partners for more than two decades, and this season marked each of their solo couture debuts, so, if they were thinking along the same lines, it’s understandable. The separation process is probably going to take a while.) The idea that flat shoes could represent progress may seem absurd. But this is a world where words like “fairy and “princess” are used so often they have become clichés. In that context, a sandal and absolute simplicity can be a radical move. So was swapping out the paillettes and bugle beads, the way Riccardo Tisci did at Givenchy, and instead using small circular fabric “mirrors” as adornment on     silk gowns. The most complicated dress in the collection, one that took 2, 000 hours to make, was made solely of linked dream catchers, each woven from black thread by hand in a different pattern. It all made the corsetry and elaborate hip swathing on view at Ulyana Sergeenko seem stiff and   by comparison  —   situated at one end of the continuum that terminates on the other with the mesmerizing garments made from   polyurethane, injection molding and laser cutting at Iris Van Herpen, which are   in the most interesting way. Somewhere in the middle is Schiaparelli, where Bertrand Guyon is in the process of a slow shift away from   surrealism. And though Karl Lagerfeld constructed a mirrored Art Deco salon complete with cream suede sofas and calla lilies for Chanel, transposing rooms at 31 Rue Cambon to the echoing environs of the Grand Palais, what was most notable was not the surround, but rather the way the silhouette had been altered by adding a plain leather belt, cinched just at the lower ribs, to everything from bouclé suiting to crystalline slips finished in a flounce of feathers. It could have been a discordant note amid the sparkling sophistication but instead it created an impression of streamlined modernity, and kept nostalgia at bay. It’s worth noting that, while Chanel (like Gaultier) is one of the few houses left that still closes its show with a bride  —   Elie Saab and Ralph  Russo also cling on, but most have jettisoned that anachronism  —   this time around she had lost her veil and simply strode the runway in a long pink dress. There was a cascade of ruffles at the sleeves and skirt, but look closer and the latter was cut just high enough in the front to allow freedom of movement. Or, put another way: progress."
"LaGRANGE, Ga.  —   Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway  —   about how, almost 77 years ago, he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men, then shot and left for dead. Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway  —   long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past  —   were acknowledged in this city of 31, 000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally   church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened. ” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical. ” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala. documented 4, 075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. The group has begun construction of a memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, which could open by March 2018. To Chief Dekmar, however, the apology in the town he has called home since 1995 is about more than righting history’s wrongs. It is also an effort, in the age of the Black Lives Matter movement, to address some of the deepest roots of minority mistrust in the police, and create a better working relationship between officers and the community. “It became clear that something needed to be done to recognize that some things we did in the past are a burden still carried by officers today,” Chief Dekmar said in a recent phone interview. “Institutions are made up of people, and relationships go like this: Before you trust somebody, you need to know that they know that they did you wrong, and that you’re stepping up and apologizing for it. ” Chief Dekmar, 61, a New Jersey native raised in Oregon, embraces a view of law enforcement that extends beyond the narrow goals of protecting the good and locking up the bad. He tends to speak about his department as one organ of a broader social body, though one that is perhaps more exposed than others to its ills. He leads regular meetings of a “community outreach committee” in which he shares with other civic leaders what his officers see on the streets  —   homelessness, juvenile delinquency, children with learning and literacy issues  —   and looks for ways that various   entities might work together to solve them. He has also sought to address trust issues: The department, he said, has mandated the use of body cameras on officers for the last five years. The chief became familiar with the lynching of Mr. Callaway only about two or three years ago, when one of his officers overheard two older   women who were looking at old photos of the LaGrange police on display at the headquarters building. One woman said to the other, “They killed our people. ” Chief Dekmar began researching the episode but found, he said, only “sketchy reports”  —   there was “no investigation I could find, no arrest, no   by the media. ” Indeed, the details of the crime appear to have been deliberately obscured for the   residents of LaGrange. Then, in 2014, Jason M. McGraw, a student at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, wrote a research paper about the lynching. He noted that while newspapers around the country had reported that a band of masked whites had abducted Mr. Callaway, the local paper, The LaGrange Daily News, wrote only that Mr. Callaway had died “as a result of bullets fired by an unknown person or group of individuals. ” The paper’s headline on the Sept. 9, 1940, article declared, “Negro Succumbs to Shot Wounds. ” Mr. Callaway is generally believed to have been 16 or 18 years old on Sept. 7, the day he was arrested and charged with trying to assault a white woman. According to Mr. McGraw’s research, six white men arrived at the jail that night with at least one gun, forced the jailer to open the cell and forced Mr. Callaway into a car. He was driven to a spot eight miles away and shot in the head and arms. He was later found by a roadside and taken to a hospital, where he died. Mr. McGraw noted that the investigation of Mr. Callaway’s death fell to the town’s police chief, J. E. Matthews, and the Troup County sheriff, E. V. Hillyer, but that an investigative report was never made public. Chief Dekmar has learned that generations of   were well aware of what happened. “There are relatives here and people who still remember,” he said. “Even if those people are not still alive, down through the generations, that memory is still alive. That’s a burden that officers carry. ” As Chief Dekmar learned more about the case, he decided that something must be done to acknowledge it. The city he has sworn to protect is less than 70 miles southwest of Atlanta. Before the Civil War, LaGrange was a wealthy hub in Georgia’s cotton kingdom: Troup County, of which LaGrange is the seat, had the state’s   number of slaves. Today, according to recent census figures, the city is about 48 percent black and 45 percent white. A Kia plant in nearby West Point, Ga. suggests an economic future for the area beyond the textile industry that once sustained it. But nearly one in three LaGrange residents live in poverty. Residents say race relations here, as in many multicultural American communities, run the gamut from friendly to frayed, depending on the day and the issue. When LaGrange College, a private liberal arts school in town, announced that it had invited Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. event scheduled for Thursday, protests poured in, in part because Mr. Lewis had questioned the legitimacy of President Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, some businesses around town bore signs promoting Mr. Lewis’s appearance, while some homes featured   signs declaring “Back the Blue. ” For the last two years or so, city and county residents, including Chief Dekmar, have been engaged in a program of racial reconciliation and racial  . At a monthly meeting this summer, Chief Dekmar approached the president of the county N. A. A. C. P. chapter, Ernest Ward, and asked if he would help set up a public apology for the lynching. Mr. Ward served on the police force for nearly two decades starting in the  . He acknowledged that some of his fellow black residents harbored an    attitude toward the police. “I lost many friends when I became a police officer,” he said, “because they felt that I sold out. ” He was asked how much the apology would help with    police work. “I believe it’s a start,” he said. “And it’s helped me to have a newfound respect for Chief Dekmar. ” “Historically certain people in the white race don’t like to bring up the past when it may not show a good light on their ancestors,” Mr. Ward said. “And so they would prefer to keep things hidden. ” Chief Dekmar issued his apology to relatives of Mr. Callaway on Thursday night at Warren Temple United Methodist Church here. The month after the shooting, Mr. McGraw noted, a church minister named L. W. Strickland wrote to Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who was then a lawyer for the N. A. A. C. P. telling him that the local branch of the rights group had asked the authorities to look into the case, but that “nothing is being done  —   not even acknowledgment of our requests. ” Some white LaGrange residents said on Thursday that they were deeply skeptical about whether the apology would have any practical effect. They noted that the crime took place before most people here were even born. “I don’t care if they apologize or don’t,” said Jessie East, 74, who works at a furniture and appliance shop. “It’s not going to change a thing that happened 77 years ago. ” But to others, including one of Mr. Callaway’s relatives, the apology was a step toward healing. “I speak your name, Austin Callaway, and ask God for forgiveness for the people that did this inhumane thing to you,” Deborah Tatum, a descendant of Mr. Callaway, told the congregation. “Some might say ‘forgiveness’? And I say to you that I believe God when he tells us that there is power and freedom in forgiveness. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe daily Berliner Kurier here writes today that solar physicists at the ultra-warmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) are warning that Europe may be facing “a mini ice age” due to a possible protracted solar minimum.

Solar activity has been much lower than predicted earlier. Credit: D. Hathaway/NASA/MSFC
The Berliner Kurier writes:
That’s the conclusion that solar physicists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research reached when looking at solar activity.”
For an institute that over the past 20 years has steadfastly insisted that man has been almost the sole factor in climate change over the past century and that the sun no longer plays a role, this is quite remarkable.

The Berliner Kurier reports that the PIK scientists foresee a weakening of the sun’s activity over the coming years. “That means that conversely it is going to get colder. The scientists are speaking of a little ice age.”
According to the PIK scientists, the reduced solar activity will, however, not be able to stop the global warming and only brake the warming up to 2100 by 0.3°C.
Given the extreme warnings of warming and sea level rise put out by the Potsdam Institute in the past, this still represents an extraordinary admission, one that has us suspecting a major climate turnaround may be ahead – despite all the efforts by the Potsdam Institute to play it all down. Here we see them possibly setting up a global warming postponement of a couple of decades. The sun plays a role after all.
The source of the Berliner Kurier report is the Austrian weather site wetter.at here. The wetter.at site writes that some solar physicists suspect the current solar inactivity may be “the start of a new grand minimum” like the one the planet saw in the 17th century and left Europe in an ice box.
Dozens of studies show Little Ice Age was global!
Though most scientists agree that the Little Ice Age took place, many dispute its extent. Some insist it was localized over the North Atlantic region. But now there are dozens of studies that show it was in fact a global event. That should make us worry.

Oxford definition of propaganda: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view.



The Prime Minister and her government coalition partners have opened the classroom door to vested interest groups to spread their propaganda.



One such group that has found strong support within Labour is the Maori sovereignty movement. It is engaged in an ambitious strategy to gain governance control of the country. This agenda is being pursued against a backdrop where both of the main political parties regard the support of the tribal elite as crucial to their own political ambitions.



Having decimated the Maori Party at the 2017 election, the Prime Minister will be highly motivated to retain all seven Maori seats within Labour. She will want to avoid the risk that a kuia-led resurgent Maori Party may regain one or more of the Maori seats, along with list MPs, since they are more likely to back National than Labour.



Likewise, National would welcome an erosion of Labour’s base and the emergence of a potential coalition partner.



It’s this political self-interest that muted the response to the calls by sovereignty activists to make their version of New Zealand ‘history’ compulsory in schools. As a result, we will have the bizarre situation where, in our self-managing education system – with a curriculum designed to give schools the freedom to choose which subjects they teach to their students – New Zealand History will be the only compulsory subject.



Such is the hypocrisy of politics that it won’t be compulsory to teach children English or Maths, but it will be compulsory to teach them the Government’s version of New Zealand history.



This is alarming on a number of fronts. Realists know that activists will control the curriculum content. They will [rewrite history](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/gisborne-history-the-re-write/) to portray Maori as peace-loving folk with an established system of government prior to the colonial invasion and era of oppression. They will promote the fallacy that all of the misfortunes of Maori are due solely to the suppression of their culture.



Already a Ministry of Education [resource](http://maorihistory.tki.org.nz/assets/Uploads/Te-Takanga-o-te-Wa-Maori-History-Guidelines-English-1.pdf) on Maori history that’s available for 5 to 12-year-olds includes a section on “a return to Maori self-determination”. The unit warns, “It is difficult for younger students to understand what it is to have been denied rights or to have them forcibly removed. Discuss how they would feel if they had something important such as break time at school unexpectedly taken away from them for good…”



 **State-sanctioned Maori activism** also features strongly in the Education and Training [Bill](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2019/0193/latest/LMS170676.html) that was tabled in Parliament just before the Christmas break.



Under the Bill, the Minister of Education will be able to issue directives – without the scrutiny of Parliament – to ensure education providers are “instilling in each child an appreciation of the importance of the Treaty of Waitangi and te reo Maori”. In addition, “after consulting with Maori”, the Minister can instruct education agencies how to comply with Treaty of Waitangi objectives. The Ministry will clearly be at the dictate of Maori.



It remains unbelievable in this day and age that a New Zealand Government would introduce laws that **create a racial divide,** when so much of modern history has been about the removal of privilege and the pursuit of equality. That our politicians choose to define people by the origin of their ancestors only becomes comprehensible when one considers it in the context of them advancing their own political self-interest.



When will we have a government that will support the basic human right of New Zealanders to be equal and free from State discrimination? When will our politicians stop kissing the feet of Maori? When will a New Zealand Government be prepared to remove race-based legislation from the Statute books in the same way that many other countries including Sweden, France, Belgium, Austria, and many US States have done?



Anyone concerned that Labour is allowing Maori activists to gain influence over education, should send in a submission on the Bill by February 14 – details can be seen [HERE](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_93294/education-and-training-bill).



Radical Maori are not the only group embedding their propaganda within state education. So too are the Greens.



On the 12th of January the Education Minister Chris Hipkins and the Minister of Climate Change, the Green Party co-leader James Shaw, [announced](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-resource-schools-increase-awareness-and-understanding-climate-change) a new climate change resource has been produced for 11 to 14-year-old children.



This week’s NZCPR Guest Commentator, former Energy Minister Barry Brill and Chairman of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition has examined the [programme](https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/Curriculum-resources/Education-for-sustainability/Tools-and-resources#collapsible1) and believes that climate activism is its central objective:



“It promotes the campaigns of Greta Thunberg, School Strike for Climate, and even Greenpeace. It urges children to ‘get talking’, ‘get others involved’, ‘be powerful as a change agent’ and ‘make good choices about climate action’.



“Children are to measure their own carbon footprints as well as those of their parents’ homes and their schools. They should write to their MP and email the Prime Minister/Climate Minister demanding further action to reduce carbon footprints.



“The teaching resource implants in children the need to eat less meat and dairy products – and strongly supports the iniquitous ‘food miles’ myth…”



Barry explains that the material presents spurious predictions for the future as if they were known facts, and says, “I personally began a list of these factoids for the purpose of comparing them with the official projections set out in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change. It was all a futile exercise. Almost every future ‘scientific fact’ in this material is either flat-out wrong or highly tendentious.”



He says, “The entire document is couched in the language of climate campaigners rather than that of scientists. It is a trashy and hopelessly unbalanced catechism of all the fashionable pseudoscience. It is pure propaganda, in the very best Goebbels tradition.”



Joseph Goebbels was, of course, Adolph Hitler’s Propaganda Minister, who used the German education system to indoctrinate children with the Third Reich’s National Socialist world view.



It is said that after Germany surrendered in May 1945, the Allies required young Germans to undergo ‘de-Nazification’ to counter the effects of twelve years of the “big lie” Nazi propaganda they had received at school.



The reality is that the conscious indoctrination of a future generation is being wholeheartedly embraced by activist groups in New Zealand. Whether the big lie is the claim that the Treaty of Waitangi created a partnership between Maori and the Crown – or that free-market capitalism is creating climate change – these fanatics are targeting our children with their political propaganda.



In an [interview](https://breakingviewsnz.blogspot.com/2020/01/sean-plunket-should-climate-change-be.html) with Minister Shaw about the new climate resource for schools, Magic Radio’s Sean Plunket asked if both sides of the debate – whether mankind or nature is responsible for climate change – would be covered.



In response the Minister made an unbelievable claim: “I have not found a scientist yet who does not think that climate change isn’t happening due to human activity.”



He further claimed that “In the New Zealand scientific community there is no debate”. 



If the Minister is to be taken at his word, he clearly lives in a very isolated bubble. It seems implausible that he could have avoided hearing the concerns of scientists in New Zealand – and thousands of others overseas – who believe that climate change is a natural process and is not being caused by humans.



James Shaw was asked: “Are we teaching kids how science works? Or what the IPCC is predicting – and what the scenarios of their computerised models might mean?”



The Minister confirmed that the IPCC predictions are core to the new programme.



The IPCC is, of course, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change – a United Nations body of political representatives that is promoting the theory that mankind is causing climate change. 



Sean Plunket then asked the Minister whether teachers will explain to Kiwi kids that New Zealand is responsible for only 0.17 percent of man-made greenhouse gas emissions?



The Minister didn’t answer the question.



We also doubt whether children will learn that only around 4 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases are produced by mankind and that nature creates the rest.



Sean Plunket asked about sea-level rise and how sea levels have not materially changed in spite of dire predictions. But the Minister sidestepped the issue by talking instead about IPCC modelling.



As Barry Brill has explained, the education resource has been designed to instruct school children on how to become climate activists – and by including an invitation for them to write to the Prime Minister and Climate Minister to demand further action, New Zealanders can expect an on-going diatribe from those politicians about how Kiwi children are insisting the Government do more to combat climate change.



This is not the first time the green movement has attempted to brainwash New Zealand children with global warming scaremongering. Back in 2007 schools throughout the country began [using](https://www.nzcpr.com/politics-in-school-on-trial/) former US Vice President Al Gore’s highly controversial film ‘An Inconvenient Truth’ to promote the Labour Government’s climate change agenda.



At the time, Britain’s Labour Government had sent copies of the film to schools as part of a Climate Change Resource Pack aimed at children aged 11 to 14 years.



But a school governor from Kent took a legal challenge against the Government for subjecting his 11 and 14-year-old sons to political propaganda in the classroom: “I wish my children to have the best education possible, free from bias and political spin, and Mr Gore’s film falls far short of the standard required”.



During the hearing the Court was informed that Al Gore’s film contained serious scientific inaccuracies, that it was ‘politically partisan’, and was being used by the Government to ‘brainwash’ children about global warming.



As part of the evidence, it was pointed out that Al Gore had admitted it was appropriate to exaggerate the facts on global warming in order to get the message across.



The Judge ruled that schools were required to warn children before showing the film that it contained “partisan political views”, as well as pointing out the eleven serious inaccuracies. These included a claim that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people, when the evidence shows sea levels are expected to rise by only 40cm or so over the next hundred years and that there is no threat of mass migration.



In fact, Al Gore’s claim in the movie that rising sea levels had already caused the evacuation of some Pacific islands to New Zealand, remains as untrue now – 14 years later – as it was back then. 



The court case highlighted the fact that in Britain school children are protected from political propaganda through an amendment to their Education Act which requires political issues to be presented in a balanced manner.



Section 406 forbids … the promotion of partisan political views in the teaching of any subject in the school. And if political issues are brought to the attention of pupils, Section 407 requires… they are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views.



Since New Zealand’s Education Act has no such safeguards to protect children from political propaganda, in 2008 the NZCPR petitioned Parliament to have similar clauses introduced.



The Ministry of Education [responded](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3607019/An-Inconvenient-Truth-sparks-school-indoctrination-debate) to our petition, saying sufficient safeguards already existed through the professionalism and common sense of school boards, principals and teachers – as well as a Code of Ethics for Registered Teachers that requires them to present material in a balanced manner. 



The Education Bill that is now before Parliament – and the infiltration of propaganda into the school curriculum by activist groups – shows the fallacy of that response. It is imperative that our education system be free from political bias. Surely, its time Kiwi children had the same safeguard in law as their British counterparts.

Wall of infamy Art Installation
James Delingpole, and other prominent British skeptics, have been immortalised on an art installation “wall of infamy”.
According to James;
I am one of several climate change sceptics to have been celebrated and immortalised in an exciting new, prizewinning art installation at Anglia Ruskin, one of Britain’s largest universities. (h/t Liam Deacon)
It comprises a faux-stone slab (made out of plywood) engraved with my own name and that of five other British climate sceptics – Christopher Booker, Nigel Lawson, Christopher Monckton, Melanie Phillips, Owen Paterson – beneath the legend “Lest We Forget Those Who Denied.” The sculpture has been described as an “oil painting with a difference” because a continuous stream of engine oil drools symbolically over the “deniers’” names, like tragic sea otters after an Exxon spill.

I must say I’m a little jealous of my friend James. Where is my art installation wall of infamy? I mean, how many of these climate articles do I have to write?
Given the amount of publicity this political stunt has generated for the artist who created it, hopefully there will be some copycat attempts before too long. Please make sure you get the spelling of my name correct – that is “Worrall” with an “A”.

"Dr David Evans
BSc, BE-EE, MA (Sydney), MS-EE, MS-Stat, PhD EE (Stanford)
[A slightly shorter version of this article appeared in The Australian newspaper on Friday 18 July 2008.]
I devoted six years to carbon accounting, building models for the Australian Greenhouse Office. I am the rocket scientist who wrote the carbon accounting model (FullCAM) that measures Australia’s compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, in the land use change and forestry sector. FullCAM models carbon flows in plants, mulch, debris, soils and agricultural products, using inputs such as climate data, plant physiology, and satellite data. I’ve been following the global warming debate closely for years.

When I started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty good -CO2 is a greenhouse gas, the old ice core data, no other suspects. The evidence was not conclusive, but why wait until we were certain when it appeared we needed to act quickly? Soon government and the scientific community were working together, and lots of science research jobs were created. We scientists had political support, the ear of government, big budgets, and we felt fairly important and useful (well, I did anyway). It was great. We were working to save the planet!
But since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming, and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon plays only a minor role and is not the main cause of the recent global warming. As Lord Keynes famously said, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”
There has not been a public debate about the causes of global warming and most of the public and our decision makers are not aware of the most basic salient facts:
1. The greenhouse signature is missing. We have been looking and measuring for years, and cannot find it.
Each possible cause of global warming has a different pattern of where in the planet the warming occurs first and the most. The signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hotspot about 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics. We have been measuring the atmosphere for decades using radiosondes – weather balloons with thermometers that radio back the temperature as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere. They show no hotspot whatsoever. Not a little hotspot, but none at all.
If there is no hotspot then an increased greenhouse effect is not the cause of the global warming. So we now know for sure that carbon emissions are not a significant cause of the global warming. If we had found the greenhouse signature then I would be an alarmist again.
When the signature was found to be missing in 2007 (after the latest IPCC report), alarmists objected that maybe the readings of the radiosonde thermometers might not be accurate and maybe the hotspot is there but went undetected. Yet hundreds of radiosondes have given the same answer, so statistically it is not possible that they missed the hotspot. Recently the alarmists have suggested we ignore the radiosonde thermometers, but instead take the radiosonde wind measurements, apply a theory about wind shear, and run the results through their computers to estimate the temperatures. They then say that the results show that we cannot rule out the presence of a hotspot. If you believe that you believe anything.
2. There is no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming. None.
There is plenty of evidence that global warming has occurred, and theory suggests that carbon emissions should raise temperatures (though by how much is hotly disputed), but there are no observations that implicate carbon emissions as a significant cause of the recent global warming. The world has spent $50b on global warming since 1990, and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming. Evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time that support the idea that carbon emissions cause global warming. Computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence, they are just theory.
3. The satellites that measure the world’s temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001, and that the temperature has dropped about 0.6C in the last year (to the temperature of 1980). Land based temperature readings are corrupted by the ‘urban heat island’ effect – urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro-climate around the thermometer, due to vegetation changes, concrete, cars, houses. Satellite data is the only temperature data we can trust, but it only goes back to 1979. NASA report only land based data, and report a modest warming trend and recent cooling. The other three global temperature records use a mix of satellite and land measurements, or satellite only, and they all show no warming since 2001 and a recent cooling.
4. The new ice cores shows that in the past six global warmings over the past half a million years, the temperature rises occurred on average 800 years before the accompanying rise in atmospheric carbon. Which says something important about which was cause and which was effect.
None of these four points are controversial. The alarmist scientists agree with them, though they would dispute their relevance.
The last point was known and past dispute by 2003, yet Al Gore made his movie in 2005 and presented the ice cores as the sole reason for believing that carbon emissions cause global warming. In any other political context our cynical and experienced press corps would surely have called this dishonest and widely questioned the politician’s assertion.
Until now the global warming debate has merely been an academic matter of little interest. Now that it matters, we should debate the causes of global warming.
So far that debate has just consisted of a simple sleight of hand: show evidence of global warming, and while the audience is stunned at the implications, simply assert that it is due to carbon emissions. In the mind of the audience, the evidence that global warming has occurred becomes conflated with the alleged cause, and the audience hasn’t noticed that the cause was merely asserted, not proved. If there really was any evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming, don’t you think we would have heard all about it ad naseum by now?
The Labor Government is about to deliberately wreck the economy in order to reduce carbon emissions. If the reasons later turn out to be bogus, the electorate is not going to re-elect a Labor government for a long time. When it comes to light that the carbon scare was known to be bogus in 2008, the ALP is going to be regarded as criminally negligent or ideologically stupid for not having seen through it. And if the Liberals support the general thrust of their actions, they will be seen likewise.
The onus should be on those who want to change things to provide evidence for why the changes are necessary. The Australian public is eventually going to have to be told the evidence anyway, so it might as well be before wrecking the economy. It is the job of our opposition politicians and press to demand the evidence from the relevant minister, Penny Wong.
And what is going to happen over the next decade as the global temperature continues not to rise? When the public find out that all the above points were known in 2008, might they feel deceived, furious at the futility of the economic sacrifices?
Who is going to be held responsible? Perhaps the political class, for not having the wit to examine the evidence? Maybe the press, for not have not done even the most elementary job of informing a debate and asking questions? (If any of the missing signature, the lack of actual evidence, the lack of temperature rises since 2001, or the 800 year lag of CO2 in the ice cores are news to you, then no, your press has not been keeping you well informed.)
Don’t you think some evidence is required before wrecking the economy? Someone simply has to demand to see evidence. You will find that there is none.

Last week the Trump administration announced its intent to freeze Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (CAFE) at 2020 levels. Rules implemented in 2012 under the Obama administration would require a fleet average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025, but the new rule change would instead hold average fuel economy at about 37 mpg.   
  
Predictably, the announcement created a flurry of criticism, with the _New York Times_ editorial board characterizing the plan as reckless in the face of climate change. Much of this criticism misses a key point: CAFE has been repurposed to manage a problem for which it was not designed and is thus a very costly and imperfect remedy.   
  
Enacted after the 1973-74 oil shock, CAFE was a political solution to a political problem: soaring oil prices. The standards were premised on the belief that consumers would not pay more for cars that used less fuel even if the reduced fuel use more than paid for the extra initial cost. Instead, CAFE sought to force automakers to produce higher mileage cars and thereby reduce fuel use despite the supposed myopia of consumers. But subsequent economic research has shown that consumers were not myopic. Consumers’ willingness to pay for higher mileage capability approximately equals the expected future fuel cost savings without government intervention.   
  
Even though the original rationale for CAFE has been undermined by the evidence, CAFE lives on with a new purpose: climate change. Since the 2007 Supreme Court decision in _Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency_ that the EPA has authority to regulate tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions, CAFE has become a tool for CO2 emissions reduction. But, as I have previously argued and my colleague Randal O’Toole recently discussed, CAFE is an inefficient and clumsy tool because it targets only one source of greenhouse gas emissions and it does so indirectly. Directly taxing carbon emissions would much more effectively incentivize businesses and consumers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The indirect CAFE program costs the economy at least six times as much as a carbon tax that reduces emissions equivalently. If reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a worthwhile goal, we should pursue policies that directly address the problem and utilize market forces to reduce emissions.   




Another key component of the Trump administration’s plan is its proposal to revoke a waiver that allows California to set its own vehicle emissions standards and allows other states to follow California’s lead. Currently, California standards are set to continue on the Obama 2012 path. So, if the Trump administration freezes national standards but California’s separate standards are permitted, then automakers would be forced either to sell different cars in California and the states that follow its lead or comply with California standards in all states.   
  
The origin of the California waiver, like CAFE in general, is divorced from its original intent. The waiver’s purpose was to allow California to impose its own regulations on conventional emissions because of unique weather and geographic conditions around Los Angeles that make it especially susceptible to smog.   
  
Smog forming pollutants and greenhouse gases are very different emissions. As I noted in the 2017 _Cato Handbook for Policymakers_ , regulation of pollutants that affect local air quality should be decentralized because both the costs and benefits are local. But reduction of CO2 emissions is a global public good. Any benefits accrue to the world’s climate even though the costs are local. This mismatch between the geographic incidence of costs and benefits imply that a waiver that exempts one state makes no sense in the context of CO2 emissions and has the potential to unduly increase compliance costs for automakers.   
  
CAFE should have ended a long time ago. The problem for which it was designed (consumer myopia) never existed. Because that is not politically possible the proposed freeze is defensible. In contrast state control of conventional pollutants is appropriate, but the California waiver should not be repurposed for greenhouse gas emissions.

From The GWPF:
Each year since 1995, the nations of the world have gathered to try to reach a global agreement on carbon dioxide emissions. These ‘Conferences of the Parties’, or COPs as they are usually termed, involve all of the members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and take place towards the end of the year. This year will see the twenty-first COP take place in Paris. Over the years the COPs have developed a style all of their own. Indeed, some observers have even gone as far as to suggest that each year sees less and less by way of meaningful activity, and more and more liturgy and ritual. They may just have a point.

"**The UN has urged Ethiopian authorities to ensure the protection of civilians as the army plans to attack the capital of the northern region of Tigray.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Sunday announced a 72-hour deadline for the region's fighters to surrender.
The army warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that soldiers would ""encircle"" the city and attack it.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting.
The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
The authorities have to guarantee the safety of aid workers and civilians, Catherine Sozi, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ethiopia, told news agency Reuters.
Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth said that ""Ethiopia has a duty to spare from harm even those who stay in Mekelle, not just threaten that 'there will be no mercy'.""
On Sunday an Ethiopian army spokesman told residents of the city to ""save themselves"" before an offensive in the city began.
The Ethiopian government has accused TPLF forces of destroying infrastructure including the airport in the ancient tourist town of Aksum, state-affiliated Fana news site reports.
It shared images of a ploughed runway, accusing the fighters of harming the region's economy.
The TPLF has not commented on the accusations but its leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency on Sunday that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he said.
The government said its troops took over the towns of Adwa, Aksum, Raya and Shire last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: ""Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity.""
Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should ""surrender peacefully"" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces ""in bringing this treasonous group to justice"".
The United Arab Emirates, an influential ally of the Ethiopian government, said it was concerned about the conflict and that it was making contacts around Africa and the world to try to end it.
And on Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation.
Transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out.
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. It held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."

The United Nations recently concluded a five‐​week conference in Rome aimed at finalizing a treaty establishing a permanent international criminal court. The advertised mission of the court is to investigate, indict and try future war criminals. But as it did with last year’s Kyoto climate change treaty and the Ottawa landmine treaty before it, the Clinton administration has negotiated another international agreement that stands no chance of being ratified by the U.S. Senate. But don’t be misled: this court could still have dangerous consequences for the United States.



For starters, there is the issue of the court’s jurisdiction, which is unprecedented. In fact, the treaty’s proponents have given the court the legal authority to try citizens of nations that haven’t even ratified the document. As State Department spokesman James Rubin has remarked, “Never before has a treaty put itself over those who have not been included in it.” 



What the treaty says is that even if the United States doesn’t ratify the agreement, its citizens can be brought before the court as long as the nation where alleged crimes took place has ratified the treaty. In other words, American troops stationed in foreign lands could find themselves arrested and prosecuted by the court. Paradoxically, the treaty also says that the nations that ratify the agreement can opt out of the court’s jurisdiction over war crimes for seven years, while citizens of those nations that do not ratify the treaty can be subjected to the court’s jurisdiction immediately.



Not ratifying the international criminal court treaty does not necessarily mean that the United States will be exempt from paying for its operation. 



More worrisome still is the inclusion of the yet‐​to‐​be‐​defined crime of “aggression” in the court’s expansive jurisdiction. According to the Rome debates, “aggression” could eventually include such things as the “bombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State” and “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State.” Including those actions under “aggression” will reduce the military options available to the United States by outlawing preemptive strikes and the kind of naval blockade President Kennedy employed during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That has U.S. policymakers worried. As Department of Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon has explained, “What we’re concerned about is that the court not be set up in a way that gives it very broad authority to pursue a vague definition of aggression that could be confused with legitimate defensive action to protect our national security interests.” 



The court also could jeopardize future U.S. efforts to resolve international conflicts. For example, if the court indicts the leaders of a warring faction while the United States is trying to conduct peace talks, that faction may respond by rejecting the resulting peace plan or staying away from the negotiating table altogether. That result would lead to more death and destruction, not less. In fact, according to former British envoy David Owen, a similar scenario unfolded in Bosnia in 1993 when the Serb faction rejected the Vance‐​Owen peace plan out of “fear that skeletons in their cupboard, such as massacres and war crimes, would be uncovered by the United Nations if they accepted the peace plan.” The result: the Bosnian war dragged on for another 18 months.



Furthermore, the court could destabilize future U.S.-led peacekeeping operations and endanger American lives in the process. Suppose the court handed down a verdict that the leaders of one faction had to pay reparations or return conquered territory to the victims of another faction, U.S. peacekeeping troops on the ground could find themselves in the messy position of either enforcing or refusing to enforce the court’s judgment. Either way, one faction will be upset and U.S. peacekeepers will be caught in the middle — a prospect that adds one more reason to get out of the peacekeeping business altogether.



Finally, not ratifying the international criminal court treaty does not necessarily mean that the United States will be exempt from paying for its operation. That’s because the court’s funding will be derived, in part, from the United Nation’s general budget. If historical contribution rates apply and the United States resumes making payments to the U.N. budget, 25 percent of the court’s costs could be passed on to American taxpayers.



Thus, even though the international criminal court treaty is not likely to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, it still threatens to compromise your national security and your pocketbook — a bad deal that only the United Nations could cook up.

Butterflies heat up the field of solar research
The humble butterfly could hold the key to unlocking new techniques to make solar energy cheaper and more efficient, pioneering new research has shown.
A team of experts from the University of Exeter has examined new techniques for generating photovoltaic (PV) energy – or ways in which to convert light into power.
They showed that by mimicking the v-shaped posture adopted by Cabbage White butterflies to heat up their flight muscles before take-off, the amount of power produced by solar panels can increase by almost 50 per cent.

Crucially, by replicating this ‘wing-like’ structure, the power-to-weight ratio of the overall solar energy structure is increased 17-fold, making it vastly more efficient.
The research by the team from both the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) and the Centre for Ecology and Conservation, based at the University of Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall, is published in the leading scientific journal, Scientific Reports.
Professor Tapas Mallick, lead author of the research said: “Biomimicry in engineering is not new. However, this truly multidisciplinary research shows pathways to develop low cost solar power that have not been done before.”
The Cabbage White butterflies are known to take flight before other butterflies on cloudy days – which limit how quickly the insects can use the energy from the sun to heat their flight muscles.
This ability is thought to be due to the v-shaped posturing, known as reflectance basking, they adopt on such days to maximise the concentration of solar energy onto their thorax, which allows for flight.
Furthermore, specific sub-structures of the butterflies’ wings allow the light from the sun to be reflected most efficiently, ensuring that the flight muscles are warmed to an optimal temperature as quickly as possible.
The team of scientists therefore investigated how to replicate the wings to develop a new, lightweight reflective material that could be used in solar energy production.
The team found that the optimal angle by which the butterfly should hold its wings to increase temperature to its body was around 17 degrees, which increased the temperature by 7.3 degrees Centigrade compared to when held flat.
They also showed that by replicating the simple mono-layer of scale cells found in the butterfly wings in solar energy producers, the could vastly improve the power-to-weight rations of future solar concentrators, making them significantly lighter and so more efficient.
Professor Richard ffrench-Constant, who conducts world-leading research into butterfly mimicry at the University of Exeter, said: “This proves that the lowly Cabbage White is not just a pest of your cabbages but actually an insect that is an expert at harvesting solar energy.”
The paper, White butterflies as solar photovoltaic concentrators, by Katie Shanks, Dr Senthilarasu Sundaram, Professor Richard ffrench-Constant and Professor Tapas Mallick from the University of Exeter, is available online.

"Dear Premier and Members,
The Carbon Sense Coalition was formed in Queensland by Australians, including many Queenslanders who have been closely involved, some at senior levels, in the backbone industries and public service activities of the Sunshine State. Some still are. Some have been participants, commentators and observers of the Queensland political scene for longer than most members of the current parliament.
They are all motivated by concern at the biggest politically generated threat to every Queensland industry, to the outlook for jobs for our kids, to the cost of living, and to the continued flow of revenue to the State. That threat is an Emissions Trading System, its carbon taxes and all the asset destruction that will flow from it.

There have been several reports of temperature data fudging by the authorities, the most recent by Paul Homewood on several stations in Paraguay.
While exploring long temperature records in Australia, I discovered a particularly egregious example of temperature changing at Adelaide Airport. GISS now offers easy access to their several sets of data for each station: unadjusted (I assume this is the raw data.), adjusted (I assume this is after TOBs, time of observation, and moving adjustments), adjusted after cleaning (whatever that is), and the final step, after adjustments, cleaning, and homogenization.
Infusion of more error?
Homogenization is supposed to correct for urban heat island problems, but it is nearly always used to cool the past, rather than cooling the present or heating the past, the opposite of what an urban heat island correction should be. But I digress.
Here is the Adelaide Airport record before any adjustments:

Figure 1: Adelaide Airport unadjusted temperature record. The top trace is the annual average summer (December, January, and February) temperatures, the middle is the annual average meteorological year, and the bottom is the average winter (June, July, and August) temperatures, all with trend lines. On all these images, click on the image for a high resolution version.
Note in Figure 1 that all the trends are negative, that is, it has been cooling since the turn of the twentieth century, for over the last 100 years, particularly in the summer months. The warmest year was 1914. The warmest summer was in 1880!
Now let us look at the “adjusted” data:

Figure 2: Adelaide Airport after “adjustment”, also with trend lines.
Note that in Figure 2 we see warming, annually, and in all seasons. The warmest year is now 2007, though the warmest summer is still 1880 by a small fraction of degree. But the strange thing about this adjustment is this:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 3: Adjustment applied to Figure 1 to produce Figure 2.
Note that from 1880 to 1947, the adjustment is exactly minus one degree, in all months, all seasons, and all years. It is a blanket, obvious, fudge! Someone got lazy. Instead of attempting to figure out an actual time of observation or move adjustment, they simply slapped on a minus one degree change, and magically, the cooling trend went away. But they were not finished! There is still homogenization to be performed, the finishing touch!

Figure 4: Adelaide Airport after all adjustments and homogenization.
Homogenization now adds another tenth of a degree to the warming temperature trends. How much was the change?

Figure 5: Homogenization adjustment applied to Figure 2 to result in Figure 4.
These changes further cool the past and mostly leave the present unchanged. The changes are the same for all months, season, and years for twenty or more year stretches.
I found the Australian BOM description for their adjustments for Adelaide. They do not resemble the adjustments seen above. They are changes to Tmax and Tmin, are in both positive and negative directions. Changes to Tmax + Tmin sometimes nearly cancel out. (If Tmax is adjusted up and Tmin is adjusted down by the same amount, Tmean will not change.) And the steps are in different years from that above.

Figure 6: Screen grab from an Australian BOM pdf document found here. Click on the image for a clearer version.
Hiding the cooling
It should be obvious to all that these adjustments to the raw temperature data are an attempt to hide the long-term cooling temperature trend at Adelaide. These changes to the temperature data begs us to examine all station data for similar changes. Is global warming real or just a  product of pencil, pen, and computer?

"Some winter nights when my heart is tight, I take the F train from work to stand on the sidewalk in front of the   window at Lucali, the famed, candlelit pizzeria on Henry Street in Brooklyn, and watch Mark Iacono make pizza. His movements are slow, deliberative. They resemble a jungle cat, grooming. The dough moves back and forth in his hands, slowly growing in circumference. Iacono barely looks at it. He looks at the people in the dining room, though his gaze is   unfocused. His   is a meditation.   should be a meditation. I go home and make pizza. On other suffering evenings, I walk down the echoing corridors and ramps of Grand Central Terminal and make my way to a stool in the Oyster Bar for a pan roast. I like the cherrystone version better than the oyster one and, especially, the rich interplay of the clam juice and the cream, the way it soaks into the toast points floating in the center of the bowl. I do not make pan roasts at home. Pan roasts should be made only in the steam kettles of the Grand Central Oyster Bar. But I do make clam chowder, and I float toast points on top of it, and that is what John Cheever called a triumph over chaos, every time. Lately I’ve been doing both, at once:   pizza, a balm against the pain of the world. It was probably Frank Pepe who invented the clam pizza, in New Haven, scattering freshly shucked littlenecks onto a round of dough, then pecorino cheese, garlic, oregano, black pepper and a torrent of olive oil. That was in the 1940s, according to his family, which still operates Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana on Wooster Street there. Clam pizza moved south in the decades that followed, to New York City. Lombardi’s put one on the menu. Franny’s made one, makes it still. Otto. Motorino. Moto. Most recently, Pasquale Jones. Some are built on the Frank Pepe model. Franny’s omits cheese altogether. Moto adds potatoes. Motorino’s is dressed with fior di latte mozzarella in addition to the clams. They are all the best pizza. Clams are on them. Quibble all you like, but a clam pizza is the very best pizza in the world. My recipe honors no one particular preparation of the pie. It honors all of them, and the teachings of Iacono and the Oyster Bar as well. It uses as sauce the building blocks of a classic clam chowder  —   alliums slowly fried with bacon, then infused with clam juice and wine, reduced to a glaze and thickened with cream  —   and tops it with chopped clams, lemon zest and a spray of hot pepper flakes. I spread these elixirs across homemade pizza dough, a recipe I learned from another pizza guru, Anthony Falco, until recently the pizza czar at Roberta’s in Bushwick. But you could use them on   dough and still have a good pizza. Or on slices of sourdough bread, or an old running shoe. Just work slowly as you make it, being present in the moment of creation. Cooking is a practice, a kind of devotion, a form of mindfulness. Practice. Recipe:   Pizza"
"**Ethiopia's prime minister has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance on the capital, Mekelle.**
Abiy Ahmed told Tigrayan leaders they were ""at a point of no return"".
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting.
The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
Earlier the Ethiopian military warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that the army would ""encircle"" the city and attack it with artillery fire.
""There will be no mercy,"" a spokesman said.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he told Reuters news agency.
The government said its troops took over some key towns last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: ""Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity.""
Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should ""surrender peacefully"" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces ""in bringing this treasonous group to justice"".
On Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation.
Communication and transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out.
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate.
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."

"By Dirck T. Hartmann Thursday, July 3, 2008
(Editor’s Note: To many in the know, Dirck T. Hartmann, who worked on the Apollo Space Program and many other significant NASA projects, was a fighter pilot in WWII, flying P38s. So when this gifted scientist/engineer/physicist and 87-year-old hero felt compelled to answer the questions of Man Made Global Warming, not only his son and grandchildren knew he had something to say with factual substance, truth and knowledge. What he has to say is clear and concise and should be read by everyone.)
What is your carbon footprint? That is the wrong question to ask. A more meaningful question is – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the wheat required to produce a loaf of bread? Or – How much carbon dioxide does it take to grow the corn for the chicken feed required to produce a dozen eggs?

Far from being a pollutant, man along with every animal on land, fish in the sea, and bird in the air is totally dependent on atmospheric carbon dioxide for his food supply.
Some politicians complain that the United States with only 3% of the world population uses 25% of the energy. But the clean carbon dioxide which we produce is increasing food production everywhere on earth. China, on the other hand, is building new power plants at a record rate using the abundant domestic supply of coal they have and has now passed the United States as the leading producer of carbon dioxide. Although their coal has a high sulfur content, they are building the new plants without any pollution controls. The sulfur dioxide which these power plants are releasing to the atmosphere, besides smelling like rotten eggs is, in sunlight, readily converted to sulfur trioxide, the highly solublegas responsible for most acid rain.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, using energy from sunlight, convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuels. It is responsible for all the fuel that feeds forest fires, and for the rapid grow-back of fuel after a fire. But even with the hundreds of millions of tons of coal and the billions of barrels of oil and gasoline that are burned annually, the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere remains about .04%.
It has been estimated that more than two hundred billion tons of atmospheric carbon are fixed yearly by photosynthesis, 10% to 20% by land plants, and the remaining 80% to 90% by plant plankton and algae in the ocean, which constantly resupply us with oxygen. Atmospheric carbon dioxide acts like a thermostat for plant growth, increases triggering vast blooms of ocean algae, and spurts in the rate of growth of land plants. As long as man burns coal and oil responsibly, that is with pollution controls that minimize the production of acid rain, the earth can never have too much carbon dioxide. The plants will not permit it.
Anyone who has lived in a desert area where the relative humidity is frequently below 5%, knows that dry air is a lousy green house gas. It can be 115 degrees F (46 degrees C) during the day yet cool off so rapidly that a sweater is needed two or three hours after sunset. Despite the heat sink of the ground with rocks hot enough to fry an egg, the heat is radiated rapidly away through the dry air to the clear night sky. Since dry desert air has about the same .04% concentration of carbon dioxide as air everywhere else, it is not credible to conclude that carbon dioxide is causing global warming
Water vapor is the most effective greenhouse gas by far. With high humidity, even without cloud cover, the night air cools at a rate so slow as to be nearly imperceptible, particularly if you are trying to sleep without air conditioning.
High humidity is the reason nights are so balmy in the tropics. At 100 degrees F and 100% relative humidity, water vapor accounts for only 2% of the atmosphere. It has a greater effect than all other greenhouse gases combined but, since it cannot be regulated, is rarely mentioned as a greenhouse gas.
If human activity is not the cause, why are the ice sheets on the earth poles receding? They are melting for the same reason that the polar caps on Mars are melting. For the 200 years or so that a record of sun spot activity has been kept, it has been observed that global temperatures on earth correlate closely with sun spot activity, very low activity corresponding to a mini ice age, and high activity to global warming.
Every second the sun converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium, consuming its mass at the rate of 4 million tons per second. It has been doing this for 4.5 billion years and has about 4.5 billion years to go before all its hydrogen is used up. At that time it will have consumed less than 1% of its mass. This enormous solar furnace is responsible for climate change as well as all weather on earth.
The U.S. has a domestic supply of coal that is alone sufficient to meet our present power needs and projections for growth for at least 1,000 years, even without building any new nuclear power plants. Burning the coal responsibly and releasing the carbon locked up in it as clean carbon dioxide will benefit crop yields all over the earth. The great atmospheric patterns of air movements ensure a steady supply of carbon dioxide for crop growth, and a steady supply of oxygen for animals and people. To increase the rate at which photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a respected scientist proposed to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, seeding the ocean to trigger algae blooms. This practical, inexpensive, highly effective means for sequestering carbon dioxide would benefit the food chain in the oceans and increase fish populations. But because it did not impose hardships, require trading carbon credits, punish the U.S. or any other nation, or require increased governmental control, the IPCC rejected it. The IPCC uses the hoax of man made global warming to increase its power and that of a corrupt, anti-American United Nations that has proven itself impotent in combating world wide acts of terrorism, genocide in Sudan, the real threat of nuclear proliferation in the mid-east from Iran and Syria, or human rights violations in China and Africa.
Our mainstream media uses every opportunity to hype the hoax of man made global warming by repeated reporting of data and events that appear to support it, and ignoring those that contradict it. When the NFC championship game In 2007 between the Packers and the New York Giants was played at Green Bay in record low temperatures and blizzard conditions, there was no mention of global cooling; nor was there any in 2007 when below freezing temperatures threatened the vegetable crops in the south and the citrus crops in Florida. The drought in California is the result of colder than normal conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the fact that ocean temperatures along the Pacific coast have been falling for the last three years is never mentioned. But after hurricane Katrina we were fed a host of dire predictions which warned of the increasing severity of storms, the melting of the polar ice caps, and the flooding of coastal areas from rising sea level, if we do not drastically reduce the release of greenhouse gasses to combat global warming. Which greenhouse gasses is not specified. We already have pollution controls in the smokestacks of most power plants, steel mills, and factories that minimize the release of sulfur dioxide.
The only completely uncontrolled exhaust gas is carbon dioxide, and photosynthesis automatically controls its atmospheric concentration for us.
Three billion years ago when the earth’s atmosphere was an unbreathable brew of noxious gases with almost no oxygen, a small green algae evolved in the ocean which, using the energy from sunlight over a few million years, completely altered the earth’s atmosphere. This oceanic green algae, the first plant to use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into high energy fuel, was of course followed by the evolution of an almost limitless number and variety of carbon dioxide consuming plants.
Fortunately for mankind and all animals, fish,and birds, all of whom are totally dependent on plants, the oceanic green algae continues to perform its magic in the oceans of the earth today. Every three centuries all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and dissolved in the waters of the earth goes through the cycle photosynthesis, decay, photosynthesis, with the cycle constantly renewing the earth’s supply of oxygen.
People on the left claim global warming is real, a threat to the continued existence of mankind, and the debate as to its cause is over! Although none of this is true, it nevertheless is what four of my grandchildren were taught in high school. Most politicians on the left have little respect for truth and no regard for clarity, and apparently many high school teachers reflect their views. My oldest granddaughter just graduated from MITwhere she was spared the political rhetoric of the left on global warming. However Caltech’s Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry, in an article titled “Powering the Planet” states “The carbon dioxide we produce over the next 40 years, and its associated effects will last for a timescale comparable to modern human history. This is why, within the next 20 years we either solve this problem or the world will never be the same.” This is nonsense. It ignores the more than 200 billion tons of carbon that is sequestered yearly through photosynthesis from carbon dioxide In the atmosphere. Since this has been known for 40 years, I can only assume he is politically motivated to make such a statement. Hopefully man made global warming will come to be recognized for the hoax it truly is.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
“New Actions to Reduce Methane Emissions Will Curb Climate Change, Cut Down on Wasted Energy” reads the headline from Wednesday’s White House blog, posted by Counselor to the President John Podesta (who will be leaving this post soon to serve as a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presumed 2016 presidential campaign).   
  
Let’s hope Podesta didn’t write the title, because it is completely wrong.   
  
First off, methane isn’t energy. It’s a gas. Like anything else, it can be converted to energy, and like a fuel the conversion process produces more energy than it takes to perform it. But methane leaks from the oil and gas sectors no more represent “wasted energy” than does cow flatulence.   
  
More accurately, methane leaks represent lost revenue. Or at least they would if natural gas prices were higher. With prices as low as they are, companies sometime find it more costly to stop the leaks than what they gain by capturing the methane and bringing it to market.   
  
Consider that the price of natural gas is so low in many regions where oil is being extracted from tight shale deposits (for example, the Bakken region of North Dakota and in west Texas) that the methane that is produced along with the oil is simply flared (burned) on site, rather than being captured and brought to market. It is more expensive to develop the transport infrastructure (largely it has to be transported via pipeline) than the return on the sale of natural gas.   
  
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that in 2013, more than 260 billion cubic feet of methane was flared in the United States. In essence, this methane represented more “unwanted” energy than “wasted” energy.   




But methane flaring is not the target of the new EPA regulations; instead, methane leakage is. In fairness, when it comes to climate change, on a unit basis, leaked methane is more important than flared methane, because the flaring process converts the methane to carbon dioxide (among other things), which has a much lower “global warming potential” than does methane.   
  
This “global warming potential” is why methane leakage is targeted in the first place by the Obama administration—it is another “we are doing something about climate change” excuse for increasing the reach of the federal government.   
  
The amount of methane that falls under the new EPA regs is very small; in the grand scheme of global warming, it is so small as to be climatically immaterial (which is the other thing wrong with Podesta’s blog headline—it won’t “curb” climate change a whit).   
  
In 2013, methane emissions accounted for about 9% of greenhouse gases emitted in the United States. (Carbon dioxide accounted for 82%.) Of this 9%, about 3% are the subject to the proposed EPA regulations—which seeks to cut those emissions in half.   
  
So how much “climate change” would such regulation avert in the future? Here’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation:   
  
Using our handy dandy temperature savings calculator, you can find out that if the United States were to cease all carbon dioxide emissions now and forever, the amount of global warming that would be “saved” amounts to 0.10°C by the end of the century (assuming a 2.0°C climate sensitivity, which is more realistic than the 3.0°C value the EPA is fond of). So if halting 87% of our greenhouse gas emissions produces a saving of 0.10°C, then halting 1.5% of our greenhouse gas emissions produces about 0.002°C of temperature savings.   
  
That’s it. Two-thousandths of a degree of warming averted by the new EPA regulations!   
  
Perhaps what is most odd with the newly proposed regulations is that in their absence, methane emissions from the natural gas and oil sector, according to the EPA’s own data, have declined about 10% since 2008—a time when U.S. oil and natural gas production has skyrocketed.   
  
In fact, all of this decline has come from the natural gas industry. (Methane emissions from oil production has actually increased slightly.) Why? Largely because natural gas producers want to limit losses of the very thing they are trying to produce. Consequently, they have developed and employed new technologies to prevent leakage all along the line from drilling, to transportation, to processing. Undoubtedly, they will continue to do this in the future.   
  
So, the ongoing and self-incentivized trend toward declining emissions, along with an imperceptible influence on global warming, means that the newly proposed methane regulations from the EPA are completely unneeded.   
  
This leads to the conclusion that they are being imposed for appearance’s sake only—appearing to burnish President Obama’s climate legacy with an eye toward increasing his clout during this December’s United Nations climate meeting. There, in Paris, he is going to champion a new, “legally binding” treaty on climate change. The same was supposed to happen during the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, where posturing hype was the order of the year. That didn’t work out very well, as the meeting was a complete failure. We anticipate a similar result will come out of Paris.

In an exceptionally brilliant piece of bluff calling, Professor Andrew Parker of St John’s College at Oxford University trolled the idiotic students at one of the UK’s most prestigious educational establishments.



Two students at St John’s College wrote to Andrew Parker, the principal bursar, this week requesting a meeting to discuss the protesters’ demands, which are that the college “ **declares a climate emergency and immediately divests from fossil fuels** ”. They say that the college, the richest in Oxford, has £8 million of its £551 million endowment fund invested in BP and Shell.



Professor Parker responded with a provocative offer. “I am not able to arrange any divestment at short notice,” he wrote. “ **But I can arrange for the gas central heating in college to be switched off with immediate effect. Please let me know if you support this proposal**.”



Oh dear, oh dear, 1.45% of the college endowment fund is invested in evil fossil fuels. HOW DARE YOU?



Apparently the students were not amused with the professor’s response and suggested that he was not taking their concerns seriously enough.



Professor Parker responded to that note saying, “You are right that I am being provocative but I am provoking some clear thinking, I hope. It is all too easy to request others to do things that carry no personal cost to yourself. The question is whether you and others are prepared to make personal sacrifices to achieve the goals of environmental improvement (which I support as a goal).”



How very dare you mock us like that, professor?



So **Fergus Green** , the organiser of the wider protest, who is studying for a master’s degree in physics and philosophy at Balliol College, got on his high horse and responded, “This is an inappropriate and flippant response by the bursar to what we were hoping would be a **mature discussion**. It’s January _[winter in the UK]_ and it would be borderline dangerous to switch off the central heating.”



This wonderful exchange beautifully illustrates the shallow thinking of the Gretas of the world, her mates in **Extinction Rebellion** and the **Greens** , **Labour** , **NZ First** and **National** politicians here at home.



They are all demanding [climate emergencies](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/there-is-no-climate-emergency/) and zero emissions and [zero carbon](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/zero-carbon-zero-farms/) etc. We even had our very own [Captain’s Call.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/05/ardern-is-destroying-taranaki/) But when it finally bites and the heating and lighting (and powering the internet) is threatened, these very same idiots are going to declare that it is “ **borderline dangerous**.”



And it will be. 



It will be catastrophic for millions of people, and someone studying physics at one of the top universities in the world seemingly does not have the intelligence to work this out. Fergus wants a “mature discussion.” Well, come back when you have grown up, Fergus.



This is not about bumper sticker slogans, and the professor’s response illustrates the reality of the situation. Our modern society simply cannot eliminate fossil fuels in the short term (If ever).



There are significant costs to real people associated with turning off the gas (or oil) tap and many people could suffer as a result.



The professor has used the only logical and rational response to those demanding an end to fossil fuels: 



**You first**.

"Rosanne Bloom and her family had just settled into their seats on a flight from Philadelphia to Turks and Caicos Islands on Christmas morning when two airline employees ordered Dr. Bloom, her husband and two boys off the plane. Their luggage had already been removed. The problem? Dr. Bloom had informed the crew that her teenage sons had severe nut allergies. “I said, ‘We have our medicine. We brought our own food, and we’re comfortable staying on the plane.’ I offered to sign a waiver,” said Dr. Bloom, an orthodontist in Clarksville, Md. “We were off the plane in two minutes. ” Matt Miller, a spokesman for American Airlines, said such decisions are left to the pilot. “The pilot determined it would be best for the family not to travel based on the severity of the allergy and the need to divert the airline if anyone were eating nuts,” he said. Airline carriers have a long tradition of serving peanuts on flights, and often serve little else. But the practice also presents a challenge to travelers with severe nut allergies, who can suffer a reaction simply by touching a surface that has been exposed to nuts. But tensions between passengers with food allergies and airline staff members have risen in recent years, as airlines have begun to enforce stricter rules related to preboarding passengers. In the past, parents of young children could board the plane early, giving them a chance to wipe down seats, trays and armrests to reduce exposure to allergens. But today many airlines have stopped letting families with children board before other passengers. When families request permission to preboard  —   or pose another request, such as asking whether nuts will be served  —   they risk being taken off the flight or threatened with removal, said Mary Vargas, a lawyer whose family was almost kept off a plane from London back to the United States in December because of a nut allergy. Now families with nut allergies are waging a legal challenge against such policies. Two formal complaints filed with the Department of Transportation in the last month accuse American Airlines of discrimination against passengers with allergies. The complaints cite the airline’s preboarding policy, which  prohibits preboarding specifically for people with allergies, and not for others. “This is about being allowed to fly like everybody else in the United States,” said Ms. Vargas, the lawyer representing the families. Although nobody tracks medical emergencies on airplanes, studies show that   medical emergencies are relatively uncommon and affect only a fraction of the estimated 3. 6 billion passengers who fly each year. Chest pain and cardiovascular events are the most common reason planes are diverted for a medical emergency. Allergic reactions make up fewer than 4 percent of all   medical emergencies, according to a 2013 study published in the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine. Notably, American Airlines, which operates one of the largest fleets of planes in the world, does not even serve peanuts. But it does have a peanut policy, in which it states: “Requests that we not serve any particular foods, including tree nuts, on our flights cannot be granted. We are not able to provide nut ‘buffer zones,’ nor are we able to allow passengers to   to wipe down seats and tray tables. ” “Ultimately we cannot guarantee customers will not be exposed to peanuts or other nuts during the flight, and allowing people with nut allergies to preboard can create a false sense of security and does not eliminate risk,” Mr. Miller said. Individuals who suffer from severe,   food allergies can experience swelling and difficulty breathing after even a mild exposure. They usually carry an   which contains epinephrine, a medication that can reverse the symptoms. But in the case of a severe reaction, a person may still need urgent access to a medical facility. Research has shown that taking steps like creating buffer zones, in which nearby passengers are asked to refrain from eating nut products, and wiping down seats and trays may reduce the risk of an allergic reaction in flight. One of the complaints, filed on Dec. 28, is from Nicole Mackenzie, the mother of a    with   allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and seeds. She was not allowed to preboard to clean the seat before the family’s trip last fall from Portland, Ore. to Charlotte, N. C. The second complaint was filed on Jan. 10 on behalf of Food Allergy Research  Education (FARE) an organization that represents individuals with all kinds of food allergies. “American Airlines’s action was clearly discriminatory,” said FARE’s chief executive officer and chief medical officer, Dr. James Baker Jr. “It has a defined policy that they put on their website, and the only people they single out from preboarding are people with food allergies. ” Lianne Mandelbaum, whose son has allergies, tracks the experiences of travelers with allergies on her website, the No Nut Traveler. She said that each airline makes its own rules but that the policies are inconsistently enforced, so travelers often don’t know what to expect when they make travel plans. “It’s like playing Russian roulette,” said Michael Silverman, a psychologist in New York City whose    daughter, Sydney, has a severe allergy, but who is reluctant to raise the subject for fear of being kicked off a plane. The Department of Transportation is investigating the complaints, officials said, adding in an email that severe allergies are considered a disability under the Air Carrier Access Act, which regulates air travel, if they impact one’s ability to breathe “or substantially impact another major life activity. ” The nut industry has lobbied against restricting nut consumption on airplanes, and Congress has prohibited the Department of Transportation from imposing any restrictions. Some airlines are more accommodating to passengers with food allergies.  Jet Blue will create a   “buffer zone” around an allergic passenger. Southwest will avoid serving peanuts if flight attendants know an allergic passenger is on board. Delta’s policy is also to refrain from serving peanuts if an allergic passenger is onboard. But interviews with nearly a dozen families and young adults with severe allergies suggest that many people worry about being removed from a flight if they ask whether nuts will be served. Ana Govorko, a hospital administrator from Princeton, N. J. said that in July she and her teenage daughter and adult son were ordered off a Lufthansa jet bound from New York for Munich and Trieste, Italy. She had informed the gate attendant that her daughter has severe allergies and she was carrying medication. The family waited in the airport for seven hours, trying to find another flight, while airline employees, “were joking about her allergies,” Ms. Govorko said. “They were very rude. It was shocking. ” Ms. Govorko was able to get on another Lufthansa flight departing from Newark the next day. A Lufthansa spokeswoman, Christina Semmel, said that the Govorkos were allowed to fly after presenting a letter from her daughter’s physician, but Ms. Govorko says she had presented the letter when she tried to board the first flight. Laura Ilsley, a mother of two now living in Travis, Calif. had a similar experience last April, when she and her husband, who is in the military, were flying from Incirlik, Turkey, along with their son and    daughter, who is severely allergic to peanuts. When Ms. Ilsley informed Air France of her daughter’s allergies, the airline’s agents said the crew planned to serve peanuts and would not alter their plans, and said the family was “not welcome on board,” Ms. Ilsley said. Eventually, an Air France manager was able to get the family on a Delta flight, where the crew made an announcement that a child with a severe allergy to peanuts was on board and that pretzels and cookies would be offered instead. “The staff was very kind and it went off without a hitch,” Ms. Ilsley said. In a statement, Air France said the flight crew had “determined it was not in the best interest of the passenger to board the flight on such short notice,” and that “the case was handled with concern for passenger safety as the top priority. ” Dr. Silverman’s daughter, Sydney, said she actually had a very good experience when she flew on Delta from Palm Beach, Fla. back to New York City over the Martin Luther King weekend. A flight attendant noticed she was wiping down her seat and asked if she was allergic to peanuts. Sydney said that she was, but that it was O. K. to serve nuts. Nevertheless, the attendant “turned to the people in the row in front of me and in back of me and asked, ‘Is it O. K. if I don’t serve you peanuts on the flight?’ And they all said yes,” Sydney said. “And then she went on the intercom and said they weren’t going to serve peanuts because someone on the flight has an allergy, and if people brought peanuts to please not eat them. “And it made me feel thankful,” she said. “No one’s ever done anything like that before. ”"
"**The Ethiopian prime minister, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has rejected a request for peace talks as the conflict in Tigray deepens.**
Tigray's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, wrote to the African Union (AU) last week to request talks.
But PM Abiy Ahmed said in a tweet that there would be no dialogue ""until our efforts to ascertain the rule of law are achieved"".
Hundreds have died since the conflict in Ethiopia's northern region erupted.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, following months of worsening tension between Tigrayan leaders and the federal government.
On Friday Mr Debretsion wrote to the AU asking for help. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, on Monday urged the federal government and the Tigray state authorities to engage in dialogue.
But on Tuesday Mr Ahmed said in a series of tweets that he wanted ""to assure Ethiopians again"" that there would be no dialogue until after rule of law was achieved.
He added: ""Our law enforcement operations in Tigray are proceeding as planned: operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended & brought to justice - all of them rapidly coming within reach.""
In other developments:
It is difficult to say but reports indicate hundreds of deaths on both sides.
The national armed forces have killed 550 Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters, the state broadcaster in Ethiopia has said.
The claim has not been independently verified.
In addition, government forces took control of Humera Airport in Tigray, state media reported on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, 17 military personnel, including senior officials, have been arrested, the federal police say.
They are accused of disrupting communications between the Northern Command and the rest of the national armed forces when the Northern Command was attacked last week.
Residents have fled Tigray.
Officials in Sudan, which shares a border with the Tigray region, say at least 6,000 Ethiopians have arrived in the country.
The Sudanese authorities are preparing for a further 200,000 people to cross in the coming days.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The federal government has cut off the phone lines and internet, Alula Solomon, the director of a Tigray media house based in the US told BBC Newsday.
His family, who live in Tigray the border near Sudan, were able to contact him by using Sudanese telephone lines. They have now fled to Sudan.
On Tuesday, Mr Debretsion accused the neighbouring Eritrean government of launching attacks on the Tigrayan state.
The accusation was denied by both the Eritrean government and the Ethiopian national army.
Mr Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea, which began when the TPLF dominated the Ethiopian government. Relations between the TPLF and Eritrea remain extremely bad.
The TPLF was the most powerful bit of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to coronavirus.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
Mr Abiy won the prize in 2019 for his role in resolving the border conflict with Eritrea.
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter border war from 1998-2000, which killed tens of thousands of people.
Although a ceasefire was signed in 2000, the neighbours technically remained at war until July 2018, when Mr Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal."

 ** _Congress should_**



• phase out farm subsidy programs because they are harmful to taxpayers, the economy, and the environment; and  
• eliminate trade protections on agricultural goods while working to pursue liberalization in global markets.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spends $25 billion or more a year on subsidies for farm businesses. The particular amount each year depends on the market prices of crops, the level of disaster payments, and other factors. Most agricultural subsidies go to farmers of a handful of major crops, including wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. Roughly a million farmers and landowners receive federal subsidies, but the payments are heavily tilted toward the largest producers.



Some farm subsidy programs counter adverse fluctuations in prices, revenues, and production. Other programs subsidize farmers’ conservation activities, insurance coverage, product marketing, export sales, research and development, and other activities. Agriculture is no riskier than many other industries, yet the government has created a uniquely large welfare system for farmers.



In 1996, Congress enacted some pro‐​market reforms under the “Freedom to Farm” law. The law allowed farmers greater flexibility in planting and moved toward reliance on market supply and demand. But Congress reversed course in the late 1990s and passed a series of supplemental farm subsidy bills. As a result, subsidies that were expected to cost $47 billion over the seven years of the 1996 law ended up costing $121 billion. In 2002, Congress enacted a farm bill that further reversed the 1996 reforms. The law increased projected subsidy payments, added new crops to the subsidy rolls, and created a new price guarantee scheme called the “countercyclical” program. In 2008, Congress overrode a presidential veto to enact farm legislation that added further subsidies. The law created a permanent disaster program and added a revenue protection program for farmers to lock in profits from high commodity prices. It added a sugar‐​to‐​ethanol program to help keep sugar prices artificially high, and it added new subsidies for “specialty crops” such as fruits and vegetables.



In 2014, Congress passed yet another huge farm bill. The bill changed the structure of subsidies but did not cut the overall level of benefits. The law ended the direct payment program, the countercyclical program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election program. However, it expanded the largest farm subsidy program — crop insurance — and added two new subsidy programs, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program and the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program. When the 2014 farm bill was passed, supporters claimed that it would save taxpayer money, but the opposite has happened. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the ARC and PLC programs will cost billions of dollars a year more than originally promised. The cost of crop insurance is also rising.



All of these subsidies ensure that farm incomes are much higher than the incomes of most other Americans. Farm programs are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do, and they induce overproduction, inflate land prices, and harm the environment. They should be ended, and American farmers should stand on their own two feet in the marketplace.



 _1\. Insurance._ Crop insurance run by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency has become the largest farm program, with annual outlays of about $8 billion. Subsidized insurance protects against various business risks, such as adverse weather, low production, and low revenues. It covers more than 100 crops, but corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat are the main ones. It subsidizes both insurance premiums and the administrative costs of the 19 private insurance companies that offer policies to farmers. The companies receive the subsidies and earn excess profits from the high premiums they charge; but farmers also benefit because the USDA pays about 60 percent of their premium costs, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Indeed, economist Bruce Babcock finds that most farmers make money on insurance over time, receiving more in claims payouts than they pay in premiums. Congress channels the largest portion of farm subsidies through the insurance program to obscure the identities of the wealthy recipients. Under prior farm programs, news stories often identified the millionaires receiving farm subsidies, which was embarrassing to Congress. Insurance subsidies are less transparent and have no income limits, and so Congress has expanded the program over the years.



 _2\. Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)._ This program pays subsidies to farmers if their revenue per acre, or alternatively their county’s revenue per acre, falls below a benchmark or guaranteed amount. Generally, the lower the prices and revenues are, then the larger the subsidies paid out are. More than 20 crops are covered, from wheat and corn to chickpeas and mustard. ARC subsidies fluctuate, but they were about $7 billion in 2016.



 _3\. Price Loss Coverage (PLC)._ This program pays subsidies to farmers based on the average national price of each particular crop compared with the crop’s reference price. The larger the fall in a crop’s price below its reference price, the larger the payout to farmers. PLC subsidies also cover more than 20 crops. PLC subsidies fluctuate, but they were about $2 billion in 2016.



 _4\. Conservation programs._ The USDA runs many farm conservation programs, which cost taxpayers more than $5 billion a year. The largest is the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers about $1.7 billion a year to keep millions of acres of their land out of production.



 _5\. Marketing loans._ This program was created during the New Deal. The original idea was to give farmers a loan at harvest time so that they could hold their crops to sell at a higher price later on. But the program has evolved into just another subsidy program that delivers higher payments to farmers when market prices are low. These subsidies cost about $400 million in 2016.



 _6\. Disaster aid._ The government operates various disaster aid programs for many types of farmers, from wheat growers, to livestock producers, to tree fruit producers. In addition to permanent disaster programs, Congress sometimes distributes additional aid after adverse events. Disaster and supplemental aid costs about $1 billion to $2 billion a year.



 _7\. Marketing and export promotion._ The Agriculture Marketing Service spends about $1.2 billion a year on farm and food promotion activities. The Foreign Agricultural Service spends about $1.4 billion a year on a range of activities, including marketing U.S. farm and food products abroad through 93 foreign offices.



 _8\. Research and other support._ Most American industries fund their own research and development, but the government employs thousands of scientists and other experts to aid the agriculture industry. The USDA spends about $3 billion a year on agriculture and food research at more than 100 locations. The department also provides many other services, such as loan programs for farmers, statistical services, and economic studies.



 _1\. Subsidies redistribute wealth upward._ Farm subsidies transfer the earnings of taxpayers to well‐​off farm businesses and landowners. USDA data show that farm incomes have soared far above average U.S. incomes. In 2014, the average income of farm households was $134,164, which was 77 percent higher than the $75,738 average of all U.S. households. The same year, the median income of farm households was $81,637, which was 52 percent higher than the U.S. median of $53,657.



Although farm programs are advertised as support for small farmers, most subsidies go to the largest farms. Economist Vincent Smith found that the largest 15 percent of farm businesses receive more than 85 percent of all farm subsidies. Over the years, many well‐​known billionaires have received farm subsidies because they are the owners of farmland. Prior to the 2014 farm bill, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) found that 50 people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans received farm subsidies. The new farm bill channels the largest share of subsidies through insurance companies, making it hard to determine the identities of recipients. But in 2015, the GAO found that at least four recipients of crop insurance subsidies have a net worth of more than $1.5 billion.



 _2\. Subsidies damage the economy._ The extent of federal coddling and micromanagement of the agriculture industry is unique. In most industries, market prices balance supply and demand, profits steer investment, businesses take risks, and entrepreneurs innovate to improve quality and reduce costs. Those market mechanisms are blunted and undermined in U.S. agriculture, causing a range of economic harms, including overproduction, distorted land use, distorted choice of crops, inflated land prices, and inadequate cost control.



 _3\. Subsidies are prone to scandal._ Like all government subsidy programs, farm programs are subject to both bureaucratic waste and recipient fraud. One problem is that some farm subsidies are paid improperly as farmers create business structures to get around legal subsidy limits. Another problem is that Congress and the USDA distribute disaster payments in a careless manner, with payments going to farmers who do not need them. The EWG found another boondoggle: the “prevented planting” program covers losses if conditions during a season prevent farmers from planting some areas. EWG found that billions of dollars over the years have been paid to farmers who would not normally have planted the areas included in their USDA claims.



 _4\. Subsidies undermine U.S. trade relations._ Global stability and U.S. security are enhanced when less developed countries achieve economic growth. America can help by encouraging poor nations to adopt free markets and expand their international trade. However, U.S. and European farm subsidies and agricultural import barriers undermine progress on achieving open trading relationships. Federal sugar protections block freer trade within the Americas, for example, while enriching sugar growers and harming U.S. consumers and U.S. food companies that use sugar.



 _5\. Subsidies harm the environment._ Federal farm policies damage the natural environment in numerous ways. For example, subsidies cause overproduction, which draws lower‐​quality farmlands into active production. As a result, areas that might otherwise have been used for parks, forests, grasslands, and wetlands get locked into less efficient agricultural use. Subsidies are also thought to induce excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Producers on marginal lands that have poorer soils and climates tend to use more fertilizers and pesticides, which can cause water contamination problems. Sugar cane production has expanded in Florida because of the federal sugar program, for example, and the phosphorous in fertilizers used by the growers causes damage to the Everglades.



 _6\. Agriculture would thrive without subsidies._ If U.S. farm subsidies were ended and agricultural markets deregulated, farming would change. Different crops would be planted, land usage would change, and some farm businesses would contract while others would expand. But a stronger and more innovative industry would emerge with greater resilience to market fluctuations. Private insurance, other financial tools, and diversification would help cover risks, as they do in other industries.



An interesting example of farmers prospering without subsidies is New Zealand. In 1984, New Zealand ended its farm subsidies, which was a bold stroke because the country is four times more dependent on farming than is the United States. The changes were initially met with resistance, but New Zealand farm productivity, profitability, and output have soared since the reforms. New Zealand farmers cut costs, diversified land use, sought nonfarm income, and developed niche markets such as kiwi fruit. The Federated Farmers of New Zealand argues that that nation’s experience “thoroughly debunked the myth that the farming sector cannot prosper without government subsidies.” That myth needs to be debunked in the United States as well.

Share this...FacebookTwitterImagine an arsonist receiving the Fireman of the Year Award, or Satan being canonized a saint by the Vatican, or Hitler driving a tank into Oslo – to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize!
It all sounds utterly ridiculous, but unbelievably something about as nutty happened recently. Everywhere in the media we read how mega-filmstar Leonardo DiCaprio took his private jet over 12,000 kilometers – to pick up an environmental award! See here and here.

Need to pick up an environmental award in a hurry? We’ve got the ideal private jet! Image cropped at www.gulfstream.com/.
While the millionaire Hollywood star jets-sets across the globe between stays at his mansions, awards and yachts, he likes to preach to the rest of the struggling world on responsible, humble and sustainable living.
DiCaprio’s Dilemma
Probably one of the most telling aspects of the affair is the decision process leading up to this junket. The award in New York City happened to coincide with the Cannes film festival – an event the California-residing Mr. DiCaprio obviously didn’t plan on missing. Yet, he really wanted that image-polishing environmental award as well. In a normal world a normal person in such a dilemma would have foregone one or the other. Indeed if the environment and climate were as important to Mr. DiCaprio as he likes to profess it is, he certainly would have skipped the star-studded Euro-Festival altogether, or if anything at least cut the Cannes fling short and picked up his award on the way back. That, after all, would have sent a clear signal that he is quite serious about the environment and that it precludes material things like Cannes. Remember DiCaprio’s own words:
Climate change is real. It is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire species.”
The other option would have been to skip the environmental award, citing scheduling problems. But that would not have gone over well either. Doing so would have sent the message that having fun at Cannes was more important than the stinking environment and shown that maybe he wasn’t really sincere about the environment.

So you do what people like DiCaprio do in such a bind. You simply flaunt the very rules you profess, and you do both – even if it means clandestinely indulging in an orgy of fossil fuel burning and environmental rape. Besides, you can always offset later. It’s Leo first. Rules apply to us, but not to him.
DiCaprio took the private jet to Cannes, then back to New York to pick up the environmental award, and then shuttled back to Cannes. After that, who knows?
Enough fuel for 10,000 automobiles!
Just how much fuel did that particular 12,000-kilometer environmental round-trip junket consume? No one knows for sure, but we can estimate it. The round trip involved around 16 hours of flight time – if not more – in a longer range private jet, e.g. a Gulfstream G450, which has a fuel capacity of 29,500 lbs,  or approx. 16,000 liters. For the 16-hour long haul roundtrip, refueling once, such a jet would need close to 30,000 liters of fuel – fuel that gets burned right where greenhouse gases are claimed to be the most effective.
30,000 liters is a huge amount of fuel. A normal compact European car can travel some 600,000 kilometers, or some 30 years, on that amount. In a single day, 30,000 liters are enough fuel to power some 10,000 cars!
Clearly if you hold Mr. DiCaprio’s beliefs, private jets are the most environmentally damaging form of transport imaginable. They ought to be banned outright. Yet, Mr. DiCaprio saw no problem committing this mass environmental climate crime. What Leo wants, Leo gets. The environment be damned.
Interestingly the Gulfstream websites overviewing the various models do not include fuel consumption and CO2 emission ratings in order to let the jet-setting millionaires and Hollywood environmental activists know the damage they do to the environment. In Europe brochures and new car stickers clearly state the vehicle’s fuel consumption and CO2 emissions so that people can judge the alleged damage to the environment (er, never mind for now the recent scandalous car exhaust test manipulations).
Sorry, I forgot. Fuel consumption awareness and environmental protection are only for the little folks.

The Cato Institute today released a comprehensive report which details information missing from a 2009 report used by the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating carbon dioxide emissions.



""After thorough review, I found that the report from the U.S Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which served as the source for the scientific opinions underlying the original endangerment finding in 2009, is unrepresentative of the larger body of scientific research on the topic of anthropogenic climate change and its potential impacts on the United States,"" said Cato Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels. ""Since the new EPA standards would essentially price anyone trying to build a new coal plant out of the market, I am not surprised that we won't see final regulations on carbon dioxide until after the election.""



Michaels, working with a team of experts and scientists, assembled an addendum to the USGCRP report, which they submitted as comments to the EPA on June 22.



""Calling this an 'addendum' is a tongue-in-cheek jab at the substantial relevant science the authors of the USCGRP report left on the cutting room floor while crafting their version,"" said Michaels. ""We came up with the idea when we noticed that literally every paragraph in their report is missing critical information. Our report adds much additional information on how climate change impacts the United States, using a more exhaustive survey of peer-reviewed science than the USGCRP relied upon.""





Michaels noted that no static report can provide long-term guidance as to the nature of climate change and its impacts, as this field is constantly evolving under the weight of new scientific findings. Consequently, he said, it is imperative that the EPA reassess the current scientific understanding on at least an annual basis.



In June, the DC Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Obama Administration by rejecting challenges to the EPA's rules concerning carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks. The EPA was expected to finalize regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired plants by the end of this year, but has deferred that decision until March 2013.

Share this...FacebookTwitterArctic sea ice more stable than thought: once agin likely no new record melt
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P Gosselin)
On June 14, 2016, Swiss flagship daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) reported on an imminent record ice melt in the Arctic:
Record ice melt in the Arctic: ‘heat wave ‘ over Greenland
Arctic sea ice is headed for a new record summer minimum. The disappearance of the ice sheet can initiate decisive climatic events. Arctic sea ice is currently melting faster than the record 2012 year. According to data from the Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) the polar ice cover this May (completely frozen or with a sea ice concentration of at least 15 percent) was about 580,000 square kilometers less than 2004; that corresponds to the size of France. The total sea ice area is still at 12 million aquare kilometers, or about one and half times the area of Australia. A new minimum is forseeable.”
Continue reading at the Neuen Zürcher Zeitung.
Was the alarmism justified? Looking at the official data from the NSIDC (Figure 1), the dotted green line depicts the sea ice extent for the record melt year 2012, the red line depicts 2016. In the first half of this year the melt rate was in fact at a record pace. In July, however, the melt slowed down. The fact is: Since July 2016 there is a lot more sea ice than at the same time in 2012. In mid September, when the ice typically reaches its minimum, we will have the final result.

On August 19, 2016, NASA issued a press release that foresaw the failure of reaching a new record minimum:
NASA Monitors the ‘New Normal’ of Sea Ice
This year’s melt season in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas started with a bang, with a record low maximum extent in March and relatively rapid ice loss through May. The melt slowed down in June, however, making it highly unlikely that this year’s summertime sea ice minimum extent will set a new record. “Even when it’s likely that we won’t have a record low, the sea ice is not showing any kind of recovery. It’s still in a continued decline over the long term,” said Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It’s just not going to be as extreme as other years because the weather conditions in the Arctic were not as extreme as in other years.” “A decade ago, this year’s sea ice extent would have set a new record low and by a fair amount. Now, we’re kind of used to these low levels of sea ice – it’s the new normal.”
This year’s sea ice cover of the Barents and Kara seas north of Russia opened up early, in April, exposing the surface ocean waters to the energy from the sun weeks ahead of schedule. By May 31, the extent of the Arctic sea ice cover was comparable to end-of-June average levels. But the Arctic weather changed in June and slowed the sea ice loss. A persistent area of low atmospheric pressure, accompanied by cloudiness, winds that dispersed ice and lower-than-average temperatures, didn’t favor melt.
The rate of ice loss picked up again during the first two weeks of August, and is now greater than average for this time of the year. A strong cyclone is moving through the Arctic, similar to one that occurred in early August 2012. Four years ago, the storm caused an accelerated loss of ice during a period when the decline in sea ice is normally slowing because the sun is setting in the Arctic. However, the current storm doesn’t appear to be as strong as the 2012 cyclone and ice conditions are less vulnerable than four years ago, Meier said.”

But curiously, the British daily The Guardian just a day earlier (18 August 2016) wrote that the Arctic sea ice was caught in the midst of a “death spiral”:
Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral
The Arctic’s ice is disappearing. We must reduce emissions, fast, or the human castastrophe predicted by ocean scientist Peter Wadhams will become reality […] Because Wadhams says what other scientists will not, he has been widely slandered, attacked and vilified by denialists and politicians who have advised caution or non-action. But now he returns their fire, exhorting people to counter what he calls “the sewage flow of lies and deceit” emitted by the deniers. Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours. But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power – both of which answers can be swallowed – but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering. […]”
It certainly is a strange “death spiral” when there hasn’t been an increased melting in 4 years.
Also the reminder that we should be listening much more closely to sea ice scientist Peter Wadhams also sounds comical, especially when one closely considers the earlier forecasting performance of the climate-alarmism-prone scientist. In the following chart we find 30 different estimates for last year’s Arctic minimum issued before the ice melt season began (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Estimate forecast for the 2015 Arctic sea ice minimum from 30 different scientific groups. Source: SIPN.
Result: By a huge margin Peter Wadhams comes in as a straggler in last place, miles away from the real value of 4.5 million square kilometers. How embarassing.
And we’re supposed to be listening more closely to Wadhams?
Scientific colleague Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading was outraged about how the Guardian could hype up this scientific fringe position. At Twitter he expressed his irritation:
 

 
It doesn’t surprise us that science fringe Wadhams gladly cooperates with the no lesser extremist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). Among others, Wadhams also appears in a publication together with Anders Levermann, who belongs to the hard core of the PIK climate alarmism group.

"MAFRAQ, Jordan  —   Nisreen   thought the worst was behind her family when it fled to Jordan from   Homs in Syria. Then, two years later, though safe from the shelling and the Syrian civil war, her son Hisham, who was 5, began to rapidly lose weight. When Ms. Najjar and her husband, Haitham   took him to a clinic, a doctor prescribed cold medicine and dismissed him. But a few days later, Hisham got worse and complained of chest pain and aches in his sides. When his parents rushed him to the emergency room, doctors determined that his blood sugar was dangerously elevated. Doctors said Hisham had Type 1 diabetes that had gone untreated for years. He was quickly placed in intensive care, and doctors told his mother that the situation was dire. The next 24 hours will determine whether Hisham lives or dies, she recalled them saying. As she reflected on the harrowing episode in an interview this month, Ms. Najjar began to cry, trying to hide her tears from Hisham. He sat behind her with his two siblings, Yousef, 6, and Mais, 3, who was born in Jordan, in their small, cold apartment here, 40 miles north of Amman, the capital. “I’m sorry,” said Ms. Najjar, 26, wiping her eyes. Hisham, who is shy and has large dark brown eyes, left the room to play with balloons. “It’s just that I almost lost him, not to violence or to war, but to diabetes. ” A few birds singing in their cages brighten the grim space where Hisham’s family lives. But they also remind the family of what it left behind and how the lives of the couple and their children have been upended. About a year after the civil war started in Syria in 2011, the family packed up a few of its belongings, leaving behind almost everything, and left its apartment in Homs for the nearby home of Mr. Abrash’s parents. Ms. Najjar and Mr. Abrash thought they would be gone for 10 days, waiting for the fighting to dissipate. Most of the family’s neighbors in western Syria were also leaving. The temporary departure soon became permanent. After tank fire and shelling erupted one day near the home where the family had sought refuge, it drove to Damascus to get passports, then south to enter Jordan legally at the Jaber border crossing. Back in Homs, the   city in Syria, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed. Many structures remain skeletons of their former selves, the walls and windows blasted out. The city was once a foothold for rebels fighting the regime of Syria’s president, Bashar   but many fighters started to leave at the end of 2015 under a   deal with the government. The city is now back under the president’s control. Ms. Najjar knows that if Hisham had fallen sick while in Syria, he probably would have died. Power disruptions, common in Syria, essentially shut down hospitals, cutting off electricity to refrigerators storing insulin. And he and his family would have risked their lives just trying to travel to the hospital. They have no plans to return. “Of course I was sad when I realized I wasn’t going to return home after a few months,” Ms. Najjar said. “There is nothing really to return to anymore. ” More than 650, 000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan, many of them settling in urban areas. They mostly live in cramped apartments where the rent consumes any humanitarian aid they may receive. The rest of the refugees, about 8 percent, according to some estimates, live in three refugee camps that offer basic services and are free, but also limit freedom of movement. Many of the Syrians arrived in Jordan six years ago, near the start of the civil war. The flood of refugees has put a strain on the country’s limited resources, and public clinics in Jordan no longer provide free health care to Syrians. The protracted crisis is increasing pressure on aid organizations to take on additional roles and provide refugees with more than emergency care, such as treatment for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments and diabetes. Nearly a year ago, Amnesty International  warned that Syrian refugees in Jordan were unable to get access to health care and other vital services, citing “the combination of grossly inadequate support from the international community and barriers imposed by the government of Jordan. ” The report also found that even if Syrian refugees could get access to health care, many could not afford it without forgoing basic needs. The United Nations refugee agency provides Hisham’s family with $137 a month in cash assistance the money goes directly toward the $193 rent and the electricity bill, which is $28. In addition, the family receives $70 in food coupons. The International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides Hisham with free regular checkups and insulin, worth nearly $30 a month. The organization also paid for a glucose meter, but lacks the funding to pay for glucose test strips. The family must pay for them  —   $27 a month. Ms. Najjar takes her son to a diabetes clinic every three months in the northern town of Irbid, about 30 miles from here. Each checkup, including the cost of travel, is $35. Across northern Jordan, the International Rescue Committee provides nearly 9, 000 refugees and vulnerable locals with free primary health care. The group uses mobile health clinics, each with two doctors, two nurses, a midwife, a counselor and a mobile pharmacy. Patients with diabetes require more frequent care, and wait times for consultations at the group’s clinics are increasing. When the family first arrived, some Jordanians and informal charities helped it cover the rent. But with no immediate prospects of returning to Syria and Jordanian poverty levels rising, it is becoming harder for this family of five to pay the bills. When Mr. Abrash, 37, first arrived in Jordan in 2012, he spent five months searching for work. The unemployment rate among Jordanians exceeds 14 percent, and is almost double that among youth. Syrians, until recently, were not allowed to work. In Syria, Mr. Abrash was a tailor, mainly sewing women’s jeans. Five months after he arrived in Jordan, he began working as a tailor, sewing pillows and mattresses for customers who were referred to him. More recently, he also began selling birds. A bulging disk in his neck is preventing him from working full time at garment factories. After Hisham was found to have Type 1 diabetes, his mother attended awareness sessions about the disease and started to change the way the family eats. Today, it mainly eats vegetables and rice. In the morning before school, Hisham eats wheat bread with eggplant and has a cup of tea. He walks to school with his friends. His mother makes sure he takes an insulin shot before he leaves in the morning, after lunch and before he sleeps at night. “The insulin shots let me lead a normal life, like my friends,” Hisham, 7, said as he watched cartoons. “Sometimes I cheat and I eat something I’m not supposed to at school, but my mom makes sure I eat well at home. ” His mother also checks his blood glucose levels regularly. Hisham does not remember his home in Syria. All his memories are in Jordan. “Nothing,” he said. “I don’t remember anything. ” His home here has two small plastic toy cars and a few plush animals donated by a charity nearby. “When I’m not at school, I mostly jump on the sofas, play soccer with the inflatable balls we have,” he said, as his younger sister followed him around from one room to another."
"**Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), is something of a superstar these days.**
The entire planet hangs on his every word as he explains, during regular press conferences at WHO headquarters in Geneva, just how widespread the Covid-19 pandemic now is and what countries must do to defeat it.
A who's who of world leaders joined him, virtually, at one of those meetings last month - France's President Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - all pledging support for the WHO's efforts to end the pandemic, and find a vaccine.
Pop star Lady Gaga turned up a week before that, announcing an online music festival One World Together at Home - with a host of big names from Billy Eilish, to Elton John, to the Rolling Stones.
No other senior UN official, not even the UN Secretary General himself, has ever received so much attention.
Dr Tedros, as he likes to be known, is the first African head of the WHO.
He took office two-and-a-half years ago promising to reform the organisation, and to tackle the illnesses that kill millions each year: malaria, measles, childhood pneumonia, and HIV/Aids.
A certain political wiliness has become apparent too as Dr Tedros faces down more than just the virus itself.
He has weathered bitter criticism - most notably from the US - of his handling of the pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January.
A PHEIC is the WHO's highest level of health emergency. That means it requires 24-hour monitoring, deployment of medical staff, equipment and medicines, daily discussions with affected countries and countries who might be affected, and of course, a steady stream of reliable information for an anxious world desperate for immediate answers.
A huge task for the ""charming"" and ""unassuming"" 55-year-old at the organisation's head.
At his first press conference as WHO director general, the Geneva-based journalists quickly realised Dr Tedros' style would be very different.
He strolled in smiling, sat down and chatted in a very relaxed way, his voice sometimes so quiet it was difficult to hear him. That was a very big change from his more formal predecessor, Margaret Chan.
And yet, behind that quiet manner, there lies a very determined man.
Before becoming head of the WHO, he climbed through the ranks of Ethiopia's government, becoming health minister and then foreign minister. He could not have risen that far by being self-effacing.
Dr Tedros was born in 1965 in Asmara, which became Eritrea's capital after independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and grew up in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region.
One formative, and now motivating experience, was the death of a younger brother, who was around four years old at the time, he told Time magazine in November. Later, as a student, Dr Tedros came to suspect it was measles that killed him.
""I didn't accept it; I don't accept it even now,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that it was unfair that a child should die from a preventable disease just because he was born in the wrong place.
""All roads should lead to universal health coverage. I will not rest until we have met this,"" he told the World Health Assembly shortly before his election as WHO chief.
As the coronavirus pandemic exposes the fragility of even the richest countries' health sectors in a crisis, Dr Tedros and his supporters believe it's the best argument there is for a radical global commitment to universal health coverage.
Dr Tedros became a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was in the vanguard of the 1991 overthrow of Ethiopia's Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam.
As a government minister from 2005, he was seen as more approachable and friendly than some of his more austere TPLF comrades.
He has been praised for reforming the health sector and improving access to health care in Ethiopia, Africa's most populous state after Nigeria.
But when he was in charge, his ministry was known to discourage journalists from reporting about suspected cholera cases in the country.
During his highly efficient and ultimately successful campaign to lead the WHO, Dr Tedros' supporters dismissed allegations that he had covered up cholera outbreaks.
That is why ""persuasive"" and ""political"" are also words which crop up regularly when discussing his leadership of the WHO.
He knows that the WHO's success tackling global health crises depends on the co-operation of the organisation's 194 member states.
During the current Ebola outbreak in DR Congo which is also a PHEIC, he has travelled there several times, not just to see the situation but to also talk to government leaders. And he moved quickly to visit Beijing when news of the coronavirus outbreak emerged.
""His strategy is to coax China to transparency and international co-operation rather than criticising the government,"" says Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
But has that actually worked?
Some WHO watchers have criticised the effusive praise heaped on China for its containment measures.
After his trip to Beijing, Dr Tedros said China had set ""a new standard for outbreak control"".
A few days later, he told world leaders meeting at the Munich Security Conference that China's actions had ""bought the world time"".
Such comments sit uneasily with the knowledge that China arrested health workers who first raised the alarm about the outbreak.
The US, with President Donald Trump leading the way, has cut its funding to the WHO, saying the organisation botched its efforts to control the pandemic.
Dr Tedros knows very well just how serious the US funding cut is, not just on an immediate financial level, but to the whole UN system, based as it is on a multilateral approach to the world's biggest threats.
He has been careful to say that he ""regrets"" the US decision, and his only mention of Mr Trump was to say he thought the president was handling the US' virus outbreak well.
But that all-star line up of world leaders, in which the US was conspicuous by its absence, was a political masterstroke.
It laid the groundwork for an accelerated development of treatments and vaccines, and promised the resulting medicines would be fairly priced, and available to all.
At the same time it sent a signal to Washington: Look, we're all here getting on with this crisis together, where are you?
So is there any foundation to the US charge that the WHO waited too long to declare a PHEIC?
""I was one of the first to ask him to call a PHEIC,"" says Prof Gostin. ""Having said that, it was only a short delay and I don't think the timing had any impact on the trajectory of Covid-19.""
""I do worry quite a bit however that his effusive praise for China could in the long term tarnish the WHO's reputation as a trusted scientific authority willing to speak truth to power.""
Meg Davis, a global health specialist at Geneva's Graduate Institute, views the WHO's position as an awkward one.
""All my sympathies go to [them], they were in a tough spot,"" she says. ""China was the place where we first saw the outbreak. They [WHO] sent a team to China, wrote generally an accurate report about the things China was doing well.
""But they didn't talk about censorship, or repression of whistleblowersâ¦ and because they didn't do that, they are now having to pay a ridiculous price.""
Now is not the time, says Dr Davis, to start cutting funding.
""At this moment we really need the WHO more than ever. We need a functional well-resourced organisation, to analyse the data and gather evidence of what works.""
So while Dr Tedros may be political, a lot of that political effort seems to be spent reassuring authoritarian, opaque governments, in a bid to get them to work with the WHO to tackle diseases which threaten global health.
When it comes to perceiving how that effort may be viewed by governments in Western democracies, his political skills may not be quite so sharp.
Shortly after taking office he proposed Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president at the time, as a WHO goodwill ambassador, saying he had worked to make Zimbabwe ""a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies"".
Only after days of outrage, not just from governments, but from human rights groups, who pointed to the deprivation that Mr Mugabe's regime had inflicted on its people, did Dr Tedros decide to withdraw his proposal.
It is not the first time the WHO has been in the spotlight for allegedly handling a disease outbreak badly.
Dr Tedros' predecessor Margaret Chan was criticised for a perceived overreaction to the 2010 swine flu outbreak, over which she declared a pandemic and advised countries to spend millions on medicines most did not, in the end, need.
Then she was seen to react far too slowly to West Africa's catastrophic Ebola outbreak, which claimed at least 11,000 lives.
""Damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" is a phrase you often hear at WHO headquarters.
Prof Gostin believes Dr Tedros has become ""the symbol of leadership"" in the course of the coronavirus crisis. But, he warns, the WHO's ""fundamental weaknesses are still there, including pitiful funding"".
The success of Dr Tedros, and the WHO as a whole, at handling the coronavirus will not be really clear until the crisis is over.
For now, he will keep on advising countries to prepare, to diagnose, to trace, and to contain.
And so he continues with his press conferences. He knows they are being watched around the world, in every time zone. He begins each with the words ""Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening"".
Despite the pressure to come up with answers, and despite the constant media spotlight, he remains quiet and friendly.
His only flash of passion came when he was asked, for the umpteenth time, what his response was to the personal criticism of him.
""I don't have extra energy for that,"" he said. ""My focus is on saving lives."""

As wind-turbine farms expand, research shows they could offer diminishing returns
From the UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS

 
LAWRENCE — Renewable wind energy is experiencing a boom, with more wind turbines popping up across landscapes in the U.S. and abroad. Indeed, wind energy accounted for 3.3 percent of electricity generation in the United States in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, that number was 2.9 percent for the same year.
But as wind turbines proliferate, researchers at the University of Kansas are looking at how these forests of turbines affect the wind itself. What happens to the wind when a larger number of wind turbines removes more and more of the energy of atmospheric motion?
Atmospheric science professors Nate Brunsell and David Mechem in KU’s Department of Geography are co-authors of a new study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by an international research group that evaluated the effects of large wind farms on atmospheric flow and its implications for how much renewable energy the turbines can generate.
“Wind turbines generate electricity by removing energy from the wind, so a larger number of wind turbines should result in a slowdown of the winds in the lower atmosphere,” Mechem said.
The researchers quantified this phenomenon in numerical simulations by applying a sophisticated model normally used for weather forecasting to one of the windiest regions of the United States.
The team found that a slowdown effect triggered by wind turbines is substantial for large wind farms and results in proportionally less renewable energy generated for each turbine versus the energy that would be generated from an isolated wind turbine.
While the researchers stress that no current or planned wind farm approaches the size or concentration that would cause the slowdown effect, their results suggest the phenomenon tied to large wind farms needs to be accounted for in future planning of wind energy.
“When just a few wind turbines are installed, each additional turbine results in a similar increase in electricity generated, as you might expect,” Brunsell said.
However, when a substantial number of turbines are installed over a small area, the amount of electricity generated is no longer governed by simple multiplication, according to the researchers.
“Instead, because the turbines extract energy from the wind, additional turbines will each generate less and less electricity,” Mechem said.
The team’s simulations estimate this slowdown effect results in a practical upper limit of 1 megawatt per square kilometer that can be generated — far less than previous estimates not accounting for the effect. Current wind farms are operating well below this generation limit, but the authors found that this slowdown effect needs to be accounted for, particularly when comparing different sources of renewable energy.
The study was published online in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Aug. 24.

Do we live in a special time in which the laws of physics and nature are suspended? No, we do not. Can we expect relationships between the Sun’s activity and climate, that we can see in data going back several hundred years, to continue for at least another 20 years? With absolute certainty.
In this presentation, I will demonstrate that the Sun drives climate, and use that demonstrated relationship to predict the Earth’s climate to 2030. It is a prediction that differs from most in the public domain. It is a prediction of imminent cooling.

We had such high hopes for Boris: Someone who could finally rescue the UK from the EU and make Great Britain great again. Unfortunately, having rescued the Brits from the Eurocrats just a few days later **Boris Johnson** has thrown the Brits on to the economic scrap heap of the Green Utopia.



The Prime Minister will today, Tuesday 4 February, launch the next UN climate conference COP26, joined by Sir David Attenborough and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at an event in central London.



Once you have hitched your wagon to **David Attenborough** , it is all over.



At the event, he will set out the UK’s position as a world leader in the response to climate change, having made a legal commitment to achieve net zero emissions, and call all nations to strive towards this goal.



Sorry, Boris, Ardern and Shaw have already assumed the mantle of “world leader in response to climate change”. You will have to be content with “an also ran leader.”



Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:



“ _Hosting COP26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change. As we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions._



 _There can be no greater responsibility than protecting our planet, and no mission that a Global Britain is prouder to serve. 2020 must be the year we turn the tide on global warming– it will be the year when we choose a cleaner, greener future for all._ “



The Prime Minister will use the speech to call for international efforts to reach net zero as early as possible through investment in cleaner, greener technology, preservation of our natural habitat and measures to improve resilience to climate change impact.



At the event, which will also be attended by Sir David Attenborough, the Prime Minister will reinforce his commitment to tackling climate change and biodiversity loss simultaneously, recognising the important role of the restoration of nature in his vision.



Demonstrating the UK’s urgent action to reduce emissions, the Government plans to bring forward an end to the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition is feasible, subject to consultation, **as well as including hybrids for the first time**. […]



Oh dear, all the smug hybrid owners will have to join the ranks of the damned ICE owners.



I wonder how the UK breeding programme for the flying pigs is getting on? The UK is going to need quite a few to haul the planes of the future.



First, it was the man’s man Harry getting emasculated by Megan and now it is Boris being told what to do by his live-in girlfriend:



Boris Johnson’s partner [C](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/carrie-symonds)arrie Symonds said politicians had a “gigantic responsibility to make the right decisions” over the climate crisis, in her first solo public appearance since moving into Downing Street.

“The climate change debate is forever shifting as science casts long shadows of doubt on the predictions of global catastrophe. The debate gathered a world-wide audience when climate alarmists gained control of the climate science agenda. Its popularisation has given it a political momentum that is proving difficult to halt.”

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
As you may have guessed from the title of this post, this week we call attention to a few articles around the web examining the common sense behind a tax on carbon. It turns out there is none.   
  
From time to time, there is a pitch made to conservatives that a “revenue neutral” carbon tax would be a win-win for everyone. It would help mitigate climate change while at the same time spur economic activity. Even if you don’t care about the former, you’re bound to like the latter. Or vice versa.   
  
To try to win some new carbon tax recruits in the incoming Republican-led Congress, two recent high profile articles—one in the _Washington Post_ by one-time Obama economic adviser Larry Summer and the other on _National Review Online_ by the Hudson Institute’s Irwin Stelzer—make that argument, with embellishments.   
  
If a carbon tax sounds too good to be true, then your intuition is correct.   
  
Robert Murphy, an economist for the Institute for Energy Research, provides the technical details, collected from the economic literature, as to why the economic gains don’t actually come along with a carbon tax as they are being promised. In his _National Review Online_ article “Taxing Carbon Won’t Help the Economy,” Murphy rebuts many of Stelzer’s claims. Ultimately, he delivers this sage advice:   




Far from offering something for everyone, a revenue-neutral carbon tax advances the policy agenda of the environmental Left at the expense of the American people. The economic theory of a carbon tax is unmoored from political reality. In practice, carbon-tax supporters have shown that they would rather spend the revenue on pet projects than reduce taxes, thereby hindering economic growth. Conservatives should resist the temptation to give central planners in Washington more money to waste and more control over our economic affairs.



Another take on the carbon tax is offered by our good friend, the always insightful Marlo Lewis, from the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Marlo takes on Summers’ “Oil Swoon Creates the Opening for a Carbon Tax” with his own “Oil ‘Swoon’ Is Not an Argument for Carbon Taxes” over at the blog for Globalwarming.org.   
  
Marlo leads off with this bit of depressing (yet predictable) news,   




It was inevitable. As soon as consumers and the economy start to enjoy significant relief from a decade of pain at the pump, the political class clamors for higher gas taxes and new carbon taxes.



Marlo then takes us through the long list of supposed “benefits” of a carbon tax, tearing each one down along the way. From “Is carbon energy a tax haven?” to “Do we overuse fossil fuels?” to “Would a carbon tax make energy markets more efficient?” Marlo’s answer is always the same, “No.” He summarizes:   




Summers makes a clear, concise, but unpersuasive case for a carbon tax. The holes in the argument are not his doing but rather arise from the thesis he propounds. The case for a carbon tax fails because:   






Also adding to the anti-carbon tax sentiment is Heritage Foundation economist Nicolas Loris. Loris highlights the results of an economic analysis of a carbon tax that the Heritage Foundation recently conducted. According to Loris:   




Using the same model as the Energy Information Administration, we modeled what a carbon tax equivalent to the federal government’s social cost of carbon estimate would do to the economy between 2015 and 2030 and found:   






Loris has this most useful suggestion:   




Here’s a better deal: Let’s cut the taxes we don’t like and in turn everyone will get more economic growth, more jobs with higher wages and a better standard of living for all Americans. Such a policy will provide the world with more wealth and resources to tackle the problems of the future, whether they’re climate-related or not.



These are three good counters to arguments for a carbon tax that everyone should be familiar with. So, to stay in the know, you ought to have a look!

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi brought to our attention an article by the Washington Post here, where it reports forecasters are warning that the coming winter “could get nasty” for the Washington D.C. area.
Although the National Weather Service predicts “equal chances of a cold or mild winter”, private meteorologists warn the winter could get bitter. There’s a real debate going on.
The Post cites meteorologist Judah Cohen, who uses the Arctic Oscillation as a predictor of winters, writing that greater-than-normal October Eurasian snow cover tends to lead to large blocking highs that steer cold air southwards into the middle latitude regions.
Early winter for Europe?
After a summerlike warm September in Central Europe, things have cooled down significantly, with Central European temperatures running below normal so far this October. German climate skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here writes that there are now signs of an early winter hitting Central Europe, with freezing temperatures and snow forecast for early November.
Current models show a major storm positioned over northeast Europe, which would send a large mass of cold air with temperatures at -35°C at the 5500m level (500 hPa) over large parts of Europe:

What follows is the forecast 2m temperature chart for November 1st:

Today’s GFS model runs (below) also continue to show cold setting in early November:

This forecast is 10 – 15 days out, and so naturally there is a fair amount of uncertainty involved. But it tells Europeans that maybe it’s a good idea not to delay putting the winter tires on. Snow is hardly a thing of the past.
The cold temperatures would lead to precipitation likely falling as snow, even in the lowland regions:

12 billion tonnes of ice in a single day!
One thing is certain: Greenland just got bombed by a “record” snowfall (hat-tip: wobleibtdieglobaleerwaermung), thanks to what used to be hurricane Nicole. some 12 billion tonnes of “record ice growth in a single day” – see chart:

Bottom: The accumulated surface mass balance from September 1st to now (blue line, Gt) and the season 2011-12 (red) which had very high summer melt in Greenland. For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1990-2013 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 24 years (in the period 1990-2013) will have its own value. These differences from year to year are illustrated by the light grey band. For each calendar day, however, the lowest and highest values of the 24 years have been left out.” Source: http://www.dmi.dk/en/groenland/maalinger/greenland-ice-sheet-surface-mass-budget/

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain became the first foreign leader to meet President Donald Trump. Ms. May had been on edge over Mr. Trump’s gleeful support of her country’s withdrawal from the European Union, which she opposed but has to carry out. But they vowed to work together on security and trade as they met at the White House, affirming the “special relationship” between the two countries. Our reporters offered   analysis, which you can see along with the video of their press conference here. Later in the day, Mr. Trump traveled to the Pentagon, where he ordered “new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out” of the country. He closed the nation’s borders to refugees from around the world and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries The American Civil Liberties Union described it as a “euphemism for discriminating against Muslims. ” The move was met with disappointment across the Muslim world, with many saying it would be interpreted as a sign that Mr. Trump sees Islam itself as the problem. _____ 2. Mr. Trump also addressed his feud with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. The two spoke by phone on Friday morning, a day after Mr. Peña Nieto canceled a trip to Washington. Mr. Trump said that it was a “very friendly call” but repeated that he would take a tough stance on trade. Mr. Peña Nieto’s office released a statement saying that they had agreed not to speak publicly about who will pay for the wall. Above, some of the existing fencing. _____ 3. On the Mexican side of the border, there’s deep worry over the impact of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. Many places are already overwhelmed by migrants from Central America. In Tijuana, above, Haitians hoping to cross the border have crowded into churches and community centers. Immigrants’ advocates say the Mexican government isn’t doing enough to address the crisis, and local charities don’t have the capacity to deal with a big wave of deportees. _____ 4. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the   March for Life on the National Mall. He became the   official ever to speak in person at the march, which has taken place every year since the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, in 1973. With the Trump administration on their side, activists opposed to abortion rights are preparing to seize a   political opportunity. _____ 5. France has banned soda refills in an effort to combat obesity and diabetes. The French are, on average, less overweight than Americans and other Europeans. The proportion of overweight or obese adults in France was reported to be 15. 3 percent in 2014. In the U. S. it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _____ 6. The Australian Open finals are this weekend. Rafael Nadal, above, beat Grigor Dimitrov in a match that lasted nearly five hours. That set him up to face Roger Federer in Sunday’s final. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. It’s a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams and Serena Williams on Saturday. _____ 7. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward. The government of French Polynesia has agreed to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is led by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2. 5 million and says work on the project could start as early as next year. _____ 8. Some theater news: Bryan Cranston, above, will star at the National Theater in London in a stage adaptation of the film “Network,” about TV executives and their Machiavellian maneuvers for higher ratings. And Elton John and the playwright Paul Rudnick have signed on to write a musical adaptation of “The Devil Wears Prada” for Broadway. _____ 9. One night six years ago, a reporter found an old photo album on the sidewalk near her home in Brooklyn. It revealed a rich history of black lives, from the segregated South to Harlem dance halls. Last spring, she began the long process of finding its owners. Here is their story. If you’re interested in other projects that explore race, ethnicity and related issues, please consider subscribing to our   newsletter. _____ 10. Finally, do you remember your dreams? If not, here are some tips on how to do so, from a sleep expert at Harvard. First, drink water.     awakenings are frequently accompanied by dream recall. Next: Resolve to remember them. Keep a pen and notebook by your bed. When you wake up, don’t move. Just lie there,  . Sink back into the dream, trying to gather more detail.

"“Riverdale,” the new high school noir on CW, is a dark, weird reimagining of the Archie Comics franchise. Which raises the question: What was the   version? The comics I read as a kid were an    palimpsest, in which kids with ’70s haircuts and ’50s lifestyles tooled around in Archie Andrews’s ’  jalopy. Recently, the franchise has been redesigned and reconceived. In one series, an adult Archie dies. In another, he and the gang flee an outbreak of zombies, one of whom is his old pal Jughead Jones. The steamy “Riverdale,” which begins Thursday, owes more to those newer iterations. (The showrunner, Roberto   is the chief creative officer of Archie Comics.) It chucks the comics’ old clichés for a new pastiche, drawn from decades of moody teen dramas, that occasionally adds up to something new. The familiar characters are back, as are landmarks like Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. But it’s a dark, bitter milkshake that “Riverdale” concocts, built on the suspicion that any town this squeaky clean must be hiding decay, corruption and secrets. And jeepers, are there secrets. The big one surrounds the murder of Jason Blossom (Trevor Stines) who disappeared while on an outing in the woods with his   twin sister Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch). Archie (K. J. Apa)  —   an aspiring musician with   abs  —   witnessed a key bit of evidence but can’t talk because of the circumstances: He was hooking up with his music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel) now a sultry knockout. The whole Archieverse is hotter and more haunted. Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) the spellbinding rich girl, is now a transplant from Manhattan whose father is in jail for fraud. Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart) still pining away in Archie’s   has an older sister who had a breakdown after an entanglement with Jason. It’s a more diverse Riverdale, too, if mainly among the supporting characters. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott) a gay student, was introduced in the recent comics. The mayor, the principal and the girl group Josie and the Pussycats are all  . When Archie asks Josie (Ashleigh Murray) if he might write songs for her group, she scolds him for his white privilege, and he soberly concedes her point. Meet our new Archiekins: not just ripped, but woke. The malt shop is still in business, but the   is closing down. The town is beset with bullying, sexual harassment and abuse. Jughead (Cole Sprouse) the wry,   sidekick of the comics, is now a dour, emo narrator. “Get closer,” he says, “and you start seeing the shadows underneath. ” Finding the corrosion under the    chassis of   America is itself an old trope. “Riverdale” flirts with the kinky darkness of David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet,” as well as “Twin Peaks,” whose Mädchen Amick plays Betty’s     mother. But the series is closer to teen intrigues like “Pretty Little Liars” and “Gossip Girl. ” “Riverdale” is very conscious of its influences  —   too much so at times. It’s a blizzard of knowing references and characters talking about one another as characters. “You may be a stock character from a ’90s teen movie,” Cheryl snipes at Veronica, “but I’m not. ” She’s right  —   Cheryl is more like a stock character from “Glee. ” Her line is typical of much of the dialogue in “Riverdale”: It’s clever, but it sounds written. Still, the show has a welcome sense of humor about itself. “Riverdale” is more an ensemble show than the story of Archie, which is fortunate, because here he’s written and played as a flat, brooding bore. In another touch of   he spars with his father, played by Luke Perry, who practically invented soulful teen brooding on “Beverly Hills 90210. ” Archie’s gal pals are far more interesting, especially the new, more complex Betty. In the excellent third episode, she and Veronica join forces for a revenge plot against some   jocks  —   a theme, lately, in series like MTV’s “ . ” Ms. Reinhart plays her vigilante turn with a gusto that conveys years of Betty’s repressing her feelings, and the two girls’ bonding complicates their inevitable love triangle with Archie. (That dynamic is very “Dawson’s Creek,” whose Greg Berlanti is an executive producer here.) The early episodes get better the deeper they delve into the murder mystery, despite false notes like members of a biker gang who look like extras from “Grease. ” If the tone is not yet consistent, the aesthetic is, a strong sign that “Riverdale” knows what it wants to be. The terrific art direction warps the   iconography into something haunting and lurid. Take Archie and the Blossom twins’ hair  —   so red that it’s clownish, like dyed cotton candy. What the original comics drew as milky and wholesome, “Riverdale” dials up to ghostly and unnatural. The old world of Archie was saccharine, down to the 1969 single by spinoff pop group the Archies, “Sugar, Sugar” (which gets an update in the series from the Pussycats). This “Riverdale” suggests that so much sugar, over time, can’t help but make a town a little sick."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
At the top of our list of things you ought to have a look at this week is a pair of blog posts by Dr. Roy Spencer updating the recent post-El Niño evolution of the satellite-observed temperature record of the earth’s lower atmosphere. In Roy’s first post, he updates the satellite record through June 2016, noting the big drop in temperatures as the effect of the recent big El Niño wanes. The take home figure looks like this:   






_Figure 1. Global average temperature of the lower atmosphere as derived and compiled by researchers at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, January 1979 through June 2016._



Roy notes that the “2-month temperature fall of -0.37 deg. C, which is the second largest in the 37+ year satellite record.”   
  
In a follow-on post, Roy looks to see what the prospects are for the 2016 annual temperatures being the highest in the 38-year satellite temperature history. In late June, Roy had concluded that is “2016 Will Likely See Record Global Warmth in Satellite Data.” But with the big drop in June temperatures, he is now reconsidering, writing that his previous prediction “looks…well…premature.”   
  
Be sure to check out all Roy’s analysis and keep tuning in to see how the year’s temperatures are progressing. We surely will be.



Next up is a piece from _Retraction Watch_ that notifies us that a (controversial) paper published last year that found that “Air pollution from fracking operations may pose an under-recognized health hazard to people living near them” and led to headlines like “Fracking could increase risk of cancer, new study finds,” well, was wrong. Turns out that the authors had used the wrong units in some of their calculations, and when they made the necessary correction, air pollution levels near fracking wells were well within EPA’s acceptable risk levels and below those that would increase cancer risk. Oops!   
  
Be sure to check out the entire Retraction Watch article, it is chock-full of interesting tidbits.   
  
And finally, the bottom of our post brings to the bottom of the world and a look at the increase in sea ice there.   
  
The growth of sea ice around Antarctica that has been ongoing for at least the past 25 or so years is a somewhat inconvenient fact for global warming cheerleaders in that climate models predict that the region should be _losing_ its sea ice (see for example the findings of Shu et al.).   
  
For a long time, the U.N.’s IPCC did its best to downplay (deny?) the increase was indeed real (e.g., https://www.masterresource.org/climate-science/yet-another-incorrect-ipcc-assessment-antarctic-sea-ice-increase/). Finally, they capitulated under the weight of the growing (!) evidence, including in their 2013 _Fifth Assessment Report_ : “It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased at a rate in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade (range of 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade) between 1979 and 2012.”   
  
Even so, when climate change worriers get together to talk impacts, they rarely mention the goings on with the sea ice around Antarctica, preferring instead to hyperventilate about Arctic sea ice declines (which, by the way, have no impact on sea level rise—like the floating ice in your cocktail glass, when it melts, it doesn’t affect the level of your drink).   
  
That is, until now. Just this week a paper was published by Gerald Meehl and colleagues makes it safe to finally discuss Antarctic sea ice trends. Why? Because, Meehl & Co. link the increase to…wait for it…natural variability! Which means that while the poor climate models have been getting the sign of the trend wrong, it is not because of their inability to correctly ascertain the impacts of human-caused greenhouse gas increases, but rather that random processes—which the models are generally not expected to get the timing of—have been acting to overwhelm the model-projected decline. Whew!   
  
Somehow, as is his inimitable fashion, Chris Mooney of the _Washington Post_ manages to use this finding to proclaim that this is “bad news for climate change doubters.” We helped Valerie Richardson of the _Washington Times_ get it right.   
  
Bottom line is that if natural variability is leading to a slowdown of the warming around Antarctica (and leading to sea ice growth there), when it swings back the other direction, it should help prime the atmosphere with moisture (warmer air can hold more moisture than colder air) that should result in greater snowfall over Antarctica and a growing ice load on land—which does impact global sea levels, acting to lower them (that is, partially offset the rise from warming oceans). This sea level rise offsetting effect has long been expected but has been slow to be manifest (although there is some evidence that it is underway).   
  
We’ll have to see how all of this develops in the future, but regardless of the outcome, it won’t be “bad news” for climate skeptics.

"I have noticed in the news that after twenty years of slapping a hefty price on carbon dioxide emissions, Norway’s carbon emissions have increased by 15%. Not that it matters, as carbon dioxide is not a pollutant anyway.
And China and India don’t even want to discuss carbon dioxide. But when they do they insist that, as it is we who are the carbon dioxide enthusiasts, we should pay. 
But here we are,  with a credit crisis and politicians panicking about infrastructure, they are tied in knots over how to go about imposing a carbon tax on the population. 
The futility of carbon dioxide taxation has been ably and practically demonstrated by Norway. But our lemming like politicians on both sides of the house are as enthusiastic as ever to impose yet another tax on the public.
Why don’t they be honest and just say “We intend to close Australia down.” Rudd wants to close us down in 2010 and Turnbull in 2012 or so. They both deserve to be bushed. (No pun intended).
Then we can select at random some sensible officials out of the phone book, and get on with the job of growing food and mining products for which the world is scrambling to acquire.

"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature  —   a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information  —   to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google’s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook’s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. “We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ‘moonshots,’” said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. “We appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that’s hardly even running in place. ” Google and Facebook have been in something of a   situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles. In response, both companies have tried various measures to limit fake news. Google in November said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from AdSense as a way to impair how such sites make money. That same month, Facebook updated some of its policy language, which already said it would not display ads on sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. Facebook has since introduced other changes, including consulting   news organizations like The Associated Press and ABC News about the accuracy of articles that users report as being false. Google’s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites “suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations” in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently. Google was careful not to say that these were fake news sites, only sites that deceive users by misrepresenting themselves or their content. This month, Media Matters noted that Google changed the language of its advertising policy, removing the words “fake news. ” Google said the language change noted by Media Matters involved examples that help explain its policy but were not changes to the actual policy. Google declined to identify the sites or publishers it banned. Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of “misrepresentative content,” such as websites peddling   schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations. Google was pulled into the fake news debate when Mediaite reported that, in the days after the election, the top result on a Google search for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to an article that incorrectly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results. The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November. Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article. “Today’s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,” the company said in a blog post. Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves. “Nothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,” Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run."

Susquehanna steam electric nuclear power station
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The nuclear industry has announced plans to lobby the Australian government, to advocate nuclear power as an affordable, practical alternative to renewables.
According to The Guardian;
The Australian Nuclear Association (ANA) will accompany Danny Roderick, chief executive of the leading US nuclear technology firm Westinghouse, to talk to government ministers and business leaders in Canberra and Sydney next week.
Roderick said nuclear power could help produce “clean, reliable, affordable electricity for more people”.
“We’d like to help Australia explore ways to create jobs and economic opportunity that are also good for the environment,” he said.
…
“My concern is that renewables won’t get us across the line in terms of emissions reduction,” said Rob Parker, the president of the ANA. “Nuclear is more reliable and it has a smaller resources footprint than renewables.
“Until we approach the issue of carbon abatement honestly, we won’t replace coal because it is the cheapest fuel we have. Nuclear is dead until we acknowledge carbon abatement is the main issue. We already pay a premium for renewables but we need to go further or we’ll just keep burning coal.”
Read more: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/nuclear-industry-to-push-for-australia-to-adopt-clean-affordable-power
In my opinion, the last thing Australia needs is any form of new energy infrastructure investment, except where driven by economic demand. In one decade, Australia went from paying one of the cheapest electricity rates in the world, to paying some of the most expensive rates in the world, thanks largely to government green energy initiatives.
If Australia’s newly greened government is determined to waste taxpayer’s money on CO2 emissions reduction, nuclear power at least has the advantage that it works. You can convert a modern economy to nuclear power without ruining it. France for example, generates around 75% of their electricity from nuclear power.
By contrast, spending money on renewables is unlikely to deliver any value whatsoever. According to a report produced by top Google engineers, major scientific advances would be required to make renewable energy useful.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."

From the “settled science” department and former chief alarmist Jay Zwally, who for years had said the Arctic was in big trouble (only to have his prediction falsified), comes this Emily Litella moment in climate science: “Never mind!”. Curiously, WUWT reported back in 2012 about an ICEsat study by Zwally that said: ICESAT Data Shows Mass Gains of the Antarctic Ice Sheet Exceed Losses. I surmise that with the publication of this second study, the original is now confirmed. I suppose John Cook will have to revise his “Denial 101” video on Antarctica now.
This map shows the rates of mass changes from ICESat 2003-2008 over Antarctica. Sums are for all of Antarctica: East Antarctica (EA, 2-17); interior West Antarctica (WA2, 1, 18, 19, and 23); coastal West Antarctica (WA1, 20-21); and the Antarctic Peninsula (24-27). A gigaton (Gt) corresponds to a billion metric tons, or 1.1 billion U.S. tons. CREDIT: Jay Zwally/ Journal of Glaciology
From the NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER via press release:
NASA study: Mass gains of Antarctic Ice Sheet greater than losses
A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.
The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.
According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008.
“We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.” Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.”
Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks.
But it might only take a few decades for Antarctica’s growth to reverse, according to Zwally.
“If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years — I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.”
The study analyzed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, spanning from 1992 to 2001, and by the laser altimeter on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) from 2003 to 2008.
Zwally said that while other scientists have assumed that the gains in elevation seen in East Antarctica are due to recent increases in snow accumulation, his team used meteorological data beginning in 1979 to show that the snowfall in East Antarctica actually decreased by 11 billion tons per year during both the ERS and ICESat periods. They also used information on snow accumulation for tens of thousands of years, derived by other scientists from ice cores, to conclude that East Antarctica has been thickening for a very long time.
“At the end of the last Ice Age, the air became warmer and carried more moisture across the continent, doubling the amount of snow dropped on the ice sheet,” Zwally said.
The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. This small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice – enough to outweigh the losses from fast-flowing glaciers in other parts of the continent and reduce global sea level rise.
Zwally’s team calculated that the mass gain from the thickening of East Antarctica remained steady from 1992 to 2008 at 200 billion tons per year, while the ice losses from the coastal regions of West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula increased by 65 billion tons per year.
“The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said. “But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for.”
“The new study highlights the difficulties of measuring the small changes in ice height happening in East Antarctica,” said Ben Smith, a glaciologist with the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in Zwally’s study.
“Doing altimetry accurately for very large areas is extraordinarily difficult, and there are measurements of snow accumulation that need to be done independently to understand what’s happening in these places,” Smith said.
To help accurately measure changes in Antarctica, NASA is developing the successor to the ICESat mission, ICESat-2, which is scheduled to launch in 2018. “ICESat-2 will measure changes in the ice sheet within the thickness of a No. 2 pencil,” said Tom Neumann, a glaciologist at Goddard and deputy project scientist for ICESat-2. “It will contribute to solving the problem of Antarctica’s mass balance by providing a long-term record of elevation changes.”

In a piece at Nature News, Zwally has said:

“Parts of Antarctica are losing mass faster than before,” says Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of a paper to appear in theJournal of Glaciology1. “But large parts have been gaining mass, and they’ve been doing that for a very long time.”

The findings do not mean that Antarctica is not in trouble, Zwally notes.

“I know some of the climate deniers will jump on this, and say this means we don’t have to worry as much as some people have been making out,” he says. “It should not take away from the concern about climate warming.” As global temperatures rise, Antarctica is expected to contribute more to sea-level rise, though when exactly that effect will kick in, and to what extent, remains unclear.

Gee, thanks.
The study:
Mass gains of the Antarctic ice sheet exceed losses

Abstract:
Mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet impact sea-level rise as climate changes, but recent rates have been uncertain. Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data (2003–08) show mass gains from snow accumulation exceeded discharge losses by 82 ± 25 Gt a–1, reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm a–1. European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) data (1992–2001) give a similar gain of 112 ± 61 Gt a–1. Gains of 136 Gt a–1 in East Antarctica (EA) and 72 Gt a–1 in four drainage systems (WA2) in West Antarctic (WA) exceed losses of 97 Gt a–1 from three coastal drainage systems (WA1) and 29 Gt a–1 from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). EA dynamic thickening of 147 Gt a–1 is a continuing response to increased accumulation (>50%) since the early Holocene. Recent accumulation loss of 11 Gt a–1 in EA indicates thickening is not from contemporaneous snowfall increases. Similarly, the WA2 gain is mainly (60 Gt a–1) dynamic thickening. In WA1 and the AP, increased losses of 66 ± 16 Gt a–1 from increased dynamic thinning from accelerating glaciers are 50% offset by greater WA snowfall. The decadal increase in dynamic thinning in WA1 and the AP is approximately one-third of the long-term dynamic thickening in EA and WA2, which should buffer additional dynamic thinning for decades.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Bank of England has stepped into the climate fray, with a claim that climate change poses a huge financial risk to UK based businesses. For once I believe the Bank of England is absolutely correct (more below).
According to the Sydney Morning Herald;
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Britain’s insurers face potentially “huge” exposure to shifts in climate-change policy and Group of 20 nations need to do more to combat associated financial-stability risks.
“The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come,” Mr Carney said in a speech at a Lloyd’s of London dinner.
“Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.”
England’s central bank has been looking into the economic and financial-stability risks posed by climate change and Carney spoke as the BoE published a report on the impact on the British insurance industry. As well as physical and liability risks, British insurers, which manage almost £2 trillion in assets, also face threats from the re-pricing of investments in fossil fuels in the move toward a lower carbon economy, Mr Carney said.
“The exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge,” Mr Carney said. General insurers are the most directly exposed to such losses, he said.
Read more: http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/climate-change-a-huge-financial-risk-warns-bank-of-england-20150930-gjy3th.html
Why do I agree with Mark Carney, that climate change poses a huge financial risk to UK based businesses? The reason has nothing to do with the weather, which, given the multi-decadal decline of weather extremes, is currently surprisingly benign.
In my opinion, the biggest climate related risk for owners of UK based businesses, is the risk of lunatic political interventions, which destroy the financial viability of your business.
WUWT reported that Shell recently abandoned exploring the US Arctic, because of regulatory uncertainty.
In the UK a similar scandal has erupted, with the closure of Redcar steel, a major steel works. One of the reasons given for the closure, and loss of thousands of jobs, is that the excessive green tariffs UK based steel plants and other intensive energy users have to pay, are making it impossible to compete with foreign businesses. (h/t Roger Helmer MEP)
Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: ‘Sympathy and warm words are welcome, but Ministers must now get behind British steel and deliver the support that we urgently need.’
He called on the government to ‘create a level playing field for British steel by fully compensating the industry for the high cost of electricity caused by the imposition of climate change policies‘.

What should UK businesses do, to avoid catastrophic regulatory instability, and unsustainable, politically imposed green costs? One option surely well worth considering is to relocate business assets and infrastructure to Asia.
Asia does not appear to have abandoned cheap energy and economic sanity. As WUWT recently reported, China and Japan are stepping in, to finance energy / industrial infrastructure, and to facilitate economic activity on a scale which the Western world no longer wishes to embrace.
Businesses should also seriously consider moving their head office and share market listing, as well as their physical assets. There have been multiple suggestions over the years, that the global assets of businesses should be fully included in any carbon accounting regime, regardless of the regulatory regime in the country where the assets are physically located. Keeping the business head office in the UK might still leave a business vulnerable to future regulatory instability.

"Donald J. Trump spent his first week in office repeating the lie that between three million and five million people had voted illegally in the November election, first to members of Congress, then on Twitter, then in an ABC News interview, then again on Twitter on Friday, citing an unsubstantiated claim popular in conspiracy circles. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump had announced in a pair of tweets that he would be asking for a “major investigation” into voter fraud, “including those registered to vote in two states. ” Since then, a variety of news organizations have found that several members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle were registered in more than one state during the election. Several still are. There is no evidence that any of them voted twice. • Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump’s strategist, was registered to vote in Florida and New York, the Sarasota   found. • Tiffany Trump, Mr. Trump’s youngest daughter, was registered in Pennsylvania and New York, NBC News reported. • Sean Spicer, his press secretary, was registered in both Virginia and Rhode Island, according to The Washington Post. • Jared Kushner, his    and close adviser, was registered in New York and New Jersey, according to The Washington Post. • Steven Mnuchin, who is nominated to lead the Treasury Department, was registered in New York and California, CNN found. Not really. Have you ever moved to a new state? And did you call up the people in charge of voting in your old state to tell them to go ahead and take you off their list? Probably not. Neither, apparently, did some members of the Trump family and his White House. “There is nothing illegal about that,” Fred Voigt, the deputy election commissioner for Philadelphia, told Heat Street, the News Corp.  conservative and libertarian site, which reported Ms. Trump’s double registration. “The illegality only occurs if one votes in two places, not if you’re registered in both. ” State authorities regularly purge their voter rolls of people who move or die. Mr. Bannon’s case is a little different. A Guardian report last summer found that Mr. Bannon was registered at a vacant home he had previously rented for his   but that he had never lived there himself. Shortly after that report, the Guardian said, Mr. Bannon changed his registered address to the home of a Breitbart writer, also in Florida. When he voted in November’s election, he did so by absentee ballot in New York, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections confirmed. On Wednesday, after widespread news reports of his double registration, Sarasota County removed Mr. Bannon from the rolls, The Herald Tribune reported. As the reports of double registrations grew, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s senior advisers, appeared on NBC’s “Today” show on Thursday and denied that members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle were registered in more than one place. “I talked last night to Tiffany Trump, and she said it is flatly false that she is registered in two states,” she said. But NBC had confirmed that Ms. Trump, in fact, was."
"Surrounded by her five grandchildren who live with her, Sandra Parker asserted her unconditional love for each one. The oldest, Akiea Brewer, 19, who identifies as transgender, interrupted to express her doubt. Ms. Parker’s reply was swift and unequivocal: “I was never mad at you for being who you are. What did I tell you? Be who you are. Don’t follow and try to be who someone else is. ” Ms. Parker has never been one to mince words. She believes her directness does not dilute her warmth and affection. “Sometimes I can be really harsh,” Ms. Parker acknowledged. “Sometimes you just have to say what you have to say. You can’t pussyfoot with kids. ” An unwavering dedication to family is what led Ms. Parker, 58, to take custody of many of her grandchildren over the years, stepping up when her children could not. For example, the mother of four of Ms. Parker’s grandchildren who live with her lives in Florida and is dealing with health issues. Ms. Parker credits her ceaseless devotion to the aunt who took her in at age 48, whom Ms. Parker calls her adoptive mother. “She was just a gem. She was precious,” Ms. Parker said. “I could never ask for a better mother. She loved me as if she birthed me into the world. ” Ms. Parker said she had showered her own four children with that same unrelenting affection. Her approach to motherhood was as tough as it was tender. If one of her sons was hanging out with the wrong crowd, she did not hesitate to yank him off street corners. One son’s friends were so worried that his mother was bringing attention to the group that they told him he could no longer associate with them. “I live what I live in front of the children,” Ms. Parker said. “They don’t see me robbing, stealing, doing all those things. They don’t see those things. ” Her parental role extended to several of her children’s friends, whom she welcomed into her home. Even now, her door is open to all. Friends regularly drop by her Bronx apartment to chat and laugh. Children in the neighborhood greet her on the sidewalk. Ms. Parker, a widow, moved to New York from Florida in 2012. She came for love  —   to be with a man she had met on vacation. They are now engaged. Because of the values she has instilled in them, Ms. Parker said, she does not worry for her grandchildren. “I was always told children emulate what they see,” she said. “If you raise them good and do the best that you can do, and they see this, then somewhere in their heart, it’s going to be stored. ” She has long demonstrated her willingness to care for them. That respect is returned to her, and she demands that her grandchildren offer it to their absent parents, too. “A lot of grandparents allow their grandchildren to call them ‘Mother,’ but that’s not who I am,” she said. “I’m their grandmother. I never allowed them to call me Mother. They have a mother. I’m just taking her place right now, but she’s still your mother. ” Health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, prevent Ms. Parker from working. Each month, she receives $630 from Social Security, $123 in survivor benefits and $376 in federal benefits for one of her grandchildren. She also receives $771 in food stamps and $310 in cash from public assistance. Ms. Parker is responsible for paying $246 toward her $1, 541 monthly rent the bulk of it is paid by a Family Eviction Prevention Subsidy provided by New York State. Through the Visiting Nurse Service, Ms. Parker contacted the Family Center, an affiliate of FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. FPWA is one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A Family Center caseworker noticed that much of the family’s furniture was badly worn. The caseworker applied for a grant from FPWA, and Ms. Parker was approved for a grant for $1, 000 in August to buy new furniture. “It feels more like home because I didn’t have anywhere for people to sit,” she said. That home is still very close quarters, which leads to the occasional fight. But her family makes the most of it, Ms. Parker said, and has learned to navigate the different personalities in a limited space. Ms. Parker wishes she had moments of calm and solitude. “There’s never a moment,” she said. “Not even when I take a shower, because somebody’s knocking on the door. Oh, my Lord. ” Ms. Parker said her home was brimming with love, giving her reason to anticipate an even brighter future. “I hope the children do well, finish school and my fiancé and I get married and sail away somewhere,” she said."

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
  
—   
  
  
The big news of the week was the “historic” (in President Obama’s words) climate agreement between the U.S. and China—but about the only “historic” thing about it was the hype the White House and environmental groups heaped upon it. In actuality, there was very little new news. The emissions reduction pathway that Obama announced for the U.S. was not much different (actually a teense lower) than the one announced after the (failed) U.N. Copenhagen meeting in 2009, and China agreed to…well, it’s unclear to what they agreed. _NBC News_ reported “China intends to begin to halt the rise in CO2 emissions by around the year 2030.” Try that line (inserting your own specific vice) on your significant other and see how it goes over.   
  
  
A good article in Reuters by John Kemp nicely eschews the hype and looks more closely at the facts. He opening paragraph reads:   




Nov 12 (Reuters) — The joint statement by the United States and China on climate change, issued on Wednesday, is more important for its political and diplomatic symbolism than any practical effect it might have in reducing emissions.



Both Kemp’s article and our article on the announcement are worth having a look at to see what the agreement really entails, and its chances at success (spoiler alert: they aren’t good).   
  
  
Another big news item this week—or at least it should have been—was the release of Alex Epstein’s remarkable book _The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels_. We can’t say enough good things about this book—and we try often! You may have seen our glowing review on these pages yesterday along with some provocative text provided by Alex that cuts to the basic premise of the book—that the societal pros of fossil fuel use far, far exceed the cons, and therefore, it is, well, immoral, to try to restrict their usage and further development. This week Alex also hosted a Reddit AMA (“ask me anything”) to allow internet savvy folks to interact with him directly as ask questions about his new book and his general way of thinking. Alex entertained many interesting questions, for example:   




Question: What should be the role of government with respect to pollution? Should it ban pollution? Limit it? Tax it?   
  
  
Answer: Good question, the subject of chapter 7 “Minimizing Risks and Side‐​Effects.” The basic principle is that we should think of it in terms of individual rights. At a certain threshold of emission someone is polluting your person or property and should be forbidden to do so. But certain threshold is important and contextual based on the state of technology. So in the 1800s people should have been allowed to use the coal plants they did but we shouldn’t today. If something is fundamentally necessary to human life it’s not pollution. There’s a lot of complexity in application but that’s the framework I use.



If you want to see all that transpired in this lively round of questioning is archived here.   
  
  
And finally, our friend, the ever‐​informative Dr. Roy Spencer has a good post up over at his blog looking at what really are the biggest influences on the climate during the timescale of our lifetime. What does he find? Why natural variability, of course! He takes us through a couple of the most influential natural sources of variability and the possible drivers behind them. Here is some insight from Roy:   




But statistics aren’t enough. Since we understand that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and should cause some warming, but we _don’t_ understand natural climate cycles, scientists only look where the streetlight of government funding illuminates the problem: CO2.   
  
  
What complicates policymaking even further is that what motivates public perceptions and thus decision makers the most are _weather events_. Hurricane Sandy. A snowy winter. We end up blaming these on the only thing we thing we think we understand — increasing CO2 should cause _some_ change, so it must be responsible for _all_ of the change we see…   
  
  
To the extent that human‐​caused warming is occurring, I am increasingly convinced it is a largely benign — and possibly beneficial — needle lost in the haystack of Mother Nature’s natural climate gyrations.



You ought to have a look at the rest of Roy’s article, which can be found here.

Note: this isn’t the High Court legal law case that has been decided, as that remains, but his own company’s internal investigation.
New Delhi: An internal committee of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) found its director general RK Pachauri guilty in a sexual harassment case.
Reportedly, the three-member panel of Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) found that Pachauri made repeated attempts at establishing a personal bond with the young woman colleague, which caused her “harassment”.
The panel also noted that when the woman resisted, Pachauri retaliated by ‘taking away her work’.
TERI committee recommended disciplinary action against the accused.
Last week, the Delhi High Court refused to cancel immediately the anticipatory bail granted by a trial court to Pachauri.
The matter has been posted for July 16 after the counsel for Pachauri sought more time to file response to the application move by the 29-year-old woman, who has alleged that “free and fair investigation” cannot be carried out if Pachauri is “allowed to roam around freely.”
The complainant had moved the High Court seeking cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted to Pachauri by the trial court in the case. The complainant’s counsel alleged before the court that Pachauri was “dictating what needs to be said to witnesses” in the case.
He claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” against Pachauri that he misused the bail conditions. A criminal case on charges of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation was registered against Pachauri on February 18 by the police.

"**""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says.**
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved.
Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week.
Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down.
This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"".
It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict.
Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access.
Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control.
He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"".
The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked.
There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run."
"There isn’t any evidence to support President Trump’s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The   estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly  —   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  —   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  —   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  —   noncitizens  —   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey’s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  —   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  —   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  —   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey’s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study’s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  —   those most likely to really be noncitizens  —   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that “the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ” In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. “The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,” Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn’t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  —   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn’t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. “I haven’t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,” Mr. Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it’s   frequency that we can’t even measure it with traditional methods. ”"
"**Last Sunday night, Daryl Morey, the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, sat in his hotel room in Tokyo, where the Rockets were playing two pre-season games against the current NBA champions, the Toronto Raptors.**
Mr Morey - in a move that would reverberate around the sporting world and beyond - then fired off a tweet expressing support for the protestors in Hong Kong who have been taking to the streets for the past four months.
While he hasn't explicitly admitted as much, it's safe to say he now regrets hitting that send button.
Close to a week later, the fallout from that single, quickly-deleted tweet - which included the words ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong"" - is still dominating the news cycle.
We've seen posts from Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, an explanation of sorts from Mr Morey, and not one, but two statements on the matter by the National Basketball Association (NBA), none of which appears to have appeased Chinese fans and sponsors, who were furious that an outsider was stirring up an issue many there regard as non-negotiable.
Freedom of speech, they argued, doesn't apply in certain areas and it wasn't Mr Morey's place to comment in the first place.
To top it all off, the league's handling of the situation simultaneously managed to spark a backlash back at home, with US fans and politicians alike calling out the league for pandering too much to China.
The timing could not have been worse: the LA Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are in China right now to play two pre-season games, but national broadcaster CCTV refused to broadcast them. Once the state-run channel had made that decision, online streaming partner Tencent had little choice but to follow suit.
Admittedly, pre-season games don't quite get pulses racing in the way that regular season games do, but this has become something of a tradition in China, where basketball rivals football as the country's most loved sport.
NBA teams have played in front of Chinese fans in 13 of the past 14 years, with LeBron James - unquestionably the biggest name still active in the league - set to lead his Lakers in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week against the Nets, whose new owner Joe Tsai co-founded Chinese tech giant Alibaba.
Basketball in China is almost as old as the game itself and Chairman Mao was known to be a big fan.
But the sport took a great leap forward once Yao Ming joined the Rockets in 2002. Yao played the bulk of seven seasons in Houston from 2002-09, before finally retiring after two more injury-plagued years.
During that time, his popularity with fans saw him named to the All-Star team eight times - even during periods when he barely played - firmly establishing the Rockets as ""China's team"".
However, the backlash to Mr Morey's ill-fated social media post has been so strong that Houston has quickly lost that mantle.
Meanwhile, Rockets merchandise has been cleared from various e-commerce platforms in China, while almost every Chinese sponsor of the league, plus others associated directly with the team, have suspended those partnerships.
Accurate statistics in a country of 1.4 billion people are notoriously hard to come by, and the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)'s claim that 300 million Chinese play the sport is wildly optimistic.
But the country still has millions of basketball fans, making China a clear number two market for the NBA, behind only the US.
And for a society that doesn't have a long history of paying for online content, Tencent's five-year streaming deal that puts an estimated $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) in NBA coffers is far ahead of anything else in the sporting landscape here.
In other words, China matters.
We've seen similar incidents with foreign entities play out in China previously. Dolce & Gabbana, Marriott, Delta Airlines and others have all fallen foul of consumer sentiment in recent years for an ad, post or oversight that was perceived in China as a slight on the country.
The crisis playbook then follows a familiar pattern: the foreign brand in question issues an apology, keeps a low profile and tries to work its way back into the good graces of those consumers.
But this time it's different.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear he will not apologise for Mr Morey's tweet, citing the American league's values of ""equality, respect and freedom of expression"".
He has some leverage here. If consumers are annoyed with a fashion brand, hotel or airline, they can easily switch to another option; but the NBA stands apart in China.
The CBA is a supplementary, complementary league, but in no way is it ready to replace the NBA as the league of choice for Chinese fans.
Claims that basketball fans might instead follow another sport are also off the mark.
The impact of this controversy is two-fold. The NBA's regular season starts on 22 October, and the hope is that the dust will have settled by then, and the league broadcast partners can return to regular programming - albeit with Houston Rockets games kept offline for at least a few more months.
It's still possible, though, that China doubles down on its call for an official apology, meaning that the situation could escalate still further and the broadcast ban extend into the regular season - though if that does happen, enterprising fans will likely find a way to access pirated live-streams from overseas.
But, more importantly, the risk of a backlash back home for companies operating in China is becoming greater.
With consumers in the West now hearing about the demands placed on those firms in China, the companies - already acutely aware of the political minefields that lie in wait - will have to weigh their moves in the East with the reception those moves get back in the West.
And as the NBA has found this week, it's becoming nigh on impossible to strike a balance between those two very different sides, even with carefully-worded statements.
Some may choose to pick sides and prioritise one market over another for a variety of different reasons, while the majority will do their very best to continue the high-wire act and stay out of trouble in the first place.
But with online mobs all over the world amplifying every perceived misstep, expect to see more companies stuck between a rock and hard place in the future.

"**Broken glass, raging fires, and smashed up barricades: the pictures from Hong Kong in the past few days look like random chaos.**
But in the middle of the violence, most activists are being deliberate about the places they attack.
So why are protesters targeting Starbucks? And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks?
Hong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland.
So when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting.
But other less obvious places are also in the firing line.
While Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers.
Annie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as ""radical protesters"".
She made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September.
The two criticised ""a small group of radical protesters"" using ""systematic and calculated violent acts"".
So protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates.
The restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted.
Maxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu ""does not hold any position at the company"" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters.
Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs.
After there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government.
Before long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls.
Another targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population.
The boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China.
Fujian is a Chinese province, and many local people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force.
Those demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime.
Best Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad.
The triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially.
The Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents.
The parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands.
There have also been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties.
The Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong.
The Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan.
In both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup.
In order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system.
The colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it.
In the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them.
Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire during the unrest.
The MTR is privatised, with the Hong Kong government as the largest shareholder.
In mid-August, the operator was criticised by Chinese state media for helping ""rioters"" move around and protest across the city.
After that, the MTR began shutting certain stations before people could gather for demonstrations. At one point the entire network was shut down.
Activists also accuse the operator of allegedly helping the police to arrest protesters, and of failing to release CCTV footage of alleged police brutality.

Ah, spring!



I know it’s here when swarms of red‐​breasted robins descend on my Virginia farm, rooting for every worm that survived winter.



No one gains much political traction writing about global warming’s threat to turkey buzzards, but robins are cute, so they’re more often the subject of climate change speculation.



Global warming is not pushing the robin to extinction. Au contraire: It’s expanding the robin’s range northward, into places where it’s never been seen. Robins are venturing so far north that they’ve even been sighted in the Inuit territory of northern Canada, where, Sen. John McCain tells us, there isn’t even a word for the birds.



Yes, even John McCain has feathered his political nest with the robin’s expansion. Back in 2004, after a hearing McCain organized as chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, _The New York Times_ ’ Andrew Revkin noted that he was particularly concerned about the rapid warming of the Arctic.



“The Inuit language for 10,000 years never had a word for ‘robin,’ ” McCain lamented, “and now there are robins all over their villages.” The BBC even titled a program on arctic warming “No Word for ‘Robin’: Climate Change in the Canadian Arctic.”



What a shame! Pretty little birds invading the Arctic, bringing joy with their whoop of spring!



But, of course, it’s not true. Like the tale of the endangered polar bears that happen to be at or near record population levels, the robin story is yet another climate confabulation. It ranks with the death of frogs in the mountains of Colombia now shown to be caused not by global warming, but by the introduction of fatal fungus on the shoes of concerned ecotourists.



It’s always instructive to consult the wisdom of our elders about climate change, and so I found an article, “The Naming of Birds by Nanamuit Eskimo,” by Laurence Irving of the U.S. Public Health Service in Anchorage, Alaska, in a 1953 edition of the refereed journal _Arctic_.



Irving describes his extensive visits with the people of Northern Alaska, residing in the Brooks Range — the most northerly mountain chain in the United States. He compared English names for birds with the Eskimo names of the ones they encountered.



Irving noted that the bird names were given by the Nanamuit elders. They were no birdie‐​come‐​latelys.





The lack of due diligence on the subject of climate change can be breathtaking.



Irving’s list brings us the Nanamuit word for “robin”: “Koyapigaktoruk.” While this may surprise Sen. McCain or the BBC, the Nanamuits saw robins, and this is their phonetic way of describing the tones of an arriving redbreast looking for a mate.



Nesting, and not just some windblown flotsam? Irving designated the robin’s status as “NM,” meaning “nesting migrant.”



The lack of due diligence on the subject of climate change can be breathtaking. In 1913, Vilhjalmur Stefansson published a book, now available at Ama​zon​.com, called _My Life With the Eskimo_. Look it up online and search for “robin,” and on page 493 you will find text describing robin sightings, obviously before 1913 (and before global warming), all over the Canadian Arctic.



Stefansson gives the word as “Kre-ku-ak’tu-yok,” which sounds suspiciously like the 1953 word given by Irving. That’s the Canadian word. It’s “Shab’wak” in Alaskan Eskimo.



There are plenty of words in Inuit, or Eskimo, describing our red‐​breasted harbingers of spring. What’s a little disturbing is how the myth of the robin persists, when it is so easy to find the truth.



My minions in Charlottesville informed _The Times_ of the error six months ago. Finally, on April 3, Andrew Revkin posted an acknowledgement on his blog, but no correction in the newspaper itself. We’ve been holding our breath waiting for it to appear in print, only to turn robin’s-egg blue.



At the same time, how about a little truth‐​telling about the hoax of “Warming Island,” an islet off Greenland that was — erroneously — thought to be a part of Greenland, connected by land lying beneath the ice.



As Greenland warmed over the last decade, the ice melted and revealed open water underneath, thus giving birth to a “new” island. Climate change enthusiasts claimed the channel between island and mainland had not been revealed for countless millennia.



As it turns out, maps show that Warming Island, indeed, was very much an island a mere 50 years ago, when Greenland, in fact, was warmer than it has been for the last 10 years.



As sure as the robin’s song of spring, we continue to hope that America’s best newspaper (and the BBC) will sing out the truth about climate change and the bob, bob, bobbin’ of the red, red Koyapigaktoruk in the North American Arctic.

Naomi Klein has been invited to attend a top level conference at the Vatican, to advise leaders how to fight climate change and dismantle capitalism.
According to The Guardian;
Naomi Klein and Cardinal Peter Turkson are to lead a high-level conference on the environment, bringing together churchmen, scientists and activists to debate climate change action. Klein, who campaigns for an overhaul of the global financial system to tackle climate change, told the Observer she was surprised but delighted to receive the invitation from Turkson’s office.
“The fact that they invited me indicates they’re not backing down from the fight. A lot of people have patted the pope on the head, but said he’s wrong on the economics. I think he’s right on the economics,” she said, referring to Pope Francis’s recent publication of an encyclical on the environment.
Release of the document earlier this month thrust the pontiff to the centre of the global debate on climate change, as he berated politicians for creating a system that serves wealthy countries at the expense of the poorest.
Activists and religious leaders will gather in Rome on Sunday, marching through the Eternal City before the Vatican welcomes campaigners to the conference, which will focus on the UN’s impending climate change summit.

The madness of this latest development, is Capitalism is the single most important factor which has made the wealth of rich countries possible. Dismantling Capitalism would not make poor countries rich, it would make rich countries poor.
As for non capitalist societies being better stewards of the environment, what a busted myth that is – if you want to see truly horrific levels environmental destruction, you need look no further than the old anti-capitalist Soviet Union, which is now practically a byword for pollution, inefficient use of resources, and environmental degradation.

"My good mate, Colin, was in a shopping plaza recently, and there was a Qantas stall offering free ‘environmentally friendly’ light bulbs. This is apparently part of their carbon offset program for which they charge extra to those passengers who believe this stuff to ‘save the planet’ when they fly. This ‘carbon neutral’ surcharge is voluntary.
Now the light bulbs were not only offered free, but these would be installed free.
So Colin signed up, and the light bulbs were duly delivered and installed.
The installation team also took away all of the offending old light bulbs.
After the first night of walking around in semi-darkness, Colin is now buying proper bulbs and replacing the free ones which were supplied and installed by Qantas.
I wonder if Qantas shareholders approve of this quaint activity?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship national daily Die Welt has a commentary by Daniel Wetzel on a new report just released in Berlin by Greenpeace Energy, which outlines what Germany needs to do in order to fulfill the Paris Treaty.
“Unrecognizable in just a few years”
So profound would be the ramifications of doing what is necessary to fulfill the Paris Treaty that Wetzel is left with no option but to label it as the “absurd excrescence of climate protection“.
He writes that if carried out, Germany would be “unrecognizable in just a few years“. In other words, following Paris is pure economic lunacy.
For example the Greenpeace Energy report writes that in order for Germany to meet its Paris Treaty targets, the country would have to completely end its production of vehicles with gasoline and diesel engines by the year 2025, and electrify important freight routes and German autobahns, and of course the entire bus and freight traffic industry in the shortest time. Wetzel writes that it would mean the end of the internal combustion in less than a decade, with no planned alternative for replacement in sight.
What that would mean for the German automotive industry, the very backbone of its economy, the country’s competitiveness, jobs and location as a place to do business, Wetzel writes: “The study does not look into it.”
In Germany one of every 6 jobs is connected to the automotive industry.
Cost? Too high to calculate
On that one point, which concerns transportation, Wetzel writes: “Concepts and cost estimates for this are not yet available.”
Gas and oil heating ban by 2020

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Implementing the Paris Treaty to the letter would not only have profound consequences for the transport sector, but also for Germany’s other primary major energy consumer: heating. According to the Greenpeace Energy Report, “Because the product lifetime cycle for heating systems is up to 20 years, it is necessary to ban the installation of new gas and oil heating systems beginning in the year 2020 in order to achieve full decarbonization by 2040“.
Wetzel writes: “German furnace manufacturers would have to stop production immediately.”
To accomplish the aimed decarbonization, Wetzel tells readers that Germany would need to increase its current green energy generation capacity some five fold, according to the study, from 600 terawatt-hours to 3120 terawatt-hours by 2040.
Wetzel criticizes Germany’s Energiewende, claiming that a number of highly naïve projections were used earlier to convince the public that somehow it would all work out. For example in 2010, Germany expected to cut electricity demand some 10% by 2020 when in fact electricity consumption has not been cut back at all – despite three recent relatively mild winters.
To replace Germany’s current fossil fuels with green energy, Wetzel writes that the Greenpeace Energy estimates it will be necessary to increase the current number of wind turbines in operation in Germany from 26,000 today to some 80,000 over the coming years! Yet, anyone who knows the public’s current sentiment with respect to littering the landscape with industrial turbines will tell you that this is all pie in the sky.
Already one German state, Bavaria, has made the permitting of new turbines practically impossible.
Already we see the huge widening chasm between the Greens’ demands and reality – making us wonder if they are still in touch. Undeterred and seemingly immune to rationality, they continue clinging to the decarbonization vision despite its growingly apparent absurdity.
Already Germany has put itself on the path to NOT MEETING the Paris climate targets and by a very long shot. The country’s new energy feed-in act scales back (and certainly does not five-fold) the installation of new renewable energy installations in the future, Wetzel points out.
Already the requirements for fulfilling Paris outlined in the Greenpeace Energy report are rendered dustbin material. Yet the Greenpeace Energy report insists that wind and solar energy installations must be ramped up six fold, and even call for consumers to subsidize it all. Currently, Wetzel writes, Germans are already paying 25 billion euros annually in feed in support.
CO2 emissions, by the way, have not fallen in 7 years, some 175 billion euros later. That even goes beyond “absurd”.

Guest essay by Ed Hoskins
Summary: By 2014 European Union countries had invested approximately €1 trillion, €1000,000,000,000, in large scale Renewable Energy installations.


This has provided a nameplate electrical generating capacity of about 216 Gigawatts, nominally about ~22% of the total European generation needs of about 1000 Gigawatts.
The actual measured output by 2014 from data supplied by the Renewables Industry has been 38 Gigawatts or 3.8% of Europe’s electricity requirement, at a capacity factor of ~18% overall.
However Renewable Energy production is dependent on the seasons, local weather conditions and the rotation of the earth, day and night.
So the Renewable Energy contribution to the electricity supply grid is inevitably erratic, intermittent and non-dispatchable.  It is therefore much less useful than dispatchable sources of electricity, which can be engaged whenever necessary to match demand and maintain grid stability.  That 3.8% Renewable Energy contribution to the grid is often not available when needed and obversely its mandatory use can cause major grid disruption if the Renewable Energy contribution is suddenly over abundant.
Accounting for capacity factors the capital cost of these Renewable Energy installations has been about €29billion / Gigawatt.  That capital cost should be compared with conventional gas-fired electricity generation costing about €1billion / Gigawatt.
The whole 1000 Gigawatt fleet of European electricity generation installations could have been replaced with lower capital cost Gas-fired installations for the €1trillion of capital costs already expended on Renewable Energy in Europe.
In spite of their being virtually no costs for fuel, Renewable Energy installations can still cost up to 1.5 – 2.5 times as much to operate and maintain as conventional Gas Fired plant.
When the capacity percentages are taken into account, the capital costs can be 15 – 50 times greater than Gas Fired plant.

Data Sources
Recent publications with data up to the end of 2014 have been used here.  These organisations are either neutral towards Renewable Energy (US  EIA) or actively promote it (EurObservER).

US EIA electricity_generation.pdf  2015   Table 1
EurObservER-Wind-Energy-Barometer-2015-EN-2.pdf
EurObservER-Photovoltaic-Barometer-2015-EN.pdf

These publications give an up to date indication of the current state of comparative data for the capital and running costs of different means of Energy generation, both Renewable and Fossil fuel based as well as Renewable Energy costs in Europe .  These illustrated notes are derived from the combination of these two up to date data sources.
The US  EIA data provides a useful yardstick for comparative costing and level of investment committed.  The comparative measure of US$ / Megawatt hour is used.  The US$ and the Euro are close to parity and used interchangeably here for cost estimation.


Major European installations
This note concentrates on the seven European Nations with significant commitments to Renewable Energy.  They account for more than 80% of European renewable investment.  Denmark is included in this analysis because of its preeminent position as a developer and supplier of Wind Power technology.

The following diagram shows the percentages of contribution for both solar and wind power in Europe.  The preponderance of PV Solar power in Germany at 44% of the total european installation is very clear.

Comparable Electrical Generation effectiveness
The EurObservER data give the current  base of Renewable Energy installations measured in Megawatts  and annual output by country in Gigawatt hours and also the actual installed level by three types of generation:

Onshore Wind Power
Offshore Wind Power
Grid connected Solar PV

The annual output in Gigawatt hours can be reduced to actual equivalent productive generation by dividing the output GWhr value by 8760, (365 * 24).  This value is then used to assess capacity  by comparing the actual generated output in Gigawatts with the nameplate value of the renewable installed generating sets.
The EurObservER data does not distinguish the output generated by Onshore and Offshore Wind Power but groups the outputs for both Wind Power types.  In general one would expect Offshore Wind Power to be rather more productive than Onshore installations even though Offshore has more onerous operating and maintenance expenditures at in excess of 30% capacity for offshore installations as opposed to about 20% for onshore Wind Power installations.
As the current EurObservER data does not distinguish between the generated outputs of Onshore and Offshore Wind Power, an overall Wind Power capacity figure of about 21% results from their data.
The aggregate (Wind Power and PV Solar)  productive capacities for the six European Nations are shown below and compared to conventional generating technologies.

The variations of efficiency between the seven European Nations shown above between arises as a result of:

their level of commitment to Solar energy as opposed to Wind Power:  Overall in Europe Wind Power has a capacity percentage of ~22% as opposed to Solar energy of only  ~12%
their latitude, Solar power being significantly less effective in Northern Europe.

Accordingly German Renewable installations perform at only ~13% overall.  They are by far the least performant in Europe because of their heavy commitment to Solar Energy at Northern latitudes.  Germany is followed by Italy with a more Southerly position but still with a heavy commitment to Solar Power.
Overall in Europe Renewable Energy is about 5 times less efficient (Energy Produced / Nameplate Capacity) than when fossil fuels are used, i.e. a capacity percentage of about 18% overall as opposed to some 85%.

The scale of Renewable installations and approximate capital costs
The  EurObservER data from 2014 is charted below showing the nameplate installations of different forms of Renewable Energy

And the actual Electrical output generated according to the EurObservER data is shown below.

It is estimated that 1 Gigawatt of gas-fired generating capacity costs about €1000,000,000 and the proportional capital costs derived from the EIA data is used to estimate the approximate capital costs of the European Renewable installations.  Accordingly the distribution of estimated capital investment totalling more than €1 trillion is shown below.

These prices are estimated using the EurObservER  reported nameplate capacity combined with the EIA differential values for capital costs.  No account is taken of the detrimental capacity factors applicable to Renewable Energy installations, i.e. operating at about 1/5 of rated nameplate capacity.

National commitments to Renewable Energy installations in Europe
The comparative commitments to Renewable Energy according to the data across Europe is shown as Megawatts installed / million head of population below.
Unsurprisingly Germany and Denmark are pre-eminent, whereas the UK and France have only achieved about a quarter of their levels of penetration.  In France which already has the lowest CO2 emissions levels/head of population in the developed world (substantially less (~60%) than China) because of its commitment to Nuclear electrical generation, the installation of Renewable Energy (Wind Power and Solar) in France would seem to be particularly costly and pointless.

The full gamut of European national commitments to renewable Energy in terms of Megawatts of nameplate generating capacity per million head of population is shown below.

Scoring cost effectiveness in Operation
The US  EIA data makes comparisons in terms of $ / Megawatt hour.  These data have been combined with capacity data derived from the EurObservER reports,  i.e. 21.8% for Wind Power overall and 12.1% for Solar Power.

For comparative purposes these $/MW hr values are normalised comparing them to the EIA Gas-Fired generation cost and the readjusted to account for the capacity factors recorded.  A fuel cost for Gas firing is about 50% more than than that for Coal.
This results in normalised comparative scores for both the Capital cost and Operation and Maintenance costs.  Using the EIA base data the Operation and Maintenance costs are marginally more for Onshore Wind and about double for both Offshore Wind and Solar Power.  On the other hand the capital cost scores range from 14 times onshore wind to almost 50 times for Solar energy.

When the capital and running costs are combined on the EIA basis, Renewable Energy comparative cost scores are 4 times higher for onshore wind and up to 12 times greater for both Offshore wind and rather more for Solar Power.  Coal and nuclear power are shown as the a useful comparison.


Conclusions
To date about € trillion, (€1000,000,000,000), has been spent on the installation of Renewable Energy technologies for electricity generation in Europe.
By Government and EU diktat, this expenditure has been extracted by extra charges imposed on utility bills throughout Europe.  Viewed as taxation this is very regressive form:  it imposes more burdens on poorer people whilst leaving wealthier people who are able to pay less affected.  It is also invisible in Government accounts as a tax income at all, as it is an industry price imposition on consumers.
These regressive “Green taxes” have already lead to significant fuel poverty throughout Europe.
Increased energy costs are also impacting on European industries with many major corporations seeking more congenial manufacturing locations outside Europe to the detriment of the European economies.
As a means of producing useful electrical power Renewable Energy is proven here to be very expensive, not only because its poor ~20% capacity factor but also because it is much less useful to the electrical grid because of its non-dispatchbliliy and inevitable intermittancy.
It is also questionable whether these Renewable Energy industries, when viewed “from cradle to grave”, including manufacturing, site works, installation, connection and demolition costs, does in fact reduce CO2 emissions to any significant extent overall.  The CO2 saved may never exceed the CO2 emissions generated to erect the total installation.  At t a maximum the use of Renewable Wins and Solar technologies only amounts to about a 4% saving in CO2 emissions in comparison to using Gas-fired power generation,
The USA has made significant CO2 emissions reductions over the past few decades by replacing Coal Fired generation with Gas Fired electricity generation with the feedstock provided by the fracking revolution.  It is estimated that using natural gas for electricity generation as opposed coal burning saves about 30% of CO2 emissions.  This outcome of this effect has been assessed to have been more effective means of CO2 emissions reduction than all actions worldwide arising from the Kyoto protocol.
The Renewable Energy industry could not exist without the Government mandated subsidies and preferential tariffs on which it depends.
Without Government subsidies and consumption mandates the Renewable Energy industry is not a viable business proposition.
Viewed from the point of view of the viability of a nation’s electrical supply grid, Renewable Energy would never be part of the generating mix without its Government mandate, Government subsidies and Government interference.

"**The UN and Ethiopia have agreed to allow aid into the country's conflict-torn Tigray region, UN officials say.**
UN spokesman Saviano Abreu says an assessment mission will begin later on Wednesday. There has been no word so far from the Ethiopian government.
Food and medicines are said to be running out for millions of people.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in the month-long fighting between the federal army and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
The Ethiopian government said the regional capital Mekelle was seized over the weekend.
But TPLF soldiers said they were still fighting near the city.
Thousands of people have been displaced.
In a separate development, the Ethiopian authorities said one of the most senior TPLF figures had surrendered. Keriya Ibrahim is the former speaker of the regional parliament.
The TPLF has not publicly commented on the issue.
The UN will have ""unimpeded"" access to deliver aid to the government-held areas of Tigray, news agencies report.
UN humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu is quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the first mission to carry out a needs assessment is starting on Wednesday after the agreement was signed this week.
""We are of course working to make sure assistance will be provided in the whole region and for every single person who needs it,"" Mr Abreu said.
Separately, a UN source told Reuters the organisation had established a logistics group with the government to ensure access.
However, the government in Addis Ababa is yet to confirm the deal has been reached.
Among those in need of urgent aid in Tigray are thousands of refugees from neighbouring Eritrea. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service.
Meanwhile, communications have been fully restored in Alamata - a town on the south-eastern tip of Tigray. But towns in the western parts of the region saw only partial restoration of the services.
Communications blackouts since the start of the fighting have made it difficult to verify claims and counterclaims by the rival sides.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before PM Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Ahmed dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
The TPLF sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.

"PHILADELPHIA  —   President Trump’s decision to build a wall along the length of the United States’ southern border with Mexico erupted into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, leading to the cancellation of a White House visit by Mexico’s president and sharply rising tensions over who would pay for the wall. With the conflict escalating, Mr. Trump appeared to embrace a proposal by House Republicans that would impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that the proceeds would be used to pay for the border wall, estimated to cost as much as $20 billion. But a furious uproar prompted Mr. Spicer to temper his earlier remarks, saying the plan was simply “one idea” that might work to finance the wall. Mr. Spicer said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy, while Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering “a buffet of options. ” If Mr. Trump does eventually announce his support for the tax plan, it could have a broad impact on the American economy, and its consumers and workers, by sharply increasing the prices of imported goods or reducing profits for the companies that produce them. Other nations could retaliate, prompting a trade war that could hit consumers around the globe. Retail businesses could see their tax bills surge, said David French of the National Retail Federation, who predicted that those costs would be passed on to consumers. He called the idea “very counter to the way consumers are feeling at the moment. ” If nothing else, the   developments showed Mr. Trump that international diplomacy and a    overhaul of the tax code would not be as easy as an announcement before a campaign microphone. The events unfolded after Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to strengthen the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. Adding to Mexico’s perception of an insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a scheduled meeting between Mr. Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The sense of chaos and confusion about the tax issue added to the fallout from Mr. Trump’s conflict with Mr. Peña Nieto, his first direct clash with a world leader since becoming president a week ago. The Mexican peso bounced sharply with each new development. Tensions between the two have been simmering for months, despite comments by both men that they were trying to work together. Mr. Trump’s immigration and   decisions on Wednesday appeared to shatter the remaining good will between them. In a video message delivered on Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and pledged to devote the resources of Mexico’s consulates in the United States to protecting its citizens. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” Mr. Peña Nieto said. Mr. Trump responded on Twitter, “If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting. ” Within hours, that is just what happened. Blasting Mr. Trump for sowing division between the countries, Mr. Peña Nieto angrily backed out of the White House meeting, which had been scheduled for next week. In remarks at congressional Republicans’ retreat in Philadelphia, Mr. Trump portrayed the decision to cancel the meeting as his own and issued a stern warning to Mr. Peña Nieto about the consequences of refusing to cooperate with him on financing the wall. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route,” Mr. Trump said. “We have no choice. ” In the same remarks, Mr. Trump alluded to the idea of a border tax, saying, “We’re working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports, and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route. ” After the speech, in a brief, impromptu news conference as Mr. Trump flew back to Washington, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the president now favored the plan to impose a 20 percent border tax as part of a sweeping overhaul of corporate taxation. Only last week, Mr. Trump had dismissed the tax as too complicated, favoring his own plan to impose a 35 percent tariff on manufactured goods made by American corporations in overseas factories. Mr. Spicer said that the plan for the tax was “taking shape” and that it was “really going to provide the funding” for the wall. Mr. Spicer said that was a direct reference to the centerpiece of House Republicans’ proposal to overhaul the tax code. They have been pushing the idea for months, but with little evidence, until Thursday, that Mr. Trump was interested in it. But by the time Mr. Spicer returned to the White House two hours later, he had already recanted. In another hastily arranged conversation with reporters, he called the proposal “one idea” that might work and said it was not the job of the White House to “roll something out” on tax policy. “We’ve been asked over and over again: ‘How could you possibly do this? There’s no way that Mexico will pay for it,’ ” Mr. Spicer said. “Here’s one way. Boom. Done. We could go in another direction. We could talk about tariffs. We could talk about other custom user fees. There are a hundred other things. ” The White House and House Republicans have been hashing out their respective tax proposals as they press forward with Mr. Trump’s agenda to revive American manufacturing and increase exports. The House proposal would replace the current system of corporate taxation with one that more closely resembles the approach taken by many other developed nations. The government would impose a 20 percent tax on corporate income earned in the United States, which would have the effect of taxing imports while exempting exports. The approach, known as border adjustment, creates the appearance of taxing trade deficits. The goods that the United States imported from Mexico in 2015 were worth about $60 billion more than the goods it exported to Mexico, so federal revenue in the short term would increase by roughly $12 billion. But the House plan would offset that revenue by reducing the 35 percent corporate income tax rate, and would thus generate no new federal revenue over all. It was unclear how that fit with Mr. Spicer’s repeated contention Thursday afternoon that revenue from the tax adjustment would help finance construction of the border wall. By siphoning off that revenue, Mr. Trump would make it impossible to reduce the tax rate as far as Republicans wish. He is pressing for a 15 percent corporate tax rate. Moreover, the tax would not be paid by Mexico. It would be paid by companies selling Mexican goods in the United States. Some might raise prices, imposing the cost on consumers, while others might be forced by competitive pressures to absorb the tax, reducing their profits. Many economists also doubt that the change would end up penalizing imports or encouraging exports. They predict that the value of the dollar would rise, offsetting those effects. Nonetheless, many businesses in industries such as retail and energy, which rely heavily on imports, were in a panic. Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who wrote the plan, told Fox News on Thursday afternoon that he was pleased that Mr. Trump appeared to be on board with it after his appearance in Philadelphia. “What I heard today from this president was that in tax reform, that they would level the playing field for imports around the world and level it with the U. S. products here in America at the exact same rate,” Mr. Brady said."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump plans to open a dialogue with Russia on Saturday that could lead to lifting American sanctions, even as Britain’s visiting prime minister and leading senators from his own party urged him not to let up the pressure on the Kremlin until it reverses its armed intervention in Ukraine. In what will be their first conversation since Mr. Trump took office, he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intended to talk by telephone on Saturday about areas of possible cooperation, particularly in fighting terrorism in the Middle East, a collaboration that would represent a significant turnabout from years of friction between the two countries. At the direction of the White House, American officials in recent days have been preparing memos outlining possible common ground, including the prospect of removing some or all of the sanctions imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to officials briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump has suggested lifting the punitive measures in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and Russian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State. Asked about sanctions on Friday, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of quick action, but did not rule it out. “As for sanctions, very early to be talking about that,” Mr. Trump said Friday at a White House news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “But we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. ” As for Mr. Putin, he offered a far more distant assessment after months of praising the Russian president for his leadership. “I don’t know the gentleman,” Mr. Trump said. “I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That’s possible, and it’s also possible that we won’t. We will see what happens. ” Standing at Mr. Trump’s side, Mrs. May warned against easing sanctions unless Russia abides by a peace settlement for Ukraine negotiated in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. “We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk Agreement fully implemented, and we’ve been continuing to argue that inside the European Union,” she said. Any talk of lifting sanctions is all but certain to spark the first serious conflagration between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who have largely given the president a pass on myriad policy areas where they disagree. Republican lawmakers have been bracing for Mr. Trump to make this move, and their concerns deepened Friday when his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said in an interview that removing sanctions was under consideration. Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Mr. Trump on Friday against lifting sanctions and vowed to push legislation reinstating them if he does, a measure that already has strong bipartisan support, including from Republicans like Senators Rob Portman of Ohio and Ben Sasse of Nebraska. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who has largely shunned confrontation with Mr. Trump, has been a longstanding opponent of lifting sanctions, a position he forcefully reiterated on Friday. In a scathing statement against Mr. Putin, Mr. McCain cataloged all of Russia’s controversial actions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere and said it could not be trusted as a partner. “President Trump should remember this when he speaks to Vladimir Putin,” Mr. McCain said. “He should remember that the man on the other end of the line is a murderer and a thug who seeks to undermine American national security interests at every turn. For our commander in chief to think otherwise would be naïve and dangerous. ” Mr. Portman concurred, saying in a statement, “We must stand by our allies in the region, including Ukraine. ” Mr. Trump’s meeting with Mrs. May was his first with a visiting foreign leader since taking office with a promise to pursue an “America First” foreign policy. For Mr. Trump, it was a debut on the world stage that took on additional meaning after a scheduled White House visit by Mexico’s president next week fell apart in a dispute over the border wall Mr. Trump wants to build. Mr. Trump appeared comfortable and confident with Mrs. May standing to his right. He offered a brief opening statement that referred twice to the “special relationship” between the two countries, a phrase Britons take seriously. He offered crisp answers, in contrast to Mr. Obama, who tended to talk at length. While Mr. Trump did not demonstrate detailed policy knowledge, he went out of his way to emphasize commonalities with Mrs. May. He also tried to reassure Europeans who view him with deep skepticism. When a British reporter referred to him as a “brash TV extrovert,” Mr. Trump replied, “Actually, I’m not as brash as you might think. ” Mrs. May, eager to forge a relationship with him akin to Margaret Thatcher’s alliance with Ronald Reagan, reciprocated the warm sentiments, praising his “stunning election victory” and conveying an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for the president to make a state visit, which he accepted. Addressing one area of disagreement, Mrs. May said that the president had privately expressed his support for NATO, despite past comments disparaging the alliance as “obsolete. ” “Mr. President,” she said, “I think you said, you confirmed that you’re 100 percent behind NATO. ” Mr. Trump embraced the decision by British voters to exit the European Union, a referendum known as “Brexit” that he and others have seen as a precursor to his own election. “I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he said. “I think when it irons out, you’re going to have your identity and you’re going to have the people that you want in your country. ” Mr. Trump and Mrs. May talked about negotiating a new   agreement between the two countries. Ms. May is not the only European leader worried about Mr. Trump’s blossoming friendship with Russia, which United States intelligence agencies have concluded hacked Democratic email accounts to influence the American election last year. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been a leading voice of keeping the pressure on the Kremlin, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to talk with her by telephone, too. The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on Russian officials and companies, mainly in response to the seizure and annexation of Crimea and the separatist war fomented in eastern Ukraine. Before leaving office, Mr. Obama imposed additional sanctions in response to the Russian election hacking. In an interview with The Times of London shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump suggested a bargain that would ease sanctions on Russia in exchange for nuclear arms cuts and cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State. One topic that may come up on Saturday’s call is the fate of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who disappeared in Syria in 2012. Mr. Trump may ask Mr. Putin for help in pressuring Russia’s ally, President Bashar   of Syria, to release Mr. Tice, according to an official briefed on the matter. Syria has never acknowledged holding him, but Mr. Trump has considered dropping support for the Syrian opposition."

Dear Professor,



I refer to your article, “[Australia’s Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/?fbclid=IwAR17MIDkfc-hPRIV6rCoNb5C3_HyHv4lYY3IhSmX8lkUKZDNczT1SrEZ3MM%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)”.



No doubt like most people who are drawn to your article, I am interested in solutions or effective preventative actions, especially during this tragic time, and it is in this context I refer to your article.



You state:



The catastrophic fires raging across the southern half of the continent are largely the result of rising temperatures […] Of course, unusually hot summers have happened in the past[…]



[Apparently they were hotter in the past](https://jennifermarohasy.com/2019/03/hottest-summer/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



[…] so have bad bushfire seasons. But the link between the current extremes and anthropogenic climate change is scientifically undisputable.



The fires raging across the southern half of the Australian continent this year have so far burned through [more than 5 million hectares](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/25/factcheck-why-australias-monster-2019-bushfires-are-unprecedented%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). To put that in context, the catastrophic 2018 fire season in California saw nearly 740,000 hectares burned 



Why do you feel it is more appropriate to compare it to California fires rather than [the 1851 Australian fire](https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/bushfire-black-thursday-1851/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) which also burnt out 5 million hectares?



[…]Climate change is making Australian wildfires larger and more frequent because of its effects on dryness and fire weather […] The current summer has presented the perfect storm for wildfire. Long-term climate warming, combined with years of drought, colliding with a set of climate patterns that deliver severe fire weather […] In the tropical Indian Ocean, one of the most severe positive [Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/iod/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) events on record [played out this year](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-11/indian-ocean-dipole-fuels-dry-australia-bushfires-africa-rain/11787874%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



The unusually cold sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean cut off one of Australia’s critical moisture sources, adding to the ongoing drought in southern parts of the country […] Again, climate change is part of the story, because anthropogenic warming is causing positive IOD events to become [stronger and more frequent](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13327%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) […]The role of climate change in the unprecedented fires gripping Australia is also [well understood by our emergency services](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-15/scott-morrison-should-listen-to-fire-chiefs-on-climate-change/11707096%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). Sadly, though, this summer has occurred against a backdrop in which the Australian government has [argued, on the world stage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-accord-australia/australias-climate-stance-sparks-anger-at-u-n-summit-idUSKBN1YH1QC%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), to scale back our greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction targets. Our leaders are literally fiddling while the country burns.



The fundamental question here is: are you referring to human-caused climate change or to **natural climate change?** In other words, are you suggesting you have scientific evidence which confirms lowering emissions will prevent or lessen bushfires? **If so, could you please supply that evidence?**



You further claim:



Increasing temperatures cause increased evaporation that dries the soil and fuel load. More than a decade ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ongoing anthropogenic climate change was [virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). This assessment of the science evidence has been [repeated in countless reports](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/not-normal-climate-change-bushfire-web/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), including the IPCC’s [Climate Change and Land report](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), released in August 2019 […]



One of the factors driving this long-term loss of winter rainfall is the [positive trend](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2235%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in the [Southern Annular Mode (SAM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/sam/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). This change is causing the westerly winds that circle the Southern Ocean to shift southward toward Antarctica, causing rain-bearing winter cold fronts to pass south of the Australian continent. The [role of anthropogenic climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1296%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in driving this trend in the SAM is also clear in the science.



You cite the [IPCC Climate Change 2007 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) as stating “ _anthropogenic climate change was_[ _virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia_](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) _.”_ Could you please state your page reference for this citation? When I examined this report I could find **nothing** to support your claim. According to the report:



[ **Climate Change 2007**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)



 ** _Australia and New Zealand_**



The region is already experiencing impacts from recent climate change […]Since 1950 there has been a 0.3 to 0.7°C warming in the region, with more heat waves, fewer frosts, more rain in north-western Australia and south-western New Zealand, less rain in southern and eastern Australia and north-eastern New Zealand, an increase in the intensity of Australian droughts, […]



The climate of the 21st century is virtually certain to be warmer, with changes in extreme events (medium to high _confidence)._



In summary, the IPCC state in their 2007 report _: “Increased fire danger is likely with climate change; for example, in south-east Australia the frequency of very high and extreme fire danger days is likely to rise 4 to 25% by 2020 and 15 to 70% by 2050”_



What you **neglected** to mention however, is that the IPCC specifically define the term ‘climate change as including **natural** (irreversible) climate variability. In other words, rewriting the above conclusion in accord with the intended definition utilised by the IPCC, we see the following:



“ _Increased fire danger is likely if there are natural &/OR human induced climatic changes”._



Clearly, your assertion that the report states “ _anthropogenic climate change was_[ _virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia_](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)”, is contradicted by the report itself; unless of course, you can supply more evidence. 



**Why did you fail to explain these facts to readers? Were you genuinely unaware of the facts?**



You further cite the _IPCC’s_[ _Climate Change and Land report_](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) _, released in August 2019,_ but here again **you fail** to point out that the IPCC specifically **includes natural climate variability** and does **not** separate this from human induced changes when it comes to fires.



According to the [report:](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/03_Technical-Summary-TS.pdf)



Technical Summary, 2019. In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems



Climate change is playing an increasing role in determining wildfire regimes alongside human activity (medium confidence), with future climate variability expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests (high confidence). Fire weather seasons have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confidence). Global land area burned has declined in recent decades, mainly due to less burning in grasslands and savannahs (high confidence). While drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions, there has recently been increased fire activity in some tropical and temperate regions during normal to wetter than average years due to warmer temperatures that increase vegetation flammability (medium confidence). The boreal zone is also experiencing larger and more frequent fires, and this may increase under a warmer climate (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}



I also draw your attention to the IPCC’s assertion that _“drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions”,_ which again contradicts your claim that _“The catastrophic fires raging across the southern half of the continent are largely the result of rising temperatures_ _”._



The connection between droughts and fires is of particular interest since scientists have indicated that there is **no reliable evidence humans are causing droughts** ([I recently reviewed the evidence](https://saltbushclub.com/2019/11/26/droughts-fires-climate/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)) and, in fact, [the IPCC has acknowledged that earlier claims droughts were caused by human induced climate change were false or exaggerated](http://www.galileomovement.com.au/docs/gw/HowToRecogniseVol2RevDroughts.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



Once again, however, you failed to communicate these vitally important facts to your readers. **Why?**



You have failed to substantiate your claim that _“the link between the current extremes and anthropogenic climate change is scientifically undisputable”_



If you have evidence of this could you please provide it?



I think you will agree with me, especially at this tragic time with so many people suffering, what is needed is accurate and useful information.



To this end, I look forward to a clarification, or alternatively, a retraction.

Humour/Satire



Schools wanting to teach global warming have a great opportunity to integrate many aspects of education into one enjoyable topic. Children today are engaged with the topic of global warming so this provides a tremendous opportunity to educate them. 



The use of [Greta Thunberg ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/an-open-letter-to-greta-from-philosopher-jason-d-hill/)in the curriculum is a masterstroke. Greta can actually see CO2, so a classroom exercise involving filling a jar with air and asking how many children in the class can see the invisible gas in it, will identify any children with psychiatric disorders that may have not previously been diagnosed.



Greta laments the fact that her childhood has been stolen, so a group exercise could involve asking how many others in the class feel they have had their childhood stolen by global warming. This could lead on to a lesson about other examples of children in history who through famine, war, epidemics, sex exploitation, violence or death have had no childhood. Footage of children slaving in lithium mines to produce batteries for electric cars so that children who have an irrational fear of the climate can get their childhood back, will reassure the children by showing them that others less fortunate than themselves are doing the suffering for them.



Once the children get used to the fact that spoilt, privileged, rich children in developed countries are more the victims than poverty-stricken children in third world countries who are denied basics like power because burning coal is upsetting the rich children, they are then ready to be climate activists like Greta. 



The topic of sea-level rise could involve a trip to the beach but teachers will have to be very careful to ensure the children are not terrified when they see the relentless march of the sea. Perhaps they should go when the tide is going out to reduce the trauma. Drawing a line on the sand where the sea level used to be 100 years ago could involve an exercise in maths and will show the children how catastrophic the 2 or 3-millimeter annual rise has been so far. This may not alarm the children enough so additional lines showing the 100-meter sea level rise that is predicted by next week or whenever will help.



A list showing all the predictions climate scientists have made over the last thirty years or so about the devastating impact of global warming could be matched in a correlation exercise with [how many have actually occurred.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fails-summary/) Discussing the numerous predictions will take a full class day but the second part where the ones that came true are covered should not take very long.



Climate deniers and how to treat them will provide an opportunity to clarify to the children that all the talk about the importance of diversity and inclusivity was just talk and global warming is too important to bother with ideological niceties like that. 



Hate speech and mental illness can be covered by explaining to the children that it is OK for the [Minister of Climate Change](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-child-molesters-of-the-mind-pervert-more-nz-children/) to bully people with hate speech by calling them “ **climate deniers** ” because it is really important to put down any people who ask awkward questions you don’t like. The children will be a bit confused about this and that provides a good opportunity to explain that bullying is OK if you are right and that, with regard to global warming, name-calling is a more reliable option than anything scientific. 



History can be covered by listing the many times in history when people thought the world was going to end. The children will no doubt question why it is any different this time from the failed doomsday prophesies of the past, and that is a great opportunity to explain to them that it is different this time because it is only climate change deniers who don’t believe the world is going to end soon and they must be wrong because they are deniers.



Data collection and research can be covered by getting the children to google search the official climate records of the New Zealand Government to find out how many more extreme weather events are occurring now because of the 1 degree of warming we have suffered since pre-industrial times. As long as the children only use official sites, such as NIWA and the Government’s Ministry for the Environment, they will find the 1 degree of warming has caused a decrease in extreme rainfall, flooding, wind and no change in drought. That will confuse them because the Minister for Climate Change says things have gotten worse. This is a good time to warn the children about the prevalence of fake news on the internet, even in official Government climate records, and that unless it supports the narrative of catastrophic global warming, it is fake news. 



Lastly, economics and the existence of gender, age and race discrimination can be covered by explaining to the children that the blame for global warming rests squarely at the feet of capitalism and greed and it is all the fault of old white men. 



In conclusion not only can a lot of important academic topics be covered under the global warming curriculum but, more importantly for children of today, social issues and learning to conform and not to question will be to the fore; which is another benefit of the curriculum because these are the traits that are increasingly valued in our modern society.

"Last Saturday, swarms of women (and more than a few men) marched in Washington and around the world following Donald Trump’s inauguration. Some readers were concerned that The Times did an inadequate job estimating how many people showed up when it described the number as more than a million worldwide. Estimating crowd sizes has long been a fraught topic. Large gatherings of people can be difficult to estimate in precise terms  —   and no one will be happy with the outcome. There’s even a group of scientists who specialize in “crowd estimates,” as a Times piece comparing the sizes of the Washington women’s march to Trump’s inauguration noted. The Times used estimates compiled by the police, as well as figures from mayoral, public safety and homeland security offices. For greater accuracy in estimating the Washington numbers, editors asked Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, to analyze aerial photographs and video. The Times incorporated all this material to reach its final estimate of “more than one million. ” Since march organizers have a vested interest in a high turnout, The Times only included their estimates parenthetically, through a link to a website reporting a total turnout of nearly five million: “(March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 ‘sister’ marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated. )” An editor who helped anchor the coverage in New York said: The marches here in the States drew foreign protesters, too, but some were denied entry on questionable grounds. That story did not appear in The Times’s pages, and several readers noticed. The public editor’s take: Not a huge story, but from what I’ve read on other news sites, it seemed like a compelling one. Unfortunately, Times readers missed out.  Readers also noticed a story that is a repeated issue for The Times and one on which the public editor has written about previously. The public editor’s take: I’m with Schafran on this one, for the reasons she states. Then there were Trump’s views on women during the presidential campaign, which came up again last weekend during the marches, such as his remarks about Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, and that infamous recording in which he brags about groping women. The issue? That The Times did not   say that Trump’s statements were misogynistic. “Many participants,” The Times wrote, “believed Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign. ” The public editor’s take: Hmmm. I’m generally reluctant to think that a journalist’s work is achieved through labels, but it’s hard to look at many of Trump’s statements and not find them misogynistic. It depends on which statement we’re referring to, but to say “some” of his statements about women are misogynistic is unequivocal. The issue of Trump and labels came up in a different context this week when The Times called one of his baseless claims a lie in a   headline: “Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers. ” The majority of readers who wrote in wrote to applaud The Times for doing so. Some other readers, however, were warier, arguing that The Times would never be able to find its way inside Trump’s mind. We went to the associate managing editor for standards, Phil Corbett, for his take on the issue. The public editor’s take: These parameters make sense to me. My vote is for using the word “lie” in a highly limited way, under specific circumstances and with   approval, as I’ve written before. As some of our readers point out, the intent of the person called out for lying matters. It can’t be just the routine stuff of the spin room. Shortly after the election, The Times ran an   piece by Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, in which he wrote, “When you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are. ” A reader wrote in then to applaud. This week, Derck wrote in again when The Times ran a story on the front page with the headline: “In a Rust Belt Town, the Women’s March Draws Shrugs and Cheers From Afar. ” “No, I’m not going to give this up,” she wrote. “I know how much work is left to do but are you still going to be calling us Rust Belt when we may be the leader in alternative energy or something else in 2090?” We shared Derck’s letters with the national editor, Marc Lacey, who said: The public editor’s take: Lacey’s answer is spot on. Last Monday, the public editor criticized a story on dads taking care of their kids while the moms marched against Trump, arguing that it should have never run. The column drew some wry responses from fathers, which we decided to highlight here. Here’s to dads."

Guest essay by Matt Manos
Skepticism has had an amazing impact on climate science given its size and persecution. Yet it still languishes as a social pariah in the green room of society. To grow, skeptics need to find a group of people that can be influenced.
Skeptics have benefited greatly through their association with Conservatives. Unfortunately, skepticism among the Conservative population has been maximized. Future growth has to come from the political middle.
According to 2014 survey by Pew, 61% of Americans believe
“…there is solid evidence that Earth’s average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades.”
What’s amazing is that 35% are willing to admit that they don’t believe the Earth has been warming in the past few decades (the remaining 4% don’t take a position). That 35% has resisted more than a decade of bellwether pushing and government campaigns. Skeptics have been out-grouped and Othered by their friends and even family members. And yet they still don’t accept CAGW or possibly even AGW. These are some stubborn people.
Are most of the 35% scientifically literate? Have they researched AGW and come to a contrary conclusion? Many scientists have reluctantly followed a lonely path to skepticism. Others in the 35% have detected a disconnect between the rhetoric of climate change and the reality on the ground. When the sky doesn’t fall for years, skepticism grows all by itself. Still, a majority of the 35% are probably skeptical because of the culture war.
Conservative leaders rally support against climate change not because they’ve done a survey of the scientific literature but because they find the policy outcomes of climate change undesirable. The association is so strong that skepticism has become linked to the Conservative movement by the general public. This linkage drives away many moderate and independent minded people before a discussion about CAGW can ever occur.
I’m not suggesting Conservative leaders temper their views and I am not trying to blame them. What I’m suggesting is that the way to grow skepticism is to engage other segments of the political sphere. Libertarians in the US are a good example. They often partner with Conservatives on policy issues but not so much on climate change. Libertarians have Othered skeptics. One way to change that is through direct lobbying by skeptic experts. Not just with Libertarians but any civic group that will host a debate. Scientific, non-partisan, debate.
That is a good message for all skeptics to have. My first post on WUWT led to some interesting rabbit holes in the comments. When I wrote about rational ignorance, I didn’t expect discussions from Truthers and anti-vaxxers. I’m not trying to pick a fight with those groups. What I am humbling suggesting is that for CAGW to become accepted by moderates and independents, skeptics need to appear above reproach on all other controversial topics. Skeptics are being lumped into a guilt by association with groups that are even more out of the mainstream than they are. Skeptics need to become single issue communicators untarnished by other controversial topics.
Skeptics need to know what they stand for and what they don’t. Skeptics get painted as deniers and conspiracy theorists and changing that perception won’t happen overnight. But it won’t happen at all if it’s not communicated. What skeptics need is a strong spokesperson. Preferably a young, charismatic, non-partisan scientist to go on daytime TV, YouTube and TV news shows. This would be a true skeptic of CAGW who could point to their belief that CO2 is a greenhouse gas as a defense against being labelled a denier. The skeptic spokesperson would be trying to reach low information viewers. The types of viewers that are most prone to rational ignorance on climate change.
I’m not calling out Conservatives or the other groups I mentioned. I’m addressing the specific topic of how I think skepticism can grow. I don’t claim these are the only ways to grow skepticism or that they’re even original. It’s easy to see what needs to happen and a lot harder to get things done. Personally, I think skepticism could grow if skeptics could get the science presented to more people. The pause is amazing stuff. To effectively communicate the pause requires different skills then influencing the scientific debate. To grow, skepticism needs a playbook and a face.

Governor Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday “a dramatic drop in state income tax revenue of $2.8 billion.” More high earners appear to be leaving New York than expected in response to the 2017 federal tax reform. “Cuomo said the law’s cap on deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000 was to blame and suggested it is, anecdotally, triggering high‐​earners to leave New York.”   
  
  
Data from both the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service have long shown that Americans are, on net, moving from higher‐​tax states such as New York to lower‐​tax states such as Florida. The issue now is whether the 2017 tax law has accelerated the trend.   
  
  
_Newsday_ notes, “Cuomo blames Trump and his 2017 tax cut legislation for prompting New York’s wealthiest taxpayers to change their legal address to another state to avoid a big federal tax hit. He said he bases this on anecdotal stories, not hard facts yet, but that the behavior of just a few thousand of these high‐​earners could have a significant impact on state revenues.”   
  
  
One way to get a real‐​time glimpse of migration patterns is to see where real estate prices and purchases are rising and falling. The _Wall Street Journal_ reports:   




A growing list of public officials in high‐​tax states are expressing alarm that big earners are bolting to low‐​tax states as new data suggests some home buyers are moving in response to the year‐​old change in the federal tax law.   
  
  
… Preliminary data show a jump in Florida home purchases by buyers from high‐​tax states. Home values in lower‐​tax areas have been rising faster than those in places where limiting the ability to deduct high state and local taxes eroded some of the savings from the federal tax reduction, according to an analysis by real estate and data firm Zillow.   
  
  
One of the biggest winners from this shift has been Miami. The city is experiencing more activity than usual from buyers living in states like New York, New Jersey and Illinois. People are drawn to the city by mild weather—as always—and by deals on condos and lower taxes.   
  
  
… While high‐​end condo prices in Miami have flattened out or even declined a bit in recent months as foreign buyers have pulled back, the market is holding up much better than New York City’s. Manhattan co‐​op and condo sales last year were down 12% from 2017 to their lowest level since 2009, a Wall Street Journal analysis found.   
  
  
Other low‐​tax cities are also doing well. Las Vegas and Phoenix have slowed a bit recently but still have the fastest home‐​price growth among major metropolitan areas, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case‐​Shiller home‐​price indexes. Brokers credit Californians fleeing rising home prices and tax changes.   
  
  
… Nelson Gonzalez, a senior vice president at EWM Realty International in Miami, said that in the past year most of the buyers for high‐​end listings that he encounters are from high‐​tax states in the U. S.—a big change from several years ago when he mostly saw foreigners. “Ninety percent of all the deals over $10 million were tax refugees,” he said.   
  
  
… “A lot of rich people are trying to find a way out of New York,” said Barry Horowitz, an accountant who specializes in helping clients switch residency to lower‐​tax states.   
  
  
… Carney Shegerian, a 54‐​year‐​old lawyer from Los Angeles, recently bought a three‐​bedroom condo in the Aria on the Bay tower in Miami for about $1.5 million. He said he plans to move there permanently and open a new branch of his law practice. The unit “is a great value compared with what you’d get in Los Angeles,” Mr. Shegerian said. And the lack of income tax in Florida is “attractive to anyone,” he said.



These new moves have likely strengthened existing migration patterns, which are shown in the chart. Each blue dot is a state. The vertical axis shows the mid‐​2017 to mid‐​2018 Census net interstate migration figure as a percentage of state population. The horizontal axis shows state and local household taxes as a percentage of personal income. Household taxes include individual income, sales, and property taxes. The red line shows the fitted relationship between the two variables.   
  
  
On the right, most of the high‐​tax states have net out‐​migration. The blue dot on the far right is New York with a tax burden of 13 percent and a net migration loss of nearly 1 percent (0.92) over the year.   
  
  
On the left, nearly all the net in‐​migration states have tax loads of less than 8.5 percent. If policymakers want their states to be attractive, they should reduce their household tax burdens to 8.5 percent or less of personal income.   
  
  
Governor Cuomo recognizes the out‐​migration problem, but what will he do about it? _Newsday_ says that he is considering spending cuts to balance the state budget, which would be a good start.   
  
  
The new federal tax law should be a wakeup call for out‐​migration states to improve their tax climates and trim their governments. High‐​tax states should aim to create simpler, lower‐​rate tax codes and improve the quality and efficiency of government services.

"One night six years ago, on a quiet side street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, I came across a photo album that had been put out with the trash. I lived around the corner, and I was walking home when I saw it sitting beneath a streetlamp on Lincoln Place. It looked handmade, with a wooden cover bound with a shoelace. But it had been tied up with twine, like a bunch of old newspapers, and left atop a pile of recycling. After hesitating a moment, I picked it up and took it home. The pages were fragile, and they cracked when I turned them, as if the album hadn’t been opened in a long time, but the photos were perfectly preserved. They seemed to chronicle the life of a black couple at midcentury: a beautiful woman with a big smile and a man who looked serious, or was maybe just   and had served in World War II. As I turned the pages, the scenery changed from country picnics to city streets and crowded dance halls in what appeared to be Harlem, and the couple went from youth to middle age. Looking at the album, I was struck by how joyful the photos were  —   and by the fact that as fabled as this era was, I had never seen a black family’s own account of that time. I wondered who these neighbors were, and who had thrown the album out. For decades, this part of Crown Heights had been mostly black. When I arrived in the neighborhood, several years before, I was one of the few nonblack residents on the block. The neighborhood was changing, though newcomers were arriving and longtime residents were moving out. I went back to Lincoln Place, hoping to find the album’s owner it had surely been thrown out by mistake. Lincoln Place was the very image of old Brooklyn promoted by real estate agents. On other blocks, the houses were carved up or crumbling. Or they had been torn down and replaced by big buildings with spotlights and   signs. But on Lincoln Place, the stately rowhouses were still intact and well loved. The block was preserved in amber. I knocked on doors and left my number, but I never heard from anyone. So I put the album on my bookshelf. A few years later, my landlords got an offer they couldn’t refuse, and my short time in Crown Heights was up. I stumbled upon the album while packing and pulled it off the shelf. Now I really had to reckon with it. Gentrification was transforming the neighborhood  —   soon there might be no one left who recognized the world in these pictures. And the album was literally falling apart in my hands. If I was ever going to try to get to the bottom of it, this was the time. I decided to uncover its story. I thought it would be simple. But chasing the album would become something of a journey, one that would take me far from   Brooklyn to the Jim Crow South, from a remote island in the Pacific to the packed tenements of Harlem, before returning me to Lincoln Place at another moment of great change. Last spring, I began the search. The photos were arranged on black   pages with little mounting corners and Scotch tape that had turned yellow with age. There were 167 pictures, and they covered both sides of the pages, as if to save space. But the photos stopped about halfway through the album. The rest of it was blank. I looked behind every photo, but there were only a few clues, handwritten notes like “From your old pal Duke,” “Myself and Sylvia” or “Love to Etta Mae, From Dorothy. ” The name Etta Mae was written on three or four photos, and I began to suspect she was the woman who appeared throughout the album. She had a full figure and elegant hands. She smoked. But I always spotted her by her smile. She was often with the same man. They were embracing, or they were in separate photos on the same page. I guessed that he was her husband on one photo, someone had written, “To my best friend’s hubby. ” Carrying photocopies of a few pictures, I went back to Crown Heights. I had been gone less than two years, but there were all sorts of changes. On Nostrand Avenue, a West Indian market that had carried buckets of salt cod had closed. Where once the only coffee had come in yellow cans of Bustelo, cafes served locally roasted espresso. There was a retro cocktail bar. On Lincoln Place, a   sign hung outside one house, and another was under renovation. There was a Pilates studio. There were more young families now, and when I asked them about the album as they swept the sidewalk or sat on their stoops, they apologized: They were new to the block and couldn’t help. One evening, I was close to giving up when a young man in a garden apartment told me to talk to Jimmy, the oldest guy on the block. He pointed to a red house a few doors down. An old man answered the door. Yes, he said, he was Jimmy  —   James Burton. I showed him the photocopied pictures, and he squinted. “That’s Mrs. Taylor,” he said. “Etta Mae. ” The man in the pictures was her husband, Isaiah Taylor. Everyone called him Ike, Mr. Burton said. The Taylors had lived on Lincoln Place forever. He pointed next door, at a white house with classical molding. When I returned to Lincoln Place a few days later with the whole album, Mr. Burton and his wife, Lenore, were doing a puzzle at a card table. “You say you just found this album on the street?” she asked, laughing. “I wouldn’t touch it. I’m amazed you would touch it. ” “Would you pick it up?” she asked her husband. “Maybe,” he said. They were in their late 80s. Ms. Burton had worked as a bookkeeper, and Mr. Burton had been a chauffeur and a shipping clerk. They had lived on Lincoln Place since the early 1950s, and raised their two daughters there. The Taylors had been their neighbors and close friends, almost like family. “In those days, we knew most everybody, and then they started disappearing and dying and moving away,” Mr. Burton said. “Now I’m lucky if I know 10 people. ” We sat on the couch and opened the album. Pages had torn loose from the binding, and as we passed them between us, black flakes fluttered to the floor. “No, no,” Mr. Burton said, peering at the faces to see if he recognized anyone. “Etta and Ike. That’s all I know is them two. ” Halfway through, we came to a page crowded with small pictures. Mr. Burton paused. “That looks like me,” he said, his voice a little louder. “Your mother, Uncle Fernando  —   that’s my wedding. ” I was hooked. Now that I had names, I enlisted a researcher at The New York Times, Susan C. Beachy, and she pulled documents for Etta Mae Taylor: census records birth, death and marriage certificates old phone books newspaper clippings. Etta Mae didn’t have children. Her siblings had all died. But she had relatives scattered across the country. The Burtons remembered a niece from North Carolina, and the researcher found someone in Raleigh named Joann Barnes. She was now in her 70s. For months, the only other thing I knew about her was that she didn’t pick up her phone. I didn’t blame her. “Hello,” I would say when I left voice mail messages, “I’m calling about a photo album that may have belonged to your family. ” Even as I said it, I knew it sounded like a scam. I tried her relatives, calling, sending emails and friendly Facebook messages, but always with the same result: silence. The documents, at least, gave me the beginnings of Etta Mae’s story. Etta Mae Barnes was born on July 28, 1918, in Wilson, N. C. which once called itself the world’s greatest   tobacco market. When Ms. Taylor was young, it was a boomtown. Thousands of   families had migrated to Wilson from the countryside to pick tobacco on farms and hang it in big warehouses downtown. The first pages in the album seemed to be of Wilson several photos had stamps from photographers’ studios there. There were portraits of women in flouncy dresses, babies, a boy with a dog, a group in straw hats in a field. In two portraits placed side by side, a   couple posed by a flowering bush, in front of a clapboard house. I wondered if they were Etta Mae’s parents. Etta Mae’s mother, Anna Bell Green Barnes, was born in Virginia and worked as a hanger at a tobacco company, the documents revealed. Her father, James Frank Barnes, was a grocery store clerk. His family went back generations in Wilson County. Etta Mae was one of six. When she was still a child, her oldest brother, Charles, boarded the train that passed through Wilson and became part of what we now call the Great Migration, the exodus of millions of black Southerners from the Jim Crow South. Judging from the album, many of Etta Mae’s relatives had gone north I could tell them apart from their country kin by their suits and furs. Etta Mae left school after seventh grade and went to work as a housekeeper in a private home, according to the 1940 census. That year, 10 other people were living at the Barneses’ including an aunt an adopted daughter Etta Mae’s sister Mildred Mildred’s husband, Jack Artis and their baby, Charles. In 1940, Etta Mae left her crowded home. But she didn’t go north just yet. She went to Suffolk, Va. where, according to her marriage license, she wed Isaiah Taylor on the day after her 22nd birthday. Ike Taylor was three years younger than Etta Mae, and when they married, he had recently graduated from high school and was working as a deliveryman. His father was a cook. His mother worked at a peanut processing plant. Suffolk, like Wilson, was segregated, unofficially divided by the railroad tracks. On one side, a sizable black community had grown, drawn by jobs in the factories of peanut producers like Planters. The Taylors’ wedding announcement in a local paper said, “The couple will reside here. ” But in 1941, the United States entered World War II, and farm work had grown scarce amid an agriculture crisis. Hundreds of thousands of black Southerners rushed to enlist, and Ike was one of them. There were about a dozen photographs from the war in the album, loose snapshots tucked in the back. They showed black soldiers amid spindly trees and what looked like Japanese shrines. Ike was an army truck commander in the 510th Port Battalion and rose to the rank of master sergeant, according to his military records. His unit was stationed on Tinian, an island in the Pacific that the United States captured from the Japanese, where the armed forces built a huge air base. (It was from Tinian that the Enola Gay took off for Hiroshima.) Today, most of the men in Ike’s unit would be approaching 100, if they were alive at all, and I had given up on getting a firsthand account, when I found a videotaped interview with a member of the 510th in the Library of Congress. James W. Taylor (no relation to Ike) died in 2014. In the video, he described their time in the army. The armed forces were still segregated, and there were almost no black combat units until troops thinned at the end of the war black soldiers were instead relegated to labor and service units. Their battalion unloaded ammunition from ships and provided transport. On Tinian, they lived apart from the white soldiers. They slept in tents in a separate camp, ate separately and drank from water tanks that they filled, separately, from a mountain spring. These men may have enlisted in the army to escape Jim Crow, but instead they found themselves on a tropical island in the Pacific that had become a replica of the segregated South. This was where records trailed off. To go any further, I needed a guide. One night in the fall, I found one. I got a Facebook message from someone in Wilson named Craig Barnes Jr. whom I had written to months before. “Sorry, I’m just seeing this now,” he said. “Do you still have that photo?” I replied immediately with a smiley face. “I have the entire album!” Over the phone, Mr. Barnes, 25, said that he was related to Etta Mae, but that he didn’t know much about her the person to talk to was his grandmother, Joann Barnes  —   the woman in Raleigh who hadn’t taken my calls. He promised to set up a conversation, but weeks went by. When we finally spoke, he had bad news: She wasn’t answering the phone. But that was all I had. So a week later, I boarded a flight for Raleigh, the album in my bag. I met up with a photographer and we drove to the last listed address for Ms. Barnes: a retirement complex in a   apartment building surrounded by trees. I was unsure if she even lived there, much less how she would feel about my visit, and as we approached, I felt nervous for the first time. I had come all this way, and though I thought the album was important, maybe I was just intruding. I pressed the buzzer and identified myself over the intercom as a reporter from New York. After a long moment, a woman’s voice crackled through the speaker. “All right,” she said. “I’ll buzz you in, dear. ” As we walked down the hall toward her apartment, Ms. Barnes stepped out from her door, as if she planned to give us only a minute. She had short gray hair and wore a   blouse. “Are you a relative of Etta Mae Taylor?” I asked. “Yes, I was her niece,” she said. I explained, quickly, how I had met the Burtons, that they had told me Etta Mae’s name and that I should look for her niece. “O. K.,” she said. “And, well,” I said, “basically, I found this on the street. ” I held out the album. She gave a surprised laugh. I laughed too, with relief. “You know, it kind of makes you leery,” Ms. Barnes said. She had gotten my messages, and her grandson’s, but she was skeptical because she had never seen her aunt’s photo album. She invited us in. Her apartment was small and neat. She had been cleaning, and after she washed her hands, we sat down. She was from Wilson, she said, but she left when she was young and spent nearly 30 years in New York, where she was a visiting nurse. She opened the album. “Oh, my goodness,” she said. “These are from way back. ” She spotted her grandparents  —   Etta Mae’s parents  —   in front of the clapboard house in Wilson where she, too, had grown up. There, in the yard, they played horseshoes and caught pigeons. She named her aunts and uncles and cousins. “And that’s me,” she said, touching a photo of a little girl. “I always liked this picture. I believe my father made this skirt. He used to make clothes for me when I was small. And I always had those big bows. ” She shook her head and smiled. “Little knock knees,” she said. Wilson was about an hour’s drive east. The downtown was deserted, the brick warehouses the only remnant of the tobacco era. Across the tracks, the house where Etta Mae grew up had been torn down. In the empty lot where it once stood, there was no trace of the family that had become so real to me. A pickup was parked in the overgrown grass. Most of Etta Mae’s family had left Wilson and scattered, but Craig Barnes Jr. was still there. We met up at an Applebee’s off the highway. I thanked him for writing to me and handed him the album. As he turned the pages, I said I had never seen a black family’s photos from this era. He said he hadn’t either. “The lifestyle they’re living looks amazing,” he said. In Etta Mae’s day, the magic of Harlem reached the South through newspapers, relatives’ letters and the radio, and in the 1940s, another wave of Southern migrants moved to New York, drawn by Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington as much as by the promise of factory jobs. “New York was the place to be,” Ms. Barnes said. While Ike was in the Pacific, Etta Mae joined her sister Mildred and her husband, along with her brother Charles, in Harlem, and the sisters found jobs pressing drapes at a factory in the garment district. “They were pressers,” Ms. Barnes said. “That was kind of the going job at the time. ” When the war was over, Ike and Etta Mae were reunited in New York. On weekends, they would go dancing  —   at small clubs and at the blocklong Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue, where thousands of couples did the jitterbug. From the time she was little, Ms. Barnes would take the train every year to visit the Taylors. “I was a Southern girl I used to go every summer with my grandmother,” she said. “When I would see them dressed up, it was exciting. Like these were some movie stars or something. ” Of her two aunts, Ms. Barnes said, Etta Mae was the serious one. “Mae thought she was the boss. She always thought she was smarter than everybody else. She was always saying, ‘Sister, you shouldn’t do that Sister, you should. ’” But she loved to dance, Ms. Barnes said. “And she could sing, too. ” The photos speak to the glamour of life in Harlem, but they barely hint at its struggles. Housing discrimination largely confined black people to Harlem, and in the 1940s, as more Southern migrants surged into the city, its blocks became some of the most densely populated in the world. Landlords charged high rents and let their buildings fall into ruin. They knew their tenants had nowhere else to go. After riots broke out in 1943, Langston Hughes wrote of Harlemites’ poverty and frustration: “Some of them don’t try anymore.   I reckon. ” Etta Mae and her sister lived in a packed tenement on West 116th Street. Their brother Charles, who in the album looks dashing in a dark suit with a pocket square, worked as a deliveryman for a florist, and shared his apartment on 131st Street with his wife and seven lodgers from the South. In the middle of the album was a series of oversize portraits of couples gathered around   tables in night clubs. I couldn’t figure out where they were taken until a clue cropped up in an old newspaper: Ike was listed among the members of the Eight Chaps Social Club, a men’s club composed of Suffolkians that was hosting a dance in Harlem. Seven of the Chaps were dead now, but the eighth picked up the phone. “Isaiah Taylor?” Walter Howell, 95, said. Of course he remembered him. “Good buddy of mine. ” He told me the photos were, indeed, from the club’s dances. They look glamorous, but all of the Chaps, Mr. Howell said, had   jobs. He had worked in a   plant preparing minks and sables. Then he answered a question that hadn’t occurred to me, which was why the Taylors had such a dazzling record of their social life. The reason was that one member of the club, Jesse Williams, was a professional photographer. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at M. I. T. told me that for Southern migrants far from home, men’s clubs like the Eight Chaps “become their new kinship networks. ” “That informal network is how you access news about where you can move,” Professor Wilder said, “where black people are moving and welcome. ” In 1950, the population of Central Harlem reached its peak, and   began to inch their way into other boroughs. The Eight Chaps scattered. Etta Mae and Ike, of course, went to Brooklyn. Crown Heights was predominantly white at the time. And when Etta Mae and Ike moved to Lincoln Place around 1950, renting a room from a black hairdresser named Lucille Stewart, they became some of the first black residents on the block. The Burtons, the neighbors whose wedding photos were in the album, came soon after. “We were about the second blacks on the block,” Lenore Burton said. Ms. Burton’s parents, Clara and Cannon Harper, moved into the white house with the classical molding, with their daughter Jackie. After they got married, the Burtons bought the red house next door. Etta Mae and Ike soon moved into the third floor of the Harpers’ white house, and the two households became like one. Etta Mae’s album captures their communal life: They shared meals, gave each other haircuts, gathered in the kitchen in their bathrobes. Ms. Burton’s sister, Jackie Jones, still lives in the white house that she grew up in and eventually inherited from her parents. On one of my visits to the Burtons’ she appeared, magically, in their living room: Back in the 1950s, they had installed a door between their homes. “All the families were intertwined more or less, though they weren’t blood relations,” Ms. Jones, 89, said. The picture the Burtons painted of the 1950s was a happy one. And it took me a moment to step back and see the obvious: During this time, as black people arrived on Lincoln Place, white families were leaving. Isabel Wilkerson, the author of “The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration,” said the timing was not a coincidence. “Fear led many white residents to flee,” she said. “Neighborhoods began to open up because white people were so fearful that they would sell at a loss. ” It was a sign of what was coming. In the next decades, hundreds of thousands of white families would leave the city, and black families would move into their homes, a phenomenon that came to be known as white flight. In 1950, the Taylors’ census tract was 95 percent white. By 1970, it was 87 percent black. White flight is often associated with the poverty and crime that plagued New York City in the later decades of the 20th century, and conjures images of muggings, abandoned buildings and urban blight. But these photos too were images of the   era: People posing beside a 1950s television console, a man at a piano, a sunny picnic. In 1956, the new homeowners formed the Lincoln Civic Block Association, which still exists. “There was a Pokeno circle, a poker circle,” Mr. Burton said. “You’d go from house to house. Nobody had a lock on the door. Our house was never locked. You’d look up, and there’d be cousin   . ” The Burtons pointed out a few houses on Lincoln Place where   still lived. A neighbor, Marilyn LeGall, 72, grew up visiting her aunt and uncle on Lincoln Place. “You played stickball, you jumped rope,” she said. “Everyone looked after the other. ” That was life on Lincoln Place, said Arthur Bates Jr. 56, who grew up on the block. “It was a real neighborhood, and a black experience no one talks about, because it wasn’t filled with drugs and it wasn’t filled with poverty,” Mr. Bates said. “It was public schools, it was playing ball, it was playing music. ” Now, he added, everyone was discovering brownstone Brooklyn. “It’s been sitting here, like so many aspects of our lives. People say, ‘It’s dripping with original details.’ Who do you think maintained it? Where were you?” Etta Mae and Ike settled down on Lincoln Place after a decade of war and uncertainty and living in cramped quarters in Harlem. Etta Mae kept working in the garment district. She went bargain hunting on Flatbush Avenue for outfits and nice furniture for their apartment. She joined a book club. Ike got dogs  —   and cars. “A blue Chevy,” Mr. Burton recalled. On the weekends, they would go to their dances, and Mildred came over. They drank cocktails and listened to records. “They were   folks,” Ms. Jones said. “You could come and sit and drink and smoke and laugh. They loved to laugh. ” They traveled, driving south to see one of Ike’s sisters in Washington, and to their hometowns. In the 1960s, they went on cruises. New York gave them a good life. And if it was lived in the shadow of white flight, it was a life they never could have had in the South. Ike’s niece, Brenda Oliver, 67, remembered her aunt arriving in Virginia wearing pretty clothes, smelling good. Ms. Oliver’s mother was a maid. “My mom lived in a house with a coal stove. She was so impressed that her siblings had gotten out of the South and made a life for themselves. ” In their later years, Ike and Etta Mae look content. In one photo, they stand beside each other, she in a dress, he in a suit. She is giving him a knowing little smile. His arm is around her shoulder. It is the last photo of the two of them together. On Aug. 5, 1971, Ike died of cancer. He was 50. After he died, Etta Mae stopped keeping the album. That was why half of the pages were blank. Etta Mae stayed on Lincoln Place. She took care of children for working couples, recalled the Burtons’ daughter, Carol Burton, 58. Etta Mae got books in the mail, never putting them on the shelf until they were read. She went to church every Sunday, at Berean Baptist nearby. She took in relatives once or twice, for brief spells, but otherwise lived alone. I found former residents of Lincoln Place. They remembered Etta Mae, but not as the young woman in the album. “She was always an old lady,” Sherrie Tanner Hammonds, 47, said. She grew up on the block with her grandmother, Ms. Stewart, the hairdresser, and now lives in Rochester. “She always had a small dog. She had a little set schedule. She would walk morning and night. ” “Rain or shine,” said Constance P. Jermin, 83, who left Lincoln Place for Georgia in 2002. “She was very deliberate and devoted. And she always greeted everyone. Always with a big smile. ” For a few years, Etta Mae and I shared the block. Our bedroom windows looked out on the same backyards, and every day, she must have walked past my house, though I can’t recall if I ever actually saw her. When she could no longer get around, Ms. Jones, her landlady, took care of her. “She was feisty,” said Ms. Jones, who said she never raised her rent from $200. “She was good until the end. ” The end was swift. In 2010, Etta Mae fell and went to the hospital, and from there, to a nursing home in East New York, Brooklyn. She died there, five long miles from Lincoln Place, on June 4, 2011. She was 92. She is buried next to her husband at Long Island National Cemetery, a veterans’ graveyard in Farmingdale, N. Y. They share a single headstone, their names on either side. Etta Mae’s funeral program ends, “Etta lived a full life. ” It was all in the album: the Great Migration, Harlem at its most chaotic and crowded, the transformation of Brooklyn. For her neighbors on Lincoln Place, Etta Mae’s album brought back happy memories of their first years on the block, but it did not stop the clock from ticking. In October, Lenore Burton died. Her widower, James Burton, plans to stay in their home on Lincoln Place. For Etta Mae’s family, the album helped fill the void left by relatives who moved to the North. They let me hold onto the album until the publication of this article. I had one last question: How did the album end up on the curb? After her aunt died, Joann Barnes came from Raleigh to arrange the funeral in Brooklyn. She hadn’t been to Lincoln Place in years and was surprised by how little her aunt’s home had changed. She had moved into the back rooms and left the rest untouched. Everything was from the 1950s  —   the kitchen sink and cabinets, the furniture in the living room, which was covered in plastic. In Ike’s old office, there was a record player, hundreds of records, and a shelf with glasses and little stirrers, the remnants of his bar. The closets were stuffed with linens and old clothes. When she went to dry her hands after washing them in the bathroom, the hand towel was so old it split in two. She was tired from the funeral, and overwhelmed. She just wanted to get home. She packed up some wedding dishes for her sister, a few pots and pans. For herself, she took some change from a drawer. “A silver dollar, some old coins,” she said. “That’s just me. I have my memory of her and our trips and what we did together. I’m not a keeper. ” As she got ready to go, Ms. Jones came in. “She asked me if I was coming back,” Ms. Barnes said, “and I said no. ‘Open the doors and let the neighbors come and take what they want. Just open it up. ’” In the weeks afterward, Ms. Jones worked her way through the apartment. She bagged up the clothes. She pulled the records off the shelf. She boxed up Etta Mae’s books. When she found the album, she tied it up with twine. And one evening, before the trucks came to pick up the recycling, she carried it outside with a few boxes and left it on the curb. A few minutes, or a few hours, passed. Then, just as Etta Mae had walked past my house so many times before, I walked by hers, picked up her album and carried it home."

When the smoke finally clears from the fires burning along Australia’s east coast, there will be the inevitable government inquiries, almost certainly a royal commission. The findings of which will almost certainly be stealthily ignored.



“The amount of prescribed burning occurring in Victoria is inadequate. it is concerned that the State has maintained a minimalist approach to prescribed burning despite recent official or independent reports and inquiries, all of which have recommended increasing the prescribed-burning program. The State has allowed the forests to continue accumulating excessive fuel loads, adding to the likelihood of more intense bushfires and thereby placing firefighters and communities at greater risk.”



– 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission.



In the meantime, though, the rush is to control the narrative, get in first on the blame game. “Our” taxpayer-funded national broadcaster is shamefully joining the scramble, by throwing certain inconvenient facts down the Memory Hole.



It was reported on social media on Monday that ABC Gippsland deleted a news story they shared in September about members of the local Nowa Nowa community protesting strategic asset protection burns in the region.



As the photos show, it was the usual crowd of nosey-nannas and grey-bearded hippies and the rest of what Orwell derided as “that whole, dreary tribe”.



During the protests, ABC Gippsland reported, “The protesters held up signs, positioned themselves in the area that was planned to burn.”



One of the protesters allegedly commented to the ABC, saying she hoped she wouldn’t be fined, but she was more concerned about climate change.



“I’m more worried about climate change, and the impact the burns are having…”



Well, there’s certainly an [impact being felt **now**.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-29/people-told-to-leave-east-gippsland-as-bushfire-risk-rises/11831304)



It should be noted that these Green malcontents stood in the way of reducing the fuel loads which have inflamed the mega-fires now burning in the region, not once, but **twice**.



The burn was stopped according to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, awaiting another opportunity to complete it.



On October 23, the ABC reported on a second protest that took place at Nowa Nowa in relation to the rescheduled backburn that was meant to take place in September.



As a result, ABC Gippsland reported that the local community were relieved at the results of their protest…



I wonder how “relieved” their neighbours are feeling now?



After the September story was recently shared on social media in light of the current bushfire emergency, ABC Gippsland allegedly removed the post.



This is not the first time “our” government-funded broadcasters have tried to [hide inconvenient truths about these bushfires](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/australias-taxpayer-funded-media-hide-the-truth-about-bushfires/) from the Australian public.



Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTrick of the radiative forcing of 3.7W/m2 at the tropopause
by Kyoji Kimoto
Radiative forcing is defined as 3.7W/m2 for 2xCO2 at the tropopause by the IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) to avoid the usage of the surface radiative forcing of around 1W/m2. It is greatly reduced from the radiative forcing of around 4W/m2 at the tropopause due to IR absorption overlap between CO2 and water vapor plentifully existing at the surface.
Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982) developed a basic idea of the IPCC trick to overcome Newell & Dopplick (1979) claiming a climate sensitivity of 0.24K with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 as shown by the following history of the AGW theory.
1959: Plass wrote:
In addition, nearly all water vapor remains close to the ground, while carbon dioxide diffuses more evenly through the atmosphere. Thus throughout most of the atmosphere carbon dioxide is the main factor determining changes in the radiation flux.
 Wiscombe (2013) explains the Plass’s idea as follows in his lecture at NASA.
Plass also notes that CO2 greenhouse action is relatively unimpeded above 2-3km.
1967: Manabe & Wetherald obtained a climate sensitivity of 2.4K with one dimensional radiative-convective model (1DRCM) utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2 giving uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface. They did not mention the Plass’s idea that CO2 greenhouse effect is greatly reduced at the surface due to IR absorption overlap with water vapor because their careless assumption of the fixed lapse rate prevented their study from self-criticism of uniform warming (see Fig.2).
1975: Manabe & Wetherald obtained an averaged climate sensitivity of 2.9K and polar climate sensitivity of 7-9K with 3DGCM which is based on the 1DRCM study of Manabe & Wetherald (1967).
1979: Newell & Dopplick obtained a climate sensitivity of 0.24K with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 to criticize Manabe & Wetherald (1975).
1979: Ramanathan et al. wrote:
For example, with a doubling of CO2, Manabe & Wetherald (1975) estimates an increase in surface temperature of 2.0-2.5K within equatorial regions. From Fig.5 the surface heating of 1.1 W/m2 at the equator, due to the radiative effects of doubled CO2, can cause a maximum surface warming of about 0.2K, and hence roughly 90% of the 2.0-2.5K surface warming obtained by Manabe & Wetherald (1975) is caused by the atmospheric feedback processes described above.
1981: Ramanathan obtained the following surface warming with the feedback mechanism shown by Fig.1 copied from his review in 1998.


1981: Hansen et al. showed a climate sensitivity of 1.9K with 1DRCM study following Manabe & Wetherald (1967) utilizing the radiative forcing of 4 W/m2.
1982: Kiehl & Ramanathan obtained the following results for 2xCO2 utilizing H2O continuum absorption in the 12-18 microns region.
Kiehl & Ramanathan wrote:
But, the influence of this H2O overlap with CO2 bands is relatively smaller on the radiative heating of the joint surface/troposphere system. In particular, the effect of CO2 increase on the radiative heating of the joint surface/ troposphere system is affected very little by the presence of the water vapor continuum in the 12-18 microns region. We stress the importance of considering the troposphere/ surface system as a whole, when analyzing the effects of increasing CO2. As pointed out recently by Ramanathan (1981), results based upon surface energy balance alone can lead to incongruous conclusions.”
From Hansen et al. (1981) and Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982), the radiative forcing for
2xCO2 is 4 W/m2 at the tropopause giving the no-feedback climate sensitivity of 1.2K with the sensitivity factor of 0.3K/(W/m2) based on Cess (1976) as follows:
 4 W/m2 x 0.3 K/(W/m2) = 1.2K
 Soden & Held (2006) shows climate sensitivity is 3K for 2xCO2 from the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007) as follows:
  Climate sensitivity = no-feedback sensitivity (Planck response) x feedbacks
= 1.2K x 2.5 = 3K

Here, feedbacks are water vapor, ice albedo, lapse rate and cloud feedback.
The no-feedback sensitivity is uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface, which is originated from the 1DRCM studies of Manabe & Wetherald (1967) and Hansen et al. (1981) utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2.
The 1DRCM studies, however, are fudged due to their strong dependence on lapse rate used according to Hansen’s idea expressed in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA here.
And Cess admits his mathematical errors of the derivation to obtain the sensitivity factor of 0.3 K/(W/m2) in Cess (1976) here and here.
Kiehl & Ramanathan (1982) is based on the joint surface/troposphere system which is originated from Cess (1976) and is in line with the 1DRCM studies giving uniform warming throughout the troposphere and the surface due to the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2. Since it is a blanket model, the OLR decrease at the tropopause heats the troposphere and the surface as shown by their conclusion above.
On the contrary, a radiation height change model is the orthodox AGW theory as shown by Mitchell (1989) and Held & Soden (2000). In Fig.2, radiation height increases from point a to point b due to increased opaqueness when CO2 is doubled. This decreases the temperature at the effective radiation height of 5km causing an energy imbalance between the absorbed solar radiation (ASR) of 240W/m2 and the outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) in Fig. 3.
In order to restore the balance of energy, the radiation temperature increases from point b to point c. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, a warming of 1K at the effective radiation height is enough to remove the energy imbalance caused by the radiative forcing of 4 W/m2 for 2xCO2 in Fig. 2.
For the Manabe method, the surface temperature increases in the same degree of 1K utilizing the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km in Fig. 2. It, however, is erroneous since the 1DRCM studies are fudged according to the Hansen’s idea above.
In contrast, Kimoto model follows Ramanathan (1981) giving the no-feedback sensitivity of 0.17K with the direct heating of 1.2W/m2 for 2xCO2 from the Stefan-Boltzmann law at the surface. It is also in line with Newell & Dopplick (1979) giving a surface climate sensitivity of 0.24K based on the surface radiative forcing of around 1W/m2 and the evaporation cooling from the surface of the ocean.
In conclusion, the surface warming should be calculated with the surface radiative forcing of around 1 W/m2 utilizing the Stefan-Boltzmann law at the surface. The upper troposphere warming nullifies the radiative forcing at the tropopause due to CO2 increase with restoring OLR which is decreased by the opaqueness increase of the atmosphere.

"**Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the site of a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong.**
The attack happened at the Cityplaza mall in the Tai Koo district on Hong Kong Island.
The local hospital authority said four men and one woman were injured, with two in critical condition.
One of the injured, a local councillor, had his ear partially bitten off by the as-yet unidentified male attacker, who was subdued by passersby in the mall.
Witnesses said the Mandarin-speaking attacker drew a knife after a political argument with people in the mall, which was the site of pro-democracy protests earlier in the day.
The local councillor, Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, reportedly was attempting to prevent the attacker leaving the scene when the man bit off a section of his ear. Witnesses said the attacker was badly beaten by passersby who intervened, before police arrested the man.
One of the victims, a woman, told the South China Morning Post that the suspect drew a knife after arguing with her sister and her husband, who were also injured. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that that attacker was a Mandarin-speaking pro-Beijing supporter.
Hong Kong has experienced five months of sometimes violent demonstrations by pro-democracy activists, who first took to the streets to protest against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.
The wave of pro-democracy protests continued this weekend, days after a high-profile activist, Joshua Wong, was banned from standing in local elections. Police fired tear gas on Sunday into crowds of demonstrators in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, home to the Cityplaza where the stabbing occurred.
With no end in sight, China's leaders signalled last week that they were preparing to change how the mainland administered Hong Kong.
Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters that officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on what exactly might change.
Last month, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked, apparently with hammers. Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood.
From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"".

Images and footage of the incident spread quickly around social media platforms. The man who did the biting was subdued by a crowd, which then beat him, some using metal objects.
That is was all happening in a shopping centre being stormed by riot police in pursuit of protestors who were earlier singing and chanting made it even more intense. A small group of hardcore activists had also smashed up shops whose owners they judged to be too ""pro-Beijing"".
I watched the footage on a television in a small restaurant in Hong Kong. Halfway through the report, the woman running the place turned and walked away from the screen. ""This is all too depressing,"" she said in Chinese."

Executive Director, The Saltbush Club



 _Viv Forbes has been an explorer and pastoralist in Queensland and NT for most of his long life. He has lit fires (accidentally and deliberately), and he and his wife have fought fires and had their camps, fences and pastures wiped out by fires. They were both members of a local bush fire brigade for over 25 years. (Judy was even qualified)._



There was a time when Australian foresters kept Australian forests safe and productive. They maintained access tracks bridges and fire breaks, undertook prescribed burning, cleared flammable litter from the forest floor, cut suckers, manned fire lookouts and maintained their own fire-fighting crews in decentralised districts. University-trained professional foresters were supported by tough experienced rangers who learned their job in the bush.



Almost every advance in bushfire management in Australia, from the science of fire behaviour to aerial burning was thanks to our foresters. Into the 1980’s they were regarded as international leaders.



To pay for good forest management, sections of the forest were logged, allowing ground space and sunlight for the swift re-growth of new trees.



And those fading die-hards still beating alarm drums about man-made global warming should be reassured – the use of hardwood and softwood timber in power poles, telephone poles, bridges, wharves, posts, sleepers, haysheds and houses provided long term sequestration of the dreaded carbon. Moreover, growing trees extract CO2 more quickly than mature trees. Win, win, win.



Then we entered the Green Era. Foresters and timber-getters were demonised by urban greens, their tame bureaucrats and academics, and their ABC mates. State forests were converted to National Parks and Wilderness Areas and John Howard created the hated Kyoto Protocol Forests on private land. Timber imports rose.



Every locked-up, un-managed, un-burnt forest inevitably breeds disastrous wild-fires. The combination of heavy fuel load, poor access for fire fighters, drought, hot winds, arsonists and dry lightning has only one assured outcome – a bushfire tragedy for the forest and the neighbours. (Why are no greens chaining themselves to trees now?)



This must change. No enquiries are needed. Anyone without green blinkers can see the evidence daily. So, cut the locks, open the tracks and remove the trash. Then call tenders from local people to use recreation, tourism, timber getting or hunting feral animals to fund proper care and maintenance of our forests. A well-managed forest can pay for its own management and also keep the community safe and happy.



Control must be local. Local Foresters and local fire Wardens must call the shots on when/how to reduce flammable litter, weeds and suckers. Everyone should have the right (maybe the obligation), to fire proof their own properties and boundaries. There should be no more national parks – just local parks. And arson should be treated as terrorism.



The State governments can provide weather forecasts, bushfire warnings, radar information, aerial support and TV performances.



The Feds should return some of their tax receipts to help us to restore the forests we have lost, but otherwise they should keep out of the way.



The urban greens have had their moment in the sun. They seized management of Australian forests from Australian Foresters, and have had every opportunity over the last 25 years to apply their evergreen theories on bushfire management. The result is there for everyone to observe – **total and tragic failure.**



Far too many bushfires start in National Parks. Few stay in the Parks.



It’s time to get sensible forest policies and professional forest managers back on the job.



Get rid of the Red Bull and the Green Fairies – bring back the White Knights.

"The leads have dried up in the killing of a young woman in Queens  during a jog last summer. Tips about potential suspects have gone nowhere. A reward has failed to bear fruit, even as it has swelled to over $280, 000. And the samples of a stranger’s DNA found on the hands, throat and cellphone of the jogger, Karina Vetrano, 30, did not match those in national offender databases. But the authorities say that the recovered DNA could hold the key to solving the case if state officials authorize what is called familial searching, which allows investigators to search criminal databases to identify likely relatives of the offender. The technique, which has been used more than a dozen times in the United States over the last 10 years, represents a frontier in the evolving world of forensic science. While some methods, like microscopic hair testing and   matching, have been challenged in recent years, DNA testing remains a staple of forensic investigation, used to both identify suspects and exonerate the wrongfully convicted. Familial searching allows investigators to search offender databases with wider parameters to identify people who are likely to be close relatives of the person who may have committed a crime. Law enforcement officials say a hit in the database is less a piece of evidence than it is a lead, and such matches have helped solve some heinous crimes in states where the practice has been authorized. But the method raises some complicated ethical issues that have trailed the expansion of DNA technology since its introduction. And as the collection of DNA grows in the private sector, so do the concerns about its potential misuse, particularly in the hands of government institutions. Problems at some laboratories, including the New York City medical examiner’s office, have highlighted how DNA evidence is not immune from human error. A 2013 review of more than 800 rape cases processed by the medical examiner’s office found that DNA evidence was mishandled in dozens of cases. In the case of Ms. Vetrano, who the police say was sexually assaulted and strangled,  lack of progress led Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, to push for familial searching. “The Police Department reached a point where they exhausted all their leads. And they came to us and said in essence, ‘What else can we possibly do? ’” Mr. Brown said in an interview. Mr. Brown and two of his deputies, Eric Rosenbaum and Robert J. Masters, said that Ms. Vetrano’s case presented an ideal situation for using familial searching, in part because of what they say is the high likelihood that the DNA is from the perpetrator. “It is a stranger rape case,” Mr. Masters said. “In the annals of law enforcement, there are few fact patterns that are more frightening. ” The New York State Commission on Forensic Science, a   panel appointed by the governor to develop standards for forensic laboratories, and its   DNA subcommittee will hold a meeting next month on whether to authorize the technique. Familial DNA searching was pioneered in Britain, helping in 2002 in what was believed to be the first conviction using the technique. In 2008, California became the first state in the country to authorize the testing, and Colorado followed a year later. It has now been used in at least eight other states. California has solved seven cases using familial searching, a spokeswoman for the state’s Justice Department said. One was the   Grim Sleeper case in Los Angeles. A serial killer preyed on vulnerable women and eluded identification for decades until investigators matched crime scene DNA to the killer’s son, whose DNA was in an offender database. “You’ve got a serial murderer or rapist in your community  —   you sit on your hands and wait for him to get in your database or do you try something?” said Mitchell R. Morrissey, an early proponent of the testing and a former district attorney in Denver. In New York, efforts to authorize such testing through the Legislature went nowhere several years ago. A compromise that allowed the authorities to use partial DNA matches automatically generated in the course of routine investigations has proved ineffective. But Ms. Vetrano’s case  —   along with the public pleas of her father, Philip, and his    work with the Police Department and elected officials  —   has   the push for familial searching. Critics of the technique say that regardless of its potential for success, it expands the use of DNA databases beyond their original intent. They fault it for allowing for searches of people who happen to be related to someone who has committed a crime, and say that given the composition of the offender databases, familial searching disproportionately affects blacks and Hispanics. “You’re creating a database of suspects largely defined by their race and class,” said Stephen Mercer, the chief attorney of the forensics division of the public defender’s office in Maryland, which outlawed the technique in 2008 in the face of these concerns. “That is just so fundamentally against our core values. ” The District of Columbia has also prohibited these searches. Leads provided by familial DNA have resulted in errors. A filmmaker in New Orleans was told that he was a suspect in a murder in Idaho based on a DNA sample given by his father years earlier as part of a   genealogy project. Ancestry. com, which had purchased the database from a nonprofit that had collected the DNA, was required by a court order to identify the man to the police. The man was cleared after his DNA  —   which he gave under a court order  —   was tested. Since then, Ancestry. com has made the database private and has not received any other requests from law enforcement officials for health or genetic information about an Ancestry member, a spokesman for the company said. The spokesman, Brandon Borrman, said the company would comply with such a request only if legally required. Proponents of the technique said the filmmaker’s case could have been handled differently DNA samples of potential suspects can be retrieved surreptitiously, from a discarded soda can, for example. But in some cases, that hasn’t been a ready option. Investigators chasing the   BTK serial killer in Wichita, Kan. compelled a hospital to turn over a sample of the suspect’s daughter’s DNA she had recently undergone a Pap test. That sample allowed the police to acquire an arrest warrant for the man, Dennis Rader. Mr. Rader later was sentenced to more than 170 years in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of   murder. The legal implications of familial testing, namely whether it is limited by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches or the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, have not been tested in the courts, Erin E. Murphy, a law professor at New York University, said. She said the logic that law enforcement officials rely on to support familial testing should, by extension, support the testing of other government databases, which include repositories of DNA from members of the military, forensic personnel and crime victims. But such testing would most likely face wider opposition. “Familial searching is just an   around these debates,” said Professor Murphy, the author of “Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA. ” “You shouldn’t have fewer civil rights because you’re related to someone who broke the law. ” A spokesman for Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said it would be premature to answer questions about whether the office would seek to search other databases. If the DNA subcommittee and the New York State forensic commission vote to approve familial searching after the meeting on Feb. 10, a   period for public comment will follow. The Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union have both filed memos with the commission that question the method’s constitutionality as well as the commission’s authority to weigh in on the matter. Many law enforcement officials around the state said that any   in civil liberties were minor compared with the potential to solve some particularly difficult cases. “Invasion of privacy is basically what law enforcement does. We do it legally. We do it with warrants, court orders,” William J. Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney and a proponent of the technique, said. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is a member of the state forensic commission, compared the method to a tip from an informant. “You’re telling me that if I have a scientific piece of evidence that shows me a perpetrator’s son is in prison  —   what’s a better lead?” In New York City, the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, and the district attorneys from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, support authorizing the method. Mr. Vetrano acknowledges that the testing may not lead to his daughter’s killer, but he said he would continue to advocate its use. “This would have been left as a dead issue unless I started making waves,” he said. “I’m the squeaky wheel and I will never ever stop. ”"

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
On June 29, 2016 the University of Delaware (UD) unleashed a climate penguin panic with its press release:
Penguins and climate change:
UD scientists report projected response of Adélie penguins to Antarctic climate change
It’s a big question: how is climate change in Antarctica affecting Adélie penguins? Climate has influenced the distribution patterns of Adélie penguins across Antarctica for millions of years. The geologic record tells us that as glaciers expanded and covered Adélie breeding habitats with ice, penguin colonies were abandoned. When the glaciers melted during warming periods, this warming positively affected the Adélie penguins, allowing them to return to their rocky breeding grounds. But now, University of Delaware scientists and colleagues report that this beneficial warming may have reached its tipping point. In a paper published today in Scientific Reports, the researchers project that approximately 30 percent of current Adélie colonies may be in decline by 2060 and approximately 60 percent may be in decline by 2099.”
That’s absolutely bitter. More than half of the penguins will be dead by 2099. In earlier times they benefitted from climate warming, but today heat is threatening to wipe them out. How has this come to be? The press release continues:
It is only in recent decades that we know Adélie penguins population declines are associated with warming, which suggests that many regions of Antarctica have warmed too much and that further warming is no longer positive for the species,” said the paper’s lead author Megan Cimino, who earned her doctoral degree at UD in May.”
Antarctica has warmed unusually over the past decades?

Unfortunately that is completely wrong, see here. Precisely on this subject a new paper by Jones et al. 2016 in Nature Climate Change tells us:
Assessing recent trends in high-latitude Southern Hemisphere surface climate
Understanding the causes of recent climatic trends and variability in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere is hampered by a short instrumental record. Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. However, most observed trends are not unusual when compared with Antarctic paleoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability likely overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.“
Perhaps the penguin researchers should first take a better look at this paper as soon as it gets published officially. It becomes necessary to explain why the Adélie-penguins are even alive today because the Antarctic Peninsula was warmer than today many times over the past thousands of years. By the way, the last warm phase in Antarctica occurred as an effect of the Medieval Warm Period.
When one looks more closely at the University of Delaware paper, the tricks the penguin researches are using quickly becomes clear. For assessing the danger, a middle of the pack climate model scenario was not used. No, instead the absolute most grim model by the name of RCP 8.5 was used. It just could not be worse. It’s like being sure you’ll have a car accident on the way to work today.
We at this blog constantly have to make official complaints when the media simply take over press releases without checking, and thus promote climate alarm. Finally, there is some good news: It appears people have in fact gotten more careful, as a search for the report turned up no result. That’s very praiseworthy. The sole exception is the Internet platform wetter.de, who found it too much to resist – and took the bait.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew Paper: From 1992-2014, There Was A
Pause In CO2’s Influence On Temperature

“Monthly variations of the areal averaged atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect parameter anomalies (Gaa and Gsa) from 1979 to 2014 for the (a) globe”

Between the years 1992 and 2014, anthropogenic CO2 emissions rates grew by 65%, or from a yearly average of 6.1 gigatons of carbon (GtC) in 1992 to a rate of 10.1 GtC by 2014 (Global Carbon Budget, 2014).
However, according to a new Nature paper entitled “A Hiatus of the Greenhouse Effect” by Song, Wang, & Tang (2016), there has been an overall hiatus to slight decline in the influence of the greenhouse warming effect on temperature beginning in 1992, which has coincided with the well-established pause in global warming since the early 2000s.
The encapsulating graph from the paper is depicted above, illustrating that the global-scale atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect (Gaa and Gsa) has remained flat or slightly declined between 1992 and 2014, during the same period time that anthropogenic CO2 emissions were rapidly rising.
This strongly suggests that anthropogenic CO2 emissions retain a very modest role in affecting variations in the overall greenhouse effect.

Song, Wang & Tang, 2016
A Hiatus of the Greenhouse Effect

[T]he primary goal of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the greenhouse effect to better evaluate its potential impact.
Because of the shorter period of the CERES EBAF product, the areal averaged Gsa [surface greenhouse effect] is represented only between 2003 and 2014 in Fig. 2 but shows no notable trend over the globe, sea or land. Thus, the surface greenhouse effect has not been strengthened in the last decade.
In the 1980s,a significant increasing Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] tendency exists with a linear estimate of 0.19 W m−2 yr−1. However, this uprising trend pauses starting in circa 1992, when Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] begins to slightly decrease at a rate of −0.01 W m−2 yr−1. This statistically non-significant trend indicates that the enhancing global atmospheric greenhouse effect is slowed down. Moreover, the atmospheric greenhouse effect hiatus can be found over both sea and land.
The oceanic Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]exhibits a notable increasing trend with a rate of 0.21 W m−2 yr−1 in 1979–1991, whereas its rate of change (−0.04 W m−2 yr−1) during 1992–2014 is not statistically significant. By contrast, although a sudden change in the Gaa tendency is observed overland, the breakpoint is approximately 5 years later than that of the oceanic Gaa. The terrestrial Gaa trends are 0.12 W m−2 yr−1 and 0.05 W m−2 yr−1 before and after 1997, respectively.
In the last subperiod [2003-2014], the global averaged SULR [surface upwelling longwave radiation/greenhouse effect] anomaly remains trendless (0.02 W m−2 yr−1) because Ts [global temperatures] stop rising. Meanwhile, the long-term change of the global averaged OLR anomaly (−0.01 W m−2 yr−1) is also not statistically significant. Thus, these two phenomena result in a trendless Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect].
[A]remarkably decreasing Gaa trend (−0.27 W m−2 yr−1) exists over the central tropical Pacific, indicating a weakened atmospheric greenhouse effect in this area, which largely offsets the warming effect in the aforementioned surrounding regions. As a result, a trendless global averaged Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]   is displayed between 1991 and 2002 (Fig. 2).
Again, no significant trend of the global averaged Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect] is found from 2003 to 2014 (Fig. 2) because the enhanced warming effect over the western tropical Pacific is largely counteracted by the weakened warming influence on the central tropical Pacific.


Explanation: Cloud Variations, Water Vapor Dominate Greenhouse Effect, With Insignificant CO2 Influence

As scientists Song, Tang, & Wang (2016) point out, during the 2003 to 2014 period, global temperatures “stop rising”.  In fact, temperatures declined slightly during this period according to HadCRUT and RSS.

Song, Wang, & Tang ultimately provide an explanation for the hiatus in the global-scale greenhouse effect (from the early 1990s to present) and temperature rise (from the early 2000s to present).  They insinuate that water vapor and clouds are the dominant contributors to greenhouse warming, and the CO2 contribution is quite modest by comparison.  Small variations in water vapor and cloud can therefore supersede large variations in CO2 in determining trends in the overall greenhouse effect.  Below are the key points from the rest of the paper detailing CO2’s small contribution to the overall greenhouse effect (relative to water vapor, clouds).

Song, Wang & Tang, 2016
[T]he influences of water vapor and clouds … contribute approximately 75% of the total [greenhouse] effect.
The results above indicate that the notably downward Gaa tendency over the central tropical Pacific indeed plays an important role in inducing the greenhouse effect hiatus since the 1990s. What causes this decreasing Gaa [atmospheric greenhouse effect]? The variation of the greenhouse effect is substantially influenced by its contributors, including water vapor, clouds, and GHGs. GHG concentrations have risen steadily during recent decades. The variations of metrics related to the other two contributors are given in Fig. 4a and are based on the CERES-EBAF products between 2003 and 2014. The total column precipitable water (TCPW) anomaly significantly increases at a rate of 0.44 cm yr−1. However, the cloud area fraction (CAF) anomaly is reduced by −0.60% yr−1, which is consistent with the decreasing cloud activity described in previous publications. Therefore, although the greenhouse effect can be enhanced by increasing GHGs and water vapor in the atmosphere, it can be weakened by decreasing clouds. If these two actions offset each other, a hiatus of the global greenhouse effect will result. 
[T]his pause in the greenhouse effect is mostly caused by the high number of La Niña events between 1991 and 2014. A strong La Niña indicates suppressed convection in the tropical central Pacific that reduces atmospheric water vapor content and cloud volume.
[T]he atmospheric and surface greenhouse effect parameters both become trendless when clouds are considered. … Overall, the downward tendency of clouds is the dominant contributor to the greenhouse effect hiatus.
In conclusion, the pause of the greenhouse effect since the 1990s may be one of the reasons for the global warming hiatus starting in the early 2000s.

The Scientific Literature Substantiates Insignificant CO2 Influence

The explanation that water vapor and clouds are the most dominant contributors to the overall greenhouse effect — and that the CO2 contribution is insignificant by comparison — has been well known and documented in the scientific literature for decades.  For example:

Willett, 1974
“[R]ecent increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide have contributed much less than 5% of the recent changes of atmospheric temperature, and will contribute no more than that in the foreseeable future.”

Dunbar, 1976
“[T]he measured increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, according to the most recent computations, would not be enough to have any measurable climatic effect. Rasool and Schneider (1971) conclude that an increase in the carbon dioxide content of eight times the present level would produce an increase in surface temperature of less than 2°C, and that if the concentration were to increase from the present level of 320 parts per million to about 400 by the year 2000, the predicted increase in surface global temperature would be about 0.1°C.”

Ramanathan et al., 1989
“Water vapour and cloud are the dominant regulators of the radiative heating of the planet. … The greenhouse effect of clouds may be larger than that resulting from a hundredfold increase in the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere. … The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling.”

Wielicki et al., 2002
“It is widely assumed that variations in Earth’s radiative energy budget at large time and space scales are small. We present new evidence from a compilation of over two decades of accurate satellite data that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) tropical radiative energy budget is much more dynamic and variable than previously thought. Results indicate that the radiation budget changes are caused by changes in tropical mean cloudiness. The results of several current climate model simulations fail to predict this large observed variation in tropical energy budget. The missing variability in the models highlights the critical need to improve cloud modeling in the tropics so that prediction of tropical climate on interannual and decadal time scales can be improved.”

Kauppinen et al., 2014
“We will show that changes of relative humidity or low cloud cover explain the major changes in the global mean temperature. We will present the evidence of this argument using the observed relative humidity between years 1970 and2011 and the observed low cloud cover between years 1983 and 2008. One percent increase in relative humidity or in low cloud cover decreases the temperature by 0.15 °C and 0.11 °C, respectively. In the time periods mentioned before the contribution of the CO2increase was less than 10% to the total temperature change.”

Hamdan, 2016
“The analysis showed that the main atmospheric parameters that affect the amount of global radiation received on earth’s surface are cloud cover and relative humidity. Global radiation correlates negatively with both variables. Linear models are excellent approximations for the relationship between atmospheric parameters and global radiation. A linear model with the predictors total cloud cover, relative humidity, and extraterrestrial radiation is able to explain around 98% of the variability in global radiation.”

Summarizing Question:  Why is there so much preoccupation with atmospheric CO2 concentrations and reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions when it is well documented in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that the CO2 contribution to the overall greenhouse effect is so weak that it can be easily supplanted by small changes in clouds and water vapor, or natural climate-changing constituents?

"Earth Hour is a sacred rite of the global warming religion whose message is: confess, do penance (turn out the lights for an hour once a year), and your sins will be forgiven.

The harsh reality is that if we must cut CO2 emissions by 90%, then we have to cut our energy use by about 70%. The only proven alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear, but reactors are expensive, take years to build and have been ruled out by the Rudd government. While “dam” is a dirty word, there will be no more hydro power. Using gas for base load electricity generation is a criminal waste. Only the dangerously deluded believe that solar and wind will ever supply more than a small fraction of energy demand. It will be decades before geothermal “hot fractured rock” power is contributing significantly to the grid – if technical problems and the tyranny of distance can be overcome. “Bio-fuels” are environmentally devastating; incur a carbon-debt that won’t be repaid for decades; and are already causing global food shortages. Nuclear Fusion’s promise of unlimited clean energy could be a century away – if it is ever economically viable. “Clean coal” is expensive, unproven, and faces significant opposition from the environmental movement.
Earth Hour should be expanded to Earth Month. Electric lighting, television, computers, home heating and air-conditioning, private motor vehicles and air transportation would be banned. All energy-intensive industries would be shut down and affected workers stood down without pay.
By giving people a small taste of life under future energy rationing, and testing their resolve, Earth Month would be more than just empty, feel-good symbolism.

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has been heckled by opposition lawmakers for a second day as she tried to answer questions in parliament.**
After shouting and holding up placards, 11 opposition members were removed from the session by security guards.
On Wednesday, Ms Lam was forced to suspend her annual policy address after she was interrupted by opponents.
Hong Kong has seen months of mass protests against the government, sparked by a proposed extradition law.
The opposition forms a small minority in the Legislative Council (Legco) but managed to repeatedly interrupt Ms Lam, forcing the session to be adjourned several times.
Some of the ejected lawmakers were holding white flowers to express solidarity with people injured during months of demonstrations.
As they were dragged out, they shouted: ""Carrie Lam you should not stay on as chief executive! You are not qualified.""
Her critics in the session accused her of not addressing the political crisis in her policy speech the previous day.
Ms Lam dismissed the allegations, insisting her policy proposals about Hong Kong's housing crisis were in fact addressing pressing social concerns.
On the protests which have engulfed the city for months, she reiterated that people should abstain from violence and solve disagreements within the spirit of the rule of law.
The chief executive also said the city was facing economic recession and that her government would offer subsidies to affected businesses.
Initially a protest against an extradition law - which would have meant Hong Kongers could have been sent to China to stand trial - the demonstrations have grown to include demands full democracy.
Hong Kong was once a British colony but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country two systems"" principle. That means it has more freedoms and rights than the mainland.
Its leadership, however, is not directly democratically elected - and Carrie Lam is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment.
Many in Hong Kong fear that Beijing's growing influence is gradually eroding the territory's freedoms.
In September, the government promised the extradition bill would be completely withdrawn once parliament resumed, but demonstrations continued.
Protesters now have five key demands:
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
On Wednesday evening, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked.
Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood."

Over the next couple of days, as the Nor’easter honing in on the New England coast matures and eventually unleashes its winter storm fury, you are going to be subject to a lot of global warming hype.   
  
After all, the climate change alarmist credo is: let no extreme weather event pass without pointing out that it is “consistent with” climate change caused by human industrial society.   
  
The push has already begun.   
  
But this time around, the pushback is also well-prepared.   
  
While the “curator” of the _Washington Post_ ’s newly-minted online “Energy and Environment” section Chris Mooney tells us in his article that global warming may make blizzards worse by increasing the temperature of the western Atlantic ocean and thereby increasing the moisture feed into the developing storm, meteorologist Ryan Maue is quick to point out that just the opposite is likely the result—that the elevated sea surface temperatures actually act to make such storms tamer.   
  
Maue goes on to add that it is “easy to make case that global warming weakened this blizzard significantly due to warmer [sea surface temperatures].”   
  
While Ryan is probably being a bit optimistic here, the reality is that this blizzard (in fact pretty much _all_ storm events) are the result of a very complex system of physical interactions—the precise behavior of each one of which is not completely understood, much less perfectly predictable. This makes ascertaining the influence of human-caused climate change virtually (if not entirely) impossible.   
  




  
  
Blizzards affecting New York City are perfect examples of this.   
  
A couple years back, during another New York City blizzard, we looked at some of the confounding factors at play in determining how much it snows in Central Park. Our conclusion after reviewing the cases for both more and less snowfall there?   




Which leaves natural variability as the primary driver of just how white New York City’s winters are.



Figure 1 will give you some idea of what we were talking about. It shows the winter snowfall history from New York’s Central Park since the late 1800s.

Kudos to you if you can pick out the patterns formed by global warming. And if you can, please write them up for scientific publication somewhere. The world awaits the definitive answer.   
  
In the meantime, don't belive the hype.

"**A strategically important airport in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region has become a key battleground between opposing forces in the current conflict.**
Pro-government accounts say the Ethiopian military controls Aksum airport - but this does not appear to have prevented Tigray special forces mounting an attack and disabling the runway in the past few days.
With communications from the region largely cut, the situation has been unclear.
But we've taken a look at some footage put out about the attack, and satellite images of the airport, to try to piece together a timeline of events.
Ethiopian forces captured the airport on 11 November, according to pro-government social-media accounts.
Until that point, it had been in the hands of the Tigray regional forces (known as the TPLF).
But control of the airport and the surrounding region was clearly not settled on that date.
On Thursday, 19 November, the Tigray leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, told the Reuters news agency Aksum town was still in their hands - but it is unclear if that included the airport.
""Aksum is with us - but there is an army sent to control Aksum - but there is a fight,"" Mr Debretsion said.
On Friday, 20 November, the government announced it had captured Aksum town, but the TPLF had damaged infrastructure in the area.
And on Sunday, 22 November, state media published a video and images of bricks and rubble on the runway, as well as what appeared to be trenches dug into the surface, saying the TPLF had attacked ""ploughed and destroyed the airport, which has contributed a lot to the economy and the people of Aksum"".
To determine whether these images are genuine, we've looked at satellite imagery, provided by Planet Labs, from before and after the attack.
On Thursday, 19 November, the runway appeared to be free from rubble or damage.
But the image captured on Monday, 23 November, shows lines across the airport, which corroborate the previous day's state media reports that trenches had been dug across the runway to prevent planes landing.
Other investigations have led to similar findings.
The Tigray government is yet to comment on what happened at the airport.
Mr Debretsion has denied the TPLF destroyed the airport, but confirmed that obstacles had been put in place to stop the Ethiopian army from advancing.
With the internet and most mobile communications down in the Tigray region, getting an accurate picture of events is challenging.
Ethiopia's state-controlled media has near-monopoly access to the territory and social media has been littered with misleading images.
After it was reported the Ethiopian army had gained control of the airport, pro-government accounts shared images from old stories unrelated to the conflict, purporting to show Ethiopian military personnel at the airport.
Similarly, after Ethiopian media reported the TPLF had damaged the airport, social-media users began sharing images of the near-total destruction of a terminal building.
But the image being shared was in fact from an attack at a Libyan airport in 2014.
Human Rights Watch has called for the Ethiopian government to restore communications in the region.
Ethiopia is a vast country and keeping airports operating for supplies and personnel is important for the national military.
The Aksum region is also important for historical reasons.
Balsillie School of International Affairs director Prof Ann Fitz-Gerald said: ""It's hugely important because other northern airports at Bahir Dar and Gondar have also been damaged and airport security is crucial for mobilising troops and keeping physical lines of communication open.""
""If regional security forces were not going to have the airport itself, its tactic would be to disrupt the access to the airport.
""It would've been a last ditch tactic and possibly as they became threatened.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterNDR German public television recently broadcast a critical report on the health effects of wind turbines.

According to state physician Thomas Carl Stiller, infrasound from wind turbines causes an array of ailments among a segment of the population, such as dizziness, tinnitus, headaches, fatigue, sleeplessness and difficulty concentrating.
Nationally, protest groups are banding together in numbers never seen before to fight off wind projects, demanding that issues surrounding infrasound and environmental impact be addressed and clarified more thoroughly before wind parks are permitted.
According to the video report, German Constitutional lawyer Rudolf Wendt says the norms for permitting wind parks need to be updated as “they originate from the 1990s, the last century!”
As wind turbines have grown to huge dimensions, wind park protest group spokeswoman Jutta Reinhardt says that human health “is now in conflict with Germany’s Energiewende” and so there should be nothing to negotiate.

German doctors like Stiller say turbines less than 3 kilometers away from occupied buildings should be turned off.
Wind parks destroying biodiversity
Meanwhile the German Wildlife Foundation issued a press release earlier this month warning that wind turbines have killed and currently endanger cranes in the German state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. According to Foundation sole chairman Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt:
The rapid species die-off and disappearance of biodiversity is being played down, ignored due to a questionable climate policy, and against the will of the citizens.”
Vahrenholt also blasts the plans for further wind parks in the region, claiming that the power grid infrastructure to transport the power to markets on windy days does not even exist, and so the parks are routinely idled. Yet, the wind park operators are still paid (by the power consumer) for the power that would have otherwise been produced.
Vahrenholt adds that it’s only the wind park project developers and the wind park operators who benefit. “The bill gets picked up by the private household consumers while nature gets thrown overboard.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to scientists de Freitas, Dedekind, and Brill (2015), removing “contaminated data” from New Zealand’s  nation-wide temperature record — and using updated measurement techniques rather than error-ridden outdated ones — reduces the long-term (1909 to 2009) New Zealand warming trend from today’s +0.91°C to +0.28°C, a 325% change.
de Freitas et al., 2015
New Zealand’s national record for the period 1909 to 2009 is analysed and the data homogenized. Current New Zealand century-long climatology based on 1981 methods produces a trend of 0.91 °C per century. Our analysis, which uses updated measurement techniques and corrects for shelter-contaminated data, produces a trend of 0.28 °C per century.
Here is what 0.28°C of warming over the course of 100 years looks like:

 
From the internals of the paper, however, we find that the national average temperature for New Zealand was 13.1 °C in the late 1860s (10-year average), but by 2010, New Zealand’s average temperature had declined to 12.74 °C (30-year average).  The overall temperature average for the 1860s to present (150 years) remained stable at 12.6°C.  In other words, there has effectively been no change in New Zealand average surface temperatures in the last 150 years.
de Freitas et al., 2015
New Zealand was one of the first countries in the Southern Hemisphere to establish an official nationwide system of weather records. These records provide a rare long time series for temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, informing the data sparse interpolations required for early temperature series. Extant 1868 archives record the national normal mean surface temperature at 13.1 °C (when converted from degrees Fahrenheit) being the average of 10+ years read at six representative weather stations. Another major compilation, covering 35 years and based on nine stations, was published by the Dominion Meteorologist in 1920, which showed that the country’s average temperature has remained remarkably stable since records began. In 2010, the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) assessed the current national normal at 12.74 °C being the average of 30 years read at seven stations.
On the face of it, New Zealand’s long-term mean temperature has remained relatively stable at 12.6 °C over the past 150 years.
Here’s what the 1860s mean temperatures look like compared to the 1909-2009 period, with the latter trend line removed:

Getting back to the contamination that has artificially amplified temperatures by 325%, the authors continue their analysis by pointing out that the non-climatic +0.91°C per century trend in use today (and obviously preferred by those who wish to portray modern warming as dangerous and unprecedented) was obtained by using temperature-measuring techniques from a 1980 paper (Salinger, 1980, herein dubbed “S81”) that conducted no checks for sheltering (which has been found to artificially warm daily maximum temperatures by 1°C over a 6-year period) or the Urban Heat Island effect (which demonstrably and artificially warms up temperatures in cities and on airport sites relative to rural stations).  The authors replace S81 with a superior statistical method for more accurate climatic temperature measurement gleaned from a 1993 paper authored by Rhoades and Salinger (hereafter, “RS93”).  RS93 was concerned with “the detection and elimination of temperature data movements that are of non-meteorological origin,” advising that “for studies of climate change, it is best to choose stations that are unlikely to be affected by gradual changes in shading or urbanisation.”   By utilizing these checks on artificial or non-climatic warming, de Freitas et al. (2015) conclude that “no ‘important’ change in mean temperature occurred over the period 1909–2009 once the known contamination is corrected.”
de Freitas et al., 2014, continued:
(a) We will hereafter use the term “S81” to refer to the published 1980 paper [Salinas, 1980] in conjunction with the unpublished thesis elaborations.  Notably, S81 had conducted no tests for “creeping” inhomogeneities such as sheltering or UHI and consequently made no attempt to correct the 7SS [New Zealand temperature record “Seven Station Series”] for site effects* 
(b) McAneney et al. [1990] found that sheltering by nearby trees can increase daily maximum temperatures by 1 °C per 10 m of shelter growth over a 6-year period. After examining a range of New Zealand stations, [Hessell, 1980] determined that two of the stations used in the 7SS were climatically unrepresentative and assessed them “to increased sheltering from trees … and/or significant urbanisation and/or screen changes”. The sites are Albert Park in Auckland and Kelburn in Wellington. These sites, within the central business districts of two of New Zealand’s largest form the major portion of the Auckland and Wellington temperature series.   
(c) Hessell [1980] also finds a strong temperature trend bias in the data “unlikely to be due to a broad scale climatic effect”.   A 12-year comparison suggested that Albert Park had warmed 0.6 °C more than a rural counterpart 10 km distant.
(d) The two rural stations (Hokitika and Lincoln) show average warming of 0.2 °C/century in contrast to the 0.32 °C/century of the five city stations. A concern … is that all seven datasets have not yet been thoroughly screened for possible UHI effects or other undocumented changes.
(e) From 1976, Auckland data are drawn from the Mangere treatment plant, sited amongst newly commissioned settling ponds (Fig. 2). In 1998, the site moved a short distance to Auckland Aero, the country’s principal international/domestic airport. Apparent warming trends in the dataset for Auckland Aero (southwest of Auckland) were de-trended by reference to two other less urban airports on the metropolitan fringes, namely, Whenuapai (27 km to the northwest) and Ardmore (17 km to the southeast). The station histories for these two stations reveal no significant site changes during1976–2009, and screening disclosed no abrupt shifts. For the period 1962–1993, Auckland Aero [urban, airport] warmed 0.96 °C/century faster than Whenuapai [rural], and over 1969–2011 it warmed 0.97 °C/century faster than [rural] Ardmore (Table 2). The Mangere station was compared with the same two airports and showed a similar relative warming, implying that the overall Mangere region was greatly affected by UHI, as the population grew by 1,200 % from 15,700 in 1957 to 190,000 in 1981.
(f) In 1993, in collaboration with a statistician D. A. Rhoades, Salinger published “Adjustment of Temperature and Rainfall Records for Site Changes”  or RS93.  This paper was accepted locally as a seminal authority for the statistical techniques to be used in measuring differences between the temperatures of compared stations. … [I]n every case the S81 station adjustments greatly increased the individual trends, while the RS93 method resulted in equal numbers of increases and decreases.  As noted previously, S81 did not account for gradual effects such as sheltering or UHI.
(g) By making adjustments which are not statistically significant, S81 may have allowed too many “false positives” to occur. In addition, using long comparison time periods may have allowed creeping inhomogeneities and undocumented shifts at reference sites to skew the individual adjustments.
(h) Hessell [1980] examined apparent continuous warming over New Zealand since 1930 but concluded: “… no important change in annual mean temperature since 1930 has been found in stations where these factors [changes in shelter, screenage, and/or urbanization] are negligible.”  
(i) Our study similarly concludes that no “important” change in mean temperature occurred over the period 1909–2009 once the known contamination is corrected.
A few days ago, a compilation of over 50 temperature graphs from peer-reviewed scientific papers  revealed that large regions of the Earth have not been warming in recent decades, and that modern temperatures are still some of the coldest of the last 10,000 years.  Apparently the nation of New Zealand can now be added to this list as a region where no significant changes in temperature have taken place within the last 150 years.

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Serena Williams was utterly unaware that a victory on Saturday night would put her back at No. 1. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, did all he could to keep her in the dark. But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and   in place, to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final. The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not. So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the   record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head. Now, after her     victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it. “I’ve been chasing it for a really long time,” Williams said. “When it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I’m here. It’s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne. ” She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them. Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters’ power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow. Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister’s seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches. Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2. 0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion. But Williams 1. 0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final. “It was palpable how much Venus wanted it,” said Isha Price, the Williamses’ half sister. An   final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments. “That’s my little sister, guys,” Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the   ceremony. She then spoke to her sister directly. It was quite a riff. “Congratulations, Serena, on No. 23,” Williams said. “I have been there right with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. I guess that’s weird, but it’s been an awesome thing. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that. And all the time I couldn’t be there, wouldn’t be there, didn’t get there, you were there. I’m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me. ” Serena Williams is now within one victory of Margaret Court’s career record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. “Good on her if she’s good enough to do it,” Court said during the week in Melbourne. Williams has closed in on Court with an unprecedented run of success at an age when most great women’s tennis players of the past had already retired. Graf, for example, was done by 30. But Williams has now won 10 major singles title since turning 30. On Saturday, she became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era, breaking her own record set at Wimbledon last year. Venus, 36, was the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. “There’s no way I would be at 23 without her there’s no way I would be at 1 without her,” Serena Williams said of her sister in the   ceremony. “There’s no way I would have anything without her. She’s my inspiration. She’s the only reason I’m standing here today, and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me to be the best player I could be and inspiring me to work hard. Every time you won this week, I felt like I’ve got to win, too. ” This final was edgy from the start, beginning with four straight breaks of serve and with Serena Williams angrily breaking a racket in just the third game after she lost her footing trying to change direction when one of her sister’s shots struck the net cord. The quality of play fluctuated considerably, but the match ultimately was determined by Serena Williams’s returns. Venus Williams had won over 50 percent of the points on her second serve in her surprise run to the final. She won just 29 percent Saturday. “Serena always expects a tough match against her sister, but I don’t think she expected it to be quite that tough from the start,” Mouratoglou said. At 35, Williams is back on top after playing little in 2016 except for the Grand Slam events and losing the No. 1 ranking to Angelique Kerber, who defeated her in last year’s Australian Open final. Williams looked shocked when it was announced after her victory that she would return to No. 1. Mouratoglou later explained, a tad sheepishly, that he had not answered truthfully when Serena had inquired about it. He said he wanted to avoid putting extra pressure on her at an already fraught moment. “Actually, I think she’s happy I did it now,” he said. The Open could easily have gone awry for Serena Williams. In her return to the circuit earlier this month at a tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, she was upset in her second match by Madison Brengle, making 88 unforced errors on a blustery day. But Williams has often proved that she can click into a higher gear without much match play, and she did not drop a set in seven matches as she won her seventh Australian Open singles title. Venus Williams, seeded 13th here, remains one of the great players of this era, but she has not won a major singles title since she beat Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008. In the intervening years, she received a diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, that limited her training and contributed to her falling from the top 100 in 2011. But she has learned to manage her health problems and is having a   renaissance that might be a much bigger talking point if it were not for her younger sister’s   surge. Venus Williams will be at No. 11 in Monday’s WTA rankings. The sisters have become, through experience, adept at compartmentalizing, even if facing each other across the net is still not entirely natural. Their family members struggle with it, too. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, did not make the long journey to Melbourne this year, but Isha Price did. And she decided that she preferred to watch the match at her hotel until it was nearly over instead of putting herself through the crucible of watching in person. “Long story short, I don’t think people actually understand the significance of what they see, these two players, who literally for generations have been able to transcend what they do,” Price said. “And it’s very difficult to watch, listen, hear commentary, all of that. We watch tennis on mute. It’s hard. To keep your body in optimal shape to be able to perform at this level consistently over 20 years is an incredible feat. But you still have the conversation where it’s not enough. ” It is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with the record books, however. Serena keeps moving the bar higher, but the poignant part on Saturday night, was that despite all of Venus’s talent and staying power and eloquence, only one Williams sister has managed to win the singles championship at Melbourne Park."

The moral compass of the Pacific Island nations appears to be in a spin. It is apparent that bearing children out of wedlock is fine if you are the Prime Minister of New Zealand but if it was one of their own, it would attract immediate condemnation and be labelled an act of immorality. 



Pacific nations are predominently **Christian** , yet it appears that Ardern’s immersion in the Muslim culture is not a problem either, even if she ignores the plight of thousands of Christians being slaughtered by Islamic terrorists around the world. 



The sanctuary of an unborn baby’s life is treasured in the Islands with the only exception being Samoa where a mother may be considered a candidate for an **abortion** , but only if her life is at risk. Ardern’s government is hell-bent on [freeing up abortion laws](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-abortion-legislation-bills-symbolic-war/) resulting in the extermination of thousands of unborn babies without question, so it is rather odd and completely inconceivable that Ardern should take out the accolade as **“[Pacific Person of the Year”.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/pacific-person-of-the-year/)** How low does one set the bar?



It is not my intention to debate the issues raised and I certainly understand that the lure of the limitless supply of NZ taxpayer money has to be lubricated in kind. My beef is where the hell is the media scrutiny on this issue? There is absolutely no evidence that Ardern has contributed anything. How is it possible that we are expected to bask in the glory of this “lovely young woman’s” achievements when they amount to zilch. 



Another sin within the Pacifica communities is to idolize false Gods.



It is becoming a farce that Ardern is held up as some luminary Goddess when in reality she is a socialist shyster, hell-bent on the exploitation of the vulnerable and naïve. I know the award was presented by some insignificant publication “Island Business” and that, in itself, is a perfectly good reason for it to be ignored. Our media though are either deliberately or ignorantly blinded by their own prejudice. It’s all about Ardern’s rhetoric about climate change and it’s all about money. Ardern gives our money to fight climate change meanwhile **China** , the biggest polluter on Earth is pouring billions of dollars into the Pacific. It doesn’t matter where the money comes from or the morality of its contributors as long as it keeps coming. I’m afraid Ardern and New Zealand have been conned again.

New Survey: Nearly Half Of Young Americans Are Climate Skeptics
The Younger They Are, The More Skeptical
 

In fact, the age group that least agreed with the statement that global warming is a fact and caused by CO2 emissions was that of 18 to 20-year-olds. The assumption that younger US adults are more liberal when it comes to global warming does not hold up; if anything, they are even more skeptical. –Emma Kromm, Harvard Political Review, 29 April 2015

New Survey: Nearly Half Of Young Americans Are Climate Sceptics
From the Harvard Political Review, 29 April 2015 by Emma Kromm (h/t to The GWPF)
At the White House Correspondents Association Dinner last Saturday night, President Obama got angry. With the help of his anger translator, Luther (played by comedian Keegan-Michael Key), the president abandoned his usual reasonable tone to condemn those who deny climate change. “The science is clear,” he began. “Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it’s a national security risk.” As the president continued, it became clear that he no longer needed Luther to reveal his inner anger, and he drew laughs from the crowd after letting loose. “It is crazy! What about our kids? What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible… ”
While the president’s skit might have been the highlight of the night, do Americans really need this kind of angry reminder that climate change is a problem? Some seem to think we are living in a world where climate change is widely acknowledged as an irrefutable fact. Mary Robinson, the seventh president of Ireland and founder of the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice, has argued that the generation in power now is the first to fully know about climate change, and the last with the ability to prevent its projected effects. She and others are of the opinion that, at this point, all but a few outliers understand global warming, its causes, and its dire consequences.
New data from the Harvard Public Opinion Project tell a very different story. Only 55 percent of survey participants agreed with the statement,
“Global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities such as power plants.” Twenty percent held the belief that “Global warming is a proven fact, and is mostly caused by natural changes that have nothing to do with emissions from cars,” and the remaining 23 percent who answered the question believe that “Global warming is a theory that has not been proven yet.”
Even more surprising, these numbers are the same across the board for participants between 18 and 29 years old, with 51-56 percent agreeing that global warming is a fact and is caused by fuel emissions across age groups. In fact, the age group that least agreed with the first statement was that of 18 to 20-year-olds. The assumption that younger adults are more liberal when it comes to global warming does not hold up; if anything, they are even more skeptical.
Consequently, young Americans are often unsupportive of government measures to prevent climate change that might harm the economy. Less than a third of those surveyed agreed with the statement, “Government should do more to curb climate change, even at the expense of economic growth,” and only 12 percent strongly agreed with it. Again, the youngest survey respondents were more conservative than any other age group, with only 28 percent of 18 to 20-year-olds in agreement and eight percent in strong agreement with that statement. In contrast, other age groups varied between 30 percent and 34 percent in agreement and 11 percent to 14 percent in strong agreement. Not only are the newest voters less convinced of climate change as a reality; they are also less likely to support government funding of climate change solutions.

"Don Ciccone may never have achieved the fame of Frankie Valli, but he was a vital member of the Four Seasons, and sang on some of their biggest hits. That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of “Who Loves You” and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),” both revived in the smash Broadway musical “Jersey Boys. ” Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like “Younger Girl” and “Mr. Dieingly Sad,” and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the ’90s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a   who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone’s vocals shone. “Don had that    kind voice and we always liked the tapes,” said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old    demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a “Ciccone Sings Gari” album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. “The week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos,” Mr. Gari recalled. “He said, ‘My next project is ‘Ciccone sings Gari. ’” Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone’s “last wish,” and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone’s remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, “I Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye” had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari’s stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone’s phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper. Some original elements would not be preserved, like the simulated rainstorm augmenting a lover’s farewell in “She Left on Good Terms. ” The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari’s apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone’s youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. “It had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died,” said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling,   apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for “Late Nite Comic,” which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari’s maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the    Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as “the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. ” Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on “ ” an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as “The Cool Ghoul. ” Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the “sunshine pop” vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including “Bicycle Ride,” and “Silent Celebration,” which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit “Escape (The Piña Colada Song). ” Mr. Gari said he would be happy if the “Ciccone Sings Gari” CD sold just enough copies to cover his recording costs. “I’m doing it because it’s the right thing to do. I’m doing this in his honor,” he said. “It fulfills my dream and his last wishes. I’m taking his death and making something positive out of it. ”"

Hillary Clinton’s suspected major health issues refuse to go away as a political issue in this year’s election. The latest here, here and here.
Though claims that she may be “at death’s door” are certainly a stretch, her low frequency of appearances resembles a light workload one sees for a person in poor health.
A no-show in Louisiana
Yet another sign of poor health likely is Clinton’s absence from flood-stricken Louisiana. Heavy criticism has been launched at President Obama, who opted to play golf instead, but also at Clinton, who has mysteriously never shown up to lend support and let the victims know they are not alone. Moral support in times of crisis is crucial to the victims as they struggle to get back on their own feet.
How could Hillary not have shown up?
Trump is the only one who stepped up.
Not a picture of health
So why wouldn’t Clinton show up? Face it, the summertime climate in the Deep South region is hardly a favorable one for persons in poor health having to spend more than just a few minutes time outdoors fully exposed to the scorching heat and high humidity – away from their air-conditioned comfort zone. Hillary is probably unable to cope with it, and so was instructed by her doctor to just stay away. Especially the elderly and sick are advised to stay indoors and to drink plenty of fluids in times of heat.
And from appearance Clinton hardly projects a picture of health. She is pale, moves about cautiously, and often looks unsteady. She is also clearly overweight, and not just at the legs and hips, but at places where health experts agree are not where fat ought to be stored (visceral fat) – another sign of poor health.

Tucked away in air-conditioned comfort zone
A visit to flood victims would require Clinton to actually be out in the harsh elements, in full heat and high humidity for at least half an hour, something for which she likely is too frail to do. Trump, in contrast, was shown unloading supplies from a truck out in the burning sun and humidity. Clinton doing the same would be something her doctor would advise anyone in poor health not to do. Clinton sweating profusely and struggling to endure the heat would hardly make a good photo-op, and certainly not a heat stroke with cameras rolling.
To sick for a boat ride?
Clinton, who also claims to be a tireless warrior against man-made climate change and a champion of environmental protection, is also reported to have recently used her private jet and gas-guzzling SUV to travel a mere 20 or so miles. Ironically her protective, constantly air-conditioned comfort zones are powered in large part by fossil fuels, something she insists the rest of us should start learning to forego.

So why would she take a private jet to Nantucket instead of a boat?
Sure some people get queasy flying in an airplane, yet it is still in most cases far less turbulent than racing across the waves of the Atlantic in boat. The risk of sea sickness is much higher – especially when one’s health isn’t what it ought to be.
If Hillary Clinton is not up to visiting Louisiana, then she should issue a statement saying so. We could all understand and respect this. But instead, in typical Clinton style, she seems to cover it all up and insist she’s healthy. No one is buying it.

"PHILADELPHIA  —   From the time Donald J. Trump became their candidate until he took the oath of office, congressional Republicans treated his policy pronouncements  —   largely out of step with Republican dogma  —   as essentially a distraction. He would talk. They would drive the policies. But now, the question of whether congressional Republicans would change President Trump or Mr. Trump would change them has an early answer. Mr. Trump cheerfully addressed the group here at their policy retreat on Thursday, and they responded with applause to many proposals they have long opposed. Republican lawmakers appear more than ready to open up the coffers for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, perhaps without the commensurate spending cuts that they demanded when it came to disaster aid, money to fight the Zika virus or funds for the tainted water system in Flint, Mich. They also seem to back a swelling of the federal payroll that Mr. Trump has called for in the form of a larger military and 5, 000 more border patrol agents. They have stayed oddly silent as Mr. Trump and Senate Democrats push a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, larger than one they rejected from President Barack Obama. Once fierce promoters of the separation of powers, Republicans are now embracing Mr. Trump’s early governing by executive order, something they loudly decried during Mr. Obama’s second term. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, whose own website this week still praised the   Partnership trade deal, now applauds Mr. Trump for putting the final shovel of dirt over the accord, with the president saying he is interested in bilateral agreements instead. Many Republicans, who have been longstanding opponents of Russia and written laws that prohibit torture, have chosen to overlook, or even concur with, Mr. Trump’s embrace of both. Even on the subject of Mr. Trump’s call for an investigation into voter fraud, a widely debunked claim, Republicans have often demurred. “The notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Mr. Trump said he could not wait for lawmakers to get to work on their newfound common ground. “This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades, maybe ever,” Mr. Trump said. In an apparent reference to forthcoming bills, he added, “We’re actually going to sign the stuff that you’re writing. You’re not wasting your time. ” Many Republicans in Congress say his presidency is off to a substantive start, delivering on campaign promises to quell illegal immigration, reduce regulations, start the rollback of the health care law and reverse the Obama administration’s decisions to halt the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline projects. “I think he’s completely winning the expectation game,” said Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois. “I think he’s a genius at lowering expectations and overperforming,” he said, adding, “It’s really remarkable. ” In one significant way, congressional Republicans potentially seemed to pull Mr. Trump to their end of the policy pool. On Thursday, the administration initially  appeared to endorse  taxing imports as a way to pay for the Mexican border wall, reversing its earlier preference for imposing a heavy tax on companies that move jobs overseas. But the White House later said it was just one option under consideration. “We are in a very good place on tax reform,” Mr. Ryan said. “It can get complicated when you get into the details of tax reform, but once we go through how tax reform works and what it’s going to take to get the kind of competitive tax system, the kind of competitive tax rates, I think most people agree that this is the right approach. ” Congressional Republicans are also struggling to keep up with Mr. Trump’s   announcements, let alone push their agenda. “It’s   stuff,” said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. Investigating voter fraud, for instance, is not something he would like to see Congress take on. “Our priorities are the ones we laid out,” he said. They are also eager to get on with the rest of that agenda  —   specifically a repeal and, ostensibly, a replacement of the Affordable Care Act. “We are on the same page with the White House,” Mr. Ryan insisted Thursday. “The president agrees with this agenda. ” But it is the sudden embrace of federal spending that represents perhaps the most striking departure, with Republicans backing the concept of starting the financing for the border wall with a new appropriation. And the list is much longer. By contrast, last year, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, called Democrats’ request for $600 million in aid to Flint added to an energy bill “a huge earmark,” adding, “I think it’s not something I could support,” in keeping with most of his colleagues. Republicans also pushed for and partly succeeded in offsetting a bill to fight Zika last year. The talk of a spending surge has left some Republicans worried about an exploding deficit. “There are going to have to be some cuts,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah. “I am not interested in raising our spending levels. ” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, seemed tense when asked about the open checkbook. “We’re a fiscally conservative group,” he said of the committee. “We’re going to want to see things paid for. ” Republicans are also at times confused about what Mr. Trump is actually seeking when he makes policy declarations on Twitter. “‘Appears’ I think is the big word,” said Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania. “I don’t think anyone in the House of Representatives on the Republican side of the aisle wants to go through the legislative process,” only to have the Trump administration send a bill back, he said. Republicans had expected to reveal great progress on their plans to replace the health care act here, but instead seemed stuck in a perpetual debate over the timeline of coming up with a replacement. Senators in large part made a strong argument for making sure that a replacement plan had been fashioned before repealing the law, while many in the House continue to push for a repeal with replacement coming much later. Also notable is the Republicans’ acceptance of something they have despised: the use of the executive pen to make policy. Several House Republicans dismissed the notion that Mr. Trump would abuse his power to issue executive orders in the way they complained that Mr. Obama did during his second term. “What you do by the pen can be dismantled by the pen,” said Representative Tom Reed of New York. Mr. Trump is also trying to work his will on how the Senate operates. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, Mr. Trump said he thought Mr. McConnell should get rid of the Senate filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees, calling those who would oppose his coming pick “obstructionists. ” About three blocks from where Mr. Trump spoke, hundreds of protesters packed a plaza just across from City Hall to rally against the president. While the demonstration was organized around preserving the health care law, protesters showed up for a variety of causes. “I don’t trust anything he says,” said Ken Snyder, 62."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to scientists, ocean temperatures have fluctuated up and down within a range of around 1 to 2°C for the last 1,000 years.
During the Medieval Warm Period (~800 to 1,000 years ago) ocean temperatures were as warm or warmer than they are now.  This centennial-scale warming occurred during a period of high solar activity, or during the Medieval Maximum.
During the Little Ice Age (1400 to 1900 AD), ocean temperatures plummeted relative to the Medieval Warm Period.  This dramatic ocean cooling occurred during several long periods of low solar activity – the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums.
During the Modern Warming Period (1900-present), ocean temperatures have risen again.  This warming has coincided with a period of very high solar activity, the Modern Grand Maximum.
Below are several papers indicating that ocean temperatures have risen and fallen for the last 1,000 years in concert with solar activity, including the 20th Century Modern Grand Maximum.  As Sejrup et al. (2010) cogently write in the conclusion of their paper:
“The associated decade- to century-scale variation of estimated nSST [near sea surface temperature] ranges from 1 to 2°C, significantly larger than expected based on thermodynamic considerations alone. We suggest that this is due to a solar influence on the regional modes of atmospheric variability which, in turn, control the poleward transport and temperature of warm Atlantic surface waters. Our findings beg the question of why such a clear connection has not been detected previously.”

The Medieval Maximum, Little Ice Age Minimums, and Modern Grand Maximum
Rigozo et al., 2001
“[I]n the last 1000 years solar activity displayed a Great Medieval Maximum, 1100 – 1250 AD, followed by a period of lower solar activity until the start of the 20th century. … The Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton Minimums have been identified, as have the Medieval Maximum and the so-called Modern Maximum, starting near 1900.”
—
Zharkova et al., 2015
“The longest direct observation of solar activity is the 400-year sunspot-number series, which depicts a dramatic contrast between the almost spotless Maunder and Dalton minima, andthe period of very high activity in the most recent 5 cycles [1950s – 2000s], prior to cycle 24. … The records show that solar activity in the current cycle 24 is much lower than in the previous three cycles 21–23 revealing more than a two-year minimum period between cycles 23 and 24. This reduced activity in cycle 24 was very surprising because the previous five cycles were extremely active and sunspot productive forming the Modern Maximum.  … We predict correctly many features from the past, such as: 1) an increase in solar activity during the Medieval Warm period; 2) a clear decrease in the activity during the Little Ice Age, the Maunder Minimum and the Dalton Minimum; 3) an increase in solar activity during a modern maximum in 20th century.”
—
Lockwood et al., 2009
“[T]he Sun has been unusually active over recent decades (Solanki et al. 2004; Vonmoos et al. 2006; Muscheler et al. 2007; Steinhilber et al. 2008). Solanki et al. (2004) used the 14C isotope abundance found in tree trunks and concluded that the Sun has been more active recently than at any time in the previous 8000 years and that it was as active as in recent decades for only 10% of the past 11000 years.”
—
Usoskin et al., 2014
“[T]he modern Grand maximum (which occurred during solar cycles 19–23, i.e., 1950–2009) was a rare or even unique event, in both magnitude and duration, in the past three millennia. Except for these extreme cases, our reconstruction otherwise reveals that solar activity is well confined within a relatively narrow range.”
—
Wang et al., 2010
“It is seen that a very active period that began in 1920, the so-called ‘current grand solar maximum’, will probably end during 2011-2027 … The current grand solar maximum started in 1920 and lasted for eight 11-year solar cycles.”

Robust Correlation: Ocean Temperatures and Solar Activity
Sejrup et al., 2010   (Norwegian Sea)
Response of Norwegian Sea temperature to solar forcing since 1000 A.D.
“Here we present an exceptionally well-dated marine sediment sequence in the eastern Norwegian Sea which records 1–2°C variations of temperature in northward flowing Atlantic waters that are robustly correlated with various estimates of solar activity spanning the last 1000 years. The temperature and solar proxy variations appear to be synchronous within dating errors, which, together with the large amplitude of the temperature signal and its correlation into central Europe, suggests strong coupling of the regional atmospheric and oceanic responses to the Sun. … Lowest isotope values (highest temperatures) of the last millennium are seen ∼1100–1300 A.D., during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, and again after ∼1950 A.D. The largest and most sustained isotopic increases (coolings) are centered at ∼1500 A.D. and ∼1700 A.D., corresponding to the regional Little Ice Age. … The presence of medieval and 20th century warmth and Little Ice Age cooling in our records suggests a possible connection to known solar variations at these times (i.e., the Spører and Maunder minima and medieval and modern maxima, respectively). …  For the period after 1500 A.D., during which we have greatest confidence in the sediment age model, correlations with the various solar proxies range from ∣R∣ = 0.71 to 0.87 (all significant at >99%). … On balance, the observed relationship of nSST and solar proxies suggests a climate response to the Sun within the characteristic inertial timescale of the upper ocean, which is one to several decades. Recurrent, episodic volcanic forcing may also influence the ocean climate signal at this timescale, however, our results indicate that approximately 50–70% of the observed multidecadal to century-scale δ18O variation may be explained by solar forcing alone.”
Conclusion: “We have presented an oxygen isotopic proxy record of near-surface temperature of Atlantic waters from the area of their primary flow into the eastern Norwegian Sea and find that it is robustly and near-synchronously correlated with various proxies of solar variability spanning the last millennium. The associated decade- to century-scale variation of estimated nSST ranges from 1 to 2°C, significantly larger than expected based on thermodynamic considerations alone. We suggest that this is due to a solar influence on the regional modes of atmospheric variability which, in turn, control the poleward transport and temperature of warm Atlantic surface waters. Our findings beg the question of why such a clear connection has not been detected previously.”

Richey et al., 2007  (Gulf of Mexico)
“[C]entennial-scale sea surface temperature (SST) oscillations of 2–3 °C occurred during the past 1–2 [thousand years].  Two multidecadal intervals of sustained high Mg/Ca indicate that Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were as warm or warmer than near modern conditions between 1000 and 1400 yr B.P. [before present] Foraminiferal Mg/Ca during the coolest interval of the Little Ice Age (ca. 250 yr B.P.) indicate that SST was 2–2.5 °C below modern SST.“
“Four minima in the Mg/Ca record between 900 and 250 yr B.P. correspond with the Maunder, Spörer, Wolf, and Oort sunspot minima, suggesting a link between changes in solar insolation and SST variability in the Gulf of Mexico.”

Dramatic Variation in Ocean Temperature During MWP, LIA
Bertler et al., 2011  (Southern Ocean)
“Here we present new data from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, that indicates surface temperatures were ~ 2 °C colder during the LIA, with colder sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean and/or increased sea-ice extent, stronger katabatic winds, and decreased snow accumulation.   The McMurdo Dry Valleys [Antarctica] were 0.35°C warmer during the MWP than during ME [modern era], accompanied by warmer conditions in the Ross Sea.”
—
Keigwin, 1996   (North Atlantic)
“Results from a radiocarbonated box score [in the North Atlantic] show that SST was ~ 1°C cooler ~400 years ago (The Little Ice Age) and 1700 years ago, and ~ 1°C warmer than today in 1,000 years ago (The Medieval Warm Period).”
—
Rosenthal et al., 2013 (Pacific Ocean)
“We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters [0-700 m] were warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4°C and 1.5 ± 0.4°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades.”

—
Newton et al., 2006  (Indo-Pacific)
“[S]ea surface temperature and salinity records from the Makassar Strait, Indonesia, show a long-term cooling and freshening trend, as well as considerable centennial-scale variability during the last millennium. The warmest temperatures and highest salinities occurred during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while the coolest temperatures and lowest salinities occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA).“
—
Oppo et al., 2009 (Indo-Pacific)
“[T]he tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) represents a major heat reservoir that both influences global atmospheric circulation and responds to remote northern high-latitude forcings. Here we present a decadally resolved continuous sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction from the IPWP that spans the past two millennia and overlaps the instrumental record.  Reconstructed SST was, however, within error of modern values from about ad 1000 to ad 1250, towards the end of the Medieval Warm Period. SSTs during the Little Ice Age (approximately ad 1550–1850) were variable, and 0.5 to 1 °C colder than modern values during the coldest intervals.”
—
Sepulveda et al., 2009 (Tropical Pacific)
“We observed two different regimes of climate variability in our record [Patagoina, Chile]: a relatively dry/warm period before 900 cal yr BP (lower runoff and average SST 1°C warmer than present day [Medieval Warm Period]) and a wet/cold period after 750 cal yr BP (higher runoff and average SST 1°C colder than present day). Relatively colder SSTs were found during 750–600 and 450–250 cal yr BP, where the latter period roughly corresponds to the interval defined for the Little Ice Age (LIA).”
—
Ran et al., 2011 (Greenland Sea)
“Warm and stable conditions with relatively strong influence of the Irminger Current on the North Icelandic shelf are indicated during the interval AD 940–1300, corresponding in time to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). A considerable cooling at ∼ AD 1300 indicates the transition to the Little Ice Age (LIA) with increased influence of Polar and Arctic water masses deriving from the East Greenland and East Icelandic currents. An extended cooling period between AD 1300 and 1910 is characterized by approximately century-scale oscillations, with marked cold intervals at AD 1325–1375, AD 1460–1500, AD 1610–1670 and AD 1810–1910, separated by relatively mild spells. A two-step warming during the last 100 years is interrupted by three cool events around AD 1920, in the AD 1960s and in the late AD 1990s.”

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s a new study out, under the imprimatur of the Energy Institute of the Haas School of Business in Berkeley, California, entitled The Distributional Effects of U.S. Clean Energy Tax Credits.  As the title implies, it looks at who actually profited from the various “green energy” tax credits across the United States. SPOILER ALERT! It wasn’t the poor folks.
How much money are we talking about? Well, the paper says that from 2006 to 2012, the taxpayers have been on the hook for $18 BILLION DOLLARS to fund these subsidies, money that would have otherwise gone into the General Fund.
And just how much money is eighteen billion dollars? Here’s one way to think about eighteen gigabucks, regarding safe, clean drinking water.
Water Wells for Africa reports from their ongoing projects that on average it has cost them about $3.50 per person ($7,000 per well serving 2,000 people) to provide people with clean safe well water. So eighteen billion dollars is enough money to drill drinking water wells for three-quarters of the world’s 7 billion inhabitants. (Yes, I know that’s a gross simplification, some folks don’t live over a subterranean water table, and so on, but it is still enough money to drill the two and a half million wells that would be needed.)
So what did we do with this huge amount of money, enough wealth to truly change the lives of the world’s poor?
Well, following the brilliant policies pushed by the Obama Administration and the climate alarmists, we took enough taxpayer money to truly change the lives of the world’s poor folks … and instead, we gave it to the American rich folks.
No kidding! This is not a joke. This is what passes for moral activism in the liberal American universe. Throwing money at the rich is seen as striking a noble blow for POSSIBLY saving the poor from a tenth of a degree of warming by 2100.
Sadly, it’s no joke at all—the whole war on carbon has been a tragedy for the poor. In this case, the result of these misguided tax subsidies, of the type which have been pushed by climate alarmists for years, has been to create a real climate “hockeystick”. Here is the data from their paper:
Figure 1. Distribution of benefits of the “Clean Energy Tax Credits” by the income class of the benefit recipient for the period 2006-2012. All values are percentages of the given benefit. “Residential” is subsidies for residential solar systems and weatherization. “Hybrid” are the subsidies paid to the owners of hybrids, as well as hydrogen, fuel cell and natural gas vehicles. “Electric Vehicle” is the subsidy paid to the pure electric vehicles like the Tesla, Leaf, and Volt.
Note that in all cases, the bottom half of the income scale got 4% or less of the benefits …
Look, if someone wants to fight the claimed evil menace of CO2, that’s their business.
And when they want to justify it on the basis that to them, it is a deed most noble and virtuous to be POSSIBLY helping the poor in 2050 by POSSIBLY reducing the future global average temperature by a few tenths of a degree … well, I gotta say that’s as dumb as a bag of ball bearings, but there’s no law against dumb.
But that’s just for starters. From there, it gets ugly fast. Tragically the preferred method of fighting evil carbon is to increase the cost of energy, which is an extremely regressive tax. Not only is it regressive, but unlike many taxes, there is no escape at the bottom of the income scale from increased energy costs. The poor pay no income tax, but they pay energy costs, and energy costs are a greater portion of their expenses than for the rich. So rather than going down with decreasing income, the effect of hikes in energy costs go UP with decreasing income. Like I said, it is among the most regressive,inescapable kinds of taxes you could design.
Raising energy costs sentence the global poor to further impoverishment, sickness, and even death. And hiking energy prices based on the pathetic justification of a POSSIBLE cooling by 2050 of a few tenths of a degree is a crime against the poor of unimaginable size and ubiquitous effect. The war on carbon literally hurts, sickens, and kills poor people all over the world. And I can assure you … the poor are not amused.
But I guess that merely shafting the poor by increasing energy costs doesn’t help the rich enough. So the other noble and virtuous method for POSSIBLY helping the future poor is to fling tax money at various pluted bloatocrats … yeah, that’s the ticket. We’ll help the poor in 2050 by making it easier for rich people to buy a new $100,000 Tesla, and meanwhile Elon Musk is laughing all the way to the bank … at this point, we have to wonder how much folks like Al Gore and Warren Buffet and the UN Climate Ambassador Leonardo Dicaprio had to do with the design of these tax subsidies for the rich.
And of course, these are just the income tax subsidies. They don’t include the massive subsidies handed out directly to the solar and wind industries. They don’t include the subsidies paid to the people wealthy enough to justify rooftop solar when the utilities have to buy their electric production at three times market value … or the cost that I and millions of others pay as electrical consumers to subsidize those over-the-top rooftop solar payments. They don’t include the cost of Solyndra and the other solar companies slurping at the public trough. They don’t include the millions of dollars that with one stroke of the pen Obama gave to his billionaire pal Warren Buffet by vetoing the Keystone pipeline. This is merely the Federal tax-related subsidies, nothing more … and this tiny part of the global waste in the war on carbon is eighteen billion freakin’ dollars.
But always remember … this is all being justified by the alarmists on the basis of “Think of the grandchildren”, and because they’re saving the planet from imminent doooom and destruction.
And if you are someone saving the planet from imminent doooom and destruction, well, you are the man. There is no action that you shouldn’t take if it is in the service of your noble cause. You know that you have right on your side, you’re preventing disaster. You know you are fighting the good fight to cool the fevered brows of those sweltering in the 2050 heat by at least a tenth of a degree, and that it is a fight that has to be fought if we are to save the very planet. Your strength is as the strength of ten because your heart is pure, and you have the moral high ground. As a result of all of that, there is no transgression you won’t commit in order to have other people pay to make your beautiful Elysian (and slightly-cooler) dream come to fruition … and meanwhile, let’s go for a spin in your new Tesla. After all, you only bought an electric car because it’s noble and virtuous and pollution-free … if you don’t count the coal-fired power plant providing your electricity.
I have a proposal for a new name for the Holocene, and it’s not the Anthropocene like some folks claim.
I think we should call it the Egoscene …

My Plea For Better Understanding: If you disagree with someone, please have the courtesy to quote the exact words you disagree with. This will allow all of us to understand precisely what you are objecting to.
About The Title: For those not up on their English history, Robin Hood was the name of a legendary English outlaw whose most notable characteristic was that he robbed from the rich and gave to the poor … hence my invention of the term“Hood Robin Syndrome” to describe the opposite action.
Fossil Fuel Subsidies: To me, the issue is never the existence of a subsidy. It is whether we get something for the subsidy. For example, one of the fossil-fuel subsidies in the US is the tax exemption for diesel used by farmers and fishermen … in exchange for which, it encourages production and so we get more food. To me, that’s a good deal. The problem with renewable subsidies is that we’ve been subsidizing solar and wind since Jimmy Carter was President, and they are still not economically competitive in the grid-scale marketplace.
We get large value in return for fossil fuel subsidies, whereas for solar and wind subsidies we get almost nothing. Per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy produced from solar and wind, there is a subsidy to the producers of about two cents/kWh. Since base electric price in the US is around 8-10 cents per kilowatt-hour, that’s about a 20% subsidy.
The subsidy for oil, on the other hand, is about a hundredth of one cent per kWh, coal is about two hundredths of a cent per kWh, and nuclear is about eight hundredths of a cent per kWh.
Why the huge disparity? It’s because solar and wind don’t produce economically, so they have to be artificially propped up. I wouldn’t mind the subsidy if they actually produced. It’s the lack of getting value in return that is the problem.

"Opponents of abortion watching the women’s march on their televisions last Saturday stewed as they saw the Planned Parenthood logo over the stage and the actress Scarlett Johansson praising the group for the gynecological care she received as a teenager. But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women’s march had drawn an estimated   people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation’s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You’d better turn out on Friday. This year’s   march in Washington  —   the 44th annual March for Life  —   was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of   measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year’s event, with   organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. “We’re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,” said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year’s event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is   energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650, 000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in “the tens of thousands. ” “I don’t think that these numbers are the most important,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. “The number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion. ” She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life’s offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage of the women’s march in Washington. “We are hearing from a lot of women who felt like their voices weren’t represented last weekend,” said Mrs. Mancini, who called in volunteers to handle the deluge. But it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the March for Life. Though many marchers come to the city by car or train, one gauge of expected attendance  —   bus parking permits  —   suggests the event will be smaller than last weekend’s women’s march. As of Wednesday only 92 permits had been issued for the March for Life, according to Events DC and the city’s Department of Transportation, which handle the permits. Some 1, 800 permits were issued for the women’s march, and 450 for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the transportation department said. The march has become an increasingly youthful event, attracting busloads of college, high school and middle school students from across the country, many from Catholic and evangelical Christian schools. This year, the University of Notre Dame, the famed Catholic college in Indiana, is sending 700 students on 13 charter buses, one of the largest campus contingents, said Emily Burns, vice president of communications with Notre Dame Right to Life. She said that she and many of her club members shared many of the feminist goals of the women’s march, such as preventing sexual assault and violence against women, and were uncomfortable being seen as in competition with the women’s march. “This definitely is not a competition for us,” Ms. Burns said. “But we are hoping that with the numbers we bring year after year, maybe we receive a bit more coverage this year. ” There is widespread resentment in the   movement that the media has not devoted much coverage to the March for Life in the past, perhaps because it happens every year. This year, a large coalition of   groups have banded together to pressure television and cable networks to devote the same kind of media coverage to the March for Life as they devoted to the women’s march. Still, compared with   supporters, organizers of Friday’s march may have a smaller base of people to draw from. A survey released by the Pew Research Center in October found that 59 percent of Americans said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Although there were wide gaps between Democrats and Republicans, overall support for legal abortion was at its highest level since 1995, the survey found. At Georgetown University, which is a Catholic and Jesuit college, Ms. Irvine is expecting only 30 to 40 students to attend the March for Life, despite her group’s efforts. Some students who would have wanted to attend could not, she said, because Friday is a class day and the university would not excuse absences from classes or labs to attend the march. The numbers appear far lower than Georgetown’s turnout for the women’s march, said Ms. Irvine: “Our entire school basically went. ” She said it would be unfair to compare the size of the two marches, however, because Washington is a liberal city in which a vast majority of residents voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. “I do think there will be comparison,” she said, “but I don’t think it will be an accurate representation of what the public actually thinks. ”"

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
We’ll jump right into this week by highlighting an appearance by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Mark Mills on The Federalist’s _Radio Hour_. During his time on the show, Mills explains how the foreseeable future is going to play out when it comes to global energy production and why he says that even if you were concerned about climate change, “there really isn’t anything you can do about it.”   
  
Mills is one of the leading thinkers and analysts on energy systems, energy markets, and energy policy, bringing often overlooked and deeply-buried information to the forefront.   
  
During his nearly hour-long radio segment, Mills discusses topics ranging from climate change, the world’s future energy mix, the role of technological advances, and energy policy as well as giving his opinions on both Bills Gates’ and Pope Francis’ take on all of the above. It is an entertaining and informative interview.   
  
As a taste, here’s a transcript of a small segment:   




In the life we live, and the world we live in, we have to do two things, one is deal with reality [current understanding of physics] and the moral consequences of that, and we can have aspirations. If the aspiration, which Bill Gates’ is, is to use fewer hydrocarbons, we need to support basic research.   
  
We don’t subsidize stuff. The reason we don't subsidize stuff and make energy more expensive, is because, for me, it is morally bankrupt to increase the cost of energy for most people in most of the world. _Energy should be cheaper, not more expensive_. We use energy to make our lives better. We use energy to make our lives safer. We use energy to make our lives more enjoyable. Everything that we care about in the world, safety, convenience, freedom, costs energy. [emphasis added]



Mark Mills’ sentiment closely matches that which Alex Epstein explained to Congress a few weeks back and that we highlighted in our last edition.   
  
If you can find any time to listen to a little or a lot of Mills’ full interview, you’ll probably find that what he says to make a lot of sense. Funny, though, how much of it seems to have escaped some folks.   
  
Next up is an article in the current issue of _First Things_ authored by Walter Wilson titled “Scientific Regress.” If you think the title is provocative, you ought to have a look at the rest of the piece beginning with the first line “The problem with ­science is that so much of it simply isn’t.” Instead, it reflects the results of a gamed system driven by pre-conceived ideas often emanating from the science/political establishment.



In describing the current sad state of science, Wilson reflects our concerns here at the Center for the Study of Science, that external factors (e.g., influence, power, money) act to negatively shape the course of science—a negative influence that is hard to shake.   
  
Wilson writes:   




[O]nce an entire field has been created—with careers, funding, appointments, and prestige all premised upon an experimental result which was utterly false due either to fraud or to plain bad luck—pointing this fact out is not likely to be very popular. Peer review switches from merely useless to actively harmful. It may be ineffective at keeping papers with analytic or methodological flaws from being published, but it can be deadly effective at suppressing criticism of a dominant research paradigm. Even if a critic is able to get his work published, pointing out that the house you’ve built together is situated over a chasm will not endear him to his colleagues or, more importantly, to his mentors and patrons.



Hear! Hear!   
  
Wilson leaves us with this warming:   




At its best, science is a human enterprise with a superhuman aim: the discovery of regularities in the order of nature, and the discerning of the consequences of those regularities. We’ve seen example after example of how the human element of this enterprise harms and damages its progress, through incompetence, fraud, selfishness, prejudice, or the simple combination of an honest oversight or slip with plain bad luck. These failings need not hobble the scientific enterprise broadly conceived, but only if scientists are hyper-aware of and endlessly vigilant about the errors of their colleagues…and of themselves. When cultural trends attempt to render science a sort of religion-less clericalism, scientists are apt to forget that they are made of the same crooked timber as the rest of humanity and will necessarily imperil the work that they do. The greatest friends of the Cult of Science are the worst enemies of science’s actual practice.



The whole piece, including the examples included therein, is an eye-opener. You ought to have a look!   
  
And finally, we’ll leave you with a Friday Funny coming from Cartoons by Josh (a frequent commenter on the often ridiculous goings-on surrounding global warming). In this strip, Josh neatly sums up the reaction when climate gloomsayers are confronted with good news—in this case, new results showing that carbon dioxide emissions from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy, are leading to a greener, more productive earth (a story that we covered in our piece “A Greening (in a Good Way) Earth”):

"A: No, we are opposed to pollution.
Pollution is the transfer of unusual or harmful matter or energy to another person’s property without their consent. Thus I should not allow smoke, ash particles, industrial effluent, noise, noxious gases, bad smells or light from my property to annoy anyone else unless we have negotiated an agreement.
Burning of carbon fuels has been part of the natural cycle of the earth since the first plant was set on fire by the first lightning strike. All the products of burning natural carbon fuels are easily and beneficially absorbed by the atmosphere, dissolved by rain and go to fertilise the soil.
However there are some emissions that are annoying or dangerous in concentrated amounts, for example nitrous oxide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide. And others such as soot and ash that are not so dangerous, but visible and annoying. Bush fires produce all of these, but usually not in troublesome amounts.
Burning coal or oil in power stations can produce continual pollution in a small area, so modern clean plants remove almost everything from the emissions except water vapour and carbon dioxide, which are disseminated into the atmosphere via a tall stack. These two are normal beneficial atmospheric gases not pollutants. Taking them out of the emissions would be a silly and very expensive exercise for no benefit.
"
"Dear Professor Garnaut,
I note that your review has been commissioned to “examine the impacts of climate change on the Australian economy, and recommend medium to long-term policies and policy frameworks to improve the prospects for sustainable prosperity”.
As written, this is a straightforward if challenging task. Unwritten, however, is that the term “climate change” today carries connotations of human causation, thanks mainly to lobby group pressure and media propaganda. This transforms a straightforward task into one of immense complexity, because of the existence of both many unresolved, controversial scientific issues and the fierce environmental politics that becomes involved.

There is wide variation in scientific opinion as to whether any human impact on global climate can be measured, or is likely to prove dangerous in the medium term future. It is, however, the case that the preparation of four comprehensive IPCC reports since 1998, accompanied by the estimated expenditure of more than US$50 billion on climate research worldwide, has as yet failed to document a human signal above the level of the noise in the natural climate system.
In view of this, it is alarming that previous Australian governments have signalled publically that they were basing their climate policy on advice from the IPCC, which is now widely accepted to be a flawed and partisan advocacy body for the existence of dangerous human-caused global warming.
The IPCC’s advice – together with that of now numerous climate lobby groups and interests – occupies the extreme, alarmist end of the range of possible views on climate change. At the other end of the spectrum are the handful of (mostly unqualified) persons who deny altogether any danger from human-caused climate change. Much more attention needs to be accorded in the public debate to the balanced, and balancing, views of the many thousands of independent qualified scientists, engineers and economists who, whilst acknowledging that natural climate change is an important issue, remain unconvinced that strong evidence exists for dangerous human-caused change and are not involved in the IPCC process.
I attach four documents that exemplify the views of some of these moderate centrist scientists, who are perhaps best described by the term “climate rationalists”, and urge that you heed their advice. The centrist view can be summarized by the following quotation from the third attachment:
————————————–
“Climate changes naturally all the time. Human activities have an effect on the local climate, for example in the vicinity of cities (warming) or near large areas of changed land usage (warming or cooling, depending upon the changed albedo). Logically, therefore, humans must have an effect on global climate also. This notwithstanding, a distinct human signal has not yet been identified within the variations of the natural climate system, to the degree that we cannot even be certain whether the global human signal is one of warming or cooling. Though it is true that many scientists anticipate that human warming is the more likely, no strong evidence exists that any such warming would be dangerous.”
“The gentle global warming that probably occurred in the late 20th century falls within previous natural rates and magnitudes of warming and cooling, and is prima facie quite unalarming, especially when consideration is given to the likelihood that the historic ground temperature records used to delineate the warming are warm-biased by the urban heat island and other effects. Once corrected for non-greenhouse climate agents such as El Niños and volcanic eruptions, the radiosonde (since 1958) and satellite (since 1979) records show little if any recent warming and certainly none of untoward magnitude.”
“Atmospheric carbon dioxide is indeed a greenhouse gas, but the empirical evidence shows that the warming effect of its increase at the rates of modern industrial emission and accumulation is minor, given an assumed pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm and noting the established logarithmic relationship between gas concentration increases and warming. As one such empirical test, it can be noted too that no global increase in temperature has now occurred since 1998 despite an increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the same 8 years of about 15 ppm (4%). Putative human influence aside, it is certain that natural climate change will continue, sometimes driven by unforced internal variations in the climate system and at other times forced by factors that we do not yet understand.”
“The appropriate public policy response is, first, to monitor climate accurately in an ongoing way; and, second, to respond and adapt to any changes—both warmings and the likely more damaging coolings—in the same way that we cope with other natural events such as droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Neither the Stern Review itself, nor the additional papers that our critique has stimulated, address the above cautious and widely held assessment of the situation. Instead, straw-man arguments are erected and attacked, detail is endlessly obfuscated and IPCC orthodoxy is relentlessly repeated.”
“In dealing with the certainties and uncertainties of climate change, the key issue is prudence. The main certainty is that natural climate change will continue, and that some of its likely manifestations—sea-level rise and coastal change in particular locations, for example—will be expensive to adapt to. But adapt we must and will. Moreover, reducing vulnerability to today’s climate-sensitive problems will also help the world cope with future challenges from climate change whether that is due to natural variability, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or other human causes. The most prudent way of ensuring that happens is to build wealth into the world economy and to be receptive to new technologies. This will not be achieved by irrational restructuring of the world’s energy economy in pursuit of the chimera of “stopping” an alleged dangerous human-caused climate change that, in reality, can neither be demonstrated nor measured at this time.”
Finally, and given the strong and polarized views that have come to exist on the topic of human-caused climate change (including amongst prestigious science organizations and academies), an objective assessment of the matter in Australia can now only be achieved by government through the mechanism of a Royal Commission, operating under appropriately neutral terms of reference. For, to ascertain the truth, it has become necessary that expert witnesses on all sides of the argument be heard under oath, under a neutral, scientifically competent chairperson and under stringent conditions of cross examination.
Yours sincerely,
Bob Carter

Political cartoonist Rick McKee of the Augusta Chronicle sees what you and I do – that any weather event can be pinned on climate change.
The warm weather on the eastern half of the USA this winter has prompted  many climate alarmists blame it on global warming/climate change/climate disruption even though in 1955, a similarly warm and record breaking warm winter occurred well before CO2 was out of the “safe” zone as some call it. This map illustrates:

h/t to Steve Goddard
McKee of course sees right through the hype of blaming any weather event on climate change with this cartoon…

What is funny is that there was some climate scientists who actually did a paper and a wheel of climate as a PR prop

Share this...FacebookTwitterA climate scientist brought my attention to a recent article reporting how one site has identified 13 beers that are climatically and environmentally correct to drink. I’m pretty sure his main objective was to show just how nutty the movement has become.
Photo: Public domain.
So I thought readers here might enjoy finding out how the climate trend has even swept over parts of the US beer industry: Drinking responsibly now also includes drinking to protect the environment!
Such rubbish.
Personally in Germany I really do admire the beer culture they have long developed here over the centuries. Many beers are still brewed according to the German Purity Law of 1516 (Happy Birthday, by the way!). What’s even better is that Central Europe qualifies as a true paradise for beer fans and connoisseurs, offering a great selection, premium quality and at prices which are in fact very low relative to other countries. For example a case of 24 glass bottles (0.33 l) of great quality beer can be easily picked up for about 10 euros (11 dollars) in Germany – and even less in the Czech Republic – and packaged in real, heavy dark glass bottles! Compare that to prices in Scandinavia or even the USA.
Now it appears that the the target of brewing beer has, for some breweries at least, strayed, going from producing a premium quality brew to making one that purports to protect the global climate, and so possibly sacrificing quality for the sake of an illusion. This is not serious business. It’s a marketing gimmick. I’d never drink such beer.
The brand of beer I drink depends solely on whether the taste suits me, and not if it’s organic, green, politically correct, or for saving some rainforest somewhere. To enjoy a beer, it has to be of good quality, on draught, put in a proper glass, be at the right temperature, with a have head of foam, fulfill the Purity Law, and especially be enjoyed in good company. See more here.
So have an uncompromised beer. Cheers!

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski held an interview with climate modeling scientist Edouard Zorita of the GKSS Research Center in Geestacht near Hamburg, Germany.

Eduardo Zorita, paleoclimatologist, GKSS Research Centre Germany tells Spiegel climate models have a long way to go, much remains poorly understood and that they are hardly trustworthy. Photo:  http://coast.gkss.de/staff/zorita/; CC BY-SA 3.0.
The interview focused on the reliability of climate models, particularly their ability to forecast precipitation trends in response to warming. Earlier models have suggested that arid regions would simply become drier, while wet regions would get wetter. Other models suggested some regions would see more of both. The result: lots of confusion and uncertainty.
“Hardly trustworthy”
The interview focusses on a new study authored by Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist of Stockholm University, which was recently published in Nature. The paper’s result now casts lots of doubt over the models and their ability to project the future. In the study the scientists examined the past 1200 years of precipitation across the northern hemisphere and they found that the models do very poorly, and that they are still at a very embryonic stage in their development – far from being mature enough to be of much use for future prognoses. Hence the title and photo caption of the Spiegel article:
Faults in the climate models: “Drought prognoses are hardly trustworthy”
A consequence of global warming is supposed to be drought. However an analysis shows: climate models can barely calculate precipitation.”
Obviously the climate system is far more complex than what some scientists, policymakers and media would like to have us to believe. The models are in fact more uncertain than ever.
Bojanowski writes:
In the case of precipitation the data contradict the model results, the scientists report.”
Mismatch between models and observations
When asked about the reliability of projections for more drought, Zorita, a scientist who has co-authored numerous publications, tells the German Spiegel news weekly that the prognoses are “hardly trustworthy” and that their new study shows that “the climate model results clearly deviated from the climate data on precipitation“.

The scientists based their findings on 1200 years of climate data from the northern hemisphere, much of it from proxy records. The mismatch between the models and observations are in fact profound, it turns out.
No 20th century precipitation signal
When asked if a man-made signal could be found in the precipitation over the 20th century, Zorita replied:
In our data we do not see anything unusual. There was nothing special concerning precipitation. It was similarly arid from the 9th to the 11th century, and back then there was no man-made climate change. Also harsh droughts such as the recent ones in Western USA were put into real perspective. Precipitation amounts actually fluctuate more greatly than previously assumed – that’s what the data show for the past 1200 years.”
When you boil it down: droughts are no worse today than they have ever been in the past 1200 years back when CO2 was some 30% less. Zorita adds:
But for the past 1200 years we were not able to find a relationship between global warming and changes in precipitation. That’s something that raises concern.”
“Hardly able to model the water cycle”
Zorita then tells Spiegel that the results of the study should be seen as a “warning signal“, elaborating:
It shows that we need to do a better job testing the climate models. They have been hardly able to model the water cycle, the crux of the climate phenomenon.”
That’s black on white. The models thus cannot be relied on to come anywhere close to forecasting the future as they cannot even properly simulate crucial precipitation cycles. The modelers of course cannot be blamed here as the system is indeed enormously complex. They are doing a good job getting the task started, but it has to be acknowledged that it is only a start and that there is in fact a very very long way to go before they produce useful long-term forecasts.
Large knowledge gaps in other areas
In the interview Zorita also brings up the knowledge gaps in other crucial areas. He tells Spiegel there’s still much to learn about clouds and aerosols, and that much more research is required here. Moreover much remains poorly understood in yet more areas:
Also our understanbding of how moisture between the ground and air is exchanged is insufficient. That is really something to think about because these factors determine the climate of the future.”
The results of this paper really ought to be embarrassing for policymakers who insist the science is settled and that we need to heed what the current (embryonic) models are telling us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Satuurday Summary, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi looks at August global temperature (starting at about the 3:30 mark) and serves up a few intersting observations.
“Global” warming confined to the poles, in wintertime
First he reminds us that the “global” warming is pretty much confined to the poles, and that during the winter time. Warming during the summertime has been very small, “much to the chagrin of people who want the Arctic ice cap to disappear … Summers are not getting warmer in the Arctic”. He summarizes:
Summers are not getting warmer in the Arctic, and they are not getting warmer in the Antarctic – their summers. The winters are getting warmer and that’s where most of the global warming is. […] Most of the warming is happening in the Arctic, and in the Antarctic during their winters, not in third world countries… “
He then tells listeners that warming is hardly occurring 20° North and south of the equator. In summary the warming is mostly confined to the poles, and it isn’t even year round.
“Phony ideas” about how warm it is getting
The veteran meteorolgist then scoffs at the claim that 0.02°C warming per decade is going to cause mass migrations of populations:

Do you actually think that people can detect, and get migrational patterns, because people detect 0.02°C increase in temperatures? Cut me a break!”
“Probably one of the least ice melt seasons on record”
At 6:10 he looks at Arctic sea ice, saying that it is not going to reach a new record low, as many were hollering about earlier this year. The ice melt rate over the summer has been too slow. Joe says:
Chances are that we had probably one of the least ice melt seasons on record.”

One reason this is so, Joe adds, is because summers have not been warming up there.

"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called for a Royal Commission of Enquiry into the Scientific Evidence for Man-made Climate Change.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the Sydney APEC Declaration was a clear signal that most APEC nations are not going to swallow the pseudo-science and economic poison being peddled by Dark Greens from yesterday’s states like Europe and New Zealand.
The APEC nations told Australia, as politely as possible “You may commit economic suicide if you wish, but we are not going to put our feet on the sticky paper.” This “Never-Never” declaration is a warning call that Australia should re-examine the basis for its enormous waste of money on “Global Warming”.

China and India recognise clearly that “Global Warming” is just another European plan to hobble economic competition from Asia. The Global Warming Scam would deny cheap clean power to millions of energetic Asians.
France closed its last coal mine in 2004 and is now heavily dependent on nuclear power. German coal mines are no longer economic, and even in Britain, fewer than 5,000 coal miners work the mines that once fuelled an empire. Thanks to their Dark Greens, Europe is now dependent on imported coal for steel production and gets its power from imported uranium and gas piped in from Russia and beyond.
France has always envied and feared the cheap and abundant coal of the Anglo American world. The world dominance of Britain and then America in steel, manufacturing, metals, steam, railways, electricity and naval power was fuelled by coal, supported later by oil. China and India are about to tread the same road. The Dark Greens of Europe, secretly supported by their decaying industrialists, fear the growing power, energy and competitiveness of these emerging giants.
This is not about climate – it is about using public hysteria to benefit certain countries, business interests and ideologies.
There was no declaration of carbon emission targets from last week’s Russian delegation to Queensland. Russian scientists are not sucked in by distortions, exaggerations, half truths and poor science being peddled by the likes of Al Gore and Bob Brown.
The Russians, the Arabs, the Indians and the Chinese cannot believe the apparent stupidity of the English speaking world. They have no intention of adding to their energy costs or forcing their businesses to waste money on dreamtime research such as carbon sequestration – they are cynically planning exploit the declining competitiveness of western industries and to milk stupid westerners of any “carbon offset credits” they can find or invent.
There is already a groundswell of opposition from well informed scientists, engineers and individuals all over the world to the lack of evidence supporting the Greenhouse Religion. A recent scientific conference in Melbourne organised by the Lavoisier Society drew scientists and delegates from all over Australia and South Africa. Even the PM’s own backbench contains well informed climate sceptics, and the ranks of scientific sceptics are growing all over the world.
A Royal Commission taking evidence from more than a few government or United Nations hacks would soon establish the facts that:

1934 was the hottest year of the twentieth century.
There was no global warming from 1940 to 1980, a time when CO2 emissions grew strongly.
There has been no global warming since 1998.
Current temperatures are not extreme or unusual.
Past records and scientific evidence show that changing surface temperature is more likely to be a cause (not a result) of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.
CO2 and water vapour have always been essential components of the atmosphere. Neither is toxic, both tend to retain some of the sun’s warmth, and both are absolutely essential and beneficial to all life on earth.
The most likely causes of variations in surface temperature are connected with solar cycles, variations in the heat output of the sun and eras of volcanic activity.
More CO2, water vapour and warmth in the atmosphere would be a boon to most of humanity.
There is empirical evidence to suggest that earth’s temperature is more likely to fall than rise – ice ages are more normal than today’s balmy climates.
There is significant scientific opposition to the proposition that man’s emissions of CO2 are causing global warming or any other harm.

Earth’s climate is always changing and we must do what every generation of our ancestors did – “adapt to whatever nature has in store for us”.
Our ability to adapt is severely reduced by crippling our economy and misdirecting billions of dollars of research funds into nonsense like carbon sequestration or rich man’s toys like windmills and solar panels.
While billions of dollars are being spent on naïve attempts to build ever more complex computer models of atmospheric heat circulation, our oceans are largely unexplored. The vast deposits of methane under our oceans are both a threat and a promise for future generations, but too little research is being done in this field. And the hundreds of thousands of undersea volcanoes, which may hold the key to past and future climate change, remain largely unmapped and un-monitored.
Australia, an island almost alone in the Great Southern Ocean which circles the globe, should take the lead in ocean research instead of letting scheming politicians from abroad mis-direct our research priorities to spurious questions.

We hear the constant dripping tap of the doomsters telling us we must embrace renewable energy, like wind. Quite apart from the bird mincing, the rare earth metal mining, the concrete, the noise pollution, the visual pollution, and their inefficiency, it turns out that [they aren’t very green at all and can’t be recycled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-02-05/wind-turbine-blades-can-t-be-recycled-so-they-re-piling-up-in-landfills). 



A wind turbine’s blades can be longer than a Boeing 747 wing, so at the end of their lifespan **they can’t just be hauled away**. First, you need to **saw through the lissome fiberglass using a diamond-encrusted industrial saw** to create three pieces small enough to be strapped to a tractor-trailer.



The municipal landfill in Casper, Wyoming, is the final resting place of 870 blades whose days making renewable energy have come to end. **The severed fragments look like bleached whale bones nestled against one another.**



“That’s the end of it for this winter,” said waste technician Michael Bratvold, watching a bulldozer bury them forever in sand. “We’ll get the rest when the weather breaks this spring.”



 **Tens of thousands of aging blades are coming down from steel towers around the world and most have nowhere to go but landfills.** In the U.S. alone, about 8,000 will be removed in each of the next four years. Europe, which has been dealing with the problem longer, has about 3,800 coming down annually through at least 2022, according to BloombergNEF. It’s going to get worse: Most were built more than a decade ago, when installations were less than a fifth of what they are now.



This is the type of thing the facepalm emoji was invented for. 



What do you do with non-recyclable renewable energy components?



Built to withstand hurricane-force winds, the blades can’t easily be crushed, recycled or repurposed. That’s created an urgent search for alternatives in places that lack wide-open prairies. In the U.S., they go to the handful of landfills that accept them, in Lake Mills, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Casper, where they will be interred in stacks that reach 30 feet under.



“The wind turbine blade will be there, ultimately, forever,” said Bob Cappadona, chief operating officer for the North American unit of Paris-based [Veolia Environnement SA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VIE:FP), which is searching for better ways to deal with the massive waste. “Most landfills are considered a dry tomb.”



“The last thing we want to do is create even more environmental challenges.”



But that is exactly what they have done.



To prevent catastrophic climate change caused by burning fossil fuels, many governments and corporations have **pledged to use only clean energy** by 2050. **Wind energy is one of the cheapest ways to reach that goal.**



Except it turns out that wind is far from clean. Now even the blades are cluttering up landfills. Basically the entire industry is built on a fraud that it is clean. And the news gets worse: even disposing of them isn’t anywhere near green.



Wind power is carbon-free and about 85% of turbine components, including steel, copper wire, electronics and gearing can be recycled or reused. But **the fiberglass blades remain difficult to dispose of.** With **some as long as a football field, big rigs can only carry one at a time, making transportation costs prohibitive for long-distance hauls.** Scientists are **trying to find better ways to separate resins from fibers** or to give small chunks new life as pellets or boards.



The inconvenient carbon footprint of large trucks to haul them away, and one can only imagine the chemicals being investigated to separate resins from fibres. 



Dirty, dirty wind turbines. Tell me again, **James Shaw** , why wind turbines are so clean.

"**As if piling up sandbags before a flood, Apple was well prepared to face a backlash over its decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters.**
But the firmâs carefully-worded statement offering its reasoning has left China watchers, politicians - and some famed Apple supporters - wholly unconvinced.
âAppleâs decision to cave to Communist Chinaâs demands is unacceptable,â tweeted Rick Scott, a Republican senator for Florida.
âPutting profits above the human rights and dignity of the people of Hong Kong is wrong. No ifs, ands or buts about it.â
Late on Wednesday, the firm started briefing journalists on the move, pushing its view that the HKmap.live was being âused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residentsâ.
On Thursday morning, Apple chief executive Tim Cook posted an internal memo.
âItâs out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision,â he wrote.
âOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.
âSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.â
Long-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cookâs email: âI canât recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny.â
Apple has yet to provide any additional information about those claimed incidents. Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator who represents the IT industry in the territory, posted a letter to Mr Cook on Twitter.
âThere are numerous cases of innocent passers-by in the neighbourhood injured by the Kong Kong Police Forceâs excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,â he wrote.
âThe user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.â
Mr Mok went on to argue that users on major social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also share information about police activity - but were not being held to the same standard.
âWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.â
Apple has not responded to the letter.
Appleâs decision comes against a backdrop of major American firms being seen as bowing to political pressure from Beijing.
In just the past week, the NBA grovelled its way around a tweet from a team executive supporting the protests, while video games published Activision Blizzard banned e-sports competitor Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung for showing his support for the movement.
And Google removed a role-playing game called âRevolution of Our Timesâ from its app store after deeming it violated its policies on depicting âsensitive eventsâ (the player plays the role of a Hong Kong protester). According to the Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong authorities had contacted Google with concerns about that app - though the company has said it decided to take action before any communication took place.
One bucking of the trend, however, came via Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the firm behind online multiplayer game Fortnite.
âEpic supports everyoneâs right to speak freely,â he wrote on Twitter, in response to a question about gamers voicing support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns 40% of the firm.
âChina players of Fortnite are free to criticize the US or criticize Epic just as equally as all others,â Mr Sweeney said.
In characteristically astute timing, an episode of Comedy Centralâs South Park earlier this month led Chinese censors to âdelete virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pagesâ, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
The episode featured four of the showâs main characters working on a film script that gets constantly altered so that it could be distributed in China.
âWell you know what they say,â the filmâs director in the show says, âYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.â
In Appleâs case that means revenues that are on course to exceed $40bn this year - almost a fifth of the firmâs total global sales. Appleâs reliance on Chinese manufacturing means the relationship goes far deeper than just local sales. The firm has 10,000 direct employees in the firm; the economy around Appleâs presence in China is responsible for around 5m jobs.
What happens next depends on the extent to which China feels its hardline stance is working - and there are indications officials are becoming wary. According to reporting in the New York Times, Beijing is concerned its actions are drawing more attention to the protests and harming the countryâs standing on the global stage, adding yet more tension to relations with the US as trade talks restart in Washington.
The rows have also bolstered concerns that China has few qualms when it comes to making demands of companies both based in the Communist state, as well as those who merely want to do business there.
âWhat would Huawei do if they were the dominant 5G provider for a country, and that countryâs leaders said the wrong thing?â speculated Elliott Zaagman, who covers Chinese business and investment,

Richard Harman has [done some sterling work in exposing the dirty deals done with sheep by **Murray McCully**](https://www.politik.co.nz/2020/02/10/damning-final-verdict-on-mccullys-saudi-sheep-deal/). The details are finally public and it isn’t very good reading for a supposedly least corrupt country in the world:



The CEOs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise have **delivered a final nail in the coffin of Murray McCully’s Saudi Arabian “Agri-Hub”.**



The pair have **authored a damning letter** finally responding to then -Auditor General, Lyn Provost’s , highly critical report on the project which she produced in 2016 when National — and McCully — were still in power.



The letter was sent to the Office of he Auditor General only last week.



The controversy dates back to 2010 when the-then National Government banned live sheep exports which angered a Saudi Arabian Investor, Hmood Khalaf, who had set up a Hawkes Bay farm specifically for the purpose of raising fat-tailed sheep for the Saudi Arabian live sheep market.



The sheep were required for slaughter and consumption during the annual Haj pilgrimage to Mecca,



Through a series of contacts, he eventually persuaded the then Foreign Minister, Murray McCully, to steer through Cabinet a proposal for a New Zealand sheep farm in Saudi Arabia for which he would supply breeding stock for from the Hawkes Bay. (Breeding stock were not included in the live sheep ban.)



McCully argued that the ban had led to a deterioration in relations with Saudi Arabia and jeopardised New Zealand’s chances of securing a free trade agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council of Arabian peninsula states.



As part of the package **$4 million was paid to Khalaf but there has never any Cabinet paper or minute produced to show that the Cabinet properly authorised the money.**



Nearly five years ago, in June 2015 then-Auditor General, Lyn Provost, received letters from members of Parliament and a petition from about 10,000 New Zealanders asking for an inquiry into the Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership.



 **The Auditor General produced a report in October 2016 which found that there were significant shortcomings in the paper put to Cabinet.**



“In my view, settlement of a grievance was provided under the guise of a contract for services,” she said.



“The Saudi Arabia Food Security Partnership was the result of a need to resolve a diplomatic issue and, in the view of Ministers, to settle a Saudi Arabian investor’s grievance.”



Then Opposition MP, now Trade Minister, **David Parker claimed in 2015** that McCully was “ **the first Minister in history to back a multi-million dollar facilitation arrangement which in other jurisdictions is called a bribe.”**



There can be no other way to view the unapproved cash trousered by Khalaf. It was dodgy then, and it dodgy today. The CEOs of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise have responded to the Auditor General’s report.



[…] the **fine print in their response is more devastating.**



“T **he economic benefits** anticipated under the Agrihub **did not materialise,** ” the report says.



“NZTE sought to leverage the Agrihub through showcasing New Zealand firms involved in the project’s implementation.



“NZTE participated in the Saudi Agriculture Show in 2015 and 2016 to help support the two companies involved in the Agrihub that were looking for commercial opportunities in Saudi Arabia.



“Further to this, NZTE’s platform at the 2016 exhibition included two additional companies that were not involved in the commercial implementation of the Agrihub project.



“ **After two years of participation, no distributor in Saudi Arabia sought to purchase the products available.** As a result, both companies withdrew their interest and their focus on the Saudi market.”



Sounds like an expensive sham that the taxpayers have funded for no benefit whatsoever.



Cris and Seed concluded that “The advent of the Agrihub did not translate into progress as **the FTA has now been stalled for a decade**. The Agrihub also **failed to generate the economic benefits** that had been hoped for at the time. It is MFAT and NZTE’s assessment then that at the conclusion of the process, **the $11.5 million Saudi Arabia Food Partnership Agreement did not provide value for money** – similar arrangements should not be recommended or utilised again.”



That is a damning assessment on what was essentially a fraud perpetrated on the New Zealand taxpayer. It was all supposed to result in a free trade agreement in the Middle East, it never did.



 **Murray McCully** didn’t follow cabinet processes, not for the first time. He also [didn’t follow cabinet processes in sponsoring the anti-Israel Resolution 2334 at the UN](http://www.jwire.com.au/mccully-supported-un-resolution-2334-without-cabinet-approval/). From here it looks like Murray McCully did whatever he liked and successive Prime Ministers, **John Key** and **Bill English** , let him. That is a sad reflection on them too.



The worry is the malign influence of McCully is still around because he and his cohort **Michelle Boag** are still meddling in New Zealand politics by facilitating National’s green proxy party, **Vernon Tava** ‘s [Sustainable New Zealand Party](https://sustainablenz.org.nz/). McCully and Boag are also part of the [Maori Carbon Foundation](https://www.maoricarbonfoundation.com/about-us/governance/) which is looking to cash in on another scam, climate change. 



We now know that McCully did dirty deeds with sheep in the Middle East.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




A couple of interesting pieces have come recently to our attention that deal with the serious issue of “publication bias” in science.   
  
In our Cato Working Paper No. 29, we describe “publication bias” as an underreporting of negative results from scientific experiments—a practice which can bias science in the direction of supporting existing hypotheses, even highly questionable ones.   
  
In “Is the Government Buying Science or Support?” we lay out a framework for detecting whether federal funding of scientific research is perpetuating publication bias through expectations of results supporting existing federal science interests. We suspect it has.   
  
A few years back, we looked into whether evidence of publication bias was present in the reporting of climate change results that were being published in the _Science_ and _Nature_ , the most influential science periodicals on earth. Not surprisingly, we found strong evidence that findings that anthropogenic climate change being “worse than expected” was disproportionately reported, compared to findings that climate change impacts would not as great as predicted. In an unbiased condition, each event should be equally likely. We concluded:   




“This [finding] has considerable implications for the popular perception of global warming science, for the nature of ""compendia"" of climate change research, such as the reports of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, and for the political process that uses those compendia as the basis for policy.”



Rather than being uncommon, publication bias is probably closer to the norm.   
  
Two recent reports highlight its occurrence in two other major scientific research areas—the social cost of carbon and psychotherapy.   
  
The social cost of carbon (SCC) is on its way to becoming perhaps _the_ strongest influence on public policy both nationally and internationally. It represents the current value of the cost of all future damages wrought by the emission of each new ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from human activities. It currently factors into virtually all newly-proposed regulations from the federal government and will no doubt be the center of focus at the international climate negotiation to take place in Paris this December. If the SCC is low (or negative) there is no need to regulation carbon dioxide emissions; the higher the SCC is, the greater the sense of urgency.   
  
But nobody know what the true value the SCC is—and, if fact, it is probably unknowable. That doesn’t stop a whole lot of people from trying to assign a value to it. The more extreme you think climate change is going to be and the less confidence that you have in the ability of mankind to adapt to changing conditions, the higher your estimates of the SCC.   
  
Since you probably only bother to study the SCC if you think there is going to be a major problem with climate change, SCC researchers are probably somewhat preconditioned to pursing methodologies which lead to high SCC estimates, and eschew those that don’t. This is a situation ripe for publication bias. And a research team led by Dr. Tomáš Havránek of the Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University in Prague set out to see if they could find one.   
  
Yesiree.   
  
From the abstract of their paper:   




We examine potential selective reporting in the literature on the social cost of carbon (SCC) by conducting a meta-analysis of 809 estimates of the SCC reported in 101 studies. Our results indicate that estimates for which the 95% confidence interval includes zero are less likely to be reported than estimates excluding negative values of the SCC, which might [how about the word _will_ —eds] create an upward bias in the literature. The evidence for selective reporting is stronger for studies published in peer-reviewed journals than for unpublished papers.



Additionally, and rather importantly, Havránek and colleagues also note that selective reporting likely plagues other aspects of the climate change literature which further leads to an inflated SCC estimates:   




Moreover, other studies suggest that some of the parameters used for the calibration of integrated assessment models [used to determine the SCC], such as climate sensitivity or the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, are likely to be exaggerated themselves because of selective reporting, which might further contribute to the exaggeration of the SCC reported in individual studies—including the results of the [U.S.] Interagency Working Group [responsible for establishing a SCC value used in federal cost/benefit analyses].



You really ought to have a look at the Havránek study in its entirety to see the nature and depth of the problem. It is available here.   
  
Another example of publication bias infiltrating a major field of science—psychotherapy—has just been published by a team led by Ellen Driessen of VU University Amsterdam.   
  
An excellent article in Vox by Julia Belluz laid out the implications of what Driessen and colleagues found:   




For years, doctors have had two main strategies for treating depression: antidepressants and psychotherapy. These practices, according to the published research, can be fairly effective.   
  
Or at least that's what we thought. But recent research now suggests that we've actually been overestimating the effectiveness of our best treatments for depression — in part because published studies were giving a biased picture of the medical evidence.   
  
The reason has to do with something called **""** publication bias. **""** Often there are lots of different scientists conducting studies on whether, say, a particular drug or therapy can alleviate the symptoms of depression. Not all of those studies, however, get published. Journal editors tend to be more interested in papers finding that a particular treatment had a big effect instead of studies showing little or no effect.



Driessen’s paper comes to this unsettling conclusion:   




The efficacy of psychological interventions for depression has been overestimated in the published literature, just as it has been for pharmacotherapy. Both are efficacious but not to the extent that the published literature would suggest. Funding agencies and journals should archive both original protocols and raw data from treatment trials to allow the detection and correction of outcome reporting bias. Clinicians, guidelines developers, and decision makers should be aware that the published literature overestimates the effects of the predominant treatments for depression.



While few even realize it exists, publication bias has serious real-world implications, from environmental policy to mental health.

I recently flew to China for an academic conference on some of the geopolitical and security issues dividing Washington and Beijing. I had attended the same event two years before and enjoyed the wide‐​ranging discussion. The conference was to bring together scholars from throughout Asia and beyond.



When I landed, however, my host informed me that the school needed higher approval to host any foreigners, so only domestic academics could participate in the next day’s sessions, and my separate talk scheduled for the following day was cancelled.



I wasn’t the only person affected, but I had traveled the furthest. I spent my two days playing tourist and chatting informally with some of the other scholars. It was a lost opportunity to consider approaches which might halt the seeming slide toward possible military confrontation. I was later told that the extra level of approval was always required for international participation but had been routinely ignored in practice. No longer, it seemed.





Beijing’s shift back toward suffocating totalitarianism is a great disappointment to China’s friends in the U.S.



Whatever the genesis of the restriction, it obviously reduced one set of unofficial contacts which have helped draw together the U.S. and People’s Republic of China. That comes on top of actions by both governments which threaten to further close the door to academic and other exchanges.



One of the most important, if low key, steps taken by the Obama administration in expanding Sino‐​American contacts was to initiate the issuance of ten‐​year visas by both nations. That eased requirements for participating in conferences, especially in response to last minute invitations, and the measure encouraged more routine travel, since the process to acquiring a visa had grown more difficult over time.



Yet Washington has shifted that process in reverse. The New York Times recently reported on the case of Zhu Feng, a well‐​known and well‐​traveled specialist in international relations, now teaching at Nanjing University and heading the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea. As he prepared to board his flight back to the PRC two FBI agents accosted him, demanded his passport, and crossed out his oft‐​used ten‐​year visa without explanation.



Some scholars, such as Wang Wen, Director of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies in Beijing, were notified by email that Washington was cancelling their ten‐​year visa. He told National Public Radio that the U.S. embassy said he could apply for a single‐​entry visa in the future—if he disclosed his last 15 years of travel. His response: “It was too much personal information to [the] American government, so I rejected having to apply again.” The list of those whose travel privileges have been revoked include academics who have spent months or years studying and/​or working in America.



The new U.S. approach likely in part reflects the administration’s hostility to all things foreign. If Washington is prepared to reject already‐​certified Christian refugees fleeing Islamist persecution—as it has—then who will it allow to enter America?



More importantly, reported the Times, the FBI apparently is targeting academics it believes to have contacts with Chinese intelligence. However, that seems to be almost inevitable in an authoritarian dictatorship. Refusing to cooperate with the Chinese government would likely bar advancement topositions which lead people to travel to the U.S.. Said Zhu: “China is, by its nature, a police state. When a national security official comes to my office, I have no way to kick them out.” Indeed.



Moreover, those scholars with strong official connections offer an important and unofficial conduit of information between governments. Their attendance in conferences is particularly useful since they help participants grapple with what Chinese policymakers likely are thinking. Obviously, it is important to stop serious espionage, but that seems unlikely from academics attending policy‐​oriented forums.



Some advocates of a tougher approach complain that the PRC is not as open as America. Of course China is less open, but limiting the entry of Chinese scholars isn’t likely to cause Beijing to welcome American critics of PRC policies in Tibet and Xinjiang, for instance. That is no reason for Washington to bar from America foreign academics likely to be among those who best understand and appreciate the U.S.



There obviously is a limit to their influence: they haven’t prevented the ongoing crackdown by President Xi Jinping, who is waging a veritable war on liberal values in China.



Nevertheless, today’s climate makes sympathetic voices even more important. Argued Susan Shirk of the University of California, San Diego: “These people are among the most sophisticated in how the U.S. works and are some of the strongest advocates of good relations with the United States.” She worried that “We are alienating some of America’s best friends in China.”



That seems to be the case with Wang, who said that he had “often suggested to [his] audience and readers that China should learn from America.” After being stripped of his ten‐​year visa he said “I [will] never write such articles again.”



In any case, Beijing has not responded to the U.S. crackdown by opening the visa floodgates. To the contrary, they showed their willingness to play the opposite game, denying a visa to the Hudson Institute’s Michael Pillsbury, a China critic. A Chinese official he knows suggested it was in retaliation for the growing list of PRC scholars losing their visas. Pillsbury called for “a ceasefire in this visa war,” since “it is in both sides’ interest to have scholars on the topic of U.S.-China relations be able to understand what is going on and bring their experience to bear.”



He’s right.



Beijing’s shift back toward suffocating totalitarianism is a great disappointment to China’s friends in the U.S. However, it is vital to keep as many channels of communication open as possible. That includes academics and scholars, especially those with the most sophisticated understanding of the bilateral relationship.



Both governments need to act to halt the ongoing deterioration of relations almost across the board. Sometimes difficult disagreements will be inevitable. Violent confrontation is not. Yet as the foundations of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship crumble, conflict will become more possible.

 _These lawyers and men of learning, and moneyed men that talk so finely, and gloss over matters so smoothly, to make us, poor illiterate people, swallow down the pill, expect to get into Congress themselves; they expect to be the managers of this Constitution, and get all the power and all the money into their own hands, and then they will swallow up all us little folks, like the great Leviathan…yes, just as the whale swallowed up Jonah._



— Amos Singletary, delegate from Worcester County at the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, January 25, 1788



In October 1787, only a month after the Constitutional Convention ended its deliberations and sent the finished Constitution to the states for ratification, Robert Yates, a judge from upstate New York, penned a prescient essay arguing against ratifying the Constitution. Yates worried the proposed constitution would create a government unaccountable to the people and that those in power would use it for the “purposes of gratifying their own interest and ambition.” “It is scarcely possible,” Yates wrote, “in a very large republic, to call them to account for their misconduct, or to prevent their abuse of power.”



Yates was an Anti‐​Federalist, the name given to opponents of ratifying the Constitution. History is written by the winners, the saying goes, so nowadays the Anti‐​Federalists are taught as a footnote in junior high American history class. Given our national reverence for the Constitution, they’re remembered as opponents to progress, as enemies to a government ordained and established by the people. At worst they’re considered knuckle‐​dragging philistines who allowed their parochial concerns about states’ powers to trump the good of the nation. They’re the Pharisees of our political religion.



But the Anti‐​Federalists are always with us, if in spirit rather than name, and we ignore them at our own peril. Country judges who complain about the highfalutin ways “back East,” populist governors who rail against the temerity of an overweening federal government, and the millions of people who just want to be left alone by Washington are all examples of the Anti‐​Federalist impulse. Sometimes that political impulse sits in the background of the American political conversation, and sometimes it becomes the most popular show in town.





Cato’s annual Constitution Day symposium marks the day in 1787 that the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the U.S. Constitution. We celebrate that event each year with the release of the new issue of the _Cato Supreme Court Review_ and with a day‐​long symposium featuring noted scholars discussing the recently concluded Supreme Court term and the important cases coming up.



This crazy election year, the wispy‐​haired, demagogic blowhards who came to prominence on both the left and the right—inciting the people against “the establishment,” attacking banks and Wall Street (i.e. “stockjobbers”), and generally calling the entire government stupid and disconnected from the average man—carry the Anti‐​Federalist impulse in their veins. When the political establishment ignores Anti‐​Federalist sentiments for too long, it can rise up and take over, which is partially what happened during the long, surreal election of 2016.



The Anti‐​Federalists taught us valuable lessons about good government that have always been relevant and will never go away.



 **What the Anti‐​Federalist Got Right**



The original Anti‐​Federalists were wrong on many things—the federal government, for example, did not obliterate and override states’ powers to tax their citizens—but they got three basic ideas right, and all ideas have become increasingly relevant in modern American politics.



First, the Anti‐​Federalists predicted that the federal government the Constitution created would increase its power until states were merely secondary considerations. Second, that this powerful federal government would be too big and distant for the people to effectively control, and thus vainglorious men of ambition and avarice would control it to enrich themselves off the common people.



Third, that it was unwise to govern a diverse and large population from a remote and distant government that would hold such immense power over the daily lives of common people, and, as a result, politics would become something more primitive than civilized, characterized by constant discord and fighting as different factions tried to control the lives of their fellow citizens.



These three ideas can be combined into one salient and perceptive question: Will a remote and distant government that wields a large amount of power over a vast land and a diverse people increasingly be seen as not representing the people, and, in the process, sow discord between them?



This essay will discuss these three Anti‐​Federalist ideas in modern context. I implore you not to think of this as a partisan plea for “states rights.” Questions about proper government structuring—that is, how government should act and at which level, local or national—are different than the more partisan “What should government do?” Maybe there should be a single‐​payer health‐​care system, or maybe there should be a school voucher program, but which level of government should implement those programs? That question is one of good governance, not partisanship.



It is time to remove the Anti‐​Federalists from the historical refuse pile where we’ve traditionally placed failed prognosticators such as Neville “peace in our time” Chamberlain or Thomas “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers” Watson. Rather than continuing to ignore the Anti‐​Federalists, this is a perfect time to find wisdom in the words of our “other” founders. Sometimes, the folk remedies of old are the best prescription to present ills.



 **A Federal Government of ‘Great and Uncontroulable Powers’**



Robert Yates actually attended the first five weeks or so of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, having been chosen along with John Lansing Jr. and Alexander Hamilton to be the delegation from New York. Lansing and Yates were “Clinton-men”—meaning they supported populist New York Gov. George Clinton, an Anti‐​Federalist and strong supporter of states’ rights—and they had been sent to the convention to counterbalance and overrule Hamilton, who was decidedly neither a Clinton‐​man nor an ardent defender of states’ rights.



Yates and Lansing watched the delegates vote to replace rather than amend the Articles of Confederation, something they believed was beyond the convention’s authority. They watched as delegates passed resolutions that would give great power to a new national government. They would have none of it. Both decided to leave the convention in early July, believing the delegates were creating an illegitimate and uncontrollable national government. When Yates saw the final version of the Constitution, it confirmed his fears.



Yates picked up his pen. In the fashion of the time, he wrote anonymously under the pseudonym “Brutus,” and choosing the name of Caesar’s assassin was certainly no accident. In his mind, he had a potential king to slay.



Under the proposed Constitution, Yates wrote, the government “has authority to make laws which will affect the lives, the liberty, and property of every man in the United States.” That power, in Yates’s view, was so great that it would eventually swallow the state governments, “for it will be found that the power retained by individual states, small as it is, will be a clog upon the wheels of the government of the United States; the latter therefore will be naturally inclined to remove it.”



Yates understood the temptations of power. “It is a truth confirmed by the unerring experience of ages,” he wrote, “that every man, and every body of men, invested with power, are ever disposed to increase it, and to acquire a superiority over every thing that stands in their way.”



Perhaps, in a modern context, we should think of this in less dastardly terms than the kind of encroaching despotism Yates seems to imply. As any government official knows, local control and individual freedom can stand in the way of the well‐​meaning designs of government programs. A painter cannot create a beautiful, harmonious picture if another painter controls part of the canvas, and he certainly can’t do so if some of the paint keeps moving around of its own accord. To paint his harmonious picture, something has to be done about the other painter and the disobedient paint. They’re “clogs upon the wheels.”



For Yates and other Anti‐​Federalists, the Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants the federal government power to make all laws “necessary and proper” to executing government’s powers, contained the seeds of absolute control.



“Under such a clause as this,” asked an Anti‐​Federalist writing as “An Old Whig,” “can any thing be said to be reserved and kept back from Congress?” “The Federal Farmer” (thought to be Richard Henry Lee or Melancton Smith) wrote that “it is impossible to have a just conception of [Congress’s] powers, or of the extent and number of laws which may be deemed necessary and proper.”



The Anti‐​Federalists were proved correct. When combined with other clauses, in particular the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause has been used precisely as they predicted. Applying the Necessary and Proper Clause to the Commerce Clause has permitted Congress to reach nearly every non‐​commercial activity imaginable, turning the Commerce Clause into more of a general powers clause.



Whether or not that is a good thing, it is certainly different than what the Framers contemplated, which was a government of limited and enumerated powers that left most questions of local governance—such as education and health care—to the states.



 **A Government of the ‘Base, Idle, Avaricious and Ambitious’**



For the Anti‐​Federalist “Cato” (probably Clinton himself), a large and powerful government was particularly prone to being captured by “ambitious people” of “large fortunes” who will realize that they can become “happy, great, and glorious by oppressing [their] fellow citizens.” Such a person would “raise himself to grandeur, on the ruins of his country” because in a large republic “the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views.”



Furthermore, given “the vast extent” of the United States’ territory, as well as “the complication of interests” reposed in the government, “the science of government will become intricate and perplexed, and too mysterious” for the average person to “understand and observe.”



The Federal Farmer thought representatives in the federal government would be “too far removed from the people, in general, to sympathize with them, and too few to communicate with them.” It is a “consideration well worth pursuing,” he asked, “how far this house of representatives will be liable to be formed into private juntos,” creating groups of “unprincipled men, often distinguished for their wealth or abilities,” who will “combine together and make their object their private interests and aggrandizement.”



Centinel (probably Samuel Bryan) concluded that “the organization of this government…is devoid of all responsibility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that so far from being a regular balanced government, it would be in practice _a permanent_ ARISTOCRACY.”



A majority of members of Congress are millionaires. Eighty‐​one percent of people think the government can be trusted to do what’s right only some of the time or never, and 75 percent see widespread government corruption. We seem to have reached peak animosity and disappointment toward those in Washington, with the ire coming from both the left and the right. Increasing numbers of Americans believe Washington DC does not represent their views.



For many, the city on the Potomac has might as well be a later‐​stage Rome, sliding into decadent splendor and orgiastic self‐​absorption. Or, in the words of Cato, the “federal city” would be “the asylum of the base, idle, avaricious and ambitious,” that would “possess a language and manners different from yours.”



 **A People ‘Constantly Contending with Each Other’**



A national government imbued with unrestrained power would be a bad idea, thought Yates, because the people of the country were too diverse to be effectively centrally governed. A remote, national government given such great powers would cause a “constant clashing of opinions; and the representatives of one part will be continually striving against those of the other.”



This was because the “laws and customs of the several states are, in many respects, very diverse, and in some opposite; each would be in favor of its own interests and customs, and, of consequence, a legislature, formed of representatives from the respective parts, would not only be too numerous to act with any care or decision, but would be composed of such heterogeneous and discordant principles, as would constantly be contending with each other.”



Quoting the Constitution’s preamble, Cato sounded the same concerns:



[W]hoever seriously considers the immense extent of territory comprehended within the limits of the United States, together with the variety of its climates, productions, and commerce, the difference of extent, and number of inhabitants in all; the dissimilitude of interest, morals, and politics, in almost every one, will receive it as an intuitive truth, that a consolidated republican form of government therein, can never form a perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to you and your posterity.



No, thought Cato, such a government would be “unkindred,” and the constant clashing would “emphatically be like a house divided against itself.”



Here the Anti‐​Federalists were perhaps the most prescient. Political polarization has reached a fever pitch, and it shows no signs of abating. As Pew recently concluded:



Across 48 different questions covering values about government, foreign policy, social and economic issues and other realms, the average difference between the opinions of Republicans and Democrats now stands at 18 percentage points…nearly twice the size of the gap in surveys conducted from 1987–2002.



Congressional polarization is no better, having increased to the point where the two parties essentially always vote in lockstep with one another and rarely overlap. The “representatives of one part” are truly “continually striving against those of the other.”



There have been many theories and solutions offered for increasing polarization. Some solutions are rooted in controlling political information, whether through campaign finance laws, lawsuits against those who spread “disinformation,” or trying, in some way, to hold media accountable. At best these seem overly optimistic, and at worst they are blatant violations of the First Amendment. Given the way the Internet is personalizing our “feeds” in music, movies, art, and, well, everything, it seems wiser to conclude that, for the foreseeable future, political opinions will become more idiosyncratic, personal, and disparate.



But during the founding era, unlike perhaps any other time except for our own, political opinion was idiosyncratic, personal, and highly disparate. Newspapers and pamphlets by the hundreds were the primary source of political information, and those sources were biased to the extreme. There was no mass media, only private “feeds.” Maybe, therefore, the wisdom of the Anti‐​Federalists is even more relevant to soothing our currently polarized soul.



 **The Constitution as Peacekeeper**



What can we learn from these three prescient Anti‐​Federalist predictions? Primarily, that the Constitution is a peacekeeper. Good fences make good neighbors, but why? It’s less about keeping things out than keeping things in, that is, defining who has control over your yard, your house, and the things that happen inside.



A Trump supporter and a Clinton supporter living next door to each other can get along cordially due to the separation between the two houses. If either one were allowed to control the internal “policies” of the other house, however, things would get ugly. It’s no different in politics. The Constitution, as it was originally conceived, also tried to keep peace between neighbors, that is, between the different states that make up the union.



The Framers partially understood what the Anti‐​Federalists argued: the more that government gets involved in the daily lives and values of common people, the more it will sow discord if those people are dissimilar. The Framers, however, believed they had created a government that would not encroach too far into the internal politics of the states—that the Constitution effectively limited the federal government to questions of truly national, not local, importance. The Anti‐​Federalists predicted that government would eventually jump the constitutional guardrails and assert local authority over a diverse and numerous people.



The Anti‐​Federalists were right. Those constitutional guardrails are almost non‐​existent and, insofar as they still exist, they are often based on tradition or maintained at the sufferance of the national government. The federal government, for example, merely tolerates marijuana use in states that have legalized it, the DOJ having instructed its officers to not generally enforce the national drug laws within those states.



If a President Chris Christie, however, decided to bring the full force of the federal government into the legalizing states, and to essentially override local governance, there would be no principled, constitutional reason he couldn’t. The only protection would be the unpopularity of such an action, which seems an awfully thin reed to rest our freedoms upon.



Regardless of your views on the proper size and scope of the government—whether the government should provide health care, prohibit drugs, guarantee education, create social safety nets, engage in environmental protection, or whatever—this situation should concern you. Americans are at war with each other, an increasingly primitive and tribal war, over fundamental questions that implicate our deepest values—which education plan we should have, which health‐​care plan we should have, and what drugs we’re allowed to ingest, just to name a few.



But why should Georgia and Massachusetts have the same health care, education, and drug laws? Many people in those states can hardly stand to be in the same room together, so why would we let them govern each other?



 **Congressional Majorities Don’t Authorize Dictatorships**



This problem is bipartisan. On April 23, 2006, President Bush signed the Student Protection and Affordable Education Act, better known as the AEA or just “Bushucation.” The law creates a school voucher program in every state, and, in so doing, seeks to make education better and more affordable through the introduction of market competition.



The law is incredibly complex. It mandates that states expand their education spending to fund a massive school voucher program or, if they choose not to, to lose all current federal education funding. There are extensive subsidies for families of lesser means, and states are required to set up “education marketplaces” where parents can trade their school vouchers and efficiently shop for the best education options.



Finally, it requires everyone to pay into a mandatory school voucher fund, even if those people don’t have or don’t plan to have children. Without a single Democrat vote, the Republicans pushed the law through.



I’m lying, of course. That law doesn’t exist as an education law signed by President Bush. It does exist, however, as a health‐​care law signed by President Obama. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as the Affordable Care Act or just “Obamacare.”



The law is incredibly complex. States were mandated to expand their Medicaid coverage or lose all current Medicaid funding (the Supreme Court struck this down). There are also extensive subsidies for those with lesser means. One essential part of the law’s structure was the so‐​called “individual mandate,” which required certain people who were not insured through their jobs or other programs to purchase health insurance.



Aside from the policy questions, arguably the most culturally significant thing about the ACA is that it is the most consequential national law ever passed without a single vote from the opposing party. In some sense, half the country imposed health‐​care policy on the other half. Of course, if George W. Bush could have done the same with an education law, perhaps Common Core, he might have imposed an education policy on half the country.



In the Affordable Care Act (and the hypothetical school vouchers law), the federal government once again used its “limited” powers how the Anti‐​Federalists predicted. Local, state‐​level control of health insurance was seen as a “clog upon the wheels,” in the words of Yates, to a great national plan. Moreover, an individual decision to not purchase health insurance was also seen as a “clog” that needed to be overridden.



Yes, the Democrats won the 2008 election and controlled Congress and the presidency, and some might argue that elections authorize majorities to rule over minorities. Yet, in a system of limited government, majorities aren’t dictatorships authorized to impose their unfettered will on the minority. Furthermore, even if something is allowed, it might still be unwise.



Such unfettered majoritarianism can be dangerous in a large and diverse country. As Cato warned, a country with the “immense extent of territory” as the United States, that contains people with a “dissimilitude of interest, morals, and politics,” should not be brought under one general government. Otherwise, we would have “a house divided against itself.”



That “house divided” can create real problems, and not just in terms of political backlash. Laws like the ACA don’t magically self-execute—rules need to be written, programs developed, and thousands of administrators and politicians around the country need to be involved in implementing them.



Furthermore, the ACA includes numerous provisions that necessitate state‐​level involvement. As much as Democrats would wish otherwise, some of those state‐​level politicians charged with implementing the law would be Republicans, and many of them resisted the law, just as many Democrat state officials would have resisted the hypothetical school voucher law. But partisan political division is a reality to be confronted, not an obstacle to be bulldozed. Major pieces of legislation require compromise, not ramming it down the throats of the opposition.



This is not to say that Republicans have done and would do the exact same. But this is where the lessons of the Anti‐​Federalists can be applied in the most salutary manner. If we stop trying to control each other in our local and personal matters, if 51 percent of the country stopped trying to impose its will on the 49 percent, then maybe we could get along better. To do that, however, we need to have a concerted and nonpartisan move toward localism.



 **We Need to Start Leaving Each Other Alone**



Let me ask the question again: Will a remote and distant government that wields a large amount of power over a vast land and a diverse people increasingly be seen as being unrepresentative of the people, and, in the process, sow discord between them? Yes.



We rightly revere our Constitution, but, apart from debates over how it should be interpreted, it is a “living document” in at least one sense: The attitudes of the people breathe life into its words, which carry no real force of their own. But the Anti‐​Federalists didn’t go away; their ideas still help animate the Constitution’s words, and their concerns have merged into ongoing the political conversation of the country.



The Anti‐​Federalists taught us valuable lessons about good government that have always been relevant and will never go away. Yet it seems there is something different about this election. Two of the most unpopular major‐​party candidates in history are vying for our votes. Given that a majority of Americans dislike both, whoever wins, most of us will be unhappy.



Yet, at his or her respective victory party, the victor will still claim that “the people have spoken.” When he or she sits down in the Oval Office, the new president will feel emboldened by “a mandate from the people,” even though more than half of his or her fellow citizens find this president unacceptable.



Nevertheless, he or she will take that sense of purpose into the most powerful office on the planet—as the head of the most powerful organization in the history of humankind—and will start pulling levers and flipping switches that will drastically affect the daily lives of Americans, for good or for ill. In four years, will we have overcome our malaise? Will this be seen as a bout of temporary insanity? For reasons that the Anti‐​Federalists first articulated, I think not.



Good government is not just about the question “What should be done?” It’s also about the question “What can we do together, cooperatively rather than combatively?” We are stronger together, yes, but someday soon the only way we can continue living together might be by leaving each other alone.

Despite our geographical and cultural proximity, it’s always instructive to realise just how little most Australians really know about New Zealand politics. I must include myself in this: prior to becoming part of the _BFD_ family, I knew barely anything beyond the names of a few prime ministers and that there was some bloke called **Winston Peters** who seemed to grab a lot of headlines. 



Even those Australians whom it might be thought have a professional obligation to cultivate an in-depth understanding of New Zealand politics often seem to have a curious facile grasp. But, while _The Project_ ’s fawning over **Jacinda Ardern** was uninformed and nauseating, even the supposedly conservative newspaper of record, _The Australian_ , looks across the Tasman through a rose-tinted Telescope of Superficiality. Nowhere is this better shown than by its analysis of what it supposes are the key issues in New Zealand’s forthcoming election.



In Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand has a modern, likeable, capable prime minister. Her effort to soothe a hurting nation following the March 15 terrorist attack was authentic and appreciated by the nation […]The alternative prime minister, **Simon Bridges** , regularly paints Ardern as a ditherer, as all compassion and no action, and incapable of landing major policies. So far it isn’t working…



While the above is mostly accurate, insofar as it goes, it almost completely ignores the most glaring issue: not Ardern, but Bridges himself. Ardern is a paper princess: the slightest puff of wind from a determined opposition leader with an ounce of political mongrel would see her vanish in a puff of fairy dust. But Bridges is neither.



 **Julia Gillard** was as beloved by the media-elite class as Ardern, but **Tony Abbott** ruthlessly demolished her prime ministership.



National’s most effective line of attack on Labour has been on infrastructure. Ardern’s government has abandoned a pledge to build 100,000 homes in 10 years – known as Kiwbuild – after falling embarrassingly short of targets. Roads and transport links, particularly in Auckland, fall well below expectations […] Labour’s counter, a trite “nine years of neglect” referring to the previous government, doesn’t bite, but a $NZ12 billion ($A11.6 billion) infrastructure announcement in January aims to address this.



Again, while kinda-sorta correct, this fails to convey **just how embarrassingly bad Labour in government have been**. Kiwibuild was not just “embarrassing”, it was farcical. Auckland’s roads are choked car-parks. Labour’s performance has been so abysmal that even the starry-eyed legacy media couldn’t avoid pointing out the lie of Ardern’s[ “Year of Delivery”](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/jacindas-year-of-delivery/). Does anyone seriously believe that the new infrastructure announcement will be any different?



Fiscally and economically, New Zealand is in rude health […] but many Kiwis are being left behind […]The government has tinkered with family support and tax settings rather than increasing welfare despite calls to do so.



As with infrastructure, this completely ignores just how big an issue this is – or at least, should be – for Labour, and Ardern especially. **Ardern owns this problem: she specifically appointed herself “Minister for Child Poverty Reduction”. She has conspicuously failed.** There is simply no excuse for the media, even in Australia, not to take notice and hang that millstone around her neck for all to see.



At least _The Australian_ is informed enough to mention Winston Peters. Most Australian media barely even seem to know that he exists, let alone what he could mean to the election.



Peters loves to take centrestage and antagonise […] But polling isn’t good for Peters’ populists; they need to poll above five per cent to retain their numbers in parliament and they are skirting dangerously close to that figure. So expect some vintage Winston this year.



Now we come to the truly ridiculous, though:



The level-headedness of New Zealand’s climate politics is quite apart from Australia.



Clearly, this journalist has never paid attention to the witterings of Ardern, or the shrill hysterics of her coalition partners, the Greens.



This analysis also completely ignores what will surely be an issue for many New Zealanders: the gun buyback and its [associated failures](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/breaking-the-raids-have-begun-all-for-a-22-bunny-gun/) of police, government and the rule of law.

"**The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated.**
The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray.
Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusations in a tweet.
But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians.
Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago.
But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated.
Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead.
On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz.
The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region.
On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet.
Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days.
The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there.
On Sunday, in a tweet, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"".
But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true.
**By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor**
With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region.
But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki.
Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead.
International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan.
Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp."
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"**Hong Kong's legislature has formally withdrawn a controversial extradition bill that has sparked months of unrest.**
The bill - which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China - prompted outrage when it was introduced in April.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the bill was eventually suspended.
But protesters have continued regular demonstrations, which spiralled into a wider pro-democracy movement.
It is the worst crisis for Hong Kong since the former British colony was handed back to China in 1997.
It has also presented a serious challenge to China's leaders in Beijing, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them.
The proposed bill would have allowed for Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to places it does not have an extradition treaty with, including mainland China, Taiwan and Macau.
Critics of the planned law had feared extradition to mainland China could subject people to arbitrary detention and unfair trials.
The bill's formal withdrawal meets only one of five key demands emphasised by some protesters, who have often chanted ""five demands, not one less"" in Hong Kong's streets.
The others are:
Connie, a 27-year-old protester, told Reuters news agency the move was ""too little, too late"".
""There are still other demands the government needs to meet, especially the problem of police brutality,"" she said.
Carrie Lam, the embattled Hong Kong leader, has insisted that other demands by protesters are outside her control.
The protests - which began peacefully - now often descend into violent running battles between Hong Kong police and hardcore demonstrators who have vandalised shops and hurled petrol bombs at security forces.
Police have used water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets in response. Live rounds have been fired on a few occasions, and an 18-year-old was shot by police in the chest on 1 October.
The Financial Times newspaper reports that China's government is drawing up plans to remove Ms Lam, a figure loathed by protesters whom Beijing has thus far stood by.
If Chinese President Xi Jinping approves the plan, the paper says, she will be replaced by an interim chief executive after calm returns to Hong Kong.
Ms Lam's office told the BBC: ""We do not comment on speculation."" China's foreign ministry said the FT report was ""a political rumour with ulterior motives"".
Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong released the murder suspect whose case led to the extradition bill in the first place.
Chan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law."

In response to the _Orlando Sentinel’s_ investigative reporting that many private schools participating in the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program have “anti‐​LGBTQ” policies, some lawmakers have been actively using social media to attack companies that donate money to fund private school scholarships for low‐​income students in the state. Two lawmakers are even congratulating companies for pulling scholarship funding from these disadvantaged families because, according to State Rep. Anna Eskamani, the private school choice program is a “discriminatory anti‐​LGBTQ voucher program.”



Her statement is incorrect, and her efforts are unintentionally hurting the very children she is claiming to help. First, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program awards scholarships to students regardless of their sexual orientation. Families can use those scholarship dollars to attend a wide array of religious or nonreligious private schools in the state. Calling the program “discriminatory” and “anti‐​LGBTQ” is disingenuous.



Taking away educational options from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students is nothing to celebrate.



The school choice program currently serves over 100,000 disadvantaged students in the state. Of those students, 100% are from low‐​income families, and about 70% of those students are African American or Hispanic. The average student lives in a household earning just $26,578 each year.



Thus, these lawmakers are literally congratulating corporations for taking scholarship funding away from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students. Democratic State Rep. Shevrin Jones, a former public school teacher, understands these implications. “Ripping scholarship funding out from underneath thousands of economically vulnerable students whose only chance at a safe environment and solid education is not the answer,” Jones said.



Taking away educational options from low‐​income families does not help anyone. Yes, some schools chosen by families using scholarships in this program are religious and have policies against gay and transgender lifestyles. We do not personally agree with those policies. However, it is their right to religious freedom to do so, and it is the right of families using the scholarships to avoid those schools if they do not agree with their policies.



But possibly the worst way to be critical of those anti‐​gay and transgender policies is to defund the scholarship program. That has very little effect on schools with the policies while doing a great deal of harm to the disadvantaged students in need of those scholarships.



Defunding the program also means fewer scholarships for gay and transgender students. A 2017 analysis of school climates conducted by the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network found that “private non‐​religious schools were more positive environments for LGBTQ youth than public or religious schools.” Cutting gay and transgender student access to choice scholarships prevents them from finding a more positive environment. Those advocating for defunding the scholarship program will arguably harm the very students they are claiming to help — students such as Elijah Robinson, who recently said, “If I would have stayed at my previous school, I honestly would have lost my life.” Elijah obviously benefits from using the school choice program in Florida.



The choice program is not “anti‐​LGBTQ.” Taking scholarships away from gay and transgender students is anti‐​LGBTQ.



Critics like Eskamani and some journalists also adamantly refer to the scholarships as “public dollars.” That’s not true either. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that tax credit scholarships are private dollars because private funding does not become public funding until it has “come into the tax collector’s hands.” Furthermore, the Florida courts most recently ruled that “tax credits offered under the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program involve no public funds.”



Corporations are obviously free to do what they want with their own private dollars. But the misinformation and attacks on the scholarship program should stop. One company, Fifth Third Bank, had withdrawn its funding from the scholarship program in response to critics but decided just one week later to resume funding after getting a more complete picture. Others should follow its lead.



After all, taking away educational options from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students is nothing to celebrate.

"As a businessman, Donald J. Trump was a serial fabulist whose   boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny. As a candidate, Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic: “Believe me. ” Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office. “We’ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes, where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of “935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity,” a book about presidential deception. It was not just Mr. Trump’s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration, or his insistence (contradicted by his own Twitter posts) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community, or his audacious and   claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally. All week long, news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another. PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 “of the most misleading claims” Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city’s murder rate was “terribly increasing. ” (The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade.) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office. But for students of Mr. Trump’s long business career, there was much about President Trump’s   ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable “beliefs. ” Mr. Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for   insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his   image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his   book “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of “truthful hyperbole,” which he described as “an innocent form of exaggeration  —   and a very effective form of promotion. ” It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was “a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy” in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s “alternative facts” on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s “1984,” in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. ” “In a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,” Mr. Schmidt said. “All authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state. ” Mr. Lewis argued that the president’s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation’s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. “  becomes an act of war by the media,” he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C. I. A. employees that he had “a running war with the media” and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth. ” The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to “delegitimize” the new president and promised, “We are not going to sit around and let it happen. ” By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as “the opposition party” during an interview with The New York Times. “It feels like this was part of the plan all along,” Mr. Lewis said. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer   historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s brazen willingness to deny “objective reality” had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. “I don’t know that he is doing it strategically,” she said, “but it certainly had the impact of a magician’s sleight of hand. ” Deception, dissembling, exaggeration  —   what Fortune magazine called his “astonishing ability to prevaricate”  —   has deep roots in Mr. Trump’s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to   contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had “handpicked” each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however,   operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than   of the claims were “mostly false,” “false” or, in 62 cases, “Pants on Fire” false. “Trump is a different kind of figure than we’ve ever seen before in our 10 years of ” Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. “No one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods. ” Mr. Trump’s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. “There’s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,” Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president’s behavior as “strange” or “worrisome,” he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump’s first interview as president, David Muir of ABC News asked, “Do you think that your words matter more now?” “Yes, very much,” Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, “Do you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?” “No, not at all,” he replied. “Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do. ” As if to prove the point, Mr. Trump then doubled down on his lie about millions of illegal votes. “Believe me, those were Hillary votes,” he said. “And if you look at it, they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn’t vote for me. ” For Ms. Goodwin, Mr. Trump’s week of reality distortions brought to mind Lincoln’s address to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Ill. on Jan. 27, 1838, where he made an appeal to Enlightenment values as the best antidote to what he called the “mobocratic spirit. ” “Reason  —   cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason  —   must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense,” he said. “He was worrying about authoritarian behavior,” Ms. Goodwin said."
"

I’d like to thank the members of the subcommittee on energy research, development, production, and regulation and the subcommittee on national economic growth, natural resources and regulatory affairs for the opportunity to testify today on the administration’s compliance with statutory requirements relating to their budget requests to address global climate change.



My remarks today will examine the administration’s compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 as it relates to global climate change programs in this year’s budget request, primarily the budget requests of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In sum, I believe that the administration is not in compliance with the stipulations of that Act. In particular:



 **Introduction to the GPRA**



The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 directs federal agencies to offer “objective, quantifiable, and measurable” goals for each of their appropriation accounts during the budget process. It was enacted to “systematically hold federal agencies accountable for achieving program results.” The Act is ambitious. It attempts to promote, when possible, real‐​time budget accountability that the public can grasp. As The National Journal explains, the GPRA requires “specific performance measurers [such] as increasing the lead time on tornado warnings from 8 minutes in 1994 to 11 minutes in 1997, with accuracy growing from 53 to 66 percent.”



In sum, the GPRA demands that performance measures be specific, quantifiable, measurable, and directly connected when possible to the well being of the American people. As President Clinton remarked when he signed the Act into law, we need to ask:



“Does this work? Is it changing people’s lives for the better? Can we say after we take money and put it into a certain endeavor that it was worth actually [taking] away from the taxpayers [and putting] into this endeavor and [that] their lives are better [sic]? These may seem like simple questions, but for decades they haven’t been answered in a very satisfactory way. We are determined to do that.1



 **Federal Climate Change Expenditures and Performance Metrics**



Rather than provide performance and results measures for each appropriations account, the administration in its April 20, 1999 report to Congress offers performance and results metrics on a program‐​by‐​program basis. This makes it difficult to examine the performance metric for any specific appropriations account given that each appropriations account is typically involved in a myriad of programs. Accountability thus suffers and outside analysts are largely unable to zero‐​in on specific budgetary successes and failures. This alone should be a red flag to lawmakers that something is amiss.



That having been said, the administration chooses to organize its activities to address global climate change in four major programs: the Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI); the U.S. Global Change Research Program; International Assistance programs; and other more tangentially climate‐​related programs. I briefly discuss the three DOE-EPA related program elements below.



 _Climate Change Technology Initiative_



The CCTI is made up of an amalgamation of tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D, labeling and public awareness programs, demonstration projects, industry subsidies, and regulatory programs to mandate tighter energy efficiency standards for appliances and machine equipment. Five separate cabinet departments and over a dozen appropriation accounts are involved in the CCTI.2



Instead of providing performance and results measures for each of the appropriations accounts engaged in the CCTI, the administration provides performance and results measures for each industrial sector targeted by the CCTI. The administration primarily suggests that increases in energy efficiency will be the main program output of the CCTI. It then calculates how many tons of carbon emissions will be saved by this increased efficiency.



According to the administration, the EPA’s activities will reduce energy consumption by approximately 59 billion‐​kilowatt hours and thereby reduce greenhouse gases by 58 million metric tons of carbon equivalent next year. By 2010, the administration suggests that those programs will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 354 million metric tons of carbon equivalent. Likewise, the administration believes that DOE’s activities will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 112 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by the year 2010.



 _U.S. Global Change Research Program_



The U.S. Global Change Research Program involves six separate cabinet departments (the Department of Health and Human Services, DOE, USDA, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and EPA) and three agencies (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution). Virtually no concrete performance or result measures are provided by the administration for the various activities of this program, much less for the various appropriation accounts of the DOE (biological and environmental research) or the EPA (general science and technology work).



 _Other Climate‐​Related Programs_



The DOE and EPA are engaged in a host of disparate programs that the administration considers related to global climate change. DOE programs include the Weatherization Assistance Program (which subsidizes energy efficiency investment for low income households) and general R&D directed to coal, natural gas, and nuclear technologies, and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. EPA programs include the Clean Air Partnership Fund. Myriad appropriation accounts are involved from both agencies, yet no concrete performance or result measures are provided by the administration for the various activities of this program, much less for the various appropriation accounts of the DOE or the EPA.



 **Inappropriate Performance and Results Measures**



There are so many problems with the performance and results measures offered by both the DOE and EPA that it’s difficult to know where to begin. I will start with the smaller problems first.



 _No Third‐​Party Verification is Possible_



Congress will find it impossible to ascertain whether the administration’s performance goals have been met because both the DOE and EPA rely heavily upon conjecture, assertions, and theoretical — not actual — measurements of performance.



First, the administration relies upon engineering calculations to estimate energy savings for the technologies it claims responsibility for in the marketplace. The actual performance of technologies is unexamined. Numerous studies at the state and local level demonstrate that engineering calculations are wildly inaccurate predictors of the performance of technologies.3 Indeed, they typically overestimate energy savings by a large degree.



Second, DOE and EPA programs implicitly assume that, were it not for those programs, the worthy technologies being subsidized would not attract enough research, development, or marketing dollars to penetrate the marketplace. In other words, both departments take full responsibility and credit for the technologies being promoted. This, of course, ignores the possibility that “free riders” are being attracted to the programs (it’s certainly possible that some of the technologies in question would have been produced by the market without government help; perhaps immediately, perhaps only a few years down the road), or that the federal assistance perhaps contributed only at the margin and thus is due only a small part of the credit and not the full degree of credit sought by the DOE and EPA. In fact, when the U.S. General Accounting Office reviewed a recent document by the DOE regarding its R&D success stories, it found that such faulty assumptions destroyed the credibility of DOE cost benefit analyses.4



The Energy Information Administration recognizes the difficulty of connecting government R&D subsidies to concrete performance goals. In testimony last month, EIA administrator Jay Hakes frankly conceded that “we are not able to link research and development expenditures directly to program results or to separate impacts of incremental funding requested for FY 2000 from ongoing government expenditures.“5 Likewise, Hakes noted that “it is also difficult to analyze the impacts of information programs, voluntary initiatives, and partnerships on realized technology development and deployment.“6



Thus, Congress will find it impossible to verify whether most CCTI programs actually achieved the goals laid out by the administration.



 _Flawed Cost‐​Benefit Analysis_



While the GPRA does not require cost‐​benefit analysis for appropriation accounts, the administration frequently offers benefit estimates for the various programs of the CCTI. Typical is the administration’s claim that a 20 percent tax credit to encourage the purchase of residential electric heat pumps and air conditioners will benefit the economy by encouraging investments that will ultimately save consumers billions of dollars in energy costs.



The claim is misleading because it is divorced from any discussion of the investment required to obtain those energy savings. For instance, the EIA estimates that the cost of a current model heat pump is $4,400 while the cost of a model that would qualify for the tax credit is $5,500 (the 20 percent tax credit would, conveniently enough, cover the differential in cost). EIA data suggests that the energy‐​efficient heat pump will save an average of 1,676 kWh per year on average. Assuming a 10 percent discount rate, electricity prices of 8.3 cents per kWh, and an 11‐​year operating life for the heat pump, the consumer will save a total of $783 in energy costs.7 At the very least, spending $1,100 to save $783 hardly represents a net plus for the economy. The calculation also indicates that “market barriers” are not necessarily the primary obstacles faced by many energy efficient technologies; high cost is.



A calculation of consumer benefit would require a consideration of total costs: in this case, $1,100 times the total number of rebates provided plus management expenses that would probably add another 10–15 percent. The total consumer benefit from purchasing the more efficient heat pump would require a calculation of the total willingness to pay minus actual payments. Once we consider the fact that a number of participants are likely to be “free riders” (households that would have purchased the technology even without the rebate), it’s likely that the benefit to consumers who otherwise would not have purchased the heat pump save for the tax credit will be one‐​half the cost or less.



For the purposes of the CCTI, however, a cost‐​benefit test requires us to consider the cost of the program in relation to the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved. In this case, dividing the cost of the tax credit ($1,100) by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided through more efficient energy use results in a total cost of $349 per ton. With a 10 percent discount rate, the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions via the tax credit rises to $666 per ton.8



Since no credible economist would support a carbon tax of $666 per ton to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (most proposals range from $5–50 per ton), why should the Congress accept a program that levies an implicit tax that they wouldn’t be caught dead advocating explicitly?



Contrast the above calculation with the administration’s argument that for every tax dollar invested in the CCTI, $70 dollars of economic benefits will result (if such figures were actually seriously believed, one could make a pretty strong argument that ALL discretionary federal spending should be plowed into the CCTI). If the administration is determined to argue the economic merits of the CCTI, it appears that a refresher course in Econ 101 would be in order.



 _Programs Aim at Solving Problems that do not Exist_



Underlying the CCTI is the belief that market barriers — such as lack of information, shortage of investment capital, and inexplicably negative consumers biases against energy efficiency investments — prevent the market place from investing optimally in the technologies peddled by the two departments. The administration’s heavy reliance on product labeling, demonstration projects, public awareness, and subsidized research, development, and marketing is largely designed to overcome those market barriers. DOE and EPA’s energy efficiency performance goals will only succeed if those market barriers truly exist. Otherwise, consumers will continue to reject those technologies.



Economists, however, are deeply skeptical about the underlying assumptions of the CCTI.9 First, market barriers do not necessarily contribute to economic inefficiency or sub‐​optimal investment. As economist Ronald Sutherland explains, “A fallacy in the conservation paradigm is the presumption that market barriers produce inefficient outcomes that justify government policy. So‐​called market barriers may not be sources of inefficiency, but rather are benign characteristics of well functioning markets.“10



Second, studies of consumer behavior involving home heating and cooling find that the implicit rates of return used by consumers in making energy conservation investment decisions are consistent with returns available on other investments.11



Third, the variance in energy prices over time creates uncertainty about the return on energy conservation investments. Because such investments are irreversible and much more illiquid than other investments, consumers rationally demand high returns on home conservation investments to compensate for the uncertainty that they face.12



Fourth, the estimates of alleged energy savings that consumers pass up are based on engineering estimates rather than actual changes in use. A study based on changes in actual use of electricity, rather than engineering estimates, concluded that consumers actually choose conservation investments rationally in light of the cost of capital and the returns on alternative investments.13



Think of the CCTI as being made up of a bunch of economic “carrots.” If the rabbits (consumers) cannot be induced by the “carrots” to purchase favored technologies, then the programs will largely fail. Since the administration’s “carrots” are designed to remedy problems that don’t exist, its unlikely that the technologies will gain enough consumer acceptance to make much difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.



 _Performance Measures Are Implausible on Their Face_



The EPA estimates that its programs will reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 354 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by 2010.14 DOE estimates that its programs will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by another 112 million metric tons of carbon equivalent,15 yielding an estimated reduction of 452 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Those performance measures are so unrealistic that they cast doubt on the seriousness of the administration’s attempts to comply with the GPRA.



To put this in perspective, the DOE’s own “5‐​Labs” study estimates that a “high efficiency” scenario for the economy would reduce emissions by only 120 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by 2010. The EIA is less bold, suggesting that reductions of only 79 million metric tons of carbon equivalent are possible under a “high efficiency” economic scenario.



The fundamental explanation for the administration’s wildly inflated program estimates is two‐​fold. First, the administration overestimates the potential for government directed R&D, marketing, and technology deployment to improve economic performance. Second, it engages in unrealistic projections about the speed with which new technologies can migrate into the marketplace.



As to the former, the DOE and EPA evince the mind‐​set of those entering into a second marriage: the triumph of hope over experience. Numerous third‐​party examinations of the history of government technology‐​forcing programs conclude that programs such as the CCTI have failed miserably over the past 30 years.16 Typical is the assessment by M.I.T.‘s Thomas Lee, Ben Ball, Jr., and Richard Tabors: “the experience of the 1970s and 1980s taught us that if a technology is commercially viable, then government support is not needed; and if a technology is not commercially viable, no amount of government support will make it so” [emphasis in original].17



As to the latter, we need to remember that the potential for new energy‐​efficient technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — especially within a decade — is limited because new technologies are only incremental additions to the capital stock, capital stock turns over slowly, and total capital stock increases with economic growth. Thus, even if the administration is correct about the benefits of their technology investments and promotional activities, there is only so much that those technologies can accomplish in the short or mid term.



The above problems are so severe that when the Energy Information Administration ran the administration’s tax credit proposal through its computer models, it found that rebates proposed in the CCTI would reduce energy consumption by less than 0.1 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 0.17 percent by 2010, figures far less than the performance measures offered by the administration.18



Moreover, when the President’s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) produced a plan to comply with the Kyoto Protocol at the lowest possible economic cost, they ignored the claims peddled by the DOE and EPA regarding the potential for the CCTI to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The CEA report instead relied upon a liberal emissions trading program to reduce greenhouse gases and made no mention of the CCTI’s ability to contribute to Kyoto compliance.19 If the DOE and EPA claims of program savings could not persuade the administration’s own economists to include them in its main planning document, they should probably not be taken seriously by Congress.



 _Energy Efficiency May Hinder Carbon Efficiency_



Another fundamental problem with the CCTI its focus on energy efficiency rather than carbon efficiency. For instance, if electricity were generated largely by natural gas and nuclear power, it would make little difference how efficient our end‐​use technologies were; greenhouse gas emissions would be minimal either way. In fact, the president’s Council of Economic Advisors relies upon the elimination of the domestic coal industry and the accelerated emergence of natural gas fired electricity to meet the standards of the Kyoto Protocol.20 Correspondingly, if electricity were generated largely by coal, all the increased efficiency in the world would do little to control total greenhouse gas emissions.



Consider, for instance, advanced water heaters. Among the most efficient water heaters on the market are electric heat pumps with an “energy factor” of 1.65. The most efficient gas water heaters, however, have an “energy factor” of only .54. Under the administration’s plan, the electric heat pump would qualify for a 20 percent tax credit and would be aggressively promoted to consumers by the government. According to the DOE’s own data, however, the electric heat pump would generate 4,872 pounds of carbon dioxide a year compared to 3,862 pounds of carbon dioxide generated by the natural gas heater.21



The reason is simple. Approximately 70 percent of the total energy consumed by an appliance is actually consumed in the production, generation, transmission, and distribution of energy. Since more electricity is generated from coal than any other fuel source, the “energy efficient” electric heat pump would be inferior — from a greenhouse gas emissions standpoint — than the less efficient natural gas heat pump.



 _Energy Efficiency Improvements Do Not Necessarily = Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions_



Aside from the difficulty in reconciling energy efficiency with carbon efficiency, the suggestion that increased energy efficiency as a program output will lead to energy consumption as an intermediate outcome is questionable. The reason is that energy efficiency reduces the marginal cost of consuming energy. If the marginal cost of energy goes down, energy consumption at the margin will increase. The increased energy consumption that results will offset some if not all the gains achieved by enhanced energy efficiency.



For example, assume that DOE helps develop and market an incredibly energy efficient air conditioner. The upshot for the residential consumers is that they will be able to substantially reduce the cost of keeping their homes at 75 degrees in the summertime. Perhaps, however, they are most comfortable if indoor temperatures are 70 degrees. They might not have been able to afford to keep the thermostat down that low in the past, but thanks to DOE’s new air conditioner, now they can. So the thermostat is lowered, energy consumption increases, and the greenhouse gas emissions go back up.



Economists who have studied the phenomenon of energy efficiency and increased energy consumption (sometimes known as the “snap‐​back effect”) have documented the relationship.22 We can also see it by examining macroeconomic data. According to the EIA, energy efficiency (measured as total energy consumption per unit of GDP) improved by 57 percent from 1949–1997. Yet total energy consumption increased by 323 percent over that same period. Population growth, economic growth, and yes, the “snap‐​back” effect are the main reasons for the lack of correlation between energy efficiency and energy consumption.



 _No Outcome Measurements of Success Offered_



Finally, the administration failed to comply with the spirit of the GPRA by refusing to directly connect the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the well being of the American people. Recall President Clinton’s desire to ask of his budget, “Is it changing people’s lives for the better? Can we say after we take money and put it into a certain endeavor that it was worth actually [taking] away from the taxpayers [and putting] into this endeavor and [that] their lives are better [sic]?” In the case of the CCTI, there are two appropriate questions to ask. First, how much global warming will be abated by these programs? Second, how will the American public then benefit from the alleviation of global warming?



In a spirit of generosity, I will attempt to do the administration’s homework for them. For the sake of argument, assume my critique of the program is incorrect and the administration’s claims can be taken at face value. Assume, therefore, that the CCTI meets all the performance measures and results offered by the administration.



If every nation meets its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, the world’s most advanced climate model predicts that temperatures will be 0.07 degrees Celsius cooler than they otherwise would be under a business as usual scenario by the year 2050.23 Since the U.S. emits 20 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, we can infer that U.S. compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would reduce global temperatures by 0.014 degrees Celsius.24 According to the DOE and EPA, their contribution to the CCTI will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 452 million metric tons of carbon equivalent annually by 2010 (the midpoint of the Kyoto compliance period). That means that about 65 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions required of the United States under the Kyoto Protocol can be met through the budgetary programs we’re discussing today, implying that the CCTI will reduce temperatures by .0091 degrees Celsius (16–1,000ths of a degree Fahrenheit) below where they otherwise would be by the year 2050.



Such a change in temperature is too small to measure. Moreover, I defy the administration to argue that this infinitesimal reduction in temperature will affect the lives of the American people one whit.



 **Conclusion**



The importance of stepping back from the GPRA budgetary “trees” to appreciate the policy “forest” was perhaps best articulated by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous description of the intellectual opportunity costs of examinations such as ours today:



The administration of political affairs itself becomes in time so full of complications that it requires an incredible number of persons to devote their time to its supervision, in order that it may not fall into utter confusion. Now, by far the greater portion of these have to deal with the mere symbols and formulas of things; and thus, not only are men of first‐​rate capacity withdrawn from anything which gives scope to thinking, and useful hands are diverted from real work, but their intellectual powers themselves suffer from this partly empty, partly narrow employment.25



There are serious doubts about whether the administration has complied with the GPRA in its budgetary request for its global climate change programs. But more importantly, there is no doubt that the performance and measurement yardsticks presented by the administration are so dubious and disconnected from reality that they discredit the programs themselves. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooking at the English-language media, one might be led to think that the latest CERN experimental results show that trees alone dominate cloud formation, by supplying the necessary cloud seeding medium. Little reference is made to cosmic rays acting as the cloud formation modulator, initiating the cloud seeding process, as hypothesized by Henrik Svensmark.
Lubos Motl at the Reference Frame noted that factions of the mainstream media seem to have spun the recent CERN papers in a “bizarre” way.

Climate models way off target. CERN’s latest CLOUD experiment results further underpin Svensmark’s cosmic ray-climate theory. Image: Maximillien Brice/CERN
German press reports cite cosmic rays
Yet looking at the reporting by German-language scientific media, one finds plenty of mention of cosmic rays as a major player in cloud formation, which has a large cooling effect on our climate, and that erosols have been grossly misweighted in the recent climate models.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt here write that the latest CERN results confirm what they claimed already in their 2012 book: The Neglected Sun. Today they write:
Already one year ago, in April 2015, scientists warned that the cooling effect by aerosols had been exaggerated (see our blog article “Director of the Hamburg Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology: Aerosols cool less than previously assumed“). This appears to have been confirmed further. Within the scope of the CLOUD Project at CERN, scientists have found more indications that the aerosol effect in the models must corrected strongly downwards.”
Scinexx.de here writes that trees earlier “provided the means for lots of clouds before industrialization” and that “man obviously has influenced cloud formation [Industrialization] less than previously thought.”
So if it wasn’t human emitted particles seeding clouds before industry; and causing cooling like in the mid 20th, what could it have been? The answer according to CERN is “organic vapours emitted by trees that produce lots of aerosol particles in the atmosphere when there’s no sulphuric acid.”
How does the cloud seeding by organic tree particles work? Through nucleation-inducing cosmic rays.

Cosmic rays as the amplifier
Scienxx.de writes that scientists used the CLOUD experiment to discover this in a controlled environment and so “determine how strongly certain components in the air or certain molecules contribute to cloud formation” and “how strongly these are amplified by the energy influx through cosmic rays.”
Adding:
Although the product of alpha pines occurred only in concentrations of one molecule per one trillion air molecules, they effectively contributed to cloud formation as the experiment showed. Through the influence of ions from cosmic rays, the effect increases even 10 to 100 times.”
That means cloud cover (and so cooling) would be the likely result in conditions of high cosmic ray influx into the lower atmosphere, as is the case during periods of low solar activity. Thus it appears Svensmark’s theory strengthens further.
Germany’s online wissenschaft-aktuell.de also points out the essential role of cosmic rays.
In the artificial atmosphere, scientists directed a beam of positively charged particles, so-called pions, which were generated by a Proton-Synchrotron. With this they simulated the effect of cosmic rays, which are constantly penetrating into the atmosphere. This stream of particles caused the organic molecules to ball up into approximately 2-nanometer size particles. More measurements confirmed that these volatile organic compounds grew further to form efficient condensation nuclei. In parallel the scientists underpinned the mechanism with computer models. ‘These results for me are the most important so far that the CLOUD experiment yielded so far,’ said Kirkby.”

The online Austrian science.orf.at here tells us more of the same: cosmic rays are at very much at play:
The experiment also showed that the nucleation rate rose by one or two orders of magnitude under the influence of cosmic rays. ‘This allows one to conclude that cosmic rays had a greater role on aerosols and cloud formation in preindustrial times than under today’s relatively dirty conditions,” said Paul Winkler of the Department of Aerosol Physics and Environmental Physics at the University of Vienna.”
In their press releases the government-paid scientists can add the mandatory “the-warming-continues” remarks all they want, but one thing is clear: The models have a long way to go and they are in dire need of major revamping. CO2 is nowhere near as important as some want us to believe it is. Cosmic rays, modeulated by the sun’s magnetic field, are together a factor that need to be accounted for.
It’s time for the habitual solar-denying so-called “experts” to acknowledge this and to start modelling much more accurately. We’ve known this for years already.

The 2010s have been the best decade ever. The evidence is overwhelming. Start with the United Nations Development Report. Framed as a warning about inequality, it plays down the good news: “The gap in basic living standards is narrowing, with an unprecedented number of people in the world escaping poverty, hunger and disease.”



The World Bank reports that the world‐​wide rate of extreme poverty fell more than half, from 18.2% to 8.6%, between 2008 and 2018. Last year the World Data Lab calculated that for the first time, more than half the world’s population can be considered “middle class.”



Health progress has been remarkable. People have better access to water, sanitation, health care and vaccines than ever. The incidence of malaria in Africa declined almost 60% from 2007 to 2017, and antiretroviral therapy reduced HIV/AIDS deaths more than half.



Tin‐​pot strongmen, looting politicians and punctilious bureaucrats make mischief with societies and economies. But mankind creates faster than they can squander, and repairs more than they can destroy.



Global life expectancy increased by more than three years in the past 10 years, mostly thanks to prevention of childhood deaths. According to the U.N., the global mortality rate for children under 5 declined from 5.6% in 2008 to 3.9% in 2018. A longer perspective shows how far we’ve come. Since 1950, Chad has reduced the child mortality rate by 56%, and it’s the _worst‐_ performing country in the world. South Korea reduced it by 98%.



Hasn’t this all come at the cost of a despoiled environment? No. At a certain point developed countries start polluting less. Death rates from air pollution declined by almost a fifth world‐​wide and a quarter in China between 2007 and 2017, according to the online publication Our World in Data.



Rich countries use less aluminum, nickel, copper, steel, stone, cement, sand, wood, paper, fertilizer, water, crop acreage and fossil fuel every year, as Andrew McAfee documents in “More From Less.” Consumption of 66 out of 72 resources tracked by the U.S. Geological Survey is now declining.



Global warming remains a challenge, but wealthy societies are well‐​positioned to develop clean technologies and to deal with the problems of a changing climate. Annual deaths from climate‐​related disasters declined by one‐​third between 2000-09 and 2010–15, to 0.35 per 100,000 people, according to the International Database of Disasters—a 95% reduction since the 1960s. That’s not because of fewer disasters, but better capabilities to deal with them.



Progress isn’t guaranteed. Look how wealthy Venezuela collapsed under the burden of crazy policies. A war between major powers, or a financial crash after a decade of easy money, could throw the world off course. So could never‐​ending trade wars and an unraveling of globalization.



Yet we’ve lived through a period of populist revolts and geopolitical tensions, and wherever societies have been open and markets free, scientists, innovators and businesses persisted and made greater progress than ever.



That’s the case for optimism. Tin‐​pot strongmen, looting politicians and punctilious bureaucrats make mischief with societies and economies. But mankind creates faster than they can squander, and repairs more than they can destroy.

[ **Samuel Alexander**](https://theconversation.com/profiles/samuel-alexander-102353), [University of Melbourne](https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-melbourne-722)



The reasons for choosing to go tiny range from reducing debt, inability to afford a conventional home, the search for sustainability, a life crisis, or even [preparing for an uncertain future](https://theconversation.com/architecture-of-doom-diy-planning-for-global-catastrophe-31836) in the face of climate change by going off-grid. Or perhaps a combination of these.



An important first step is to decide what type of tiny house you want. To many, the phrase “tiny house” brings to mind an archetypal tiny house on wheels, a miniature cottage on a trailer, often made of wood, with a pitched roof and dormer windows. 



Indeed, most tiny housers prefer some degree of mobility, whether a ready-made or DIY tiny house, converted caravan or bus/van. A survey by the [Australian Tiny House Association](https://australiantinyhouseassociation.org.au/) found most (78% of 109 respondents) lived in tiny houses on wheels, but a small but growing proportion live in converted caravans, vans or buses. 



First you need to evaluate your motives, which may differ according to your situation or stage of life. The most important question here is, how often do you want to move? 



Do you want to be ultra-mobile, and live like a digital nomad, perhaps in a “stealth van” in the city, changing parking spaces every night? Or do you want to travel around Australia like a “grey nomad”, staying in caravan parks or roadside camps for a week or so before moving on? 



Alternatively, do you want to be more settled, perhaps moving occasionally, to be closer to work, medical facilities or schools for children? (Yes, some tiny housers have children). Or do you want to travel between the houses of adult children or do petsitting, staying from weeks to months? 



Many off-the-shelf caravans are extremely well designed and are accepted everywhere, at caravan parks or roadside parking areas. On the other hand, a tiny house on wheels is less mobile, and not suited to frequent moving (they are also extremely heavy, not aerodynamic and large tow vehicles are costly). 



They’re also less accepted in caravan parks, and [most local councils consider them caravans](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1632358), with restricted periods of occupancy and often onerous conditions. Vans and buses are the most flexible (in the “stealth van” or vanlife movement, people live rent-free by parking, mostly illegally, often in industrial estates, and using public or work/gym bathrooms). 



They are, however, extremely small and while it may seem glamorous to live in a van like celebrity rock climber [Alex Honnold](https://www.ft.com/content/d1ac7b02-34f8-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5), the reality may not be practical. 



Cost will likely be the next factor to consider. [Ready-built tiny houses range from around A$50,000 – $120,000](https://tinyrealestate.com.au/what-does-a-tiny-house-cost/); DIY are cheaper, especially if self-built, with some costing under $2,000. The higher end, architect-designed ones are more expensive. 



Converted caravans can be affordable, even under $10,000, but prices vary markedly, with some ultra-luxurious five-wheelers costing more than a typical suburban house (>$600,000). 



Converting old buses and vans is much cheaper, with the cost of the vehicle tending to be under $20,000. Of note, unless you are living [under the radar](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1636837) or free camping, you are going to have to factor in the ongoing cost of renting someone’s backyard or caravan park space.



Sustainability is a more nuanced aspect of tiny house living; living small means less energy needed for heating and less room for superfluous stuff, encouraging or enforcing a minimalist lifestyle. 



Most tiny houses on wheels are off-grid to some extent, relying on [solar power, rainwater and composting toilets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1634111). They are often built entirely out of sustainable or reclaimed materials. 



On the other hand, most caravans and vans are not particularly sustainable — they’re often built out of mass-produced material and may produce outgassing from carpets and paints. Vans and busses are generally no more or less sustainable than any similar vehicle. 



Tiny houses, whatever the type, are just that: tiny. Space is at a premium and living tiny requires reducing stuff, such as clothes, sporting and hobby equipment. Tiny houses on wheels, where parked more permanently, allow for decks and even sheds, but caravans and vans are self contained, unless in a permanent caravan park. 



If you are used to living in a very large space, it may take time to adapt to the practicalities of tiny living; people often complain about cooking smells and composting toilets. 



Despite the popularity of tiny houses however, very few people actually live in them. Nonetheless, the vast majority of people who live or have lived tiny, [view their experience positively](https://theconversation.com/life-in-a-tiny-house-whats-it-like-and-how-can-it-be-made-better-110495), and feel it has greatly enriched their lives, and helped them [re-evaluate their life choices, especially consumerism](https://theconversation.com/when-people-downsize-to-tiny-houses-they-adopt-more-environmentally-friendly-lifestyles-112485) even after moving to more conventional dwellings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Kenneth has compiled and submitted a comprehensive list of some 250 peer-reviewed scientific papers from 2015 on climate, all supporting the premise that the Earth’s climate is driven in large part by natural factors. It now has been posted.

Science institutes can no longer ignore massive body of scientific evidence that contradicts the man-made global warming theory. Image: logo of the National Academy of Sciences
How could the IPCC, scientific academies, institutions, lawmakers possibly ignore them? They are out there for all to see – and now in a single list. 
What follows is just a tiny random sampling of the findings this massive body of evidence delivers:
A small sampling of findings
“Mounting evidence from proxy records suggests that variations in solar activity have played a significant role in triggering past climate changes.” http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/43/3/203
“Solar minimum conditions reinforce the high pressure above Greenland together with a weakening of the other two North Atlantic pressure centres.” http://www.ann-geophys.net/33/207/2015/angeo-33-207-2015.pdf

“There have been many studies noting correlations between solar cycles and changes in the Earth temperature.”
http://www.rxiv.org/pdf/1504.0124v1.pdf
“Ocean heat content anomaly (OHCa) time series in some areas of the Pacific are significantly correlated with the total solar irradiance (TSI). ” http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682615300778

“We show how clouds provide the necessary degrees of freedom to modulate the Earth’s albedo setting the hemispheric symmetry. We also show that current climate models lack this same degree of hemispheric symmetry and regulation by clouds.”
http://webster.eas.gatech.edu/Papers/albedo2015.pdf
“While there is scientific consensus that global and local mean sea level (GMSL and LMSL) has risen since the late nineteenth century, the relative contribution of natural and anthropogenic forcing remains unclear.”
http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150729/ncomms8849/full/ncomms8849.html
“Most present-generation climate models simulate an increase in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) since 1998, whereas observations suggest a warming hiatus.”
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7536/full/nature14117.html
“Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall, European summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes and variations in global temperatures. It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content. “
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14491.html
“Predicted slow-down in the rate of Atlantic sea ice loss. Recent forecasts indicate that a spin-down of the thermohaline circulation that began near the turn of the century will continue, and this will result in near neutral decadal trends in Atlantic winter sea ice extent in coming years, with decadal growth in select regions.”
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL065364/abstract
The list of the 2015 papers with such findings is some 250 long! To claim that they do not matter and do not count is willful ignorance. And keeping them from the public is flat out deception and a disservice to the field of science. Little wonder government and institutions have seen the public trust fade.
This list is the perfect thing to educate them. only needs to be sent this list. Send it to your Senators, Congressmen, newspaper editors, journalists, teachers, professors or blind following alarmists who are currently on the verge of a nervous breakdowns over the fictitious global warming catastrophe.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
The _New York Times_ ran an op-ed  last week extolling the virtues of a carbon tax by trying to poo-poo the idea that a tax on carbon emissions (which are produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas during the production of 80% of our nation’s energy supply) would produce a negative impact on our economy. The _Times’_ editors attempt to do this by running through a couple of examples where they claim the imposition of a carbon tax has produced economic benefits (or at least, was somewhat neutral).   
  
Economist Dr. Robert Murphy takes the _Times_ to task on this in his post “The NYT Gets It Wrong on Carbon Tax.”   
  
Murphy is a senior economist at the Institute for Energy Research, research assistant professor at Texas Tech, and also the lead author of our Working Paper (soon to be Cato Policy Analysis) examining the cost for a carbon tax.   
  
In his response to the _Times_ , Murphy points out the _Times’_ editors’ favorite example of a carbon tax done well—British Columbia—actually serves as a counter-example when looked at a bit more carefully. Not only did British Columbia’s economy suffer after the establishment of a carbon tax, but also, the revenue-neutrality of the BC tax is not a real-world possibility in the U.S.   




Murphy writes:   




It’s worth pointing out that these dire economic impacts on the B.C. economy occurred even though they did a surprisingly good job of implementing offsetting tax cuts. Were a carbon tax to be introduced in the United States, the politics would almost certainly result in a large _net_ tax hike.



Ultimately Murphy concludes his piece with:   




The American public is being sold a bill of goods regarding a carbon tax. On the one hand, proponents tell progressive citizens about all the “green” goodies that can be funded with the trillions in revenue that such a tax will bring in. On the other hand, supporters assure conservative citizens not to worry, that the tax will be revenue neutral and will allow for huge cuts in the corporate income tax rate. As Dr. Evil would say, “Riiight.”



Check out Murphy’s full piece for the details of what’s wrong with the _Times’_ op-ed, and our “The Cost Against a Carbon Tax” Working Paper for what’s wrong with the concept of a carbon tax at large.   
  
One of the many (bad) ideas behind a carbon tax is that the federal government will have more money in its hands to do with what it wants, including funding more climate change science to support why it needs to implement a carbon tax.   
  
Dr. Roy Spencer frets over this is his recent blog post examining the observational science behind last year’s record high global temperatures. After reviewing the strength of the claims as to 2015’s temperature (including those as measured by satellites), Dr. Spencer‘s response is rather ho-hum: yes, the surface temperature data compilations do have 2015 as the warmest year in their record (thanks, in part, to a big El Niño); no, the same is not true for satellite observations which show the year as ranking 3rd or 4th; and take everything with a grain of salt, because all the data compilations have “issues.”   
  
What really gets Roy fired up is the government’s behavior in all of this. Roy writes:   




And this brings up the elephant in the room that I have a difficult time ignoring   
  
By now it has become a truism that government agencies will prefer whichever dataset supports the governments desired policies. You might think that government agencies are only out to report the truth, but if that’s the case, why are these agencies run by political appointees?



Roy continues:   




There indeed is a climate change problem to study…but I don’t think we know with any certainty how much is natural versus manmade. There is no way to know, because there is (contrary to the IPCC’s claims) no fingerprint of human versus natural warming. Even natural warming originating over the ocean will cause faster warming over land than over ocean, just as we already observe.   
  
But since the government has framed virtually all of the research programs in terms of human-caused climate change, that’s what the funded scientists will dutifully report it to be, in terms of supposed causation.   
  
And until the culture in the government funding agencies changes, I don’t see a new way of doing business materializing. It might require congress to direct the funding agencies to spend at least a small portion of their budgets to look for evidence of natural causes of climate change.   
  
Because scientists, I have learned, will tend to find whatever they are paid to find in terms of causation…which is sometimes very difficult to pin down in science.



Be sure to check out Roy’s full post “On that Record Warmest 2015 Claim” for a more complete treatment of his concerns.   
  
And, finally, as an amusing anecdote in support of Roy’s comments about the inherent uncertainties in weather observing systems comes this report on how snowfall during the weekend’s blizzard was measured at NOAA’s official weather station in our nation’s capital—Reagan National Airport.   
  
Turns out it was snowing so hard at the height of the storm that the weather observers at the airport couldn’t find the official “snow board” on which the snowfall measurements were supposed to take place. So they improvised—and in doing so seemingly under-reported the snow total during the storm (to the great dismay of many snow nerds). We are not making this up. From the Capital Weather Gang’s investigation:   




It’s not that 17.8 inches of snow wasn’t enough.   
  
But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington’s official total — recorded at Reagan National Airport — is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity?   
  
The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their snow-measuring device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure.



Couple the problem measuring snow at Reagan National Airport with the problem measuring temperature there that we identified last summer (see here and here) and you have the makings of a Laurel and Hardy routine on how weather observations of even fairly straightforward variables are collected. And to think, these types of somewhat major problems were identified as occurring at what would have to be considered among the best observing stations in the world.   
  
Now you know why the data must be “adjusted.” Not a pretty picture.

Within five years of the United States being written off as a declining economic and imperial power, the shale gas revolution it has pioneered provides it with the energy independence it has sought since the first Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC) oil shock of 1973. It also changes the global future of fossil fuels, which have been the basis of the modern intensive growth — generating a sustained increase in per capita incomes, first in the West and now in the Rest. (See my _Unintended Consequences_.)



One of the periodic fears generated by the Greens is that of the world running out of fossil fuels, of which the discredited “peak oil” theory was the latest (see Daniel Yergin’s _The Quest_ ). The potential increase in worldwide natural gas resources from currently estimated recoverable reserves of shale gas is 40 per cent, implying that about 250 years of gas supplies are now available. (See US Energy Information Administration’s “World Shale Gas Resources”.) These are also widely distributed, with China and the Americas having the largest assessed reserves (see map). Furthermore, the potential shale oil reserves are even larger. The US government estimates that the Green River Formation in the Western US contains three trillion barrels of shale oil — three times as large as total global oil consumption over the past 100 years ( _seewww​.theg​w​pf​.org_).



This increase in cheap natural gas will allow the replacement of coal‐​fired power stations, which account for 46 per cent of the electricity produced globally, by gas‐​fired ones, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by half. Moreover, this will happen through normal market processes without any need for the mandates and taxes currently in place to decarbonise the world. The US, as a result of the shale revolution, has cut its carbon footprint by five percent this year, well ahead of those hankering after a new Kyoto Protocol on climate change.





The geostrategic implications of the shale gas revolution invalidate predictions of the death of American‐​style capitalism.



However, for the next decade or two this imminent energy revolution is likely to be mainly confined to the US, which shows the robustness of American entrepreneurship, its system of property rights and the depth of its financial markets. The technology of “fracking” was developed by small companies experimenting in the 1980s and 1990s, supported by venture capital from Wall Street, and took off in 2005 when the Barnett Shale in Texas was shown to be commercially viable. Other shale formations were then rapidly developed. These small companies were aided by the unique US system of property rights, whereby owners of land also own rights to subsurface minerals; in much of the rest of the world these belong to the state. The exploration and production companies have to negotiate with these private property owners for the right to drill in return for negotiated royalties. This provides an incentive for the locals to allow “fracking”, overcoming the NIMBYism prevalent in much of the world. The shale gas and oil revolution, thus, attests to the robustness of US capitalism despite its current fiscal woes.



The fall in the price of natural gas in the US, from $16 to $3.30 per mBtu, has meant that the US is re‐​industrialising as petrochemical — and energy — intensive industries shift from Europe, the Gulf and China back to the US. All the predictions of the US‐​related economic decline are soon to be overturned. The renaissance in US manufacturing, particularly in petrochemicals, has been estimated to increase US manufacturing employment by one million by 2025. This increase in high‐​paying jobs should help mitigate the stagnation of US wages and the attendant rise in its inequality indices. Just as the proponents of “Japan as number one” had written off the US in the 1980s with the stagnation of US productivity, all those rushing to anoint “China as number one” are likely to be nonplussed by the coming resurgence of the US economy.



Moreover, other parts of the world with large shale gas reserves are also unlikely to realise their potential. Argentina, with large reserves, is a pariah when it comes to the direct foreign investment that is needed, after its nationalisation of the oil firm YFP. China, with shale reserves greater than the US’, has a shortage of the water needed for “fracking”. Given the continuing “Green” uproar over mining and nuclear energy, India’s polity also seems unlikely to be able to exploit this bounty.



It is the geopolitical consequences of this US economic renaissance and energy independence that are likely to be momentous, allowing greater freedom of manoeuvre in its foreign policy — most importantly, in its relationship with West Asia. Ever since President Franklin D Roosevelt struck the deal with the Saudi King Ibn Saud on the USS Quincy in 1945 promising security to the Saudi dynasty in return for the free flow of oil to the West (to match the leverage provided to Russia by its oil in the Cold War), the US has been unable to counter the fundamentalist Wahhabi poisoning of the Muslim mind. With the ending of its reliance on West Asian oil, the US could cut back on its implicit protection of the Wahhabi state, and its policing functions in the Strait of Hormuz. It only needs to act as an offshore balancer in the coming internecine conflict amongst the Shias and the Sunnis in the region. It will be the Chinese, Indians and, above all, the Europeans who will no longer be able to remain free riders relying on US arms to secure their oil supplies from the impending turbulence in West Asia.



Moreover, the prospective global abundance of oil and gas, by spiking the Russian threat to world order based on deploying the rents from these natural resources, could also lead Russia to move from its authoritarian crony capitalism to the advanced liberal market economy that it needs for its future prosperity. Equally important, by allowing a shift of US military resources from West Asia to the Pacific, it might give the other authoritarian capitalist state — China — cause to pause in its recent aggressive attempts to challenge the US Pax in Asia. In conclusion, it is premature to predict the end of the American Imperium.

President Obama’s speech to the nation last week about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico followed a predictable script. Whenever a problem confronts this administration, the president’s answer is sure to include one of a trio of his 2008 campaign initiatives: health care reform, action to address climate change or education reform.



Obama claimed in 2008, for instance, that these long‐​term, slowly acting changes were a fix for a temporary downturn in the economy. Now, in an even greater leap of logic, he contends that the 1,427-page Waxman‐​Markey bill (which addresses climate change) is the proper response to the oil spill.



Obama’s advocacy of this bill exemplifies the incoherence and dishonesty of our present debate about energy policy. Two distinct problems — those associated with oil imports and those associated with greenhouse gas emissions — are treated as if they were one and the same.



At a minimum, those alleged problems have wildly different causes necessitating equally different responses. If we fear oil imports, we should tax foreign oil or administratively restrict imports. If we fear greenhouse gas emissions, we should tax those emissions or administratively restrict their release.



Those direct responses will by definition increase the price of gasoline in the first case and all forms of fossil fuels to varying degrees in the second. The more “progress” we wish to achieve in the course of our pursuit of “energy independence” or a carbon‐​free energy economy, the larger the price increases will have to be.



The president eschews direct confrontation with these alleged menaces because the public has little stomach for major, sustained increases in energy prices, particularly when the economy is ailing and gasoline prices are at historically rather high levels.



So he followed the established but failed practice of proposing complex, indirect remedies that aim to hide costs from consumers (and thus, voters). At best, this political sleight‐​of‐​hand makes import reductions and emission controls far more costly to achieve than would otherwise be the case. Economic harm is the more likely outcome.



Regardless, the animus toward foreign oil is unjustified. Historically, domestic energy producers have claimed that foreign suppliers are unreliable in order to restrict competition. Unfortunately, those arguments are readily embraced by the economically gullible.



Given the large number of suppliers and low transportation costs, a loss of supply from any one source can be relatively easily answered by buying from another. Fears of coordinated producer blackmail run aground on the fact that suppliers need us far more than we need them. That’s because the typical oil‐​exporting country is undiversified and a loss of oil revenue would destroy its economy. An oil supply disruption, however, would do far less damage to industrialized importers.



Similarly, if greenhouse gas emissions are a problem (and it is not altogether clear that they are), direct control of greenhouse‐​gas emissions is preferable to a complex set of rules. Economists dealing with these issues recognize that, in principle, either a carbon tax or a pure allocation of emission rights (popularly termed cap‐​and‐​trade) would work best.



Many prefer a simple tax because experience with quota systems proves that difficult problems arise regarding how to allocate the initial rights to emit. Regardless, even fervent supporters of action have long recognized that U.S. emission reductions were futile unless China and India also acted. Otherwise, warming will scarcely be affected.



Unfortunately, there is little reason to believe that U.S. action will prompt similar action in those states.



Waxman‐​Markey, despite its own and the president’s suggestions to the contrary, is predominantly a greenhouse‐​gas control measure. It works on imports very indirectly (and very minimally) by attempting a long‐​term re‐​engineering of the car.



More importantly, the bill imposes a convoluted cap‐​and‐​trade program with every conceivable problem that might be imagined with such programs.



Exceptions are provided for politically well‐​connected industries. Permits are first given away and then subsequently auctioned with the funds to be used to underwrite various inefficient corporate subsidies, a regime so complicated and convoluted that the relevant provisions constitute over half of the sprawling bill. They are preceded by many pages dictating how electricity is to be generated and what fuels shall be used.



In sum, even accepting that there is a problem to solve, the bill’s dictates violate virtually everything that economists know about designing an efficient environmental policy.



Would the Gulf spill have been any less damaging or any less likely to occur had Waxman‐​Markey been passed, say, 10 or 20 years ago? Of course not. No matter what one thinks about the merits of the bill, it would not have reduced the profits associated with oil production enough to have deterred investment in the deep waters of the Gulf.



Nor would it have changed any of the decisions made by BP officials on the Deepwater Horizon platform or any of the BP management practices that allegedly made an accident more likely.



In short, the president’s speech to the nation was a classic political bait‐​and‐​switch maneuver that, unfortunately, errs not only by embracing make‐​believe solutions but bad make‐​believe solutions at that.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Friday afternoon approved a sweeping executive order that suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said, though the administration said exemptions could be granted. Here are some major excerpts from the executive order, with comments by The New York Times. The full text of the order is available here. Most of the 19 hijackers on the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pa. were from Saudi Arabia. The rest were from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon. None of those countries are on Mr. Trump’s visa ban list. The nation’s founding principles, as reflected in the Declaration of Independence, included dissatisfaction with what were said to be overly restrictive immigration practices. “There is no statutory requirement that noncitizens entering the United States support the Constitution,” said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. “The executive order seems to suggest that even temporary visitors like tourists and students should support the U. S. Constitution, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. ” This provision is the key to the power Mr. Trump claims. It says: “Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. ” The provision “gives the president capacious authority to deny entry to any alien or class of aliens,” Professor Spiro said. “No court has ever reversed a presidential order under it. ” But he added, “In terms of the number of prospective immigrants involved, this is by far the most significant use of the power by any president. ” Some critics say the order runs afoul of a later law that bars discrimination “in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. ” The tension between the two laws has not been definitively resolved by the courts. Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that a challenge to the executive order based on the later law’s   principles was the most promising line of attack. In an opinion article in The New York Times, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said Mr. Trump had at least violated the spirit of the later law. “Even if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far,” Mr. Bier wrote. “If Mr. Trump can legally ban an entire region of the world, he would render Congress’s vision of unbiased legal immigration a dead letter. ” The countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. These exceptions are mostly for diplomats, people traveling to the United Nations in New York, and others involved in international organizations. The initial list may soon change and expand. This provision suspends all admissions of refugees, not limited to the seven countries. As a general matter, this will give priority to Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Though framed in a neutral way, this part of the order may raise questions of   discrimination. Mr. Trump has said that he means to favor Christian refugees. That violates the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion, according to David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “One of the critical questions with respect to the validity of executive action challenged under the Establishment Clause is its intent and effect,” he wrote in a blog post. “If intended to disfavor a particular religion, it violates the Establishment Clause. ” This effectively expands the ban on immigrants from Syria. This cuts the cap on refugees in half."

CLINTEL – the Climate Intelligence group of more than 800 international scientists and professionals – have sent a letter to the World Economic Forum to inform them that there is NO Climate Emergency, and that’s good news for Greta Thunberg and her followers, many of whom are scared about climate change. 



Present day climate change turns out to be well within natural variability of the past. Dr. Guus Berkhout, president of CLINTEL, has issued a new plain language climate science essay that shows how computer simulated models have been mistaken for ‘reality’ and why they are unsuitable for setting climate policy. 



Some people wonder why the WEF business community and Al Gore claim there is a climate crisis, but the CLINTEL scientists and professionals don’t… the answer is found in a Forbes story where Roger Pielke, Jr. reveals that two green billionaires sponsored a very influential climate risk report that used the most extreme and least likely scenario. That document and that thinking became embedded as if fact in science, when it is pure speculation.

As the most recent polls show, Australian PM **Scott Morrison** has been politically damaged by the fallout from this summer’s bushfires. No small blame is due to Morrison’s foolish miscalculation of the public mood, but much also stems from the subsequent hysterical opportunism of the political left and their camp-followers in the legacy media. But Morrison is nothing if not a survivor, as his [wresting of victory ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-got-trumpeters-on-the-roof-of-the-white-house-what-will-ardern-get/)in last May’s election shows.



Morrison is already moving to repair, not just the physical damage wreaked by the fires, but the political damage inflicted by his opponents. Many of whom he is moving to hold to account for their own disastrous failings.



Scott Morrison has flagged strengthening the constitutional and legal powers of the commonwealth to allow prime ministers to declare national disasters and call in the Defence Force rather than waiting for the states to ask for ­assistance.



The Australian understands the Prime Minister will also shift the Coalition’s posture on ­climate change and ­elevate preparation, resilience and adaptability to ­increasingly ­extreme events to a national security footing…He will also focus on the government’s economic plan as a successful formula by making a virtue of fiscal discipline that has given the government the ability to ­respond to disasters.



Some of this is plain, old political narrative-setting: Morrison is moving to ally the Coalition’s traditional strength – economic management – to emergency management. This is not all just spin, either. As the wildly differing outcomes from recent natural disasters around the world show, well-off, well-managed countries will sail all-but-unscathed through disasters that, in poorer, less-prepared countries, inflict staggering losses.



But Morrison is also sailing into untested constitutional waters.



Mr Morrison will call for a more immediate role for the ADF in future disasters and consider an overhaul of constitutional and legal frameworks to hand greater powers to the commonwealth to respond to natural disasters…



Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews called for Defence help in late December at the height of the bushfire crisis and the navy evacuated stranded holidaymakers from Mallacoota.



The NSW government early this month declined an offer from the Prime Minister to deploy a fleet of naval ships and military helicopters to help with evacuations from the state’s south coast.



Traditionally, conservative governments have zealously protected Australian federalism and states’ rights. But, in this case, the egregious failures of almost exclusively left-wing state governments seems to demand action. The simple fact is that under the constitutional rules as they are currently understood, the federal government cannot unilaterally send in the troops on Australian soil. Victoria waited until the last minute when thousands had fled to the beaches to escape the flames, to ask for Commonwealth assistance. NSW flatly refused. The Queensland premier didn’t even deign to interrupt her holidays.



Yet it was Morrison who copped the political blame from the public, and worse, from a legacy media either too ignorant or too biased to bother telling the public the truth. Unsurprisingly, Morrison seems determined that blame be sheeted home where it’s most richly deserved. Even if he has to re-write commonwealth-state relations in order to pull negligent states into line.



The Prime Minister will also pledge to introduce an enhanced national accountability for “natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness”.



Mr Morrison last week called for a national standard for bushfire hazard reduction burns and declared that tracking measures to cut fuel loads was at least as important as monitoring Australia’s carbon emissions.



Despite the fears of Coalition voters who emphatically rejected the sort of “climate action” demanded by the left, Morrison isn’t about to bow to the Krazy Klimate Kult. Instead, he’s determined to reset the national discourse, to focus on the [real causes of Australia’s periodic mega-fires](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/bushfires-hysterical-journalists-need-to-read-some-old-newspapers/), rather than futile tilting at carbon windmills.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following clearly shows a complete lack of correlation between CO2 and temperature. Most of the 20th century warming occurred before 1945, and clearly was linked to natural factors at time the planet was emerging from the Little Ice Age.
====================================
Explosive (Non-Anthropogenic) Warming in the Early 20th Century
By Kenneth Richard
As Figure 1 depicts, human CO2 emissions were essentially flat during first half of the 20th century.

Yet, the world’s climate warmed dramatically throughout this period. For example notice how steep the rise in near-surface (0 – 20 m) ocean temperatures was between 1900 and 1945 according to Gouretski et al. (2012, “Consistent near-surface ocean warming since 1900 in two largely independent observing networks“).

As the Gouretski et al. (2012) graph indicates, near-surface ocean temperatures rose by about 1.2°C between 1900 and 1945. But then, in the next 65 years, between 1945 and 2010, the near-surface ocean only warmed by about 0.3°C in total, which includes a 30-year cooling trend (1945 – 1975).
If we compare the two trends, the early 20th century (1900 – 1945) near-surface ocean waters warmed at a rate of almost 0.27°C per decade, whereas the more recent period (1945 – 2010) only warmed at a rate of under 0.05°C per decade. Interestingly, it was the more recent 1945 – 2010 period that contained the rapid expansion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, with rates rising from ~1 GtC/year (1900 -1945)  to nearly 10 GtC/year by 2010.
These warming (and cooling) trends in the near-surface ocean are the opposite of what would be expected if human CO2 emissions were the primary driver.
Sea level rose 8 mm/year between 1930 – 1948

What follows are some of the details of this dramatic early 20th century warming as documented by Princeton geologist Dr. Erling Dorf, a veritable expert on the subject. Notice from the summaries provided below that sea levels were observed to be rising at a rate of about 8 mm/year between 1930 and 1948 (6 inches in 19 years), which is more than double today’s modeled satellite altimetry rate (3.2 mm/year).
These early 20th century temperature and CO2 trends beg the question: What were the physical mechanisms that caused this dramatic global-scale warming, since anthropogenic CO2 emissions were both low (~1 GtC/year) and stable during this period?
Summary of the 1900 to 1950 warm period as described in Dr. Dorf’s (1959) “CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT”.

A 14°F (+7.7°C) warming in the Arctic (North Pole region) between the early 1900s and 1950, with ice-free ports 7 months out of the year rather than the mere 3 months per year that were common at the turn of the century.
A 5°F (+2.8°C) warming in Antarctica.
“Catastrophic” and “violent” wasting away of glaciers, with Muir Glacier retreating 2 miles (3.2 km) in 10 years.
A snow line rise by 2700 feet (823 meters) in the Peruvian mountains.
A 6-inch (15 cm) rise in sea level between 1930 and 1948, a rate of about 32 inches (+80 cm) per century and 8 mm/yr  (more than double today’s alleged rate per satellite altimetry [3.2 mm/yr]).  A 600% increase in the rate of sea level rise in the 1920s.
Agricultural crop lines shifted 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) northward, with 10-day longer growing seasons.
Tree lines moved 65 feet (20 meters) up the mountains in Sweden.
Many birds and mammals extended their habitats northwards; about 25 species of birds advanced from the south up into a warmer Greenland; codfish replaced seals along the coasts of Greenland, which led “Greenland Eskimos” to switch to cod-fishing rather than seal-hunting.

Excerpts from Dr. Erling Dorf, 1959:
CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT
It has been observed, however, that the greatest temperature increases during the last hundred years have been in the Arctic regions. In Spitsbergen, only about 10 to 12 degrees from the North Pole, the mean winter temperatures have risen about 14° F. since 1910 (Willett, 1950). Ice-free ports there are now open to navigation about 7 months of the year as compared with only 3 months fifty years ago (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 32). If the warming trend of the north polar region should continue at its present rate, it has been estimated that the entire Arctic Ocean would be navigable all year long within about a hundred years. At the opposite end of the world, according to recent reports from the Weather Bureau (Wexler, 1958), the Antarctic region has undergone a rise of about 5°F. in average temperature in the last fifty years. There has been no appreciable rise, however, in the mean annual temperatures in the tropical regions of the world.
What have been some of the notable results of this warming trend during the last hundred years? Glaciers throughout the world have been melting away at a rapidly increasing rate. Brooks (1949, p. 24). the eminent British paleoclimatologist, stated that “Since the beginning of the 20th Century glaciers have been wasting away rapidly, or even catastrophically.” In the Juneau region of Alaska, all but one of the numerous glaciers began melting away as far back as 1765. Muir Glacier, for example, has retreated as much as two miles in 10 years. Baird and Sharp (1954, p. 143) have referred to the “alarming retreat of glaciers” in the Alaskan region; along the Pacific Coast of North America and in Europe they believe the glacial melting “appears to be progressing violently.” In the north polar region, measurements of melting of the ice islands in the Arctic Sea indicate an approach toward an open polar sea (Crary, Kulp, and Blarshall, 1955). In only a few regions of the world, such as the Pacific Northwest, are there any records of glaciers advancing during the past century, and these have been mostly since 1950 (Hubley, 1956). The warmer temperatures have also caused a general rise of the snow line throughout the mountainous regions of the world, even in the tropics: in northern Peru it has risen about 2700 feet during the 60 years.
Believed in large part to be the result of the melting of the world’s glaciers, sea level has been rising at a rapidly increasing rate, amounting to as much as a 6-inch rise from 1930 to 1948 (Marmar, 1948). This is about four times the average rate of sea level rise during the past 9000 years, as recorded by Shepard and Suess (1956). It should be noted that more than a six-fold increase in the rate of sea level rise occurred in the mid-1920’s at the same time there was a striking change in the rate of glacial melting in the north (Ahlmann, 1953, Fig. 11).
Changes in vegetation brought about by the warmer temperatures include the encroachment of trees into the subpolar tundra as recorded in Alaska, Quebec, Laborador, and Siberia. In the Canadian prairies the agricultural crop line has shifted from 50 to 100 miles northward as a result of the lengthening of the growing season by as much as ten days. In parts of northern New England and eastern Canada the birch trees have been dying off over large areas, and the spruces and balsams have begun to suffer as a result of the rise in summer temperatures. In Sweden the timberline has moved up the mountain slopes as much as 65 feet since 1930 (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 35).
In the animal world many southern types of both birds and mammals have been extending their habitat ranges northward as a result of the warming trend. The cardinal, the turkey vulture, the tufted titmouse, and the blue-winged warbler, as well as the warmth-loving opossum, have slowly moved their ranges into the northern United States. A good many central European species of animals have been shifting their ranges northward into Scandinavia, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faero Islands. Twenty-five species of birds alone are reported to have invaded Greenland from the south since 1918 (Jensen and Fristrup, 1950). Codfish from the Atlantic have replaced the seals in the waters along the coast of Greenland. It is reported that compared to a shipment of 5 tons of codfish from Greenland in 1913, the 1946 shipment had risen to over 13,000 tons; the Greenland Eskimos have become cod fishermen instead of seal fishermen (Kimble, 1950). Farther south tunafish have moved northward into the waters off New England, and tropical flying fishes have become increasingly common off the coast of New Jersey.

Guest essay by Wim Rost

Sometimes you know that something “stinks” somewhere. But you don’t know what and you don’t know where. You can search everywhere and don’t find it. Till you finally find out.
Until recently I thought about the IPCC as an organisation “filled up with science”. That thought was both right and wrong. Sure, you can find a lot of scientists and scientific results there, but, IPCC does not (necessarily) work as science. No, it is not science, IPCC is government.
I discovered the importance of that difference by reading a title of an IPCC report twice: “Summary for Policymakers” and “Summary for Policymakers”. That title was giving me the suggestion that scientists had been writing a scientific paper for Policymakers. But, looking further I discovered it was different. That summary was not a scientific paper. It was an opinion and it does not need to be the opinion of all scientists involved*. Let me explain.
Scientists have to respect the scientific method. The scientific method has rules. The most important of all rules is to work in a way to obtain maximum objectivity. “Science or Fiction” wrote about objective science in a post with reference to Karl Popper: https://dhf66.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/ippc-does-exactly-what-should-be-avoided-in-objective-science/ . In the words of Karl Popper:
“We may now return to a point made in the previous section: to my thesis that a subjective experience, or a feeling of conviction, can never justify a scientific statement, and that within science it can play no part (…). No matter how intense a feeling of conviction it may be, it can never justify a statement. Thus I may be utterly convinced of the truth of a statement; certain of the evidence of my perceptions; overwhelmed by the intensity of my experience: every doubt may seem to me absurd. But does this afford the slightest reason for science to accept my statement? Can any statement be justified by the fact that Karl R. Popper is utterly convinced of its truth? The answer is, ‘No’; and any other answer would be incompatible with the idea of scientific objectivity.”
Is a conviction the slightest reason for science to accept a statement? Popper: “The answer is, ‘No’; and any other answer would be incompatible with the idea of scientific objectivity.”
In the IPCC Climate Discussion at this point all went wrong: conviction. But how? As said, it has been a struggle for me to discover. But now I know how we all are tricked. We are tricked in sentences like “Summary for Policymakers”. And also by way of “organising a result” in a manner which is perhaps formally correct – within the IPCC context – but as a result gives a wrong suggestion to the big public. Namely, the suggestion of “scientific evidence”, supported by nearly all scientists.
“The Summary for Policymakers 2014” of group II has a subtitle: “WORKING GROUP II CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE”. From the scientific point of view “Working group II contribution” to the summary is not correct as far as I can see.
To be scientific, the statement that something – for example an opinion or a conclusion – is a“working group II contribution” has to be tested and verified. So there must have been an enquiry among the scientists that were working in the group involved, in any case of a statement with expressions as “likely” or “very likely” or in any other statement or conclusion which is not straight from scientific research itself. That enquiry must make clear which of the scientists involved did judge the presented statement to be “a certitude” from the scientific point of view. This enquiry and the results have to be publicly available in order to make it verifiable. It must be possible to make the enquiry again and then we must get the same results. By doing so [parts of] the enquiry can be verified by researchers and journalists.
I have never heard about such an enquiry by the IPCC in regard to summaries or conclusions.
When the hypothesis (e.g. “X = very unlikely”) is not tested in such a way, you can only refer to such a statement as to the opinion of the writers of that specific part. But, opinion is not the same as “science” and every suggestion that the summary or conclusion is representing the science or even the scientists of “working group II” has to be avoided. Unless it is proven.
The IPCC is stating elsewhere:
The assessment process
This Working Group III contribution to the AR5 represents the combined efforts of hundreds of leading experts in the field of climate change mitigation and has been prepared in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the IPCC.
(WR: italic is mine)
Source: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf
That was an eye opener. Does this statement mean that rules and procedures of science and of experts are used to produce summary’s and conclusions? No, not at all. It means, that what you are reading in the summaries and the conclusions is IPCC. And IPCC, although a lot of important work is done by scientists, IPCC is not equal with science. The IPCC is an intergovernmental panel on Climate Change. To be even more clear: IPCC is government and not science. And the workers of the IPCC prepare the work in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the IPCC.
In order to be scientific the scientific method has to be adhered. The use of many scientists to fill important parts of IPCC reports does not mean that everything is science. A report is just a report. In this case, a report from the IPCC. And the IPCC is (inter-) government. Scientists involved can produce their own scientific papers about their own specialised part of science, but a small group of writers writes the summaries and the conclusions – for the IPCC. And IPCC is government.
When you are reading well, formally the IPCC knows. But, the problem is that in public use the fact that a lot of scientists are working for the IPCC is mentioned so often, that it seems that everything produced by the IPCC is “scientific”. But, the summaries and conclusions are not scientific. They are just representing the intergovernmental opinion.
 
Of course, government may have an opinion. And government may also find support for that opinion in scientific research. But by making choices for certain lines and by drawing certain conclusions – even when made with the help of scientists – this doesn’t mean the government is representing “Science” and that her conclusions are “Science” or even “scientific”. It could very well be, that another choice for the IPCC‘s stated mission**, another choice of writers, another choice for “process organisers” and another selection of scientists would have delivered other summaries and other conclusions. As is usual when it is about an opinion.
The ‘big lie’ about the scientific nature of all of the IPCC statements and especially her conclusions has to end up by strictly avoiding the overwhelming suggestion that everything is science. Unless there are enquiries which prove the opposite. Therefore, to start with the next report the IPCC should give reports titles and subtitles like:
 
Summary by Policymakers
Approved by governments, not science
As a beginning. And to continue, they have to make everywhere a strict division between “science” and “opinion”. And tell with every statement who’s opinion it exactly is.
Wim Röst ***
* Of course there always remains the possibility that at a certain moment one specific researcher is more right than the other 99.9% of researchers which “are not that far”. Think about Albert Einstein’s E=mc2 or Alfred Wegener’s Continental Drift. So, majority doesn’t count in science. “Reigning by majority” is a democratic principle which is bound to government and not to science. The IPCC is government and so uses “majorities”. But, from the scientific point of view, “majority” is without any meaning and doesn’t belong to Science.
** “The IPCC’s stated mission is not to discover what accounts for climate change, but to assess “the risk of human-induced climate change.” Consequently, there is almost no discussion in its lengthy reports of other theories of climate change. Policymakers and journalists took this to mean the AGW theory was the only credible theory of climate change, and the IPCC’s sponsors and spokespersons had no incentive to correct the mistake.”

"Rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday: “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. ” But the president’s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States, which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001. Many experts believe the order’s unintended consequences will make the threat worse. While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence, terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data. For instance, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the seven countries targeted in the order’s   visa ban, according to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina. Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind  —   for instance, charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group  —   only 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries, said Mr. Kurzman, who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism. The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States, and the president’s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame. There was a random quality to the list of countries: It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated. Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan, where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States. Notably, perhaps, the list avoided Muslim countries where Mr. Trump has major business ventures. Nor did the list include the European countries where disenfranchised Muslim communities have become hotbeds of militancy, leading to major attacks in Paris and Brussels in the name of the Islamic State. Because no visas are required for travel by most European citizens to the United States, and because of the volume of tourism and business, restricting travel from Europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named. By Mr. Kurzman’s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks  —   out of a total of more than 230, 000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, 870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings. “My advice to the new administration would be to declare victory,” Mr. Kurzman said. For the average American, he added, “your odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal. ” But terrorists  —   the root of the word means “to cause to tremble”  —   do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics. Their purpose is to terrify, and they use random and spectacular violence to do it, with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw. To the rational calculations of Mr. Kurzman, one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years: Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla.  —   place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds,   bodies and frightened people running for cover. In Gallup polls, the number of Americans “very worried” or “somewhat worried” about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent, with understandable spikes after new attacks. In the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump’s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with “hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles” or those “who do not support the Constitution. ”) The trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism. “In my opinion, this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation,” said Daniel Benjamin, formerly the State Department’s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at Dartmouth. “For the life of me, I don’t see why we would want to alienate the Iraqis when they are the ground force against ISIS. ” At home as well, Mr. Benjamin said, the president’s order is likely to prove counterproductive. The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. “It sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,” Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will “feed the jihadist narrative” that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence. For an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field. Jonathan Schanzer, the vice president for research at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures, it might be justified. But he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures, and no specific plans to address such issues during the temporary restrictions on visitors and refugees. “The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise,” he said. Mr. Schanzer said he was frustrated that during the Obama administration, there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the United States and elsewhere. “We have several bloody, complex and interlocking conflicts in the Middle East,” he said. “It’s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts. Admittedly, that is not easy. ” Much easier, clearly, is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense. But as the Trump administration is finding out, such pronouncements from an American president have many consequences, not all of them intended, anticipated or desired."

We need to fix the climate of fraud, corruption, and policies that kill jobs, hope and people 
Guest essay by Paul Driessen
Reeling stock markets across the globe hammered savings, pension funds, innovation and growth. US stocks lost over $2 trillion in market value in eight days, before rallying somewhat, while the far smaller Shanghai Composite Index lost $1 trillion in four days of trading, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Battered economies continue to struggle. Investment banks are pulling out of developing countries. An already exploding and imploding Middle East now confronts a nuclear arms race and human exodus.
Complying just with federal regulations already costs American businesses and families $1.9 trillion per year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute calculates. That’s more than all 2014 personal and corporate income tax receipts combined – and Obama bureaucrats issued 3,554 new rules and regulations last year.
EPA’s 2,691-page Clean Power Plan is designed to eliminate coal mining and coal-fired power plants – and minimize natural gas substitutes. The CPP requires that gas use can increase by only 22% above 2012 levels by 2022, and just 5% per year thereafter. On top of that, new natural gas-fueled generating units that replace coal-fired power plants absurdly do not count toward state CO2 reduction mandates.
That means millions of acres of new wind and solar installations that generate expensive, unreliable electricity – and survive only because of subsidies, tariffs, anti-fossil fuel mandates, and exemptions from endangered species, environmental impact and other requirements that block fossil fuel projects.
Anti-energy, anti-growth policies imposed in name of preventing “dangerous manmade climate change” impact everything we do. For minority, elderly and working class families, they bring soaring electricity costs, rising unemployment, unproductive lives on government assistance, diminished health and welfare, and shorter life spans. They hogtie economies and kill jobs, prolong and worsen economic quagmires, crush aspirations and opportunities, perpetuate poverty, and foster anger, unrest and conflict.
None of these hard realities seems to bother President Obama, though. In fact, he is determined to use the December climate conference in Paris to lock the United States into binding treaty commitments to slash the common folks’ fossil fuel use, CO2 emissions, economic growth and job creation even further.
Anyone who cares about living standards, lifting billions of people out of abject poverty, and reining in the power of unaccountable US, EU and UN bureaucrats needs to pay attention and get involved.
Earth’s climate is doing pretty much what it always has: responding to powerful natural forces, changing, and driving atmospheric patterns and weather events that benefit some, harm others and sometimes wreak devastation. It is not doing what gloom-and-doom computer models and headlines predicted.
We do not need to “fix” or “control” the climate. We couldn’t if we tried. We do need to fix the climate of fraud, corruption and destructive policies that kill jobs, dreams and people. We need to realize that most countries will not commit economic suicide. They may sign a climate treaty – but for reasons that have nothing to do with environmental protection … and only if their obligations are distant and ephemeral.
Mr. Obama has said from the outset that he would use executive decrees to “fundamentally transform” the United States and ensure that electricity prices “necessarily skyrocket.” He has kept his word.
He and his friends in the UN, EU, Big Green and Climate Crisis Industry have also made it clear that they intend to use the Paris conference to negotiate the future distribution of the world’s wealth and resources, determine what economic growth and living standards are “ecologically feasible,” and transform the global economic development model: replacing sovereign nations and free enterprise capitalism with global governance and decision-making based on “sustainable development” and “dangerous manmade climate change” mantras. 1992 climate conference organizers even said saving the world requires that they cause “industrialized civilization to collapse.” They intend to keep their promises.
Impoverished people in developing countries reject this agenda. They want sustained development, not sustainable development. They want decent jobs and modern houses, hospitals and living standards.
Thus, under the proposed Paris treaty, only developed countries will be required to slash fossil fuel use. “Poor” nations (including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia) will not be obligated to reduce their carbon-based energy use or carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emissions by any specific amounts or dates – though some say they “intend to try” to reduce emissions or may present non-binding targets some years from now. Most will dramatically increase their oil, gas and coal use, and CO2/GHG emissions.
The real bribe to induce poor nations to sign a new treaty is a binding commitment that increasingly less developed, less energy-powered, less rich countries will give “poor” nations (or at least their ruling elites) $100 billion per year in climate adaptation, mitigation and reparation payments. That’s to cover damages that developed nations have supposedly inflicted on Earth’s climate. FRCs (Formerly Rich Countries) will also be required to give “poor” nations advanced energy and other technologies, at no cost.
Even more insane, the entire basis for this agenda, this treaty, these commitments and non-commitments, is bald assertions – driven by garbage in/garbage out computer models and deceptive, fraudulent science – that humanity faces “unprecedented” global warming, rising ocean, weather and other calamities.
About the only unprecedented event in the past century is that no category 3-5 hurricane has hit the USA in nearly a decade. Climate alarmists refuse to discuss that. Their other assertions are pure fiction.
Claims that 2014 was the “hottest year on record,” and July 2015 was “the hottest July” since “at least 1880,” are based on city and airport temperatures that are always several degrees higher than those at nearby rural sites. (Satellite data show no warming for 18 years.) The “superheated planet” alarums involve hundredths of a degree: less than the margin of error. They are based mainly on only 1,200 measuring stations for Earth’s entire surface – with few in the coldest regions, and millions of acres of missing data simply extrapolated from urban numbers. The “hottest ever” charade also assumes reliable temperature data exist for the entire USA and planet all the way back to 1880! It defies belief.
(For more examples of climate scare deceit, see Climate Hype Exposed, Heartland’s Top 10 Global Warming Lies, the Aussie temperature scam, the Gore-a-thon analysis, and much more.
Imagine your life without electricity, or only when it’s available, or costing so much you can’t afford it and your now-bankrupt former employer couldn’t afford either. Imagine the EPA and UN controlling the juice that powers everything in your life: transportation, manufacturing, communications, entertainment, life after dark, life in hot and cold weather, the enormous infrastructure and energy demands that feed your smart phone. No wonder Google scientists finally admitted renewable energy is a pipedream.
Too many environmental laws no longer focus on protecting the environment. They have become bureaucratic weapons to protect chosen industries and destroy those connected to carbon-based fuels.
Denying people access to abundant, reliable, affordable hydrocarbon energy is immoral – and often lethal. It is an unconscionable crime against humanity to implement policies that pretend to protect the world’s energy-deprived masses from hypothetical manmade climate dangers decades from now – by perpetuating energy deprivation, poverty, malnutrition and disease that kill millions of them tomorrow. 
Letting this climate fear mongering continue also means fewer jobs, more welfare, lower living standards, and deteriorating health and welfare – except for ruling elites. But so far too few politicians, candidates, clergy and business leaders have shown the courage to speak out – even as every Democratic would-be successor to Mr. Obama seems hell-bent on going even further than he has on all these policies.
Our next president and congress must focus on job and economic growth, and overall human welfare. They must review and roll back destructive regulations, root out the fraud and corruption, and restore honesty, transparency and real science to our political and regulatory system.

"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using  his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president’s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like   authentication  —   a password and a code texted to a phone, for example  —   are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure   network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. “The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,” said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. “It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted. ” Among the concerns by security experts: ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured   and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. ■ Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device’s location and other information. “There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems  —   and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone though he won, the use of a White   secure device came with many rules. “As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,” said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America’s Open Technology Institute."
"The newly formed Carbon Sense Coalition today described the Global Warming Policies of both Federal and State government and opposition parties as “Policies for Poverty”.
Chairman of the new group, Mr Viv Forbes, says that at a time when scientific and informed opinion was becoming more sceptical of the apocalyptic prophecies of the Global Warming Industry, politicians and the media were competing to propose the most extreme and expensive options to “solve” a non- problem.

“A coalition of big business, big government and state funded media and research bureaucrats is colluding to impose job losses, power shortages and increased costs for electricity, transport and food on the unsuspecting Australian community – a well designed total package of Policies for Poverty.
“Ordinary workers, consumers and taxpayers will be sacrificed on this Altar in the vain hope that it will have some beneficial effect on earth’s future climate.
“Even casual analysis of the evidence will show that even if Australia closed every coal mine and power station, and stopped all cars, trucks, ships and aeroplanes, it would be impossible to detect any effect on world temperature.
“Politicians seem prepared to impose enormous costs on the Australian people in order to achieve miniscule effects on a non problem.
“Professor Lance Enderbee has published graphs of mean temperatures from 27 rural recording stations in Australia for 100 years from 1890 to 1990. The trend is horizontal, with mean temperature in 1990 below that for 1880. This has occurred during the century of the motor car, two world wars, and massive growth of coal burning for steel production and power generation. Rising carbon dioxide levels have had no effect on temperatures.
“A similar data set for six Australian capital cities shows a generally rising trend in temperature since 1950 – that is, rising temperature in Australia is an urban effect, not a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“Urban heating is caused by air conditioners pumping heat into or out of buildings, motors cars exhausting hot fumes, hot factories, millions of hot bodies, politicians emitting hot air, hot concrete and bitumen, polluted air, fewer breezes and less cool pastures, swamps and scrub.
“This urban heating will be made worse by the silly proposal to replace electric appliances (whose source of heat and emissions is controlled in an isolated power station in the countryside) with millions of small open fires burning in gas stoves and hot water systems in every home all over the city.
“The federal government and five state governments have six different programs and models covering emissions trading, carbon caps, carbon taxes and renewable energy schemes. Each jurisdiction is rushing to set up new energy, greenhouse and climate change offices with hierarchies of expensive public officials to staff them.
“Merchant banks are gearing up for the easy profits to be generated by carbon trading. Lawyers are preparing for the rush of new business from the disputes, legal challenges and shady deals which will follow the complicated sets of laws and regulations on carbon caps, emissions trading rules, conditions covering free permits, penalties, exemptions, offset policies, early abatement rules, reporting requirements and international trading rules.
“All of this is creating a totally artificial industry living on the sweat of ordinary workers, farmers, miners, foresters, consumers, tax payers and shareholders.
“Every carbon cap or tax will increase the cost of electricity in every home, farm and factory. Every increase in power costs will drive one more business and its jobs to China or India. Every subsidy for playthings like solar collectors or wind farms will cause an increase in taxes. And every ethanol plant built will increase the costs of every bit of food on the table of every home in the country – all of these are Policies for Poverty.
“The long term effects on the community will be obvious, but different. Emission traders and regulators will get bonuses in their pay packets. The beautiful people in the leafy suburbs will cut back on cappuccinos. Grain and sugar farmers supplying ethanol plants will prosper. All other farmers and consumers will suffer losses as grain, sugar and electricity costs rise. Coal miners will lose their job. Factory workers will lose their house. Politicians will lose office.”
Mr Viv Forbes

"**US Vice-President Mike Pence has criticised the US National Basketball Association (NBA) in a speech attacking Chinese diplomatic and trade policies.**
He accused both the NBA and the sports firm Nike of ""kowtowing"" to Beijing and ""muzzling"" criticism of China.
Hours later, Beijing hit back at Mr Pence, saying the US should ""cease expressing irresponsible opinions"".
It comes in the wake of a diplomatic row over an NBA team manager's support for anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong.
In the speech in Washington DC late on Thursday, Mr Pence also said Chinese policy was growing ""more aggressive and destabilising"".
""In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,"" the vice-president said.
But on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying accused Mr Pence of ""arrogance and hypocrisy"", according to news agency AFP.
Ms Hua added the US should ""cease actions that harm the relations and mutual trust between the two countries"".
The China-NBA row began early this month with a tweet - since deleted - by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters.
It sparked furious reactions in China, where the NBA has a mass following that provides substantial revenue. NBA products were taken off shelves and games were boycotted by Chinese state TV.
The NBA released two statements on the tweet - the first one distancing itself from Mr Morey - turning a Chinese backlash into an American backlash as well.
In his remarks, Mr Pence accused the Chinese government of trying to ""influence the public debate here in America"" by ""trying to export censorship"".
He also accused Beijing of ""exploiting corporate greed"" of American companies hoping to do business in China.
""Nike promotes itself as a so called 'social-justice champion,' but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,"" he said.
""Nike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager's seven-word tweet: 'Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.'""
Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners who routinely exercise their freedom to criticise the US are silent on other people's rights, he said.
President Donald Trump and his administration have previously criticised Nike over its decision to support Colin Kaepernick, an American football player who controversially knelt as the US national anthem was played ahead of NFL games.
Mr Pence also called on China to show more respect for the rights of its minority citizens.
The speech came after Congress voted on laws to support Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has indicated ""strong countermeasures"" if the White House allows the bill to become law.
The latest row between Washington and Beijing also comes amid efforts by the US and China to end their trade war.
In his speech, Mr Pence said the US was ""not seeking to contain China's development"".
""We want a constructive relationship with China's leaders,"" he added.
Basketball is the most popular sport in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA.
The NBA has had a presence in China since 1992 when it opened its first office in Hong Kong.
The Houston Rockets are widely followed in China after it signed Chinese player and eight-time NBA All-Star Yao Ming in 2002.
NBA China, which conducts the league's business in the country, was launched in 2008 and is now worth more than $4bn (Â£3.1bn), according to Forbes."
"**With my 11-year-old brother suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication following the outbreak of a new conflict in Ethiopia's already war-scarred Tigray region.**
He lives in the regional capital, Mekelle, with my parents and siblings and - just days before the conflict started - I had what has turned out to be my last video chat with them about his treatment.
As his medication is expensive and pharmacies in Mekelle often run out of stock, I agreed to send money to my family to pay for the drugs, while they were going to get the medication from the federal capital, Addis Ababa.
I did a bank transfer from Kenya's capital Nairobi - where I live - to Mekelle, but with the state-owned National Bank of Ethiopia now shutting all of its more than 600 branches in Tigray because of the conflict, my family cannot withdraw the money.
And even if they get the cash, they cannot get the medicines, as all passenger flights into Tigray have been halted, meaning that no-one can bring it from Addis Ababa. Road travel between the two cites, about 700km (435 miles) away from each other, has also stopped, leaving many Tigrayans stranded in the federal capital.
The airspace is now restricted to military aircraft.
Ethiopia's Prime Minster and Nobel Peace laureate Abiy Ahmed has warned people in Tigray to avoid holding gatherings as he has ordered air strikes to destroy the military arsenal of the regional government. He wants to dislodge it from power after accusing it of being illegally in office and of violently taking control of a federal military base near Mekelle, charges the Tigray government denies.
The regional government has also heavily restricted road travel within Tigray, as fighting takes place, according to the UN, in eight locations, including in the sesame-growing area of Humera, where farmers are usually harvesting crops at this time of the year, helped by workers from the neighbouring region of Amhara, in a sign of how the fate of Ethiopians of all ethnic groups is intertwined.
Now, fear and suspicion are growing, with some Tigrayans in the federal police and military telling me that they have been ordered by their superiors to hand in their weapons, and to stop reporting for work.
When news of the conflict broke in the early hours of 4 November - the day the world's attention was focused on the fiercely contested US election - I received a message from a colleague, saying: ""Have you heard what's happened? Have you checked on your family?""
I immediately dialled the numbers of my parents and siblings, but could not get through to any of them as the phone lines were down and the internet was shut, cutting me - and hundreds of thousands of others - off from our families in Tigray.
I miss my little brother the most. As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video link-ups of my family.
Now, I cling to the photos I have of him - and hope that the conflict ends soon so that he can get his medication. I had also been thinking of getting him over to Nairobi for further medical check-ups. I was also thinking of buying him a wheelchair as he has difficulty walking.
All this will have to wait until the conflict ends, but what if it drags on? This is a real possibility as the prime minister has rejected mediation while the regional government - led by a former guerrilla movement, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - is unlikely to give up power without a fight to the finish.
What will then happen to my family and other families? Will there be a scarcity of food? Will prices rise? How will families cope with a shortage of cash, especially if they rely on remittances sent by relatives living abroad?
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel in Tigray - and, worst of all, water which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected, they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity.
But my biggest worry is this: What if tanks roll into my home town or if it is hit in an air strike?
I have vivid childhood memories of the 1998-2000 border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea - of being shielded by my mother in our home as we heard the terrifying roar of fighter jets and of being told never to wear white clothes to avoid being spotted.
This aversion lasted until my teens, when I finally said to myself: ""It really is OK to wear white.""
Some of my friends - whose minds are also racing back to that era, a time which we thought we had left behind - are having worse flashbacks - of building bunkers in their school as four-year-olds; of an Eritrean air strike killing children at another school; of friends and neighbours never returning from the frontline.
One friend's memory goes back even further - to the stories he had heard about how his mother fled to the outskirts of Mekelle in 1989 to escape air bombardments ordered by Ethiopia's then-ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime, and to how his grandfather survived the 1943 bombing of the city by the British Royal Air Force at the request of Emperor Haile Selassie.
So, the people of Mekelle - like those in other parts of Tigray and Ethiopia - have lived through war after war.
They are worried about another one, especially when the festive season is approaching.
I had planned to go back to celebrate Christmas in January - as Ethiopian Orthodox Christians do - and to get married to my boyfriend, who continued to live in Mekelle after I moved to Nairobi a few years ago to work for the BBC.
But my plans are frozen, as I find myself cut off from him and my family. It reminds me of my father, a humble carpenter, who lost all contact with his sister in Eritrea because of the war that the two countries fought.
For two decades, he spoke of how much he missed her. When border crossings reopened - albeit temporarily - following the peace deal Mr Abiy negotiated with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki in 2018, he was looking forward to seeing her, only to learn that she had died.
For his peace efforts with Eritrea, Mr Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and, in his acceptance speech in Oslo, said:
""It takes a few to make war. But it takes a village and a nation to build peace. For me nurturing peace is like planting and growing trees. Just like trees need water and good soil to grow, peace requires unwavering commitment, infinite patience and goodwill to cultivate and harvest its dividends.""
Like many others, I am hoping that Mr Abiy and Tigray's leader Debretsion Gebremichae now make peace.
Otherwise, the seeds of hatred could grow, in a nation already hit by ethnic clashes that have left about two million people - including more than 100,000 Tigrayans - homeless in different parts of Ethiopia since 2018."
"**Dozens of spectators at a US basketball game have held signs and donned T-shirts and masks in support of protests in Hong Kong.**
Demonstrators gathered during a match in New York between the Brooklyn Nets and the Toronto Raptors.
The move was organised by film producer Andrew Duncan, who bought 300 tickets for the activists.
It comes amid an ongoing row between China and the NBA over the protests that have rocked Hong Kong since March.
Images from the pre-season game on Friday show demonstrators wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ""Stand With Hong Kong"" and ""Free Tibet"".
Two other people were also pictured wearing Winnie-the-Pooh costumes. The cartoon bear is used as a symbol to mock Chinese President Xi Jinping and is banned in China.
Footage from the protest was shared on social media.
Among the group was Hong Kong activist Nathan Law, the former chairman of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party he co-founded with fellow campaigner Joshua Wong.
""We want to use our performance art to show our support for Hong Kong and the NBA,"" another spectator, Chen Pokong, 55, told the New York Post. ""[China wants] to take away freedom of speech and now spread dictatorship to America.""
Local media report that some of demonstrators were ejected from the game for chanting.
Similar demonstrations have already been held at other games between American and Chinese teams. Earlier this month, during a match between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, two people were asked to leave for holding signs in support of Hong Kong protests.
At another game between the Loong-Lions and the Washington Wizards, local media report that spectators had their pro-Hong Kong signs confiscated.
But Friday's protest was the first to be held during a match between two NBA teams.
The spat between the league and China's government began earlier this month after Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protests in Hong Kong.
As a result, several Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals with the NBA - a huge financial blow to the league, which has millions of followers in China.
The Rockets and the NBA quickly distanced themselves from Mr Morey's tweet, while basketball superstar LeBron James suggested the Rockets' manager ""wasn't educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong.
Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai - who is also the vice-chairman of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba - has also criticised Mr Morey for his ""damaging"" tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong.
""Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China,"" Mr Tsai added.
Mr Morey has since backtracked on his tweet. but US lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have accused the NBA of bowing to Beijing."

Amid a busy December, when the United Nations was focusing on important conferences on climate change and migration and year-end holidays loomed, a case of harassment that never got the traction it arguably deserved ended in a traditional UN way: it disappeared.



On Dec. 14, the [chairman](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/12/senior-un-official-resigns-undermining-sexual-abuse-charges/) of the [International Civil Service Commission](https://icsc.un.org/rootindex.asp), which regulates salaries and working conditions for staff members across the vast UN system, quietly resigned, after a year of dodging allegations that he had created a hostile and “unhealthy” environment for women who rejected his sexual advances.



The chairman of the commission, Kingston Rhodes of Sierra Leone, who held the rank of UN under secretary-general, was due to retire at the end of 2018, when his second term ended. His sudden, early resignation was exactly what the women who filed a complaint feared: Rhodes hung on and walked free. Four of those women had aired their allegations in a letter to Secretary-General António Guterres.



Rhodes’ staff even organized a farewell party for him, in place of a holiday party, and employees were urged to help defray the costs.



Thalif Deen, a correspondent at the UN for Inter Press Service, who was almost alone in his persistent reporting on the harassment story, wrote on Dec. 14 what women working for the commission had been predicting, “The UN’s heavily-hyped ‘zero tolerance’ policy on sexual abuse is being ridiculed once again.”



Equality Now, an international organization advocating for women’s rights, had been following the case for more than a year, since the allegations surfaced in November 2017. The organization had also formally asked for intervention by Guterres, who was reported to have said he found the allegations made by the women on the commission staff “credible.”



One complainant was Shihana Mohamed, a human-resources policies officer on the commission. In an interview with PassBlue last summer, she discussed several systemwide principles that she charged had been violated by Rhodes, who had created a “hostile” and threatening working environment.



While Rhodes — as an elected, not appointed, official — was not required to abide by some employee rules, one that he had at least publicly endorsed was a systemwide UN code of conduct. Under the heading “Harassment and abuse of authority,” it says:



“Harassment in any shape or form is an affront to human dignity and international civil servants must not engage in any form of harassment. International civil servants have the right to a workplace environment free of harassment or abuse. All organizations must prohibit any kind of harassment. Organizations have a duty to establish rules and provide guidance on what constitutes harassment and abuse of authority and how unacceptable behaviour will be addressed.



“International civil servants must not abuse their authority or use their power or position in a manner that is offensive, humiliating, embarrassing or intimidating to another person.”



The International Civil Service Commission, which has 15 commissioners from around the world and a staff of about 40 people, is not a remote body based far from the UN. It is across the street from UN headquarters in a building housing other UN offices. Yet for months, the UN Secretariat, including the office of the secretary-general, took the position that technically, the commission was an independent entity, having been created by the General Assembly and fully in charge of its own affairs.



Equality Now took issue with that explanation from the start. Yasmeen Hassan, the organization’s global executive director, said in a letter to Guterres in July, endorsed by nine other advocacy groups, “You are in a unique position to defend your staff against harassment, physical and psychological, by any others in the United Nations workplace.”



Although the complaint filed in November 2017 could have been acted on quickly, it took five months for the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the UN’s investigative arm, to begin considering the case and apparently to decide whether it had standing to investigate the commission.



When the investigation began, another seven months elapsed before it issued a report, according to the Inter Press Service, which has a global readership. The findings were sent to the commission in mid-December 2018 and have not been made public by that body or by the Secretariat.



Throughout the time that Rhodes was under investigation, he carried on blithely ignoring the complaints. For example, in a speech on July 9, he congratulated himself on the successes of his tenure.



“Twelve years ago when I was first appointed Chair of the Commission, I set out my vision for a revitalized Commission, which would reassert its leadership role and deepen engagement with the overall reform taking place in the organizations of the United Nations common system,” he said.



“At the time, I urged members of the Commission to recommit to the concept of a unified, high performing, merit-based international civil service which emphasizes and rewards performance. . . . Looking back, I take pride in seeing how much has been accomplished and the extent to which we were able to realise that vision together.”



Rhodes was allowed to continue in his post without interference from fellow commissioners or Guterres until less than two weeks from his scheduled retirement date. The details of what prompted his unexpected — earlier (so to speak) — resignation have not been made public.



He will be replaced as chairman by [Larbi Djacta](http://www.aps.dz/en/algeria/26436-algerian-larbi-djacta-elected-chairman-of-un-international-civil-service-commission) of Algeria. A member of the commission, Djacta is a diplomat who has also worked with UN peacekeeping.



After the resignation of Rhodes was announced, Shihana Mohamed, the complainant noted above and a leading figure in the campaign to expose the difficult conditions for women at the commission, publicized the details of her own experiences in a statement to Equality Now. She said, in an abridged version of her story:



“I was sexually harassed by the Chairman of the ICSC, Mr. Kingston Rhodes, for over 10 years — and I was not the only one,” Mohamed said. “Because I said NO to his repeated sexual advances, Mr. Rhodes denied me promotions, and excluded me from duty travels, training, assignments, projects, Commission sessions and working groups. In 2016, I was on sick leave for 3 months due to the stress caused by the hostile office environment and retaliation by the ICSC management.



“His quiet resignation just two weeks before the end of his term is a slap in my face and barely a slap on his wrist.”

"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today came out in support of “lights out” during Earth Hour (Saturday 29th) but claimed the time should be renamed “Dark Hour” and suggested that consumers should also forgo the consumption of gasoline and diesel during this period.
The chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that consumers should spend the hour they sit in the dark with no transport, air conditioning or hot coffee, remembering the contribution that carbon fuels have made to modern society.

“And while contemplating this hour of darkness, they should steel themselves for the hour when, if the Global warming alarmists have their way, this will become a necessity not a nicety.
“The only thing that lifted mankind from the Stone Age was carbon energy from charcoal, coal, oil and gas – for heating; for steam power; for electricity and water; for mining, smelting and refining of metals; for transport on land, sea and air; for lighting, heating, cooling and communications; for production of food and chemicals; and for power for processing and manufacturing.
“All of this comfort, safety, convenience and prosperity is now threatened by hysterical claims that man’s carbon emissions can and should be stopped. Even though the weather records and the science deny the doomsday forecasts, the politicians, like lemmings, are leading us over the Greenhouse Cliff. Without the nuclear parachute, it will not be a pleasant fall. 
“Many other countries have already experienced their own dark days, most caused by silly decisions taken to appease the Greenhouse Gods.
“If we continue down this path, we can no longer assume that electricity will come at the flick of a switch. Consumers need to learn a new vocabulary for these bad new times – “load shedding, demand management, quota allocation, rolling blackouts, brownouts, emission permits, load prioritisation, interruptible customers, emergency customers, zone rota systems, power emergency declarations, priority lines, three-day-week rationing, power outages, grid instability, electricity rationing, operating reserve, maintenance shutdowns . . . ” all the jargon of a power system in crisis, suffering from stagnant or falling capacity and growing demand.
“One of the first places to experience power shortages was, appropriately enough, California in the early 2000’s, where Deep Greens have harassed and delayed every practical method of generating base-load power. The operating reserve margin in California is now about 5% whereas 15% is considered safe. More “Dark Hours” can be expected there. And their Green Tick solar collectors will produce 12 Dark Hours EVERY DAY.
“Then came South Africa, which was forced to shut its big mines for several hours because of insufficient power to guarantee safe operation of the hoists. The South African government has now admitted that demand for electricity will exceed supply until 2013 – five years of dark hours are in prospect there. 
“Then it was China’s turn. The Global Cooling of 2007 plus insufficient generating capacity and inadequate coal stocks caused widespread power failures. Whole regions and millions of people were forced to cope with blizzards without power for days. Power blackouts and brownouts hit 17 Chinese provinces.
“Then one day in Texas recently, the wind dropped, the whirling blades stopped turning, power supply collapsed and load shedding commenced before the old reliables of coal, nuclear or gas could pick up the slack.
“The aging European power grids are now also subject to similar disruptions from the intermittent supply from unreliable sources like wind and solar. However France has been very canny by building large nuclear capacity, then agitating for decarbonisation for their competitors. Foolish Germany got sucked into this caper, but also committed to phase out their nuclear power. It is not possible to cut both nuclear power and carbon emissions at the same time without morbid consequences. Germans can only continue this rot while their accommodating neighbours will sell them the power.
“Across Africa, the Americas and the -stans, the same problem appears – an aging power grid and an orchestrated campaign to delay and deter new power stations.
“Even here in Queensland, the coal capital of the world, a few blackouts in 2004 revealed an over-loaded and under-funded electricity grid. There may be a few more Dark Hours for us, at less convenient times. 
“Australia and New Zealand both live in cuckoo land, believing they can maintain living standards in the face of population growth while drastically cutting carbon emissions and prohibiting nuclear power. Saturday’s “Dark Hour” caper may be just a practice run.
“So, let us all in Australia and New Zealand spend our “Dark Hour” thinking on the realities of life – such as where we will get the electricity, motor fuel, food and jobs for our kids and grandkids if we allow the Deep Greens to destroy our backbone industries, on the false promise that our sacrifice will improve the future climate. 
To steal a phrase from my friend, Rod Bates: “On Saturday night, after they have turned off their lights, I suggest the participants in Earth Hour wander down to the nearest beach, pee into the sea and observe what effect it has on the tide.”
“This will illustrate the effect that cutting man-made carbon emissions will have on future climate.”
Additional Notes:
Both the science and the past records are indicating very strongly that man-made carbon dioxide has negligible consequences for climate change. For a very good summary of the science, by a scientist, in plain language see: www.middlebury.net/op-ed/global-warming-01.html
Given the political momentum for the introduction of damaging policies such as Emissions Trading or Carbon Taxes, Carbon Sense repeats its call for a joint ANZ Royal Commission into the science of man-made global warming.  Carbon Sense strongly believes that only through settling the science will the truth emerge.” See: www.carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/royal-commission.pdf

PS. Since the above statement was released I received an email on Monday 31st March 2008 from a South African associate, Will Alexander, a respected water engineer and Professor Emeritus of the Department of Civil and Biosystems Engineering of the University of Pretoria. (His studies of rainfall patterns also demolishes any dominant role for man-made CO2 in climate cycles.) Here is a direct quote from Pretoria, on the future facing all of us unless we wake up:
“The planned electricity blackouts also start on Monday. In our suburb the power will be switched off from 10.00 to 12.30 on alternate days of the week excluding Sundays. In addition, Eskom is urging all of us to make personal sacrifices such as switching off our geysers during daylight hours and hanging up our clothes to dry instead of using clothes driers. Cosatu has threatened to have nation-wide strikes because of the job losses. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has expressed his concern about the effect that the proposed 60% increase in electricity tariff on top of the load shedding will have on our national economy. 
“Looking on the brighter side all that is missing is the air raid sirens and Vera Lynn singing “We’ll meet again” on the battery operated radio set.”

You’d think that even running a fish and chip shop would teach you a little diplomacy. You know, simple stuff like don’t be rude to customers and especially the regular ones that spend the most. _Newshub_[reports](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/jacinda-ardern-dismisses-phone-call-from-australian-pm-scott-morrison-during-coronavirus-update.html).



Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been caught awkwardly ignoring a call from Australian leader Scott Morrison during a press conference – a move The Project co-host Jeremy Corbett has likened to “treating ScoMo like he’s treated climate change”.



[…]While answering a question regarding a trans-Tasman collaboration to evacuate Australasians from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in China, Ardern looked down at her buzzing phone on the lectern.



[…]She brushed off the interruption, adding that New Zealand and Australia are “in close contact” over “the work we are doing on the ground” and “the situation of our citizens and residents”.



So let’s see. A press conference is more important than answering a call from our closest, and one of our most important, allies. Not that it would have surprised the Aussies of [course](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/australian-govt-has-had-enough-of-arderns-sanctimonious-hypocrisy/).



[…]The Project co-host Jeremy Corbett couldn’t help but take a dig at the situation on Tuesday’s episode.



“Our closest ally, she screens the call – treating ScoMo like he’s treated climate change,” he quipped.



Jeremy Corbett can take his fake “bloke” humour and go f*ck himself as far as I’m concerned. Here he’s shown himself to be nothing but a leftist twat. The only ones who think the Aussie PM has been ignoring climate change are the climate alarmist left.



And if you’re looking for proof that NZ comedy has gone one hundred percent political and has been taken over by the Left there it is right there.

"It is getting closer to midnight. On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a   interview, explained why the board had included the   mark in the measurement. She said that it was an   signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note. ” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action. ” In an   for The New York Times, Dr. Titley and Dr. Krauss elaborated on their concerns, citing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, as well as President Trump’s pledges to impede what they see as progress on both fronts, as reasons for moving the clock closer to midnight. “Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person,” they wrote. “But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter. ” The board has held the responsibility for the clock’s movements since 1973, when the bulletin’s editor, Eugene Rabinowitch, died. Composed of scientists, and nuclear and climate experts, the board meets biannually to discuss where the clock’s hands should fall in light of world events. In the 1950s, the scientists feared nuclear annihilation, and since then, the board has begun to consider other existential threats, including climate change, compromised biosecurity and artificial intelligence. There were crises that the clock was not quick enough to take into account. The Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, in 1962, did not change the hands of the clock, which at the time stood at seven minutes to midnight. An explanation on the Bulletin’s website accounts for this seeming lapse in timekeeping: “The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks,” it says. “However, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing. ” The end of the Cold War came as a relief to those who had lived in fear of nuclear annihilation for decades, and the minute hand slowly moved away from danger. In 1990, it was at 10 minutes to midnight. The next year, it was a full 17 minutes away, at the relatively undisturbing time of 11:43. “The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away,” the Bulletin said at the time. But over the next two decades the clock slowly ticked back. Conflict between India and Pakistan, both of whom staged nuclear weapons tests three weeks apart, had the clock at nine minutes to midnight in 1998. By 2007, fears about Iranian and North Korean nuclear capacity had pushed it to 11:55. By 2015, the scientists were back in a state of unmitigated concern, with the clock at three minutes to midnight, the closest it had been since 1984. “Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity,” the bulletin said. “World leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe. ” “These failures of political leadership endanger every person on Earth,” it added."

**Public health officials should**



twitter #CatoCOVID



In medical and environmental policy, scientists play prominent roles in decisions. Agencies such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency have scientific advisory councils that review the relevant scientific literature and advise policy decisionmakers about pollution exposure standards and pharmaceutical and medical device safety. When the decisions of governmental officials do not follow scientific recommendations, critical news coverage follows. The implication is that “science” is sufficient for policy decisions and that “politics” should not play a role.



The discussion about science and politics is occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent _New Yorker_ article lauded Iceland’s response to the pandemic because the prime minister deferred to scientists in her decisions: “It was very clear from the beginning that this was something that should be led by experts—by scientific and medical experts.” In the United States, 57 former scientists and public health officials issued a statement calling for a science‐​based approach to the pandemic. The signatories said, “Sidelining science has already cost lives, imperiled the safety of our loved ones, compromised our ability to safely reopen our businesses, schools, and places of worship, and endangered the health of our democracy itself.”



But scientific findings, by themselves, are rarely sufficient for individual or policy decisions. Such findings can tell us about the causes of outcomes _but nothing more_. The question of how we should evaluate those outcomes in our own decisionmaking requires other considerations, such as costs, benefits, and philosophical or religious values. And the relative importance of those considerations will vary across individuals. Finally, aggregating those individual differences into collective policy decisions involves even further nonscientific choices about the relative importance of different individual preferences about outcomes. So even under the best circumstances, policy decisions involve more than science, and in the case of COVID-19, our scientific knowledge is very limited.



What is science? Science is an ongoing discussion about the testing of hypotheses of cause and effect through experiments and comparison with the possibility that random variation produced the same outcome.



Researchers can be either too cautious or too cavalier about concluding that the results of inquiry reflect real cause and effect rather than random variation. Confidence that results reflect real cause and effect increases with replication by other experimenters and the magnitude of the result relative to the number of data points under study.



How cavalier or cautious should scientists be about their results? Ironically and importantly there is no scientific answer to this question. Instead there are only adopted conventions. Scientists are usually reluctant to say a result is “real” rather than the result of normal variation around zero effect unless they are 95 percent confident that the result did not arise simply because random variation happened to produce an outcome that appears to be a “real effect.” But even if a scientist is 95 percent confident, 5 percent of the time the observed result arises simply through sampling variation rather than a “real” effect. And 95 percent confidence is a convention.



How confident one should be in hypothesis testing is a value choice and not scientifically determined. Experimental physicists, for example, take the concern for avoiding “false positive” results to the extreme. They use what is referred to as the five‐​sigma rule, which allows a result to be considered “real” only if the probability of a false positive result is less than 1-in-3.5 million, which translates to 99.99997 percent confident. If medical science adhered to such a rule, there would be no accepted results.



Regardless of the false‐​positive acceptance rate a researcher chooses, the number of observations dictates our ability to differentiate a small result from no result. In the context of any medical treatment, including vaccines or antiviral medication for COVID-19, our ability to declare the treatment “safe” after clinical trial results depends on the number of subjects in the trial (as well as representativeness of the participants). Side effects that affect only small percentages of the population will manifest themselves with 95 percent confidence only after the medication is widely used because clinical trials have thousands rather than millions of participants.



Table 1 shows how much larger (in percentage) that the harmful effect of a medication or vaccine would have to be in the experimental group relative to the control group to allow us to state with 95 percent confidence that the negative effect is the result of the medication rather than random variation. If scientists or policymakers wanted to ensure that the negative side effects of a vaccine affected only 0.1 percent of those who received it, the trial would require 2.9 million people. While 0.1 percent might seem small, 0.1 percent of the U.S. population is 330,000 people. Thus, a vaccine trial with almost 3 million people that passed a clinical trial test with 95 percent confidence would not preclude the possibility that universal administration of the vaccine would have negative side effects on 330,000 people. Whether that is acceptable is not a scientific question.



Scientists occasionally interject values into their recommendations—not in the pervasive, subtle, and unavoidable manner previously described but in obviously avoidable ways that undermine their role as neutral providers of information. A prominent example occurred when 1,300 public health officials signed a May 30, 2020, letter of support for the public protests in the wake of the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. But the same officials had earlier condemned public protests against mandatory business closures.



Why the difference? A _New York Times_ article asked, “Was public health advice in a pandemic dependent on whether people approved of the mass gathering in question?” According to the article, “To many, the answer seemed to be ‘yes.’” Mark Lurie, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University said, “Instinctively, many of us in public health feel a strong desire to act against accumulated generations of racial injustice. But we have to be honest: A few weeks before, we were criticizing protesters for arguing to open up the economy and saying that was dangerous behavior. I am still grappling with that.”



To his credit, Lurie recognized the failure to separate his role as a scientist from his role as a citizen with views about public policy after he took his daughter to a protest early in June. “We felt afterward that the risk we incurred probably exceeded the entire risk in the previous two months,” he said. “We undid some very hard work, and I don’t see how actions like that can help in battling this epidemic, honestly.”



Luckily, it appears little damage was done by this crossing of the boundaries between science and politics. A recent paper using cellphone tracking data shows that cities with protests saw increased social distancing compared to cities that did not have protests—presumably because nonprotestors changed their behavior. And net COVID-19 case growth did not differentially increase in those cities that experienced protests.



Though by itself “science” cannot dictate our personal or policy choices, in some cases the information it provides can make those choices rather clear with few additional considerations. If the benefits or harms of a medical decision (such as taking a medicine or vaccine) are large and discontinuous (an abrupt change in outcome with respect to exposure or dose), even with the confidence‐​interval and sample‐​size qualifications previously described, then “science” leads fairly easily to decisions. If the harm from a medication or vaccine increases abruptly with the dose and the benefits do not decrease abruptly below that dose, then the appropriate dose is below the threshold at which side effects appear.



In the COVID-19 pandemic, the wearing of masks seemed initially to fall into the category of decisions that follow simply and directly from the science. The problem is that new evidence led scientists to change their understanding of viral transmission. At the start of 2020, scientists thought that coronavirus transmission occurred only from people exhibiting symptoms, such as its genetic cousin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) does. Thus, general mask wearing was a waste of resources and reduced those supplies available to those dealing with active infections. Hence, the early universal public health advice was not to wear masks.



But evidence accumulated that asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission was real and large; 35–60 percent of infections cause no symptoms. Thus, the advice to stay home if you’re sick may have been insufficient. More aggressive measures, such as ordering healthy people to wear masks, may have been necessary.



The transition from masks are not required and not helpful to masks are required and you are irresponsible if you do not wear one was not easy even for scientists. European public health scientists resisted the claims of asymptomatic transmission. As the _New York Times_ reported:



Sweden’s public health agency declared that [the original journal article reporting asymptomatic transmission] had contained major errors. The agency’s website said, unequivocally, that “there is no evidence that people are infectious during the incubation period”—an assertion that would remain online in some form for months. French health officials, too, left no room for debate: “A person is contagious only when symptoms appear,” a government flyer read. “No symptoms = no risk of being contagious.”



Science is always a conversation about current knowledge and new results.



Science is always a conversation about current knowledge and new results. And science is by its nature conservative in that it worries greatly about accepting new or unusual results because they may be the result of random error or mistakes. But sometimes that conservatism is wrong. And that appears to have been the case with asymptomatic coronavirus transmission and the utility of generalized mask wearing. Researchers have not conducted trials, but when people wore masks in a seafood plant and on a cruise ship, the proportion of severe cases decreased dramatically, reducing hospitalizations and deaths.



All nonscientists have noticed, however, that the surgeon general of the United States has dramatically reversed course. In late February he tweeted, “Seriously people‐ STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!” By early July he told NBC’s Today, “As we talk about Fourth of July and independence, it’s important to understand that if we all wear these, we will actually have more independence and more freedom because more places will be able to stay open. We’ll have less spread of the disease.”



This reversal, along with the contradictory advice of epidemiologists toward demonstrations, has left many people skeptical of experts and expertise.



Absent an abrupt change in benefits or harms, recommended behaviors do not depend on the science alone; other considerations and their importance are relevant, including economic costs and benefits as well as religious or philosophical values. Policy disagreements are largely about the differing weight that people assign to these other considerations. Science does not tell us how to weigh incrementally increased risk of COVID-19 transmission against other values, such as freedom to operate a business or pursue one’s livelihood. This statement doesn’t refer only to the daily fight between supporters and opponents of President Trump regarding the value of returning to a “normal” economy. John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, made an argument about the role of values in the context of deciding to reopen the university during the COVID-19 pandemic.



If we gave the first principle [to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff and their loved ones] absolute priority, our decision about reopening would be easy. We would keep everyone away until an effective vaccine was universally available.



However, were we to take that course, we would risk failing to provide the next generation of leaders the education they need and to do the research and scholarship so valuable to our society. How ought these competing risks be weighed? No science, simply as science, can answer that question. It is a moral question in which principles to which we are committed are in tension.



Even under the best of circumstances, “science” can lead easily to policy choices only if the relevant research results are large and discontinuous and if there are no other competing considerations. In all other circumstances, decisions follow from “science” only with the addition of values that allow us to assess the relative importance of outcomes. And because individuals weigh these other considerations differently, collective choices involve conflict about how to aggregate individual differences in the evaluation of those outcomes.



The use of “science” as a guide to COVID-19 policy is even more complicated because our scientific knowledge about infectious respiratory diseases is limited. The data analytic site _FiveThirtyEight_ put it more bluntly: “Why It’s So Freaking Hard to Make a Good COVID-19 Model.” In the 1918 influenza outbreak, why did the spring wave go away, and why did it come back in the fall? Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, says, “We don’t know.” In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) feared that SARS would return in a devastating wave that fall, but instead it was extinguished. In 2009, experts worried that the H1N1 flu would be severe, but it was not. “You’ve got to have a lot of humility with these viruses,” Osterholm said. “I know less about viruses than I did 10 years ago.”



Dr. Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a legend in the battles against Ebola and AIDS. But he misjudged the coronavirus, “I underestimated this one—how fast it would spread. My mistake was to think it was like SARS, which was pretty limited in scope. Or that it was like influenza. But it’s neither.” If he didn’t know how to react to the coronavirus in real time, who would?



On February 20, when the WHO was reporting the existence of 79,748 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, Philip Tetlock’s superforecasters (people with alleged expertise) thought that the probability of more than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 being reported by the WHO only one month later on March 20 was about 3 percent. The actual number that the WHO reported on March 20 was over 266,000.



Not only is our scientific understanding of respiratory viruses limited, but the coronavirus has characteristics that make the use of scientific inferences about it as a guide to policy even more difficult. First, given the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, stopping transmission by confining only those who are sick is not effective because so many people do not know they are infected. Second, the false negative rate for the polymerase chain reaction active virus tests is about 33 percent and maybe more among the asymptomatic. Thus, even among those who are tested, a third have the virus but are declared not to have it and can transmit it to others. Third, active virus tests also generate false positive results because of the presence of genetic fragments from the virus but no actual infection. Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University, told the _New York Times_, “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.” This happens with viruses. Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body. The implication of these three characteristics of COVID-19 is that figuring out in real time which people to isolate from whom to stop viral transmission is very difficult.



Even if we could identify all infected individuals in real time and resources existed to follow them and their contacts (and U.S. attempts at contact tracing seem extremely ineffective), many contract tracing exercises would find no infections. During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, 89 percent of patients did not appear to transmit the disease. In the COVID-19 pandemic this year, a husband and wife in Illinois both became gravely ill and were hospitalized. Both recovered. State public health officials traced their contacts—372 people, including 195 health care workers. Not a single contact became infected. A new study suggests that the coronavirus arrived in places around the world more than once without starting runaway outbreaks. In these cases, there was little or no transmission, and the virus simply died out.



So the belief that expertise in infectious viruses provides obvious and clear answers for policy is misguided. And that is why we observe so much variation worldwide in the modeling recommendations of epidemiologists. Should decisionmakers rely on the model developed at the University of Pennsylvania or the model developed at the University of Washington? The former suggested that the District of Columbia would need 1,453 ventilators; the latter suggested it would need 107. Neither England nor Sweden initially implemented lockdown orders. But on March 16, 2020, Imperial College London published a model that predicted over 500,000 deaths in the United Kingdom, and it embraced a lockdown while Sweden did not. Japan limited testing to only the most severe cases even though it has the oldest population of any country in the world (unless you count Monaco), and the government never forced businesses to close. Yet Japan’s reported COVID-19 mortality rate is low. If science is the answer, which scientists do you listen to when they disagree?



Even though perfect science is rare, and even then it rarely translates directly into decisions, and even though infectious disease knowledge, in general, and coronavirus knowledge, in particular, is strikingly incomplete, why is science invoked so often as _the_ answer? In the language of economics, the invocation of science is the equilibrium outcome of the interaction of public officials, scientists, and the public.



Most people don’t understand science; most people don’t understand statistics; most people don’t understand what scientists do, how they argue, or what the scientific method is.



First, science serves the interests of public officials. Science legitimizes policy decisions and reduces discussion about them. Most people don’t understand science; most people don’t understand statistics; most people don’t understand what scientists do, how they argue, or what the scientific method is. In some ways, the “scientific community” is akin to a modern version of the priesthood. 



Scientists wear lab coats instead of vestments, but like clerics, they have the authority that comes with access to knowledge unavailable to laypersons. Insisting that we yield to their judgment can be very useful in policy debate because it elevates some policy preferences relative to others. Instead of having to say that you would like the policy outcome to reflect your preferences rather than someone else’s, you invoke science: “‘Science’ has concluded that my preferences are legitimate and that your preferences are out of bounds.” Robert Pindyck describes this in the context of climate science: “The use of a complex IAM [Integrated Assessment Model] or related model throws a curtain over our lack of knowledge, and creates a veneer of scientific legitimacy that suggests we know more than we do.” 



Second, for some scientists, expertise is power. For many, science is simply the investigation of how the world works and nothing else. Stanley W. Trimble, professor of geography emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, “I learned early on to avoid academic bandwagons of any sort and that true scholarship can scarcely abide political causes.” For some, scientific expertise allows you to lead and others to follow analogous to the role that priests played for rulers in pre‐​modern civilizations. In the words of Roger Pielke, who studies the role of science in public policy, “For those with scientific expertise, it consequently makes perfect sense to wage political battles through science because it necessarily confers to scientists a privileged position in political debate.” 



Third, for the public, following expertise is a rational response to the complex division of labor that exists in the modern world. Each of us knows a tiny slice of the world very well and very little about anything else. We all rely on others’ knowledge except for the very few things we have mastered. In addition, when decisions involve important matters such as health, relying on experts can relieve the anxiety associated with important decisions. 



Finally, in the current pandemic, favoring “science” has become shorthand for saying, “I worry about COVID-19 more than I do about the economy or freedom or anything else.” It has also become shorthand for saying, “I don’t like any other approach to the pandemic including President Trump’s.” But it seems no one criticized the president of Notre Dame as being anti‐​science because he decided to reopen the university even though he wouldn’t have if minimizing the risk of infection had been his only objective. 



At its best, science explains relationships between cause and effect: no more and no less. No normative conclusions about individual or collective decisions follow directly from science. Instead costs, benefits, and other values properly enter both individual and collective decisions.



Sadly, science about infectious respiratory diseases, in general, and the coronavirus, in particular, is limited, creating more difficulties in the use of scientific understanding to inform decisions. Leading virologists have been very open about how little we know about the 1918 flu pandemic as well as SARS and MERS and how their initial views about coronavirus transmission were anchored in their understanding of SARS and MERS, which turned out to be incorrect for COVID-19.



For this coronavirus, about 35–60 percent of infections cause no symptoms. The conventional wisdom at the start of 2020 was that could not possibly be true. And thus, experts advised against masks except for those in obvious infection settings. But now asymptomatic infection has quickly become the new conventional wisdom, and wearing a mask is a wise choice. To scientists this is just good updating given new information, but this abrupt change has caused many nonscientists to give up on the idea of expertise.



In addition to asymptomatic transmission, the test for the virus has large false negative rates. And molecular evidence suggests that the virus arrived more than once in the past year with little or no transmission. The combined result of all the characteristics of COVID-19 is that in real time, identifying whom to isolate to reduce viral transmission is very difficult.



The essential problem with the role of science in public policy is that some scientists, most politicians, and the public want science to do more than it can. Some scientists want to tell others what to do. Expertise is not only information; for some it is power. Most politicians want to hide behind the veil of science so that they do not have to openly discuss why they favor some outcomes over others. It is much easier to say, “The experts made me do it.” And finally, the public and journalists often want “answers” particularly about “safe” and “unsafe” rather than nuanced statements about likely changes in health outcomes given various behaviors or exposures. Science actually can tell us more when the pressure for it to answer all our questions is less.

For years David Bellamy was one of the best known faces on TV.
A respected botanist and the author of 35 books, he had presented around 400 programmes over the years and was appreciated by audiences for his boundless enthusiasm.
Yet for more than 10 years he has been out of the limelight, shunned by bosses at the BBC where he made his name, as well as fellow scientists and environmentalists.
His crime? Bellamy says he doesn’t believe in man-made global warming.

Reasonable minds differ on the science of global warming. Even if they didn’t — even if the science were settled — anyone familiar with the federal government’s track record on large‐​scale regulation ought to harbor serious doubts about Washington’s anti‐​climate‐​change efforts. And while climate hysteria dominates the environmental argument within the spheres of politics and science, few realize just how far its influence extends.



In _Climate Coup: Global Warming’s Invasion of Our Government and Our Lives_ , Patrick J. Michaels edits a collection of essays offering shocking insights into the impact of globalwarming alarmism on the law, the scientific peer‐​review process, global security, trade, international economic development, and public education.



Michaels, senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of _Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don’t Want You to Know_ , introduces the book’s eight chapters, in which academics and policy experts sketch the landscape of global‐​warming alarmism’s reach. Roger Pilon and Evan Turgeon show how, while James Madison, the father of the Constitution, thought that “the powers of the new government would be ‘few and defined,’ ” the modern executive branch, “in the name of addressing global warming, is able to regulate virtually every human activity in this nation.”



Ross McKitrick offers a cautionary tale of bias within the peer‐​review process that acts as the gatekeeper to the scientific literature. He recounts the two years he spent “trying to publish a paper refuting an important claim in the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report,” a claim that “was not just wrong but was based on fabricated evidence.” He writes, “I did not expect a smooth ride, but the process eventually became surreal.”



Ivan Eland looks at the way the Department of Defense has used global warming as a justification for its own expansion under the umbrella of national security. Sallie James shows how politicians, in an effort to appear active on the climate‐​change issue while not offending special‐​interest groups, have proposed “trade‐​related measures [that] put the United States at risk of retaliation, litigation, or both from its global trading partners.”



Indur M. Goklany argues that developing nations will have little difficulty adapting to rising global temperatures, while Robert E. Davis debunks many of the most pervasive myths about global warming and public health. “The litany of human health impacts from global warming goes on and on,” he writes. “It’s safe to say that these (and other) health impacts either will not happen or will not be nearly as severe as the predictions.” Neal McCluskey ends Climate Coupwith a look at global‐​warming alarmism in public education and its pernicious effects. “When what we will need are rational, well‐​informed adults, what we will get is either people who know little or nothing about climate change or people who are scared to death about it,” he writes.



In his introduction, Michaels offers a striking observation by way of a parade of horribles: “When students are threatened with death from global warming, when our military raises the threat of war from global warming, when the state has the apparatus to run our lives because of global warming without any additional legislation, when our Congress legislates tariffs that could provoke trade wars because of global warming, when the threats of global warming to the developing world are egregiously exaggerated, when the biomedical community hypes unfounded health and mortality fears, and when the scientific peer‐​review process becomes skewed against anything moderate, we have witnessed a coup.”



 _Climate Coup_ exposes the sordid details of this process.

For such a normally astute politician, Australian prime minister, **Scott Morrison** , was shockingly wrong-footed by Australia’s bushfire crisis and the political and media hysteria that followed. Slowly, the government is moving to recover from the political firestorm.



While presumably judging – correctly, as it happens – that the federal government’s role in such emergencies is all-but-nonexistent, Morrison’s decision to take a family holiday was still inexplicably ham-fisted. He must have known that organisational realities be damned, the media-elite would pounce like hyenas. Feelings and empty gestures are the currency of today’s media. Doing takes a long second to being **seen** – especially being seen doling out hugs for the cameras as if they were emergency supplies.



But, in the process of struggling to regain political control, Morrison has risked alienating the very voters who delivered the Coalition such a stunning electoral victory. Inasmuch as elections are ever about specific issues, the Australian electorate emphatically rejected the sort of ‘climate action’ that the Greens and the globalists are demanding. So, when Morrison and his ministers seemed to be surrendering to the ‘it wuz climate change!’ narrative, many Coalition voters began to wonder if they were returning to the bad, old days of **Malcolm Turnbull** , the wannabe-Green masquerading as a Liberal.



Such fears may yet prove to be unfounded. Morrison has summarily [slapped into line](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/scott-morrison-slams-matt-kean-claims-over-cabinet-climate-claims/news-story/0ae3a33564bcdd33de67ea2d4bc9de36) one Coalition state backbencher who tried to link the bushfires to the government’s climate policies. He’s also putting pressure back on the states who are responsible for the parks which exploded into firestorms this summer.



Scott Morrison has called for a ­national standard for bushfire hazard-­reduction burns and ­declared that tracking measures to cut fuel loads is at least as important as monitoring Australia’s carbon emissions.



In fact, Morrison is taking the rhetorical fight right up to the [Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/), illustrating how climate alarmism is not just foolish, but dangerously ignores real problems.



In the wake of the bushfires crisis, the Prime Minister criticised the fact there were clear rules and transparency arrangements for reporting on emissions but not on mitigation measures.



He highlighted hazard-reduction burns, land-clearing laws and management of native vegetation and national parks as critical state issues that had to be scrutinised.



“We report all the time on what our emissions reductions are but across the country there is not a national system of reporting to track how hazard reduction is progressing,” Mr Morrison said on Tuesday night.



Morrison also takes a swipe at negligent Labor state governments.



“These are all responsibilities of the states and I’m not making any argument for the federal ­government to be intervening in any of these areas but it is a very reasonable expectation people have that there are national ­standards, that there is transparency around how this is being achieved.



“Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season.”



This is a direct hit at the states, especially the Andrews socialist government, which have comprehensively failed to meet their hazard-reduction obligations. If there are any ‘arsonists’ in Australian politics, it’s governments who pandered to the Green-left and allowed staggering amounts of fuels to build up for years.



Morrison is also opening a front on what so many keyboard experts have completely failed to comprehend: that Australia’s federal system prevents Canberra from acting in areas that are supposed to be state responsibilities. When the Morrison government finally got sick of waiting for the states to step up and summarily sent in Army Reservists, he was on shaky constitutional grounds: grounds he’s obviously trying to secure.



Mr Morrison wants any royal commission to look at the legality of the federal government calling out the Australian Defence Force to respond to a natural disaster.



Three thousand reservists were called out in January on a compulsory basis to help in the bushfire recovery.



“I want to know when the trigger line is. I want to know where the authority is established for the prime minister, for the federal government, to be able to take the initiative and move in and direct getting these resources in place where we believe life and property is under threat and we believe we can play a constructive role,” Mr Morrison said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader has brought my attention to more new papers. I haven’t found any mention of them at other sites like WUWT. Perhaps they aren’t able to get through the Gate of Willis.
At any rate, just because I choose to bring them up, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I agree with them. I do strongly feel, however, that these papers need to be brought to the public’s attention. They have, after all, gone through the peer-review process and appeared in respectable journals.
The latest paper NTZ wishes to present today is one lead-authored by Chantal Camenisch of the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern in Switzerland, appearing in the Journal Climate of the Past bearing the title: “The early Spörer Minimum – a period of extraordinary climate and socio-economic changes in Western and Central Europe“.
Obviously, just as dozens of other papers have shown already, low solar activity has something to do with cooling climates, famine and socioeconomic collapse. So it’s probably a very good thing the 20th century saw high solar activity, but a bad thing that we may be starting an extended period of low solar activity.
The papers abstract:
Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality. Climate model simulations show that periods with cold winters and strong seasonality are associated with internal climate variability rather than external forcing. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that the reconstructed extreme climatic conditions during this decade occurred by chance and in relation to the partly chaotic, internal variability within the climate system.
Again here climate science seems to have the chronic habit of blaming unexpected cold or warming pauses on “chance”, as the above paper does. Yet, under the bottom line, the paper is just the latest confirming that climate swings and fluctuations are indeed natural and have always happened in the past. Often solar activity is very much in the works.
Moreover, today’s possible 0.05°C of warming we may have seen over the past 2 decades is nothing compared to the stuff we’ve seen before.
It’s time to end the hysterics.

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
On WUWT, Bob Tisdale recently examined the disparity of results between IPCC models in “No Consensus: Earth’s Top of Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in CMIP5-Archived (IPCC AR5) Climate Models” and wrote that
“There are astonishing differences in the modeled estimates of the past, present and future imbalances and the three components that make up the top of the atmosphere (TOA) energy budget.”
There were several earlier studies, but the supposed accuracy improved after satellite data became available. Rossow and Zhang did a study similar to Tisdale in a 1995 article titled, “Calculation of surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes from physical quantities based on ISCCP Data sets 2. Validation and first results.” 
Our validation studies suggest that the specification of cloud effects is no longer the dominant uncertainty in reconstructing the radiative fluxes at the top of atmosphere and at the surface. Rather cloud property uncertainties are now roughly equal contributors to the flux uncertainty, along with surface and atmospheric properties.
Erhard Raschke did a similar study in 2005 titled, “How well do we compute the insolation at TOA in radiation climatologies and in GCMs.” He found that,
In the spatial and temporal variations of the insolation at TOA as computed by 20 models participating in the AMIP-2 project and for the ISCCP data-set we discover that none of the models reproduced accurately the prescribed TSI value of 1365 Wm−2. 
Some of the factors listed as problematic were
Some models ignore leap years. Moreover, leap years are included in different ways either leading to a small increase (0.34 Wm−2) or decrease (0.92 Wm−2) of the annual mean of insolation at TOA. 
Most models produce seasonal insolation fields at TOA that deviate from their zonal means. More importantly, the corresponding latitudinal profiles (of zonal averages) differ, as illustrated by deviations to a “reference profile” (here: ISCCP data set). These different latitudinal gradients of insolation are expected to affect the atmospheric circulation in integrations over multiple years. The largest deviations exceed ±5 Wm−2 (in conjunction with extended low sun-elevation times) at high latitudes and polar regions. 
Figure 1 is a graph of the latitudinal discrepancies.

Figure 1
These discrepancies compare unfavorably to an absolute accuracy requirement for all radiation quantities at the TOA of 1.5 Wm−2 [Ohring et al., 2004].
Tisdale’s material shows that nobody, including the IPCC, dealt with Raschke’s recommendations.
We recommend that in all climate models and in all “radiation climatologies” the incoming solar radiation at TOA must be identical for any given time period and area on the globe. Modelers should use the real length of the tropical year. Since a similar analysis of IPCC AR4 simulations shows qualitatively the same deficiencies as described here for the AMIP simulations, we think, that there is a need for sensitivity tests that investigate impacts of detected differences in the TOA insolation on circulation structures developing in the model’s climate system.
The Real Problem
Maybe the problem is the same one associated with climate models in general. They are built on inadequate data and inadequate understanding of the structure and mechanisms of the real world. These problems are then exacerbated and aggravated by creating mechanisms to hide, ignore or even falsify the situation. As Raschke notes in a paper titled, “How accurate did GCMs compute the insolation at TOA for AMIP2?”
All models should reproduce the known major state and related fluxes of energy, mass and momentum with high accuracy. But quite large disagreement was found in various quantities, in particular at higher latitudes over both hemispheres [Gates et al., 1999].
Recently other articles (here, here, here and here) discussed the TOA, but they don’t tell you what or where it is. Here is one description that provides an explanation, but as with most climate science measures, it only adds to the confusion.
Technically, there is no absolute dividing line between the Earth’s atmosphere and space, but for scientists studying the balance of incoming and outgoing energy on the Earth, it is conceptually useful to think of the altitude at about 100 kilometers above the Earth as the “top of the atmosphere.” The top of the atmosphere is the bottom line of Earth’s energy budget, the Grand Central Station of radiation. It is the place where solar energy (mostly visible light) enters the Earth system and where both reflected light and invisible, thermal radiation from the Sun-warmed Earth exit. The balance between incoming and outgoing energy at the top of the atmosphere determines the Earth’s average temperature. The ability of greenhouses (sic) gases to change the balance by reducing how much thermal energy exits is what global warming is all about.
Consider the implication that TOA is a line 100km above the surface and equidistant around the Earth. Now look at the known structures of the atmosphere and factors that affect weather and climate.
Most weather occurs in the Troposphere, and that is far from uniform or spherical. There is inadequate horizontal surface data to construct the General Climate Models (GCM) and even less in the vertical. More layers make no difference if you have no data. William Ferrell proposed a three-cell model of circulation within the Troposphere in the 1850s (Figure 2). It is still in many textbooks, with the middle cell named after Ferrell, Figure 2 is from 2012.

Figure 2:
Figure 3 is a more recent approximation of what is going on within the Troposphere. Notice the Ferrell cell is now an “Indirect Cell”. There is a debate about whether it exists because the diagram shows an average condition. The Polar Front shifts seasonally, from approximately 38°N in the winter to 65°N in the summer. The Southern Hemisphere range is from 40°S to 65°S because of the land/water ratio difference

Figure 3
The top of the Tropopause also changes seasonally. The height at the Equator ranges between 17 and 18 km while it is 7 to 10 km at the Poles because of the greater seasonal temperature range. As the diagram shows, the Tropopause is a distinctive but not continuous boundary with breaks associated with the Jet Streams. All these factors affect the energy flows between the surface and the TOA. It is like trying to cross a very turbulent, fast flowing, constantly changing river. I suggest it is impossible to model such a complex dynamic system with virtually no data. There are serious limitations with accurate measures at high latitudes from the surface up.
Then there is the problem of the different direction of incoming solar radiation and outgoing irradiation. The Earth is a rotating sphere and that complicates everything. Figure 4 shows that solar energy strikes only half the Earth and varies considerably in the angle of incidence. The outgoing long wave passes through considerably different depths of the atmosphere with constantly varying constituencies including clouds, aerosols and gas levels.

Figure 4.
The Ozone layer also lies within the 100 km TOA. Usually, it is dealt with as a homogenous zone but in reality the interaction between ultraviolet radiation and oxygen varies considerably at different levels. It is not unusual for ozone levels to increase at one level while decreasing at another. It also varies considerably spatially as the so-called ozone hole attests.
Another important factor essentially ignored is magnetism and its influence on numerous components of the energy balance. I wrote about one possible relationship in a previous WUWT article. A Danish study by Mads Faurschou Knudsen and Peter Riisager showed a relationship between precipitation patterns and geomagnetism. They attribute the relationship to the same mechanism identified by Svensmark.
Their work, which only looks at Earth’s magnetism, does not include the distortion of the entire atmospheric system from the magnetosphere on down by the pressure of the solar wind. Figure 5 shows the impact on the upwind side and the elongation on the downwind side, but again this is a static image. In reality, the area of maximum pressure is constantly moving as the earth rotates.

Figure 5
In their introduction Mads et al., underline the general problems
It remains difficult to capture the complexity of Earth’s climate system in numerical models. A meaningful discussion of past and future climate variability cannot, therefore, rely solely on mechanistic computer models, but must, at least to some extent, be based on actual climate observations. Because the instrumental records are too short to elucidate several aspects of the climate system, new insights often have to rely on crude comparisons between climate-proxy records and potential climate-forcing factors recorded in geological archives. The controversial role of the Sun as a driver of climate change represents a good example, as geological proxy records are important for our endeavor to understand climate variability.
Tisdale focuses on the modeled oceans as one source of discrepancy in the TOA numbers. As he notes,
We can simply add ocean heat accumulation and TOA energy imbalance to the list of things that climate models do not simulate properly. 
A very good indication of the complexity of the problem of creating accurate models for the energy balance at the TOA is the fact Raschke noted a variation in results of plus (0.34 Wm−2) or minus (0.92 Wm−2) or a range of 1.26 Wm−2. Also, he found that
The largest deviations exceed ±5 Wm−2 (in conjunction with extended low sun-elevation times) at high latitudes and polar regions.
To put this in perspective, Lenaert Bengtsson, previously the Director of Research at ECMWF and Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology noted,
…the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases (including methane, nitrogen oxides and fluorocarbons) has increased by 2.5 watts per square meter since the mid-19th century.
As with most climate measures, the supposed impact of all greenhouse gases is less than the error factor in a multitude of the inadequate data sources.

"WASHINGTON  —   Sensing a political opportunity they have not had in more than a decade, social conservatives are preparing for a lengthy fight over abortion rights that promises to widen the culture war fissures that Republicans have tried for years to bridge. Two fights now loom in Washington that are galvanizing the right as it solidifies control of two branches of government and moves to dominate the third: an effort in Congress to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and President Trump’s forthcoming choice of a Supreme Court nominee. The choice for the court is likely to meet conservatives’ expectations. But fulfilling even a   goal of the   movement, like defunding Planned Parenthood, will be a longer and more complicated process than it appears, setting up an early and potentially defining test for the new president. Mr. Trump, an eager if improbable combatant in the cause, made bold promises about what he would do to restrict abortion if elected and, in turn, won overwhelming support from religious conservatives. Yet those promises are now tangled in intraparty politics and, in some cases at least, will be blocked by Senate Democrats. They include laws that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and permanently prohibit all federal funding, including Medicaid, from paying for abortions. Cutting off Planned Parenthood is part of the larger and messier debate over repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans so far have been unable to do. Even if the law is scrapped, there is no guarantee a Planned Parenthood funding ban could easily move forward, given that   women’s groups will bring intense pressure upon moderate Republicans to vote against it. On the other side of the spectrum among women’s groups is the Susan B. Anthony List, which has been lobbying to gut Planned Parenthood’s funding and is planning to target senators who may be wavering, especially in states where Mr. Trump won. “The commitments in the House and the Senate and in the White House are so strong, and the desire to get it signed is so palpable,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group’s president. “But like everything that’s worthwhile, it’s a crooked path. It gets more complicated as it gets more real. ” Mr. Trump has committed in writing to choosing a Supreme Court nominee who opposes abortion. But a Democratic filibuster of Mr. Trump’s choice  seems likely, which would force Republicans to confront the difficult question of jettisoning the Senate filibuster for all presidential nominees, once and for all. Not too far removed from the minority themselves, Senate Republicans have enjoyed the filibuster’s protections in the past. And many in the party are reluctant to move too hastily on it. While the ease and speed with which Republicans can act is in doubt, the new president’s commitment is not. Barely in office a week, Mr. Trump has already taken steps to reassure his   base. Earlier this week, he reinstituted a   policy prohibiting foreign aid to health providers abroad that discuss abortion as a family planning option. In a show of solidarity with the movement, Mr. Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence to speak at an   rally in Washington on Friday that is expected to draw thousands. The president’s appointments so far, both in his cabinet and among other senior White House positions, include many committed and longtime opponents of abortion. The attorney general nominee, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, has called Roe. v. Wade “one of the worst, colossally erroneous Supreme Court decisions of all time. ” Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s pick to be labor secretary, was an early advocate of legal efforts to define life at conception as a way of outlawing abortion. Tom Price, who is in line to become secretary of health and human services, has been a leading proponent of defunding Planned Parenthood in Congress. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway spent her time as a pollster and messaging expert before 2016, advising   groups and politicians on how to soften their approach when talking about the issue. Among her suggestions: telling a personal story about why they came to believe abortion is wrong. Mr. Trump adopted this approach during his campaign and spoke of two unnamed friends who ended up deciding against aborting a child he described now as “a total superstar. ” Ms. Conway is also a featured speaker at Friday’s rally in Washington, the annual March for Life. How Mr. Trump  —   a former Democrat who once declared, “I’m very pro choice”  —   became an unbowed voice for the   movement is a story of savvy political transformation and bald expedience. Women in the movement, like Ms. Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, once publicly declared themselves “disgusted” by him. But as it became clear he would be the Republican nominee, many social conservatives swallowed their pride to get behind him. To shore up their support, Mr. Trump pledged to name an   Supreme Court justice and largely turned the party platform over to social conservatives at last July’s Republican National Convention, which yielded numerous new provisions like the endorsement of a nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Mr. Trump went even further himself, disregarding Ms. Conway’s advice by talking about   abortion in the most graphic of terms, a move that endeared him to the movement’s supporters. Today, conservatives see his line “rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth” as a turning point in his campaign. In an interview, Ms. Conway marveled at how Mr. Trump had flipped the script. “I’ve been working on   messaging for two decades in this town,” she said. “And it took a billionaire man from Manhattan who had spent most of his life being   to deliver the most impassioned defense of life that many have ever heard. ” Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, said that many conservatives felt Mr. Trump spoke to them with that line in a way that other Republican nominees, like Mitt Romney, had been too timid to pursue. Mr. Romney barely spoke about abortion at all in the 2012 general election and when he did, it was often in the context of how he did not support further restrictions. “If you feel like your side is being pushed around and then someone comes around and says, ‘I may not be one of you, but I’m going to defend your views,’ they see that as loyalty,” Mr. Domenech said. “It’s a declaration of cultural war alliance. ” One quandary that Mr. Trump will surely face is meeting the expectations of a group of supporters so hungry for a victory after setting the bar so high. “The Trump administration presents us with a new opportunity: For the first time, really, we are able to interface with the federal government to achieve our goals,” said Dean Nelson, national outreach director of the Human Coalition, an   group. “We are cautiously optimistic. ”"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on voters to put the Greens and the ALP last on their ballot papers, with most government candidates just above them.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that he had listened with alarm and disbelief to the increasingly hysterical statements from the Greens and their copy cats in the opposition and the government.

“The Greens would like a carbon free world. We hope they volunteer themselves first in this suicidal ambition.
“Carbon is the essence of life and carbon dioxide is the gas which recycles the essence of life. These carbon killers would have us bury the gas of life in carbon cemeteries.
“However, despite the increasingly lurid horror stories being concocted regularly by the IPCC, it remains a fact that there is no evidence that man-made carbon dioxide is the key driver of world temperature.
“As a sacrifice to the Greenhouse religion, the ALP has just announced a silly, costly and unnecessary scheme to dictate the share of future energy supplies coming from so-called “alternative energy”.
“Alternative energy has always played a useful part in Australia’s energy mix, and the booming prices for oil, coal and uranium will ensure that this process accelerates.
“Alternative energy was not discovered by Bob Brown.
“Kangaroos running on grass power provided most of the energy needs for the aboriginal people for thousands of years. Then wind power, pushing the sailing clippers, brought the first Europeans to Australia and provided the first transport for our world trade. Cobb and Co coaches used horses running on hay and grain energy to create a huge land transport network in Australia. This provided a mail and passenger service better than the Government railways provide today. Then in the hungry thirties, rabbits and jumbucks running on grass power provided energy for many a swagman. Even today, millions of windmills, wood stoves, camp ovens and solar hot water systems are providing decentralised energy to outback Australia, and hydro-electricity still powers many city homes.
“However, to advocate the closing of all coal power stations (Greens) or just 20% of them by 2020 (ALP), is just too silly for words, and could only be done at great cost to every Australian consumer.
“Nature has already taken out Victoria’s biggest power station at Yallourn, and the Greens have invaded and called for closure of the huge Munmorah Power Station in NSW. If the drought causes any more cutbacks in Queensland’s generating capacity, we may soon experience a carbon free future as the power grid fails during the next heat wave. Or suburbia may find how little energy comes from solar panels and windmills on a freezing, still winter night.
“Carbon Sense is also opposed to the silly and unnecessary carbon caps and emission trading dreams of the Government, but of all the policies designed to prevent the sky from falling, this is the least silly. It will at least minimise the cost of killing carbon.
“It seems that only a few mavericks on the government side in parliament and some minor party and independent candidates are game to brave the abuse they would receive if they questioned the Greenhouse religion.
“We recommend that voters use the power of preferential voting to rank every one of them. Number every square. Put anyone who defends the gas of life first and the carbon killers last.”
Mr Viv Forbes

"Can I finally admit that my role model was a sitcom character? Mary Richards  —   played to perfection by the beloved Mary Tyler Moore  —   was more than a role model, she was a template. Even in fashion and home décor  —   my choices mimicked hers. Mary Tyler Moore had shown up just when everything about women’s lives was about to change. Her show debuted in 1970, when I was 19, still in college and not imagining a career in television  —   or a career in anything. But two years after Mary first joyfully threw her tam hat up in the air and joined   in Minneapolis, I began my television career in a city also ending in ’apolis. That part is coincidental, of course  —   but my home? Mary lived in a studio apartment with a pullout sofa bed, and not coincidentally so did I. And if my apartment was not quite so charming, it wasn’t for lack of copying. I didn’t yet have a style of my own, so whenever possible I borrowed Mary’s. A few years later, when to outward appearances, I was making it on my own, I was on the cover of Chicago Tribune magazine holding a   find  —   a large gold number “5”  —   for Channel 5, my new broadcast home. But in truth, the inspiration was Mary. She had a big   “M. ” It was affixed to the wall, part of the furniture, just like her highboy chest of drawers. I also had one of those. In Chicago, I moved up into a   condo in a high rise. Mary had also moved out of her studio and into a condo where she gives herself a housewarming. Her parties  —   this was a running gag  —   were always dull. Sitting alone on the floor after her last guest has left, she surveys her modern new home and says, “I HATE IT. ” I loved her for that. The ’70s were my formative years, and when my career got way out ahead of me, I still had Mary to fill in some gaps. We viewers were never given a peek inside her   closet, but Mary would walk out of it in one cute outfit after another usually a smart knit. I gravitated in that direction, too  —   if not with the same effect. For my farewell show in Chicago, on the eve of my debut on the “Today” show, I chose a knit ensemble in alternating wide stripes of brown, orange and white  —   possibly inspired by the colorations of a clown fish. I was thinking of Mary. Not long after, Tom Brokaw looked at me across the anchor desk one morning and said, “Burn the dress. ” Not Mary’s fault. I’m sometimes described as a “pioneer” in broadcast journalism  —   which is preposterous. The chair I settled into in 1976 had been recently vacated by the real thing, Barbara Walters. Barbara was indisputably the   woman in television news at that time, but she was not the best known or most beloved. That distinction belonged to “Mary. ” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” started several years before two words, “and women,” were inserted into an F. C. C. affirmative action clause pertaining to television station hiring. That might have helped women like me get a job, but Mary Richards may already have opened as many doors she had made a woman in the newsroom seem normal. Mary was ahead of her time, but not too far. She was not superwoman she was someone you could be. She was someone you wanted to be. Mary was plucky, but not driven. When starting a new life in Minneapolis, she was just looking for a job, not a career. And though uncommonly beautiful, Mary made it O. K. to be dateless on a Saturday night  —   which I often was. (I wasn’t alone. On Saturday nights, as Oprah recalled, she would put the conditioner in her hair during “The Bob Newhart Show” and rinse it out before “Mary. ”) Mary Tyler Moore, was “our Mary. ” She was the right woman at the right time. And I loved her for it."

http://www.antarctica.gov.au/news/2016/aurora-australis-successfully-refloated
===================================
Schneefan at German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here writes about how yet another ice-breaker has gotten stuck in summertime Antarctic sea ice.
The Antarctic “Aurora Australis” with 68 people on board became stranded in sea ice in the West Arm in Horseshoe Harbour last Wednesday, and rescue efforts were prevented by a snowstorm. According to reports that the ship’s rump has a tear, but its structural integrity is thought not to be at risk.

For some readers the Aurora Australis may ring a bell. This is because it is the ice breaker that ultimately helped rescue the 52-person crew on board the sea-ice trapped research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy which ferried a global warming/polar ice melt expedition led by a hapless Prof. Chris Turney back in early 2014. That expedition devolved into a highly publicized folly attracting much worldwide ridicule. Eventually a helicopter from the Chinese ice breaker Xue Long succeeded ferrying Turney and his crew to safety.
Today the German Handelsblatt here reports that 37 scientists on board the Aurora Australis were rescued on Friday and that the remaining crew has stayed on board in order to try to free the injured ship.
Schneefan writes that it should be clear to global warming/polar researchers that sea ice at the South Pole is not melting, but has in fact been growing for 37 years!

Arctic sea ice, surrounded by large land masses has, on the other hand, been declining:

"The election of Donald Trump and the accompanying rehabilitation of fossil fuels should have been, by all rights, devastating for Tesla Motors. Tesla is the top maker of   autos, and it completed its merger with SolarCity, a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels, days after the presidential election. Elon Musk, the visionary founder of both companies, openly criticized Mr. Trump’s candidacy, saying on CNBC just before the vote that he was “not the right guy” for the job. Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming, which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax. The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry. Moreover, both Tesla and SolarCity benefit from federal subsidies. Robert E. Murray, a coal executive and Trump supporter, has called Mr. Musk “a fraud” for accepting $2 billion in government handouts. So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump’s election, closing this week within striking distance of a record high? Adam Jonas, a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week, with a target price of $305 a share. (It was trading this week at about $255.) “When you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest” with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. “To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that. ” Shares in pure solar energy companies haven’t fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump’s victory. Solar investors “aren’t nearly as negative as they were the day after the election,” said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse. One reason for that shift seems to be a budding bromance between Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk. The   invited Mr. Musk to Trump Tower in December as part of a group of technology executives and named him to his strategic and policy forum of business leaders. And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn’t reject it out of hand. For his part, Mr. Musk this week endorsed Rex W. Tillerson, a pillar of the fossil fuel establishment as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state. Mr. Jonas said that the “strategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development” in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock. “That Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people,” Mr. Jonas said. A major fear of investors in solar power was that a Trump administration would end the federal subsidies so reviled by fossil fuel proponents. While that remains a concern, the most recent jobs data suggests that the subsidies have led to a surge in new   jobs, exactly what the president has advocated. This month, the Energy Department noted in its annual energy and jobs report that “solar technologies, both photovoltaic and concentrated, employ almost 374, 000 workers, or 43 percent of the electric power generation work force. ” (Coal, by contrast, accounts for about 86, 000 workers.) “The jobs data is a compelling argument in favor of the tax credits,” Mr. Hughes said. He noted that federal solar subsidies were set to expire anyway in a few years, a result of rare bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Mr. Musk has stressed that solar energy is close to reaching a scale where federal subsidies will no longer be needed. And Tesla is also expanding rapidly. Tesla employs 25, 000 workers in the United States and could easily double that as it ramps up production for its new Model 3 and expands its Gigafactory, a lithium ion battery manufacturing operation in Nevada. “I don’t know what kind of multiplier you put on that, but it’s a significant boost to the economy,” Mr. Jonas said. Federal subsidies for electric vehicles will also end once a manufacturer hits 200, 000 vehicles, a level Tesla may soon reach. Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk appear to have other areas of overlapping interest as well. Mr. Musk has broached the subject of the nation’s aging electricity transmission grid in conversations with Mr. Trump, according to an insider with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Musk has advocated a   smart grid and has said that eventually Tesla will offer grid services, such as batteries that can be added to the grid and paired with solar and wind farms. This is the kind of   infrastructure project that Mr. Trump has supported. And Tesla’s success could help fend off Chinese efforts to compete or even dominate in what could be an important piece of the car industry’s future. But the ultimate bond between the two may simply be that they both like to think big. As Joel Achenbach has reported in The Washington Post, Mr. Musk seems to have captured the new president’s imagination with his SpaceX project  —   which designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft  —   and his fascination with transporting human life to other planets. A manned mission to Mars (a joint venture between NASA and SpaceX that would reduce the costs and risks to taxpayers) might well become Mr. Trump’s version of “landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth” within a decade, the challenge that President John F. Kennedy set before Congress in 1961. It’s still early in the Trump administration, and some (or all) of this may turn out to be wishful thinking by fans of Mr. Musk, Tesla investors, environmentalists and hopeful space colonists. “I want to believe that Trump won’t kill solar,” Mr. Hughes said. “But there’s still a lot of uncertainty. The big question: Will he take away the tax credits?” Still, there’s a growing sense that Mr. Trump and Tesla can not only coexist, but even thrive together. “You don’t have to be   to be   fuel,” Mr. Jonas said."

Beyond its severe toll on human life, public health, and people’s livelihoods and aspirations, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in routines that we have long assumed were reliable and safe. Out of necessity, we are reconsidering how we work, learn, transact, collaborate, and socialize.



This kind of stock‐​taking may point us toward new and better ways of doing things—provided we succeed at purging bad ideas in the process. Among the ideas most in need of purging is that the pandemic laid bare the intolerable risks of globalization, which must be reined in once and for all.



Proponents of retrenchment see cross‐​border trade, investment, and migration not as liberating, life‐​enhancing, and wealth‐​creating but as vectors across which a local outbreak became a global pandemic. Moreover, they argue that the pandemic revealed the dangers of relying on foreigners. When the time came for global supply chains to show their mettle by getting protective gear and medical equipment to where it was needed as quickly as possible, foreign governments encouraged hoarding and imposed export restrictions, which created supply shortages in the United States.



There is no denying that contracting and spreading novel viruses is easier in an interconnected global economy. After all, COVID-19 originated abroad and was brought to the United States by visitors and returning Americans engaging in various forms of international trade. But it is also true that the international collaboration that is very much needed to contain and subdue SARS‐​CoV‐​19, the virus that causes COVID-19, is made possible by that same interconnectedness.



International trade and cross‐​border investment produce some degree of reliance and risk, but in policymakers’ rush to indict trade and globalization, they dismiss the enormous benefits that Americans get from participating in the global economy as workers, consumers, producers, and investors. Those benefits would be casualties of a protectionist overreaction that would make us poorer, more vulnerable, and less resilient.



Americans are easily deluded into thinking we can go it alone because the U.S. economy is the world’s largest.



While most Americans favor trade and trade agreements, we have a tendency to assume that we can be self‐​sufficient and that the United States is big enough to provide everything we need—all our commodities, food, manufactured goods, and services. Americans are easily deluded into thinking we can go it alone because the U.S. economy is the world’s largest. In fact, so big is the U.S. economy that the United States can be the world’s largest trading nation but still be the world’s third least dependent on trade. The value of U.S. goods and services trade (imports plus exports) in 2019 amounted to $5.9 trillion, which was 27.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $21.4 trillion. That ratio for China was 38.2 percent last year, and the world average was 59.5 percent.



Indeed, the U.S. economy is big enough that Americans could probably endure autarky longer than people in other countries, but the experience would be profoundly costly and immiserating—something that holds true regardless of the size of the economy. The costs would not purchase more jobs or more security. They would only make us poorer by forcing us to divert resources to produce things that we can currently import more cost effectively. This is the case for small, medium, and large economies. Moreover, 95 percent of the world’s consumers and potential supply chain collaborators live outside the United States. We haven’t come close to realizing the potential benefits of deeper and broader global integration.



Yet, policymakers from both sides of the aisle dangle the goal of national self‐​sufficiency in response to the alleged scourge of globalization. Many seem amenable to top‐​down edicts to promote self‐​sufficiency by making international trade and collaboration more expensive. The Trump administration, the Biden campaign, and congressional leadership all support proposals to repatriate supply chains, restrict government procurement spending to goods and services produced domestically, impose tariffs to prevent reliance on imports, and subsidize domestic production of everything from pharmaceutical ingredients to personal protective equipment to semiconductors. Those are all mistaken policy pursuits.



The _economic_ case for free trade has stood strong for nearly two and a half centuries. When individuals are free to focus their productive efforts on what they do best, aggregate output is greater than it would be if everyone attempted to produce all the goods and services each needs or wants. We each specialize so that we can produce more collectively, but specialization is feasible _only if_ people are free to exchange their output.



Without knowing the first thing about making clothing, building houses, growing crops, or treating illnesses, a software engineer can focus exclusively on developing, writing, and debugging code—producing software—and then use some of his output (monetized in the form of a salary) to purchase clothes, food, medical care, and housing. If exchange were not possible, there would be no scope for specialization because everyone would have to allocate their time into suitable increments to try to produce as much of the things they need or want to consume. Imagine how much poorer we would be—in terms of unmet needs and wants—if we had to toil in the tasks of self‐​sufficiency every day.



Pandemic or not, these facts make the irrefutable economic case for free and inclusive trade. We trade to enable us to specialize. We specialize so that we can produce more in the aggregate. We produce more so that we can consume and save more. Expanding trade across international borders to include more people and enable economies of scale in production is the wellspring of wealth creation and higher living standards.



Trade is an economic endeavor; trade policy—in contrast—is very much a political exercise. The latter is more concerned with how the larger pie created through trade gets divided. Sometimes those political efforts lead to trade barriers, which end up reducing the size of the pie.



Of course, expanding trade isn’t entirely risk‐​free. Trade means interdependence, which implies reliance on others for certain goods and services. Protectionists and nationalists rarely pass on the opportunity to portray imports as constituting a dangerous reliance on foreign sources—a risk to national security. The pandemic has provided them a fresh excuse for an old argument.



When we restrict trade, we specialize less, produce less, and consume and save less. We become poorer.



In cases where trade may present legitimate risks to public health or our security, it may be prudent to consider measures that may reduce the risk, including trade restrictions. But we must remember that in addition to the immediate costs of those measures are the unseen, longer‐​term costs. When we restrict trade, we specialize less, produce less, and consume and save less. We become poorer.



COVID-19 hit when international trade and other aspects of globalization were already under sustained attack from the ideological left and right. The left sees globalization as multinational businesses gaming the system, running roughshod over democratic governance, and limiting the scope for domestic policy and regulatory experimentation. The right sees globalization as an invitation to overreaching global government to bleed America’s national sovereignty. In both cases, the concern is about loss of local control. Sometimes that concern is disingenuous. After all, blaming imports, outsourcing, and foreigners for the country’s home‐​grown economic and social problems is a time‐​tested tactic of U.S. politicians. It’s a tactic that’s been elevated to an art form in President Trump’s nationalist “America First” gospel, which borrows heavily from the protectionist hymnals of the left.



Our COVID-19 experience counsels that we develop proactive and prudent public health measures to reduce the likelihood of massive transmissions of deadly viruses, but it makes no case for global retrenchment. If the risks of relying on foreign firms for critical medical supplies and equipment are too much to bear, then diversification of sourcing may be a reasonable response. Diversification is the optimal response to uncertainty. That said, claims that the United States is too dependent on China or anyone else for items necessary to secure public health and national security are vastly overblown. Regardless, using laws and regulations to compel repatriation of supply chains is not diversification. It is a textbook example of putting all eggs in one basket.



Protectionists and nationalists have seized upon the pandemic as an opportunity to portray globalization as the culmination of years of promiscuous policies—comeuppance for U.S. internationalists who sold out America and “shipped jobs overseas.” The pandemic, in this telling, is the final straw and a ripe opportunity to right the wrongs of the past few decades. Central to their story are fallacies and misunderstandings about the nature of trade and whom it benefits.



Protectionists and nationalists portray trade as a zero‐​sum competition between “Us” and “Them” and argue that we are losing the game. They see exports as Team America’s points, imports as the foreign teams’ points, the trade account as the scoreboard, and the deficit on that scoreboard as proof that the United States is losing at trade.



Of course, trade is not a zero‐​sum game. National trade statistics reflect the aggregated daily decisions of millions of people, who exchange on terms that both parties find acceptable: the definition of win‐​win. But protectionists claim that purchasing imports constitutes leakage in the economy. They say that dollars that could have been spent domestically to support U.S. workers and the U.S. economy are instead diverted abroad at great cost. Cheaper foreign goods, they argue, may provide some short‐​term satisfaction to the consumer, but they subvert the U.S. economy.



Buying cheap T‐​shirts, they moralize, may save you a couple dollars but cannot be justified when it causes fellow Americans to lose their jobs. But that logic reflects an attenuated understanding of how trade works. Lower prices are not the objective of international trade. Rather, lower prices are the transmission mechanism through which trade’s benefits are delivered. When consumers can buy cheaper T‐​shirts, they have more resources to purchase other products and services or to save, which funds innovation and entrepreneurship and underpins economic growth and wealth creation. The process explains how a new business in Texas gets a loan and begins operating some 6–18 months after a T‐​shirt factory shutters in Georgia, even though the resources for the startup aren’t easily traced to the elimination of tariffs on clothing. Meanwhile, the dollars sent abroad to purchase imports always find their way back into the U.S. economy via foreigners’ purchases of U.S. exports and assets, which both underpin economic growth and job creation in the United States.



Without access to output from the rest of the world, Americans would suffer lower real incomes and consume and save less. Before long, the reduced spending and savings would retard innovation and the emergence of new, dynamic firms to challenge incumbents, which is essential to replenishing the economy. It is this creation that justifies the destruction of the T‐​shirt jobs.



Another article of faith among those who argue for supply chain repatriation and import substitution is that trade and globalization killed U.S. manufacturing. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, they say that requiring the production of pharmaceutical ingredients and critical medical supplies stateside would give U.S. manufacturing the shot in the arm it needs. But that idea is wrong.



U.S. manufacturing has thrived during recent decades of increased openness to trade and cross‐​border investment. Excepting cyclical and pandemic‐​induced recessions, real manufacturing output reaches new heights almost every year. In 1953, when the manufacturing sector’s share of U.S. GDP was at its highest (28.1 percent), total manufacturing value‐​added amounted to $110 billion. Today, manufacturing’s $2.4 trillion in value‐​added accounts for only 11 percent of U.S. GDP. In other words, the manufacturing sector is creating more value—six times more value in real terms—today, when it is much less important to the economy, than it did when manufacturing was the driver of the economy. And it is achieving that level of output with a manufacturing workforce that is 60 percent its 1979 peak size of 19.4 million workers.



Another commonly invoked myth is that trade disproportionately benefits big business and the rich, widening the gap between large and small businesses and between higher‐ and lower‐​income households. However, the facts show the opposite. Trade—and measures that liberalize trade—disproportionately benefit small over large businesses and lower‐​income over higher‐​income consumers.



The burdens of tariffs, regulations, and other protectionist measures are greater on small businesses than on large ones. The cost of absorbing tariffs and having internal procedures and personnel to deal with such administrative burdens constitutes a higher share of a small company’s total operating costs. What may be a minor speed bump for large companies can be a significant imposition on small firms. This burden impairs the ability of small companies to gain footholds to effectively challenge large incumbents. For capitalism to function properly, new, small, dynamic enterprises must be able to challenge entrenched behemoths and their old ways of doing business. Today’s startups are tomorrow’s national champions.



Meanwhile, lower‐​income households spend higher proportions of their budgets on goods than do higher‐​income households, whose consumption spending tilts more toward services. Not only do people with lower incomes spend more on goods, but they also spend more on imported goods. And, although U.S. tariffs are relatively low on average, they are especially high on life’s basic necessities—food, clothing, shoes, housewares, and building materials. Trade protectionism is a deeply regressive form of taxation, so the pain of global retrenchment is felt especially deeply by people at the lower end of the income and wealth scales.



A lot of anti‐​globalization sentiment has been directed toward the rules‐​based international trading system. At the core of this system is the World Trade Organization (WTO), with a growing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements spiraling around it. Complaints about the system range from assertions that it is too powerful and intrudes too much into areas of national autonomy to arguments that it is hopelessly ineffective and has been unable to accomplish much in recent years. It gets criticized for doing too much and too little. Much of the criticism reflects widespread misunderstanding about what the system does and does not do.



Some critics call the system “hyperglobalization” run amok, asserting that trade rules tie the hands of domestic policymakers. Many on the left allege that national and local governments are forced to adhere to pro‐​market global rules that require openness, encroach into domestic “policy space,” and cause a “regulatory chill.”



Similar complaints about loss of domestic sovereignty come from the right. But criticisms of the global trading system from people such as Pat Buchanan, Jeff Sessions, and Josh Hawley tend to focus not on the crowding out of domestic capacity to engage in regulatory experimentation but on its alleged anti‐​American bias and its abiding, ultimate objective to ensnare the United States in global government.



Whether starting from the left or the right, reaching that conclusion requires a fundamental misunderstanding of the existing international trade rules. The WTO system of adjudication has only limited power over domestic laws and regulations, with the ultimate decision about how to respond to findings that a law or regulation violates WTO rules being left up to national governments, leaving them plenty of sovereignty over domestic policy.



Unfortunately, even WTO proponents who understand how the system works sometimes contribute to the backlash against globalization by advocating the extension of “trade rules” into areas where they don’t belong. They figure that the rules have worked elsewhere so why not apply them here? But insisting on rules that bridge every cultural difference and address every social ill is inevitably going to foment opposition. One can push too far and too fast, as the European Union found with Brexit.



Another bipartisan myth holds that outsourcing hurts the U.S. economy and its workforce. By “shipping jobs overseas,” businesses are depriving U.S. workers of opportunities, the U.S. economy of value‐​added, and the federal and local governments of tax revenues. However, outsourcing typically augments domestic production. Rather than a substitute for domestic production—a zero‐​sum game in which a factory shutters in Ohio and relocates to Mexico to produce for export back to the United States—outsourcing is usually a complement to domestic production. By outsourcing, businesses free up new resources that often lead to new investment, job creation, and output at home.



Just as competition empowers consumers to spend less on products and services, which frees up resources that create wealth, businesses availing themselves of alternative production models are empowered to produce at lower costs, which likewise frees up resources that create wealth. Detractors assert that this outsourcing of production follows the pattern of a “race to the bottom” in which U.S. investment seeks out locations where wages are cheap and labor, environmental, product‐​safety, and other regulations are weak or nonexistent. But reality doesn’t hew to this cliché.



Globalization wasn’t preordained. Nor was it the product of some binary decision. Nobody consciously flipped on the globalization switch. Globalization happened gradually, as the aggregate sum of millions of individual decisions enabled and shaped by technological, political, economic, and demographic changes.



Innovations leading to dramatic declines in the costs of communication and transportation, the fall of the Soviet Union, China’s economic reforms, the worldwide easing of restrictions on trade and capital flows, improvements in educational attainment, the proliferation of manufacturing skills, and democratization and other forms of political liberalization all served to create new opportunities for international cooperation and collaboration. Globalization happened as the world’s producers responded to the growing demand of the world’s awakening consumer classes, who sought more choices, better quality, and lower prices. Producers, likewise, sought better options and explored new, more cost‐​effective ways to meet that growing demand. The global supply chains that emerged were the result of a confluence of factors shaping millions of investment and production‐​location decisions.



Among those factors are indeed wages and the regulatory environment but also skills of the workforce, access to transportation infrastructure, quality of communications infrastructure, tariffs, customs clearance procedures, other trade barriers, proximity to domestic and foreign markets, stability of the economic and political climates, risk of asset expropriation, respect for the rule of law, public health, and so on. It is the total cost—from a product’s inception to its consumption—that matters.



The decades‐​long trend toward increasing production in accordance with the supply chain model indicates that businesses in many different industries find the benefits to outweigh the costs. It stands to reason that the risk of supply chain disruption due to public health crises will be assigned a higher probability and weighted more heavily going forward than was the case in the past. In other words, businesses and individuals don’t need governments to artificially raise the costs of particular options to signal higher risks when those risks—and their costs—are already taken into account.



Less risk averse businesses likely will make modest adjustments to their calculations and subsequent investment and production decisions, while more risk averse entities may repatriate their supply chains entirely. Risk, risk tolerance, and the array of available options to mitigate risk vary by industry and firm. Overriding the diversity of production decisions of thousands of businesses with different risk tolerances by compelling the repatriation of supply chains through legislation or executive fiat would be enormously shortsighted and costly.



The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some of the risks that Americans face in an interdependent global economy. Longtime critics of globalization and trade have exploited these risks and fears to recycle their arguments against the world trading system. But their arguments are no more compelling now than they were before.



Despite current threats of a protectionist overreaction, prospects for a deeper and broader form of globalization look strong. The pandemic has actually _facilitated_ globalization by encouraging us to find new reasons and ways to stay in touch. Cooperating in the development of procedures and techniques; sharing research, insights, and technology; and collaborating with people in other countries who are working on the same problems are intuitively preferable to working on these matters in isolation. The proven dependability of broadband connectivity and communications technologies means that face‐​to‐​face contact may not be as important as it once was, which is likely to translate into reduced demand for domestic and international travel, public transportation, office buildings, schools, other structures meant to accommodate large gatherings, and many other traditional activities that entail close personal contact. But that means that the time may be now for a dramatic shift in the supply and demand for international trade in services that can be delivered over the internet. Services in high demand that can be performed remotely and are ripe for competition, such as education and medicine, are likely to become much more popular.



We may be on the cusp of a new era of global interconnectedness with vast possibilities for experimentation in how we collaborate, exchange services, and transact. International cooperation will be more important—and may prove more rewarding—than ever.



Developing, testing, and implementing more targeted methods of detecting and mitigating public health risks are essential to avoiding the excessive costs of extreme responses to health crises, such as travel and trade bans. Diversification is the optimal response to uncertainty. But banning travel, forcing repatriation of supply chains, restricting government procurement to domestically produced goods and services, and imposing tariffs to dissuade the use of imports are not diversification but its antithesis. And those measures would leave U.S. producers, consumers, workers, investors, and the economy both prone to economic shocks and deprived of cutting‐​edge products, technologies, and methods.

In recent months, the most influential political party in the country may not be the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, but the Tea Party. This murky, largely leaderless grassroots movement has been the driving force behind the derailment of President Barack Obama’s dearest agenda items, notably health care reform and climate change legislation.



What are the goals of this movement? In part, that is the wrong question. The Tea Party effort rejects the notion that a politician or a pundit should define their movement. Rather, citizens themselves will tell us what the movement means.



As their name suggests, these citizens want to revive the ideas at the heart of the American Revolution: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. One chapter in Texas adopted these principles: limited government; fiscal responsibility; personal responsibility and the rule of law.





The quality that gives the Tea Party movement its legitimacy is that it is so fundamentally illegitimate.



Tea Party groups are conducting online polling and deliberations to determine the priorities of the movement. This process will create a “Contract from America” to serve as a template for reforms to come. The most popular ideas now include a flat tax, congressional term limits and abolishing the U.S. Department of Education.



Those ideals and policies sound like what the Republican Party once espoused but have not practiced for at least a decade.



Not surprisingly, establishment conservatives have recently tried to make hay of the Tea Party movement’s apparent lack of a recognizable face or national headquarters. Grover Norquist, the Rasputin behind countless conservative organizing activities, has offered tips to Tea Party organizers. Old (and perhaps new again) Republican apparatchiks like Dick Armey and Newt Gingrich have proclaimed their oneness with the Tea Party faithful and essentially offered their services as the movement’s leaders. No doubt many Republican leaders would like to direct the energy of the Tea Party against the Obama administration and to receive the votes of these idealists come November.



We pray thee, Tea Partiers: Do not go there.



The quality that gives the Tea Party movement its legitimacy is that it is so fundamentally illegitimate: outside the establishment, bereft of representation on K Street, and without an identifiable face to speak for it on _Meet the Press_. This is a movement that sprang deep from within the viscera of America, not from some political poll or focus group.



It is not Republican; it is not even conservative. It has no interest in debating the merits of No Child Left Behind, abstinence‐​only sex education or George W. Bush’s rationale for going to Iraq. Replacing a “spend and borrow” Democrat with a “spend and borrow” Republican is not the goal of the Tea Party movement.



This movement is simply saying: “We are fine without you, Washington. Now for the love of God, go attend a reception somewhere, and stop making health care and entrepreneurship more expensive than they already are.”



Machiavelli once said a republic stays healthy by returning to its first principles from time to time. The Tea Party movement is trying to get our nation back to its first principles to prevent our decline. For their trouble, they have been denounced by many in the media and the Obama administration.



But they will continue to fight. They still believe in the promise of America. That faith may spread as Election Day approaches in the second and perhaps final year of what is supposed to be the Age of Obama.



What began as angry town meetings and grew into a political movement may end as a third political party in 2012. Maybe then Washington will finally listen.

"George Orwell’s classic book “1984,” about a dystopian future where critical thought is suppressed under a totalitarian regime, has seen a surge in sales this month, rising to the top of the Amazon   list in the United States and leading its publisher to have tens of thousands of new copies printed. Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75, 000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. “We’ve seen a big bump in sales,” Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise “started over the weekend and hit hyperactive” on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9, 500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on “Meet the Press. ” In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the “largest audience ever to witness an inauguration,” Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of “1984. ” When asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, “Don’t be so dramatic. ” Mr. Spicer, she said, “gave alternative facts. ” In the novel, the term “newspeak” refers to language in which independent thought, or “unorthodox” political ideas, have been eliminated. “Doublethink” is defined as “reality control. ” On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book’s readers made a connection between Ms. Conway’s comments and Orwell’s language, and the attention on the book “kind of took a life of its own,” Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher   described the interview as “fraught with epistemological tension. ” The dictionary also reported that searches for the word “fact” spiked after Ms. Conway’s comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary’s definition. Even outside the United States, interest in “1984” has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a   editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a   she said, and it sold 100, 000 copies last year in   countries outside the United States and Canada. “But we’ve definitely seen an uplift” in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are “chiming with people,” Ms. Harrison said, adding that “The Man in the High Castle” by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick’s novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here,” about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, “and we’re already on to our third printing,” Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon’s best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,” another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. “Everyone remembers ‘1984’ as containing various parodies of official distortions,” he said. “That kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that’s why they keep coming back. ”"
"■ President Trump, at a political gathering of congressional Republicans, asks, “Where’s my C. I. A. director?” ■ A new Quinnipiac University poll put President Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent, compared to Barack Obama’s 59 percent in the opening weeks of his presidency. ■ The professional golfer Bernhard Langer released a statement saying he never told President Trump a story of voter fraud that Mr. Trump relayed to congressional leaders. President Trump may be unaware that America’s spy chiefs are not supposed to be creatures of partisan politics. Speaking on Thursday in Philadelphia at an annual retreat for Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump seemed to think Mike Pompeo, the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, would be among the senators, representatives and party operatives hooting and hollering in the crowd. “Where is Pompeo? Where the hell is he?” Mr. Trump said, scanning the crowd. The answer, in case Mr. Trump has not yet figured it out: Mr. Pompeo was not in Philadelphia. The C. I. A. like the military, is supposed to be apolitical, and its chief does not have a direct role in creating administration policies. Though Mr. Pompeo has attended the Republican retreat in years past  —   he was a Republican representative before taking over the C. I. A. on Monday  —   it would be considered highly inappropriate for him to take part in his new role running the country’s premier intelligence agency. It was not the first time that Mr. Trump appeared to mix partisan politics and C. I. A business. He accused the C. I. A. ’s previous leadership of playing politics after American intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia tried to help him win the election. Then, on Saturday, he gave a speech at C. I. A. headquarters that was filled with campaign trail rhetoric. The speech was widely criticized by former C. I. A. officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Mr. Trump, in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News, cast the visit to C. I. A. as a highlight of his first days in office. “That speech was a home run,” he said. “I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl, and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. ” President Trump, now famously touchy about his approval ratings, is not doing well on that front. A new Quinnipiac University poll put his approval rating among American voters at 36 percent, 33 percent among women. In Quinnipiac’s first poll of Barack Obama’s presidency, Mr. Trump’s predecessor stood at 59 percent. Republican lawmakers who might be considering distancing themselves from their president should consider this: Mr. Trump’s   rating among Republicans is 81 percent to 3 percent. Independent voters are the problem. They are more split, with 45 percent disapproving and 35 percent approving of the job that the president is doing. Gathered with the top leaders of Congress, President Trump on Monday apparently relayed the story in all seriousness: the pro golfer Bernhard Langer had told him a story that really stuck with him. As Mr. Trump relayed it, Mr. Langer had been in line to vote in Florida when he was told by an official that he could not cast a ballot. But people all around him who looked far more suspect  —   Mr. Trump tossed out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from  —   were allowed to draw up provisional ballots. There was a problem with the story: Mr. Langer is a German citizen. But Mr. Langer says he never talked to Mr. Trump, that he was told the story by a friend, then told the story to a friend who told it to someone with ties to the White House  —   who apparently told it to Mr. Trump. He certainly never tried to vote in Florida. So, if the story was important to Mr. Trump’s erroneous belief that millions of illegal immigrants gave Hillary Clinton her 2. 8   win in the popular vote, it was based on   information. There’s a slight problem with President Trump’s Great Wall with Mexico: the Tohono O’odham Nation. The Native American tribe controls about 75 miles of the border of the United States and Mexico that slices through its sovereign territory. Tribal leaders are already saying that the wall is not going to divide its territory. Verlon M. Jose, the Tohono O’odham Nation’s vice chairman, was not subtle when discussing the wall when he spoke in November to Native News Online: “Over my dead body. ” Tribal officials did say they are willing to meet with President Trump to discuss the matter further. As Mr. Jose said: There may be a Gingrich in the Vatican just yet. Callista Gingrich, the wife of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, is in the running to be ambassador to the Holy See, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Mr. Gingrich, reached by telephone, said that he was aware that his wife had been on a list for the job, but declined to say where things stood. The former speaker took himself out of the running for a cabinet post after it became clear that Mr. Trump was looking elsewhere for a secretary of state. Mr. Trump has known Newt and Callista Gingrich socially for years. They’re members of his golf club in Virginia, and have been at his club,    in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Gingrich was one of the people Mr. Trump consulted in 2015 when he had already determined he would run for president. But Mrs. Gingrich is the former speaker’s third wife  —   not something the church takes a shine to. Others who are being considered for the role include William Simon Jr. a friend of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Four senior management officials at the State Department resigned on Wednesday, leaving the department without the top managers charged with running the administrative, consular and foreign mission operations until their successors are in place. “As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation,” Mark Toner, the department’s acting spokesman, said in a statement, adding: “Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the foreign service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. ” The most senior official to leave is Patrick F. Kennedy, the department’s longtime undersecretary for management, who oversees finances, security, facilities and consular services. But his departure had been expected, in part because of his vigorous defense of   of State Hillary’s Clinton’s handling of the attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. He also sought the F. B. I. ’s help in downgrading the security classification of an email from Mrs. Clinton’s private server. Rex Tillerson, nominated to be secretary of state, is not expected to be confirmed by the Senate until next week. Nominations for the department’s deputy positions have yet to be announced or submitted. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday morning that in spite of President Trump’s perpetual tweet storms, distracting television interviews, occasional lies, and intraparty slights, they are with him on policy. “We are on the same page with the White House,” Mr. Ryan told reporters in Philadelphia, before a visit from Mr. Trump to the congressional Republican’s policy conference. On the list: a costly wall along the border with Mexico, which Mr. Ryan said would be paid for with a supplemental funding request from the White House and existing federal funding to secure the border. Also on the list is a new tax code and a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  —   easy! (Remember, Congress dithered for weeks and months to scrape together aid for the victims of tropical storm Sandy, to combat the Zika virus and to help the   residents of Flint, Mich. while conservatives looked for offsetting spending cuts.) As for Trump’s distractions, the leaders seemed to say that’s his special sideshow. “This is going to be an unconventional presidency,” Mr. Ryan conceded, adding, “that is something we are all going to have to get used to. ” Mr. McConnell also shrugged off questions about Mr. Trump compromising the United States’ relationship with Mexico. “We intend to address the wall issue ourselves, and the president can deal with his relations with other countries on that issue and other issues,” Mr. McConnell said. The Republican chairmen of the House and Senate veterans’ affairs committees dashed off a letter to President Trump Thursday demanding to know whether his executive order freezing federal hiring applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Surely you didn’t mean the department under our jurisdiction, suggested Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee: Don’t be surprised if more such letters emerge as the hiring freeze starts to bite. In a week in which President Trump is busy unraveling much of Barack Obama’s legacy, the former president was defended from an unusual quarter Thursday morning: Mr. Trump. In an   post on Twitter, Mr. Trump expressed outrage that Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst whose sentence for leaking American secrets was commuted by Mr. Obama, had criticized the 44th president for not being strong enough. Even though Mr. Trump repeatedly characterized Mr. Obama the same way during last year’s campaign  —   “weak attitude and pathetic president,” “so weak and so bad,” “he’s been weak, he’s been ineffective”  —   he evidently thought Ms. Manning was ungracious to do so. Mr. Trump seemed to be referring to a column that Ms. Manning wrote in The Guardian newspaper, in which she argued that Mr. Obama left “very few permanent accomplishments” because he was too willing to compromise. The column was largely a criticism of Republicans never giving Mr. Obama a chance, but it suggested that he had not been strong enough to resist them. “The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama’s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise,” Ms. Manning wrote. “They won’t meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader. ” Wonder where Mr. Trump got his idea?"
"**Tourists are staying away and retailers are reeling after nearly five months of protests that have dealt a ""devastating"" blow to businesses in Hong Kong, and pushed the economy to the brink.**
Growth figures issued on Thursday showed Hong Kong has entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In the third quarter, Hong Kong's GDP shrank 3.2% from the previous quarter, which had seen a drop of 0.4%.
Ahead of the numbers, the city's leader Carrie Lam warned of a looming recession. She expects the economy to record negative growth for the year.
DBS economist Samuel Tse agrees the upcoming figures will show Hong Kong has sunk into recession - and expects more pain to come.
""We don't think it will rebound that fast,"" Mr Tse says.
The protests - which began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China - have piled pressure on existing economic strains.
Hong Kong has been grappling with the US-China trade war, while a weaker yuan has hit spending from mainland visitors and bruised consumer sentiment.
The controversial extradition bill has been withdrawn, but demonstrations continued and evolved into demands for greater freedoms, and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Those dramatic scenes have kept tourists away.
In August, arrivals to the city - a popular travel destination and transit hub - hit their worst level since the SARS crisis of 2003. Visitor numbers are expected to plunge nearly 50% in October compared to the previous year.
Many hotels are struggling to fill their rooms and Mr Tse says the vacancy rate is sitting around 60%.
Some hotels have slashed prices in the hopes of winning back tourists, while reports suggest many have forced staff to cut work hours or take leave to cope with the slowdown.
Among those to have taken a hit is Ovolo Group. The firm, which operates four hotels in Hong Kong, has seen occupancy rates fall by up to 30% over the past three months.
""It's devastating to see the effect that the recent situation in our city has had on local businesses, particularly those of us in the hospitality industry,"" Ovolo Group's chief executive Girish Jhunjhnuwala says.
Mr Jhunjhnuwala says business is holding up better on weekdays as most guests choose to leave before the weekend, when protests typically kick off. The firm has introduced flexible cancellation policies to help offset uncertainty for guests.
With fewer tourists flying in, airlines have also been knocked. Days of protests at Hong Kong's airport in August, one of the world's busiest transit hubs, led to widespread flight cancelations.
Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific has seen a sharp drop in passenger numbers to the territory in the past two months, while Qantas said the protests would hit first-half earnings by A$25m ($17m; Â£13m).
Lighter tourist flows have weighed on retailers in the city, many already battling with softening consumer sentiment from local shoppers.
Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours while workers report fears over their safety as protests have turned violent.
Certain businesses have faced direct attacks.
Vandals have targeted big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have also repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire.
The chaos has led to a sharp fall in retail sales, down 23% in August, the biggest drop on record. The decline in September is expected to be even worse.
Additionally, the long-running unrest has shaken business confidence and frustrated investment. That could have a more lasting impact on the economy, Mr Tse says, as questions and uncertainty remain over Hong Kong's future as a financial hub.
The city has so far injected more than HK$20bn to combat the slowdown including help for the transport, tourism and retail sectors. More relief measures are expected.
But the government argues there's only so much it can do to stem the economic slide.
""To truly cure the problem, we must always work together to stop the violence, stop the destruction of traffic infrastructure and specific target shops, banks and institutionsâ¦ and let the society recover as soon as possible,"" Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post.
""Our society and the economy need to take a breather and need to get back on the road."""
"**US gaming publisher Activision Blizzard has reversed its decision to withhold prize money from a player who expressed support for the Hong Kong protests.**
Professional gamer, Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung, said in Mandarin, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" on a live broadcast after a tournament.
He was banned for one year and said was told he would not get any prize money.
In a new statement, the company said: ""In hindsight, our process wasn't adequate, and we reacted too quickly.""
The hashtag #Blizzardboycott trended on Twitter after the 21-year-old was banned, and some players tried to delete their accounts in solidarity with ""Blitzchung"".
Even some US politicians commented on Blizzard's initial decision.
Activision Blizzard is behind some of the most popular console, PC and mobile video games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
It initially said Ng Wai Chung broke rules as ""the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament"" and it wanted to ""keep the official channels focused on the game"".
But the game-maker decided that he didn't break any rules during the game, and so revised their decision.
Ng Wai Chung's statement showed solidarity with the protests happening in Hong Kong.
The protests started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
The extradition bill would have allowed for criminal suspects to be tried in mainland China, under certain circumstances.
Some said it might give China more influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.
Ng Wai Chung also put on a gas mask in the post-match interview, which protesters have been wearing since Hong Kong police have been using tear gas.

As the Australian media-elite relentlessly hammers its “climate emergency” narrative during Australia’s bushfire crisis, many citizen journalists have been [digging through Australia’s available old newspapers](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/how-the-australian-government-created-a-treasure-trove-for-citizen-journalists/), turning up story after story to debunk hyperbolic media claims. The Green-left have been doing some digging, too.



The Green-left, immediately and enthusiastically echoed by the luvvies in the taxpayer-funded media, seized on a single sentence in the 2008 Garnaut report, to claim that “they knew” these fires were going to happen.



 **But did they really?**



Firstly, the Green-left’s soothsayer didn’t “know” anything: he repeated a projection. Projections are not “knowledge” in the sense of being certain that something will happen. Climate modellers typically make dozens of projections. Most of them do not eventuate. Seizing on just one apparently successful projection, while ignoring the others, is the sort of fallacious reasoning that convinces gullible rubes that John Edwards really does talk to dead people.



As it happens, when cherry-picked from Garnaut’s voluminous report, without any context, that single sentence **might** appear eerily prophetic.



“Recent projections of fire weather suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020.” (Page 118).



Talk about Nostradamus! Except…



Even with Garnaut’s (more credible) bushfire prediction, it is important to drill into the detail of what was said (something the ABC/Fairfax/Guardian climate change cheer squad failed to do). The 2008 report relied on a bushfires study commissioned by the Climate Institute of Australia. The four authors (Lucas, Hennessy, Mills and Bathols) wrote of how:



“Bushfires are an inevitable occurrence in Australia. (In the South-East) the winter and spring rains allow fuel growth, while the dry summers allow fire danger to build. This normal risk is exacerbated by periodic droughts that occur as a part of natural inter-annual climate variability.”



At no point did they say bushfires would be caused by climate change. Their main conclusion was to point to an increase in the number of ‘fire danger days’ on the Australian mainland, marginally increasing the length of our bushfire seasons by 2020. That looks about right.



But Garnaut wasn’t “predicting” anything. Much less fingering climate change as the dastardly culprit.



Elsewhere, Garnaut was sceptical about linking climate change to specific weather events and outcomes. “Single events, such as an intense tropical cyclone or a long-lived heatwave”, he wrote, “cannot be directly attributed to climate change.” (Page 106) Presumably this also applies to a dry spell and a bad bushfire season.



Garnaut is also no friend to the [Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/)’s other favourite impending climate catastrophes. Aren’t we all gonna die, our economies and societies wiped off the face of the planet by a vengeful Gaia?



Re-reading the Garnaut Report is like an antidote to Green-Left hysteria. Are you worried about heat-related deaths due to global warming, people literally frying alive? Garnaut forecast, “In NSW, the number of annual temperature-related deaths is expected to decrease by 30 percent” (Page 126)



What about the Australian economy being destroyed, sector by sector, with mass unemployment from the impact of climate change? Garnaut said, “Australians will be substantially wealthier in 2100 in terms of goods and services, despite setbacks from climate change.” (Page 127) It hardly sounds like the end of the world.



Elsewhere, Garnaut’s projections are as off the mark as a TV psychic guessing that they’re being contacted by some whose name starts with L, no, A, or is that C? E, anyone? Anyone?



He predicted sea level rises of up to 59 cms, which are not occurring. He said Pacific nations such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands would be submerged, which hasn’t happened. (Page 149) He forecast, “climate refugees could constitute the fastest growing proportion of refugees globally”, which is ludicrous.



Garnaut wasn’t completely wrong, but he wasn’t infallibly right, either. Cherry-picking a single sentence that appears to pander to your hysterical doom-mongering is the sort of irrational blindness that keeps frauds, shonks and psychics in business.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.  President Trump’s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally. Tensions with Mexico are particularly high. Its president, Enrique Peña Nieto, above, canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump, and the two feuded  —   largely over Twitter  —   as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall. Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants, while America’s   sanctuary cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, vowed to resist   immigration enforcement. _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest “in decades, maybe ever. ” His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media, saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should “keep its mouth shut. ” He added: “I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. ” This may not come as a surprise: Sales of dystopian novels, most notably George Orwell’s “1984,” are spiking. Our literary critic offers a reappraisal. The Times is tracking Mr. Trump’s full agenda, and covering many more aspects of his administration. You can also sign up for our daily politics newsletter here. _____ 3. Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the   March for Life on the National Mall on Friday. Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women’s marches last weekend. And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump’s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion, a rule that often curtails broader health services. Above, a woman who suffered complications from a botched abortion in the Democratic Republic of Congo. _____ 4. The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it’s been in more than 60 years. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it’s meant to convey “how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making. ” It debuted in 1947. Two of the group’s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump’s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change. _____ 5. In China, hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday. Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns. _____ 6. For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. _____ 7. Tributes to Mary Tyler Moore, the iconic actress who died on Wednesday at 80, continue to pour in. The TV journalist Jane Pauley, above, said the character of the single,   news producer Mary Richards was a role model and more. She even mimicked her fashion and home décor choices. The show “made a woman in the newsroom seem normal,” wrote Ms. Pauley, the anchor of “Sunday Morning” on CBS. _____ 8. Serena and a resurgent Venus Williams will face each other in the final of the Australian Open on Saturday. It’s the first time they’re playing against each other in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2009, above. If Serena wins, she would set an   record with a 23rd Grand Slam singles title. And a surprisingly strong Roger Federer defeated Stan Wawrinka to advance to the men’s final. He’ll seek his first major title since Wimbledon in 2012 on Sunday. _____ 9.   years after the movie “Trainspotting” gave the world a glimpse into the   underbelly of Edinburgh, the characters are back. “T2 Trainspotting”  —   with the same director and several of the same stars, including Ewan McGregor, above center  —   checks in with the unmoored but compelling characters as they face middle age. It’s being released this week in Britain and reaches the U. S. in March. We rounded up the early reviews. _____ 10. Finally, whatever your politics, your fears, or your troubles, a gift: the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017.

Guest essay by Jim Steele
Director emeritus Sierra Nevada Field Campus, San Francisco State University
A recent Guardian article “Wild bees on the decline in key US agricultural ecosystems” adds further support to my analysis that debunked an earlier claim by Kerr 2015 that climate change had been killing wild bees. I had argued that an agricultural trend where increasing acreage of natural and agricultural habitats have been increasingly converted to corn for silage and biofuels in addition to the importation of exotic European diseases. Using corn for biofuel makes no sense in terms of CO2 reduction or energy efficiency, et due to global warming hysteria government agencies have subsidized the spread of corn fields. Corn is wind pollinated and provides no nectar resources for pollinators. Corn has been steadily replacing pollinator friendly wild plants and pollinator friendly agricultural plants like soybean.
Cornfields also require irrigation that has also increased the extraction of groundwater. Groundwater extraction has now been projected to raise sea level by 0.87 mm/year, accounting for 25% of the estimate current sea level rise.
According to the Guradian, “The study estimated that wild bee numbers diminished in 23% of the continental United States between 2008 and 2013 in a trend driven by conversion of their natural habitat into farmland including corn for biofuel production.” [Emphasis mine]
“The study followed a 2014 memorandum by Barack Obama creating a task force to study pollinator losses. The task force in May called for preserving wide swathes of pollinator habitats.”
Inappropriate biofuel subsidies are driven by CO2 alarmism. As I continue to warn, bad climate science will only lead to bad environmental stewardship!

 Guest essay by Robert Johnson

How plasma connects the Sun to the climate
The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) are a plasma phenomenon caused by charged particles from the solar wind entering the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Magnetic storms in the ionosphere, which have occasionally damaged satellites in orbit, are also evidence that the Earth’s upper atmosphere is electromagnetically connected to the Sun via the plasma in interplanetary space.
It’s recently been recognised that the atmosphere below the ionosphere is also a weak plasma due to the ionisation caused primarily by cosmic rays. So it’s plasma all the way down! The weather regions are directly connected to the Sun; even the air we breathe is all part of the same system.
This talk at the recent SIS meeting introduces plasma to the general reader and investigates how it enables variations in the Sun’s output to directly influence the weather systems here on Earth.

"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."
"**Apple has removed an app that protesters in Hong Kong have used to track police movements and tear gas use, saying the app violated its rules.**
The company said the app, HKmap.live, had ""been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents"".
Apple initially rejected the app \- which uses data from protesters on the ground - from its store.
When it later appeared on the App Store, there was a sharply-worded response in official Chinese media.
The removal then came after ""many concerned customers in Hong Kong contacted us"", Apple said.
""We have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police,"" Apple said.
The statement added that ""criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement"".
Although the app has been removed from Apple's store, a website version appears to remain active. There is also a version on Google Play.
When the app was available on the App Store, Apple was criticised in Chinese state media.
Communist Party publication the People's Daily didn't name the app, but criticised Apple for ""opening the door"" to violent protests.
""Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people's feelings,"" the paper said.
Apps previously have been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.
A number of companies have drawn the ire of Chinese officials over the long-running Hong Kong protests.
China's state broadcaster has scrapped plans to show two US NBA basketball pre-season games over a pro-Hong Kong tweet from a team manager, and sponsors have also been critical.
Jeweller Tiffany & Co scrapped an advert image after some Chinese consumers suggested it was supportive of the protesters.
And California-based Video-game company Blizzard suspended a gamer after he expressed support for the protestors during a livestream.
Hong Kong protesters, meanwhile, the other hand, have targeted mainland banks and what they perceive to be pro-mainland businesses.
For Apple, China is both a major market and a manufacturing base for its products.
The manufacturing of Apple products directly and indirectly accounts for around three million jobs in China.
Apple had sales of $9.61bn last quarter in its Greater China category, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong."

“West Texas Pumpjack” by Eric Kounce TexasRaiser – Located south of Midland, Texas.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
President Obama, on the eve of a 3 day flying tour of Alaska, to highlight the effects of global warming, has been forced to defend his decision to allow drilling for oil in the Arctic.
According to Obama;
“Our economy still has to rely on oil and gas. As long as that’s the case, I believe we should rely more on domestic production than on foreign imports.”
Read more: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/29/obama-arctic-drilling-alaska-trip-climate-change
However, green groups have gone on the attack, accusing Obama of hypocrisy, and of undermining his own global warming vision (same article).
“There is a very obvious contradiction between meaningful action to address climate change and continued exploration for remote and difficult hydrocarbon resources,” said Michael LeVine, Arctic campaigner for Oceana.
“Moving forward with exploiting Arctic oil and gas is inconsistent with the Administration’s stated goal and meaningful action on climate change.”
Credo, another campaign group, accused Obama of “self-defeating hypocrisy”.
In my opinion, Green groups are once again demonstrating that there is no compromise with fanaticism. Either you support every line item of their radical agenda, or they treat you as the enemy. By any reasonable metric, President Obama is the best friend green groups have ever had in the White House. Yet rather than recognise that President Obama is a green president, environmental groups are on the attack, because Obama has not fulfilled every one of their economically destructive and environmentally pointless demands.

Fifteen years ago, how many Americans or Bulgarians would have imagined that in 2003 Bulgaria would be one of America’s closest allies in Europe, that Bulgarian and American troops would be serving together in Iraq and that Bulgaria would have a smartly growing market economy? 



How did this change from Cold War enemies to new NATO allies come about, and will the good economic news from Bulgaria continue? 



Bulgaria overthrew its last communist dictator in November 1989. Early in 1990, I was invited by the Bulgarian government to become the co‐​chairman of the Bulgarian economic transition project. We assembled a group of U.S. economic, legal and industry experts and, working with our Bulgarian counterparts, developed a plan to move Bulgaria from a communist country to a free‐​market, democratic, capitalist one. The plan, which even included a proposed constitution and updated commercial code, was submitted to the Bulgarian people, government and parliament in October 1990. 



Unfortunately, few economic reforms were made because Bulgaria suffered a series of weak coalition governments and a chaotic political situation in the early 1990s. The so‐​called reformed socialists made a comeback in 1994, but were a thoroughly corrupt gang that looted the country and left it with hyperinflation. A second Bulgarian revolution took place in 1997 that ultimately installed a free‐​market‐​leaning democratic government. 



A major reform was made with the installation of a currency board in 1997 that tied the value of the Bulgaria currency to the German mark (and now the euro). Back in 1990, our transition team had recommended that Bulgaria establish a currency board. Unfortunately, it took a second bout of hyperinflation to finally convince the political forces we had been correct. The currency board has been an almost unqualified success, giving Bulgaria six years of currency stability. 



Two and half years ago, the former Bulgarian King, Simeon Saxe‐​Coburg‐​Gotha (who was exiled by the communists when he was a child) returned and ran for prime minister. He was elected and has continued much of the economic reform program of his immediate predecessors. The result has been an economy growing by about 5 percent annually. However, despite the good economic news, the former king did suffer a defeat in the local elections last month, probably due to having over‐​promised how quickly most people would see their standard of living improve. 



Despite continuing problems with corruption, particularly in the judicial system, there are now many reasons for optimism about Bulgaria. The country has a brilliant and very able young finance minister, Milen Velchev, who has managed to not only balance the budget but begin to pay down Bulgaria’s debt. The government has just introduced a flat 19 percent corporate tax rate (far lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent, and lower than in most European Union countries), which will encourage much more foreign and domestic investment and, ultimately, many new well‐​paying jobs. 



We, Americans who served as economic advisers in the early days of the transition, were naive about how difficult it would be for the Bulgarians to adopt our proposed reforms. Bulgaria had become a highly corrupt society, like other countries that suffered under communism. Even though most Bulgarians understood that communism and socialism did not work, they did not fully appreciate that for a capitalistic society to succeed, it was necessary to have honest courts that protect private property and that the people need to fulfill their contractual agreements. 



We foreign advisers stressed privatization, tax and regulatory reform, free markets, free trade and sound money. We should have given more emphasis to the rule of law and the importance of honesty in all business relationships in order to have a properly functioning economy and civil society. 



The critical mass of economic reforms and institutions have now been put in place, even though there is still much left to do. The first free‐​market think tank in Bulgaria, the Institute for Market Economy, was established in 1992. The most recent policy institute is the Bulgarian Council for Capital Formation, co‐​chaired by an American, Mark Bloomfield, who was a member of our original transition team. 



Bulgaria should be a prosperous country. It has rich agricultural land, natural resources, great scenic beauty, a pleasant climate, and a well educated, talented population. The bet is, with its entry into NATO, preparation for entry into the EU, and continued economic reform, Bulgaria will grow even more rapidly and finally fulfill its potential as an affluent, free and civil society.

"Even before President Trump issued an order on Friday banning immediate entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries, immigration lawyers, having heard rumors of coming action from the White House, were on alert. On Wednesday, lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center who were concerned that the action would affect the project’s clients sent out an email calling for lawyers who could volunteer immediately to go to airports where refugees were scheduled to enter the United States. “It occurred to us that there were going to be people who were traveling who would land and have their status affected while in midair,” said Betsy Fisher, the group’s policy director. And that is exactly what happened. Across the country, people were detained on Sunday after being caught up in the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s order, even though a petition filed on Saturday in federal court in Brooklyn led a judge to block part of the order. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, the plaintiffs named in the petition, were originally clients of Ms. Fisher’s organization. The email received a tremendous response, Ms. Fisher said, with “well over a thousand people” expressing interest and availability. By Saturday morning, the lawyers who heeded the call were at about a dozen airports around the country. Others who heard about the effort through colleagues or the news media went to airports on their own to pitch in. By early Sunday morning, Ms. Fisher said, lawyers offering services and advice were at “most international airports in the United States. ” Andre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was “entirely taken over by attorneys,” all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients’ families. “There were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together,” Mr. Segura said. “I’ve never seen that immediate coming together of teams to start filing actions to try to protect people. ” He added, “The dynamic between what was happening inside the terminal with all the attorneys, and outside with massive protests and people holding signs  —   I’ve never experienced anything like that. ” Mr. Segura said he arrived home around 2 a. m. on Sunday. He woke up at 5:30 and began answering emails from lawyers who had stayed overnight at the airport. While lawyers gathered at airports on Saturday, others were working furiously on litigation. Cecillia Wang, the A. C. L. U.’s deputy legal director, described the scene at her office as “complete chaos. ” “I was sitting at my desk working on a template habeas petition that could be used by lawyers at airports all around the country,” she said. Omar Jadwat, the director of the A. C. L. U.’s Immigrant Rights Project, which worked on the petition that led to the judge’s stay, said the litigation had not been prepared ahead of time. “That was not something we had on the shelf ready to go, waiting for the right plaintiffs to come along,” he said. “It was a case of: There’s this emergency, and people have to work together to figure out a response as quickly as we can so that these people and other people around the country didn’t get deported. ” Even after word of the federal court’s order reached the airport in New York, confusion reigned. Alina Das, a professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law, said she had arrived at the airport at 7 p. m. on Saturday and stayed overnight, working to get a client released. Ms. Das, who said she could not comment on her client’s situation, described the scene on Sunday morning, saying that it was “incredibly difficult to get an answer on whether our clients were going to be sent back or whether they were being processed for release” and that people remained detained even after the court order blocked part of the president’s actions. Avi Gesser, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell, described the process in Terminal 4 on Saturday, saying that a group of people had been deployed to search for those whose family members were detained. “If they found people, they referred them over to us and we onboarded people as clients if we could, and then filed habeas petitions,” he said. Mr. Gesser, who is originally from Canada, did not leave the airport until 4:30 a. m. on Sunday, he said. “Our firm has a lot of people who were not born in the United States,” he said. “We felt that people who were being detained needed legal representation. And that’s something that we do very well. ” Rebecca Heller, who was coordinating lawyers’ efforts on the ground for the International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday, said that by Sunday afternoon, her services were far less in demand. “They’re   now!” she said excitedly in a brief phone call. “That’s how a movement starts. ”"

From the Institute of Physics and the “children won’t know what snow is” department:
The likelihood of record-breaking warm years in England is set to substantially increase as a result of the human influence on the climate, new research suggests.
Time series of the observed CET (black).Time series of the mean of the historical simulations (solidorange), RCP8.5 simulations (solidred) and historical Nat simulations (solidblue). The maximum and minimum values of the modelled CET are shown for the historical simulations (dashedorange), RCP8.5simulations (dashed red) and HistoricalNat  simulations (dashedblue).The record annualCET is marked by the black cross.
In a study published today, 1 May, in IOP Publishing’s journal Environmental Research Letters, an international team of researchers has shown that the chances of England experiencing a record-breaking warm year, such as the one seen in 2014, is at least 13 times more likely as a result of anthropogenic climate change.
This is according to climate model simulations and detailed analyses of the Central England Temperature (CET) record–the world’s longest instrumental temperature record dating back to 1659.
The results of the study showed that human activities have a large influence on extreme warm years in England, which the researchers claim is remarkable given England is such a small region of the world.
Lead author of the study Dr Andrew King, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of Melbourne, said: “When you look at average annual temperatures over larger regions of the world, such as the whole of Europe, there is a lower variability in temperatures from year to year compared with smaller areas.
“As a result of this low variability, it is easier to spot anomalies. This is why larger regions tend to produce stronger attribution statements, so it is remarkable that we get such a clear anthropogenic influence on temperatures in a relatively small area across central England.”
To arrive at their results, the researchers firstly used climate model simulations to calculate the likelihood of very warm years when there is just natural forcings on the climate and no human influence, and then when there is both natural forcings and human influence. The change in the likelihood of warm years due to human influences on the climate was then calculated.
The researchers then observed the CET and picked out the warmest years from the record since 1900. The warmest years were then plotted onto a graph which the researchers used to calculate the likelihood of warm years happening now and warms years happening 100 years ago.
The model-based method suggested at least a 13-fold increase (with 90% confidence) due to human influences on the climate, whilst the observation-based approach suggested at least a 22-fold increase in the probability of very warm years in the climate of today compared with the climate of a century ago (again with 90% confidence).
“Both of our approaches showed that there is a significant and substantial increase in the likelihood of very warm years occurring in central England,” Dr King Continued.
According to the CET, 2014 was the warmest year on record in central England. It has been reported that during the last 60 years there has been rapid warming in the CET in line with the anthropogenic influence on the climate, with the highest average annual temperature of 10.93 °C recorded in 2014.
The Central England Temperature (CET) series, which is the longest instrumental time series of temperature in the world, has monthly recordings of average temperatures dating back to 1659 and recordings of average daily temperatures dating back to 1772.
The CET is designed to represent the climate of the English Midlands, which is approximated by a triangular area enclosed by Lancashire in the north, Bristol in the south-west and London in the south-east. The CET has undergone thorough and extensive quality control, making it an ideal resource for studying long-term temperature trends across the region.
As to whether these results can be seen to be representative of areas outside of central England, Dr King said: “I would expect that other areas near the UK would produce similar results.
“For larger regions, stronger attribution statements can often be made. For example, we performed a similar attribution study for Europe as a whole and found a 35-fold increase in the likelihood of extremely warm years using model simulations.”

"**On 17 February last year, a young Hong Kong couple's holiday in Taiwan went terribly wrong.**
The night before they were due to leave, the couple bought a large pink suitcase at one of Taipei's popular night markets.
Their hotel's CCTV footage showed the couple returning to their room with the suitcase. That was the last time the 20-year-old woman, Poon Hiu-wing, was seen alive.
The next morning, the footage showed her boyfriend Chan Tong-kai, who was 19 at the time, taking the suitcase, along with other luggage, out of the room to check out.
There was no sign of Ms Poon.
Chan was later seen pushing the suitcase through Taipei's busy subway stations. He took a flight back to Hong Kong that evening, alone.
It was a month later, after Ms Poon's father came to Taiwan to report her missing, that her body was found hidden in bushes, about 20 metres from a popular riverside trail in neighbouring New Taipei City.
""There was a stench, but no one thought there would be a dead body there,"" said Mr Chou, a long-time local resident.
""Sometimes as many as 10,000 dead fish would float up in the river here and it would smell bad, so everyone thought it was just the smell of dead fish.""
The Hong Kong authorities used Taiwan's request for Chan to be extradited as a reason for proposing a controversial bill to allow such extraditions.
The bill would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to Taiwan, as well as mainland China.
The former British colony does not yet have an extradition agreement with Taiwan or mainland China. But many Hong Kongers took to the streets in protest at the plans.
Given China's human rights violations and heavily government-controlled judicial system, they feared the bill would harm Hong Kong's judicial autonomy, established under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Taiwan also strongly objected, accusing the Hong Kong government of using its request for Chan's extradition as an excuse to ram through the bill.
The bill has since been withdrawn due to widespread protests, but Chan's case is still in limbo.
**What happen** **ed** **on the night in question?**
According to Hong Kong's High Court document on the case, Chan and Ms Poon met in 2017 and became lovers a month later.
Ms Poon was five weeks' pregnant when, in December, Chan arranged a trip to Taiwan for the couple, paying for plane tickets and hotel accommodation.
After returning to the hotel on 16 February, they argued about how to pack the suitcase. They later made up but in the very early hours of 17 February, they argued again.
It was during that argument that Ms Poon told Chan the baby in her womb was conceived with her former boyfriend. Chan said Ms Poon then showed him a video of her having sex with another man.
Feeling angry, he smashed her head against the wall and strangled her from behind with both hands. They struggled on the floor for about 10 minutes until she was dead.
He then stuffed her body into the pink suitcase and packed her belongings into four plastic bags.
In the morning, Chan threw away Ms Poon's belongings in bins near the hotel and checked out, taking the suitcase with Ms Poon's body in it.
He took the subway for about 40 minutes to Zhuwei station, dragged the suitcase along the trail by the Danshui river, found some tall bushes off the path, took the body out and dumped it there.
He tossed the suitcase elsewhere, but kept her ATM card, digital camera and iPhone.
Before leaving Taipei, he used her ATM card to withdraw TWD20,000 (Â£507, $653) and after returning to Hong Kong, he used her card to withdraw money three times, totalling HK$19,200 (Â£1,900, $2,450).
Chan was arrested on 13 March by Hong Kong police, two days after her parents reported her missing. He was later charged with four counts of dealing with proceeds from a crime, commonly called money laundering.
During the investigation, he confessed that he had killed Ms Poon and revealed where he had dumped the body, according to the court document.
Liu Guan-wu, a Zhuwei police officer at the time, said he and around 30 other officers found the body after a three-hour search.
""We were looking for the suitcase initially, because we thought the body was still inside the suitcase,"" said Mr Liu.
""But when we found her, it was just her body there. He didn't dismember her; he simply curved her body to stuff it inside the suitcase. She was not a tall girl and she was skinny.
""The body was decomposed. There were no signs of injury.""
In Hong Kong, Chan pleaded guilty to money laundering and was sentenced to 29 months in prison, but the High Court reduced the sentence by a third.
On 18 October this year, days before Chan's release, the Hong Kong government released a statement about his ""alleged offence"" in Taiwan.
""The courts of Hong Kong have no jurisdiction over it,"" the statement said.
""Neither do the local authorities have any ground to extend Chan's detention or pursue the offence that he was alleged to have committed in Taiwan.""
The case has revealed the conflicted relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong - as well as the island and mainland China, which considers Taiwan a province that must be reunified one day.
It also highlights the unnatural state of affairs among the three sides - places so close to each other, but with no extradition or judicial cooperation agreements.
The long dispute over Taiwan's sovereignty - whether it's a part of China or not - makes forming such agreements, usually reached between countries, a very sensitive matter.
On Wednesday, the day he was released from Hong Kong's jail, Chan bowed deeply before a large crowd of TV cameras and journalists, apologised to Ms Poon's family, expressed hopes that she would rest in peace, and asked society for forgiveness.
But the bickering continued between Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Taiwan's authorities initially refused to accept Chan's surrender, even though they issued an arrest warrant for him.
They suspect the whole thing was orchestrated by Beijing to treat Taiwan as a part of China and had insisted Hong Kong first negotiate a judicial assistance agreement before handing over Chan.
Hong Kong's authorities dismissed that as ""nonsense"" and urged Taiwan to take a suspect willing to surrender himself, so as to give justice to Ms Poon and her family.
Police officer Mr Liu said he's handled other murders, but never one like this, not least because of the political battles involved.
""I hope the case can be dealt with quickly,"" he said. ""It must be really sad for her parents.""
Perhaps Chan is also eager to find closure.
""For my impulse, for the wrongful act I've committed, I'm willing to surrender and go back to Taiwan to face prison sentence and face trial,"" he told the media.
""To society and Hong Kong people, I can only say I'm sorry. I hope everyone can forgive me. I hope everyone can give me a chance to be a new person and give me a chance to give back to society."""

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
A US judge in Anchorage has slapped a massive accumulating fine on Greenpeace of $2500 per hour, rising to $10,000 / hour, for every hour Greenpeace activists block Shell Oil ship MSV Fennica from leaving Portland, to sail for Alaska.
According to Sky News;
A US judge has slapped a $US2,500 ($A3,426.77) fine on Greenpeace for every hour its activists continue to block a Shell Oil ship headed for Alaska on a drilling expedition.
The activists have been hanging from ropes since Wednesday from a bridge in Portland, Oregon’s main city, to prevent the departure of the MSV Fennica, a Shell icebreaker that was in town for repairs.
But federal judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage, Alaska’s biggest city, ruled in the oil giant’s favour on Thursday, imposing the hourly fine until the protesters withdraw, a court official told AFP.
The fine will increase the longer the protest continues, according to the local KGW News.
Starting at 10am on Friday (0300 AEST on Saturday), Greenpeace will be fined $US5,000 an hour, increasing to $US7,500 an hour on Saturday and $US10,000 an hour from Sunday.

Greenpeace is a massive multi million dollar international organisation, with assets in the 10s of millions, so in principle they could laugh off even a $10,000 / hour fine for at least several weeks before feeling the financial strain. My guess is there may be some interesting discussions occurring now in Greenpeace HQ, about how much money they should burn to make their point.
Update
The MSV Fennica made it past the protestors at 6pm Thursday, according to Oregon Live.
Just before 6 p.m. Thursday, the controversial icebreaker MSV Fennica threaded through a hole cut by law enforcement in the wall of protesters suspended from the St. Johns Bridge.
…
A police Special Emergency Response Team officer rappelled over the bridge and cut the lines connecting the protesters dangling from the bridge. Then Portland Fire Bureau technical rescue teams moved in, with some firefighters going over the bridge’s edge and asking the protesters to voluntarily ease themselves down to waiting boats.
The first two protesters came down on their own but the third wouldn’t communicate. Firefighters connected two rope lines to his lines, removed his anchor and lowered him on their attached lines to a boat.
Their work opened a gap just wide enough for the Fennica’s safe passage.

Retreating sea ice linked to changes in ocean circulation, could affect European climate
From the UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
MODIS true-colour satellite image showing linear cloud patterns known as ‘cloud streets’ over the Greenland and Iceland Seas. These clouds are a signature of the transfer of heat and moisture that warms the atmosphere and cools the ocean resulting in a convective overturning of the water column, a process that plays an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The island of Jan Mayen is in the center of the image and the flow around its topography results in the formation of spiraling cloud patterns known as ‘von Karman vortices’.

Retreating sea ice in the Iceland and Greenland Seas may be changing the circulation of warm and cold water in the Atlantic Ocean, and could ultimately impact the climate in Europe, says a new study by an atmospheric physicist from the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) and his colleagues in Great Britain, Norway and the United States.
“A warm western Europe requires a cold North Atlantic Ocean, and the warming that the North Atlantic is now experiencing has the potential to result in a cooling over western Europe,” says professor G.W.K. Moore of UTM’s Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences.
As global warming affects the earth and ocean, the retreat of the sea ice means there won’t be as much cold, dense water, generated through a process known as oceanic convection, created to flow south and feed the Gulf Stream. If convection decreases, says Moore, the Gulf Stream may weaken, thereby reducing the warming of the atmosphere, in comparison to today.
Their research, published in Nature Climate Change on June 29, is the first attempt to examine and document these changes in the air-sea heat exchange in the region — brought about by global warming — and to consider its possible impact on oceanic circulation, including the climatologically important Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.
Previous studies have focused instead on the changing salinity of the northern seas and its effects on ocean circulation.
Moore and his fellow researchers based their findings on wintertime data from 1958 to 2014 that was provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and model simulations.
Traditionally, the Gulf Stream moves warm water north toward western Europe, says Moore, where it loses heat and moisture to the atmosphere, acting to moderate the climate in this region. The resulting colder, denser water sinks and returns south at a great depth eventually rising to the surface in the tropics, where the cycle, known as the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation, begins all over again.
The Iceland and Greenland Seas are among the only places worldwide where conditions are right and this heat exchange is able to change the ocean’s density enough to cause the surface waters to sink. The largest air-sea heat exchange in these seas occurs at the edge of the sea ice.
In the past, this region of maximum heat exchange has coincided with the location where oceanic conditions are optimal for convection to occur. However, in recent years, the sea ice has retreated and with it the region of maximum heat exchange. As a result, there has been a reduction in the heat exchange over the locations where sinking occurs in the ocean. This has the potential to weaken oceanic convection in the Greenland and Iceland Seas.
“The heat exchange is weaker — it’s like turning the stove down 20 percent,” says Moore. “We believe the weakening will continue and eventually cause changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Gulf Stream, which can impact the climate of Europe.”
The paper’s other authors are Kjetil V?ge from the University of Bergen, Robert Pickart from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Ian Renfrew from the University of East Anglia.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Conversation has published a gem of an article, aimed at people suffering climate “guilt”, to help them philosophically come to terms with the fact that they are experiencing emotional distress, about events which haven’t happened
According to The Conversation;
Do you suffer from climate guilt? A dose of philosophy can help
People cannot engage in something they cannot see or feel. We need concrete reasons to care and act. In this way, climate change presents a threefold intangible challenge:
1. we can perceive the weather, but the climate system is something rather abstract, a statistical construct
2. we now know climate change is anthropogenic, or man-made, but how can we understand this? One way is to say: mankind is the reason, but this becomes also very abstract. Who actually is represented with mankind? Another way is to say: China or the US is to blame, as if we are speaking of subjects and not concepts. We cannot grasp how you and I contribute to climate change, not by doing something extraordinary, but with our everyday lives
3. we cannot perceive how we as individuals can contribute to mitigating climate change. Eighteenth-century philosopher George Berkeley stated that “To be is to be perceived.” If we can’t see the change in the climate system, nor the reason why it is actually occurring, does it exist in our daily lives?

My favourite takeaway soundbite is the following;
… Furthermore, climate is not here and now. Its only possible way to be perceived is through recognition of patterns, by computer modeling and, most importantly, through representations. …

 **[Gabriel Popkin](https://undark.org/undark-author/gabriel-popkin/)**  
[undark.org](https://undark.org/2019/04/11/trump-war-against-science/)



 _By endorsing the overblown rhetoric that science is under siege, we play into the narrative that the media is just another partisan actor._



It may surprise you to learn that the Trump administration has, on quite a number of occasions, championed or advanced science. It has strongly backed increased funding for [quantum computing](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/612679/president-trump-has-signed-a-12-billon-law-to-boost-us-quantum-tech/) and promoted artificial intelligence [research](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/ai-artificial-intelligence-trump.html). The Trump Food and Drug Administration has [sought to](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/6/18252176/scott-gottlieb-fda-vaping-tobacco) regulate e-cigarettes based on scientific findings about their addictive potential. The National Cancer Institute under Trump has [pushed for](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/03/nci-director-norman-sharpless-named-acting-fda-chief) increased data sharing and shifted more funding to external researchers. NASA has launched multiple science instruments just this year and has more in the [pipeline](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-experiments-for-possible-lunar-flights-in-2019). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is [rolling out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/02/26/noaa-delays-launch-next-generation-weather-forecast-model-names-new-acting-head/?utm_term=.e75f44c354eb) a new weather model.



But the dominant narrative is that the administration is conducting a “[war on science](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/16/trumps-war-on-science-how-the-us-is-putting-politics-above-evidence)” and that science is “[under siege](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05706-9).” As a science journalist, I often get asked questions like, “Wow, it’s a really bad time for science, isn’t it?” I find myself explaining that, actually, American science is better-funded, by some measures, than it has ever been, and the U.S. federal science workforce remains probably the most impressive scientific organization the planet has ever seen. A feared exodus of scientists out of the government or even the country has hardly amounted to a trickle at most agencies. (At the Environmental Protection Agency — probably the most politically embattled science agency — more than 250 scientists have retired, taken buyouts, or quit, but several non-science agencies have seen larger staff reductions.)



Many decry proposed science agency budget cuts that sprout reliably under the Trump administration each year, like mushrooms after a spring rain. While such cuts would be drastic if enacted, the administration proposes similar cuts to many other discretionary programs — food stamps and public housing, for example — as well as Medicare and Medicaid. There doesn’t seem to be an anti-science agenda per se; there seems to be an agenda to cut spending on almost everything not related to the military or security. Similarly, while science and scientists definitely suffered during the recent government shutdown, they were collateral damage, not direct targets. And of course, Congress has rejected all these cuts; science agency budgets have generally remained steady or increased since Trump was elected.



The American conversation around science is much bigger than any president. Much of the science we taxpayers fund involves long-timeline activities that cannot be supported at universities. Did you know, for example, that since the 1930s, through Republican and Democrat administrations and even a world war, U.S. Forest Service scientists have designed and conducted a forest inventory that is the envy of the world? It’s unglamorous, non-breaking-news work, but it provides a crucial baseline for all kinds of research and decision making, and it has been replicated by other countries. By the way, the inventory is continuing under Trump — in fact, it’s improving, thanks to innovative uses of new technology. Government scientists continue to do lots of climate science, too, even if the administration doesn’t want to talk about it.



Of course, every president likes some science more and other science less. President Obama clearly was very interested in climate science, because he was interested in tackling climate change. He was less interested in space, cancelling a troubled program to return humans to the moon without putting in place a comparably visionary program, and allowing us to become dependent on other countries to shuttle our astronauts. Yet no one accused Obama of a war on space science. As a less visible example, the Obama Department of Energy tried to quietly kill a research program on the health impacts of radiation, despite protests from some scientists that we still don’t understand whether or not low levels of radiation from nuclear power plants, medical equipment, and other sources are harmful.



And, [as I have written](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-doesnt-want-the-public-to-know-what-government-scientists-are-doing/2018/12/11/b9ff5770-e69e-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html), the Obama administration was often oddly averse to talking about the science it was doing, throwing up barriers to communication between its scientists and the media. (The Trump administration has generally kept these barriers in place and added new ones.)



But since Obama invited students to present at White House science fairs, addressed scientific society meetings, and staffed a robust Office of Science and Technology Policy, he mostly got a pass for the times his administration defunded science or suppressed scientific information access, and retained his sterling reputation as a science champion. The main difference today is that the man in the White House doesn’t even pretend to care what scientists are learning.



Even when an opportunity presents itself, [such as the December signing of the National Quantum Initiative Act](https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/national-quantum-initiative-signed-law), he does not seem to have much to say on the subject — a rarity for Trump. And scientists clearly don’t like the cold shoulder they’re getting from this administration after the warmth they grew used to from the previous one. Hence, rhetoric suggesting that science is under [“relentless assault”](https://www.whistleblower.org/event-calendar/sunshine-week-2019-assaults-on-science-in-the-trump-era/) arises from groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists.



There’s no question that the Trump administration often ignores or downplays science when weighing policy decisions that scientists could clearly contribute to. But that is very different from assaulting or fighting a war against science. Remember how the coal industry and right-wing politicians accused the Obama administration of carrying out a “war on coal” as it tried to reduce air and water pollution and emissions from the electricity sector? Science advocates are now doing something similar.



Fine: It’s an advocate’s job to advocate. But journalists should not. It is not the media’s role to take sides in a political fight, or to decide that certain science, such as environmental or public health science, gets to represent all science. It is the media’s job to report what is happening, as comprehensively as possible, so that readers can make the best decisions possible. The science media have done part of this job well. They’ve reported exhaustively on the Trump administration’s efforts to cut climate science programs, disband science advisory panels at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, and to suppress scientists’ findings that certain chemicals such as chlorpyrifos and PFAS harm health. Science journalists’ stories helped get Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke — two ethically compromised agency heads — ousted. Kudos for that.



But we have done a less stellar job of covering the science agencies that Trump has not directly interfered with, and of painting a complete picture that can help Americans understand what their $86.5-billion-a-year investment in science is getting them. As in so many areas, we have let Donald Trump drive the agenda.



I implore my fellow science journalists to avoid getting dragged into political fights against the present administration. Doing so just plays into Trump’s narrative that the media are aligned against him. It makes it even harder to reach those who we most need to reach — people who have fallen under the sway of false narratives and conspiracy theories on climate change, vaccines, and other issues. And it makes all our readers less informed and less able to participate effectively in our democracy.

"
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"**Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), is something of a superstar these days.**
The entire planet hangs on his every word as he explains, during regular press conferences at WHO headquarters in Geneva, just how widespread the Covid-19 pandemic now is and what countries must do to defeat it.
A who's who of world leaders joined him, virtually, at one of those meetings last month - France's President Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - all pledging support for the WHO's efforts to end the pandemic, and find a vaccine.
Pop star Lady Gaga turned up a week before that, announcing an online music festival One World Together at Home - with a host of big names from Billy Eilish, to Elton John, to the Rolling Stones.
No other senior UN official, not even the UN Secretary General himself, has ever received so much attention.
Dr Tedros, as he likes to be known, is the first African head of the WHO.
He took office two-and-a-half years ago promising to reform the organisation, and to tackle the illnesses that kill millions each year: malaria, measles, childhood pneumonia, and HIV/Aids.
A certain political wiliness has become apparent too as Dr Tedros faces down more than just the virus itself.
He has weathered bitter criticism - most notably from the US - of his handling of the pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January.
A PHEIC is the WHO's highest level of health emergency. That means it requires 24-hour monitoring, deployment of medical staff, equipment and medicines, daily discussions with affected countries and countries who might be affected, and of course, a steady stream of reliable information for an anxious world desperate for immediate answers.
A huge task for the ""charming"" and ""unassuming"" 55-year-old at the organisation's head.
At his first press conference as WHO director general, the Geneva-based journalists quickly realised Dr Tedros' style would be very different.
He strolled in smiling, sat down and chatted in a very relaxed way, his voice sometimes so quiet it was difficult to hear him. That was a very big change from his more formal predecessor, Margaret Chan.
And yet, behind that quiet manner, there lies a very determined man.
Before becoming head of the WHO, he climbed through the ranks of Ethiopia's government, becoming health minister and then foreign minister. He could not have risen that far by being self-effacing.
Dr Tedros was born in 1965 in Asmara, which became Eritrea's capital after independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and grew up in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region.
One formative, and now motivating experience, was the death of a younger brother, who was around four years old at the time, he told Time magazine in November. Later, as a student, Dr Tedros came to suspect it was measles that killed him.
""I didn't accept it; I don't accept it even now,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that it was unfair that a child should die from a preventable disease just because he was born in the wrong place.
""All roads should lead to universal health coverage. I will not rest until we have met this,"" he told the World Health Assembly shortly before his election as WHO chief.
As the coronavirus pandemic exposes the fragility of even the richest countries' health sectors in a crisis, Dr Tedros and his supporters believe it's the best argument there is for a radical global commitment to universal health coverage.
Dr Tedros became a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was in the vanguard of the 1991 overthrow of Ethiopia's Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam.
As a government minister from 2005, he was seen as more approachable and friendly than some of his more austere TPLF comrades.
He has been praised for reforming the health sector and improving access to health care in Ethiopia, Africa's most populous state after Nigeria.
But when he was in charge, his ministry was known to discourage journalists from reporting about suspected cholera cases in the country.
During his highly efficient and ultimately successful campaign to lead the WHO, Dr Tedros' supporters dismissed allegations that he had covered up cholera outbreaks.
That is why ""persuasive"" and ""political"" are also words which crop up regularly when discussing his leadership of the WHO.
He knows that the WHO's success tackling global health crises depends on the co-operation of the organisation's 194 member states.
During the current Ebola outbreak in DR Congo which is also a PHEIC, he has travelled there several times, not just to see the situation but to also talk to government leaders. And he moved quickly to visit Beijing when news of the coronavirus outbreak emerged.
""His strategy is to coax China to transparency and international co-operation rather than criticising the government,"" says Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
But has that actually worked?
Some WHO watchers have criticised the effusive praise heaped on China for its containment measures.
After his trip to Beijing, Dr Tedros said China had set ""a new standard for outbreak control"".
A few days later, he told world leaders meeting at the Munich Security Conference that China's actions had ""bought the world time"".
Such comments sit uneasily with the knowledge that China arrested health workers who first raised the alarm about the outbreak.
The US, with President Donald Trump leading the way, has cut its funding to the WHO, saying the organisation botched its efforts to control the pandemic.
Dr Tedros knows very well just how serious the US funding cut is, not just on an immediate financial level, but to the whole UN system, based as it is on a multilateral approach to the world's biggest threats.
He has been careful to say that he ""regrets"" the US decision, and his only mention of Mr Trump was to say he thought the president was handling the US' virus outbreak well.
But that all-star line up of world leaders, in which the US was conspicuous by its absence, was a political masterstroke.
It laid the groundwork for an accelerated development of treatments and vaccines, and promised the resulting medicines would be fairly priced, and available to all.
At the same time it sent a signal to Washington: Look, we're all here getting on with this crisis together, where are you?
So is there any foundation to the US charge that the WHO waited too long to declare a PHEIC?
""I was one of the first to ask him to call a PHEIC,"" says Prof Gostin. ""Having said that, it was only a short delay and I don't think the timing had any impact on the trajectory of Covid-19.""
""I do worry quite a bit however that his effusive praise for China could in the long term tarnish the WHO's reputation as a trusted scientific authority willing to speak truth to power.""
Meg Davis, a global health specialist at Geneva's Graduate Institute, views the WHO's position as an awkward one.
""All my sympathies go to [them], they were in a tough spot,"" she says. ""China was the place where we first saw the outbreak. They [WHO] sent a team to China, wrote generally an accurate report about the things China was doing well.
""But they didn't talk about censorship, or repression of whistleblowersâ¦ and because they didn't do that, they are now having to pay a ridiculous price.""
Now is not the time, says Dr Davis, to start cutting funding.
""At this moment we really need the WHO more than ever. We need a functional well-resourced organisation, to analyse the data and gather evidence of what works.""
So while Dr Tedros may be political, a lot of that political effort seems to be spent reassuring authoritarian, opaque governments, in a bid to get them to work with the WHO to tackle diseases which threaten global health.
When it comes to perceiving how that effort may be viewed by governments in Western democracies, his political skills may not be quite so sharp.
Shortly after taking office he proposed Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president at the time, as a WHO goodwill ambassador, saying he had worked to make Zimbabwe ""a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies"".
Only after days of outrage, not just from governments, but from human rights groups, who pointed to the deprivation that Mr Mugabe's regime had inflicted on its people, did Dr Tedros decide to withdraw his proposal.
It is not the first time the WHO has been in the spotlight for allegedly handling a disease outbreak badly.
Dr Tedros' predecessor Margaret Chan was criticised for a perceived overreaction to the 2010 swine flu outbreak, over which she declared a pandemic and advised countries to spend millions on medicines most did not, in the end, need.
Then she was seen to react far too slowly to West Africa's catastrophic Ebola outbreak, which claimed at least 11,000 lives.
""Damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" is a phrase you often hear at WHO headquarters.
Prof Gostin believes Dr Tedros has become ""the symbol of leadership"" in the course of the coronavirus crisis. But, he warns, the WHO's ""fundamental weaknesses are still there, including pitiful funding"".
The success of Dr Tedros, and the WHO as a whole, at handling the coronavirus will not be really clear until the crisis is over.
For now, he will keep on advising countries to prepare, to diagnose, to trace, and to contain.
And so he continues with his press conferences. He knows they are being watched around the world, in every time zone. He begins each with the words ""Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening"".
Despite the pressure to come up with answers, and despite the constant media spotlight, he remains quiet and friendly.
His only flash of passion came when he was asked, for the umpteenth time, what his response was to the personal criticism of him.
""I don't have extra energy for that,"" he said. ""My focus is on saving lives."""

California’s accumulated precipitation “deficit” from 2012 to 2014 shown as a percent change from the 17-year average based on TRMM multi-satellite observations. CREDIT NASA/Goddard Scientific Visualization Studio
A new NASA study has concluded California accumulated a debt of about 20 inches of precipitation between 2012 and 2015 — the average amount expected to fall in the state in a single year. The deficit was driven primarily by a lack of air currents moving inland from the Pacific Ocean that are rich in water vapor.
In an average year, 20 to 50 percent of California’s precipitation comes from relatively few, but extreme events called atmospheric rivers that move from over the Pacific Ocean to the California coast.
“When they say that an atmospheric river makes landfall, it’s almost like a hurricane, without the winds. They cause extreme precipitation,” said study lead author Andrey Savtchenko at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Savtchenko and his colleagues examined data from 17 years of satellite observations and 36 years of combined observations and model data to understand how precipitation has varied in California since 1979. The results were published Thursday in Journal of Geophysical Research – Atmospheres, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.
The state as a whole can expect an average of about 20 inches of precipitation each year, with regional differences. But, the total amount can vary as much as 30 percent from year to year, according to the study.
In non-drought periods, wet years often alternate with dry years to balance out in the short term. However, from 2012 to 2014, California accumulated a deficit of almost 13 inches, and the 2014-2015 wet season increased the debt another seven inches, for a total 20 inches accumulated deficit during the course of three dry years.
The majority of that precipitation loss is attributed to a high-pressure system in the atmosphere over the eastern Pacific Ocean that has interfered with the formation of atmospheric rivers since 2011.
Atmospheric rivers occur all over the world. They are narrow, concentrated tendrils of water vapor that travel through the atmosphere similar to, and sometimes with, the winds of a jet stream. Like a jet stream, they typically travel from west to east. The ones destined for California originate over the tropical Pacific, where warm ocean water evaporates a lot of moisture into the air. The moisture-rich atmospheric rivers, informally known as the Pineapple Express, then break northward toward North America.
Earlier this year, a NASA research aircraft participated in the CalWater 2015 field campaign to improve understanding of when and how atmospheric rivers reach California.
Some of the water vapor rains out over the ocean, but the show really begins when an atmospheric river reaches land. Two reached California around Dec. 1 and 10, 2014, and brought more than three inches of rain, according to NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)’s multi-satellite dataset. The inland terrain, particularly mountains, force the moist air to higher altitudes where lower pressure causes it to expand and cool. The cooler air condenses the concentrated pool of water vapor into torrential rains, or snowfall as happens over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where water is stored in the snowpack until the spring melt just before the growing season.
The current drought isn’t the first for California. Savtchenko and his colleagues recreated a climate record for 1979 to the present using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, or MERRA. Their efforts show that a 27.5 inch deficit of rain and snow occurred in the state between 1986 and 1994.
“Drought has happened here before. It will happen again, and some research groups have presented evidence it will happen more frequently as the planet warms,” Savtchenko said. “But, even if the climate doesn’t change, are our demands for fresh water sustainable?”
The current drought has been notably severe because, since the late 1980s, California’s population, industry and agriculture have experienced tremendous growth, with a correlating growth in their demand for water. Human consumption has depleted California’s reservoirs and groundwater reserves, as shown by data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, leading to mandatory water rationing.
“The history of the American West is written in great decade-long droughts followed by multi-year wet periods,” said climatologist Bill Patzert at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. He was not involved in the research. “Savtchenko and his team have shown how variable California rainfall is.”
According to Patzert, this study added nuance to how scientists may interpret the atmospheric conditions that cause atmospheric rivers and an El Niño’s capacity to bust the drought. Since March, rising sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific have indicated the formation of El Niño conditions. El Niño conditions are often associated with higher rainfall to the western United States, but it’s not guaranteed.
Savtchenko and his colleagues show that El Niño contributes only six percent to California’s precipitation variability and is one factor among other, more random effects that influence how much rainfall the state receives. While it’s more likely El Niño increases precipitation in California, it’s still possible it will have no, or even a drying, effect.
A strong El Niño that lasts through the rainy months, from November to March, is more likely to increase the amount of rain that reaches California, and Savtchenko noted the current El Niño is quickly strengthening.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which monitors El Niño events, ranks it as the third strongest in the past 65 years for May and June. Still, it will likely take several years of higher than normal rain and snowfall to recover from the current drought.
“If this El Niño holds through winter, California’s chances to recoup some of the precipitation increase. Unfortunately, so do the chances of floods and landslides,” Savtchenko said. “Most likely the effects would be felt in late 2015-2016.”

From Oregon State University and the department of “we fully understand Earth’s climate, we just need more funds” department comes this bit of a surprise. (h/t to Dr. Leif Svalgaard)
Researchers find 200-year lag between climate events in Greenland, Antarctica

CORVALLIS, Ore. – A new study using evidence from a highly detailed ice core from West Antarctica shows a consistent link between abrupt temperature changes on Greenland and Antarctica during the last ice age, giving scientists a clearer picture of the link between climate in the northern and southern hemispheres.
Greenland climate during the last ice age was very unstable, the researchers say, characterized by a number of large, abrupt changes in mean annual temperature that each occurred within several decades. These so-called “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” took place every few thousand years during the last ice age. Temperature changes in Antarctica showed an opposite pattern, with Antarctica cooling when Greenland was warm, and vice versa.
In this study funded by the National Science Foundation and published this week in the journal Nature, the researchers discovered that the abrupt climates changes show up first in Greenland, with the response to the Antarctic climate delayed by about 200 years. The researchers documented 18 abrupt climate events during the past 68,000 years.
“The fact that temperature changes are opposite at the two poles suggests that there is a redistribution of heat going on between the hemispheres,” said Christo Buizert, a post-doctoral research at Oregon State University and lead author on the study. “We still don’t know what caused these past shifts, but understanding their timing gives us important clues about the underlying mechanisms.
“The 200-year lag that we observe certainly hints at an oceanic mechanism,” Buizert added. “If the climatic changes were propagated by the atmosphere, the Antarctic response would have occurred in a matter of years or decades, not two centuries. The ocean is large and sluggish, thus the 200-year time lag is a pretty clear fingerprint of the ocean’s involvement.”
These past episodes of climate change differ in a major way from what is happening today, the researchers note. The abrupt events of the ice age were regional in scope – and likely tied to large-scale changes in ocean circulation. Warming today is global and primarily from human carbon dioxide emissions in the Earth’s atmosphere.
The key to the discovery was the analysis of a new ice core from West Antarctica, drilled to a depth of 3,405 meters in 2011 and spanning the last 68,000 years, according to Oregon State paleoclimatologist Edward Brook, a co-author on the Nature study and an internationally recognized ice core expert.
Because the area where the ice core was drilled gets high annual snowfall, Brook said, the new ice core provides one of the most detailed records of Antarctic temperatures at a very high resolution. Greenland temperatures were already well-established, the researchers say, because of high annual snowfall and more available ice core data.
“Past ice core studies did not reveal the temperature changes as clearly as this remarkable core,” said Eric Steig, a professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, who co-wrote the paper. Steig’s laboratory made one of the key measurements that provides past Antarctic temperatures.
“Previous work was not precise enough to determine the relative timing of abrupt climate change in Antarctica and Greenland, and so it was unclear which happened first,” Steig noted. “Our new results show unambiguously that the Antarctic changes happen after the rapid temperature changes in Greenland. It is a major advance to know that the Earth behaves in this particular way.”
Kendrick Taylor, chief scientist on the project, said the core enabled the research team to get the relative timing of Greenland and Antarctic temperatures down to several decades.
“We needed a climate record from the Southern Hemisphere that extended at least 60,000 years into the past and was able to resolve fast changes in climate,” said Taylor, from the Desert Research Institute in Nevada. “We considered sites all over Antarctica before selecting the site with the best combination of thick ice, simple ice flow and the right amount of annual snowfall.”
Taylor and colleagues formed a science and engineering team consisting of 28 laboratories from around the United States. “The resulting information provides unprecedented detail about many aspects of the Earth’s past climate,” Taylor said. “This will provide a generation of climate researchers a way to test and improve our understanding of how and why global climate changes.”
OSU’s Buizert said it is “very likely” that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is involved in these abrupt climate reversals.
“This ocean circulation brings warm surface waters from the tropics to the North Atlantic,” said Buizert, who is in OSU’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. “As these water masses cool, they sink to the bottom off the ocean. This happens right off the coast of Greenland, and therefore Greenland is located in a sweet spot where the climate is very sensitive to changes in the AMOC.”
Brook said the AMOC seems to be critical, but was probably part of a combination of factors that ultimately controlled these past abrupt changes.
“Although ocean circulation may be the key, there are probably other feedbacks involved, such as the rise and fall of sea ice and changes in ice and snow cover on land,” Brook said. “There is probably some kind of threshold in the system – say, in the salinity of the surface ocean – that triggers temperature reversals.
“It’s not a problem to find potential mechanisms; it’s just a question of figuring out which one is right. And the precise timing of these events, like we describe in this study, is an important part of the puzzle.”

The paper:


Precise interpolar phasing of abrupt climate change during the last ice age


Nature 520,661–665(30 April 2015) doi:10.1038/nature14401









The last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard–Oeschger climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate archives1. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard–Oeschger cycle and vice versa2, 3, suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw4, 5, 6. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events7, 8, 9. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision2, 3, 10. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 ± 92 years (2σ) for Dansgaard–Oeschger events, including the Bølling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 ± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard–Oeschger dynamics.

"For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos, shifting from science fiction to the realm of the possible the idea of developing human organs in animals for later transplant. The approach involves generating stem cells from a patient’s skin, growing the desired new organ in a large animal like a pig, and then harvesting it for transplant into the patient’s body. Since the organ would be made of a patient’s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. The    pigs would be examples of chimeras, animals composed of two different genomes. They would be generated by implanting human stem cells into an early pig embryo, resulting in an animal composed of mixed pig and human cells. One team of biologists, led by Jun Wu and Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute, has shown for the first time that human stem cells can contribute to forming the tissues of a pig, despite the 90 million years of evolution between the two species. Another group, headed by Tomoyuki Yamaguchi and Hideyuki Sato of the University of Tokyo, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi of Stanford, has reversed diabetes in mice by inserting pancreas glands composed of mouse cells that were grown in a rat. The Salk team’s report is published in Thursday’s issue of Cell and the   team’s in Wednesday’s issue of Nature. The two reports together establish the feasibility of trying to grow replacement human organs in animals, though such a goal is still far off. “I think this is very promising work in principle,” said Rudolf Jaenisch, a stem cell expert at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. Many technical and ethical barriers have yet to be overcome, but the research is advancing alongside the acute need for organs some 76, 000 people in the United States alone are awaiting transplants. Creating chimeras, especially those with human cells, may prove controversial, given the possibility that test animals could be humanized in undesirable ways. One would be if human cells should be incorporated into a pig’s brain, endowing it with human qualities. Almost no one wants a talking pig. Another untoward outcome would be if human cells should come to compose the pig’s reproductive tissues. Few people want to see what might result from the union between a pig with human sperm and a sow with human eggs. In 2005, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas introduced a bill imposing a $1 million fine on anyone creating and profiting from a chimera with human cells in its brain or reproductive tissues. That bill went nowhere, but in deference to public concerns the National Institutes of Health in 2015 instituted a moratorium on using public funds to insert human cells into animal embryos. The N. I. H. proposed last August to lift the ban, but to require grant proposals involving the insertion of human stem cells into early animal embryos to be examined by an expert committee. The public comment period on the proposal drew 22, 000 responses that it reviewed. . The ban is still in place, and it’s unclear whether the Trump administration would continue to consider lifting the moratorium or whether new objections would be raised to using public funds for this line of research. “We have no indication one way or another that they have any opinions on this,” said Carrie D. Wolinetz, the associate director for science policy at the N. I. H. Insertion of human stem cells into the early embryos of monkeys was prohibited in 2009, and remains so because monkeys, given their evolutionary closeness to humans, might easily have their brains altered by human cells. Biologists’ interest in chimeras has been prompted by the limited success in coaxing medically useful tissues from stem cells grown in glassware.   human stem cells were first derived from human embryos in 1998 and from ordinary adult tissue cells in 2007. After each discovery there were hopes of converting the cells into therapeutic tissues by exposing them in glassware to the sequence of natural chemicals that in the living embryo directs them into constructing the heart, brain, lungs and other organs. But no one knows exactly what sequence of chemicals is required for the generation of each different tissue or organ. This may be why glassware experiments with stem cells have not yet lived up to their full promise. Some biologists believe a better approach may be to grow stem cells not in glassware but in a developing embryo, where they will be exposed to the natural sequence of chemicals required to induce each type of organ. “In the last 18 years, hundreds of labs, including ours, have tried to generate different cell types from human pluripotent stem cells in the culture dish with a cocktail of factors,” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte said. “But the cocktails are not identical to what the cells experience in the embryo. So I thought, ‘Why not let nature do the job? ’” Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s and Dr. Nakauchi’s teams have both pursued a strategy of directing the human donor cells to generate specific organs in the recipient species. This is desirable for both technical and ethical reasons. Dr. Nakauchi has disabled the master gene in rats for making a pancreas so that when mouse stem cells are injected into the early embryo of such a rat, the growing embryo has no choice but to construct its pancreas of pure mouse cells, instead of the usual mixture of rat and mouse cells. Generating inviting homes for the donor cells may reduce the risk that they will be incorporated in nontarget tissues like the brain or reproductive tissues. Also, an organ made purely of donor cells can be transplanted into the donor animal with minimal fear of rejection. In practice, about 10 percent of the mouse pancreases generated in rats was composed of rat cells, because the rat supplies the blood vessels for the organ. But the rat blood vessels seem to be quickly replaced when the organs are transferred to mice. The mice with their new pancreases lived in good health for a year after the transplant. They came from the same inbred strain as the donor mice, so they did not reject their new organs. The result provides proof of principle that Type 1 diabetes can be treated by growing a pancreas from an individual’s cells in another animal, Dr. Nakauchi and colleagues conclude. The next step is to repeat the experiment in pigs, which produce organs of a more suitable size for use in humans. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s team has now shown that human stem cells do survive in pig embryos and help form their organs, although not very efficiently. “The human cell doesn’t contribute much. To the brain we observed little or no contribution at all,” said his colleague Dr. Wu. “This is good news because we can guide the human cells to the organ we want. ” Both Dr. Izpisua Belmonte and Dr. Nakauchi said there was a long way to go before human organs could successfully be grown in animals like pigs. Chimeras will be more immediately useful in studying human embryogenesis, testing drugs and following the progress of disease. To achieve the goal of growing human organs for transplant, researchers must first engineer pigs that cannot make the organ of interest. In mice, this has already been done for the pancreas, heart and eye. They must then show that human stem cells can construct such an organ in a pig. Since the pig will supply the blood vessels and nerves, these will need to be replaced by the recipient’s cells after transplant without triggering immune rejection. If rejection does occur, the researchers will have to knock out the pig’s vasculature genes and arrange for these too to be humanized. Complex organs, like the heart, will be harder to grow than those like the pancreas which has a single kind of progenitor cell. All these steps, though they seem feasible, will require several years to develop and test. Both scientists expressed confidence that ethical concerns about chimera research could be addressed. Chimeras are typically mosaics in which each organ is a mixture of the host and donor cells. But new techniques like the   gene editing system should allow the human cells in a pig embryo both to be channeled into organs of interest and to be excluded from tissues of concern like the brain and reproductive tissues. “This isn’t dangerous research. We’re not creating monsters,” Dr. Nakauchi said. “There isn’t a need to get into a debate about moral humanization if scientists target the organs where the human cells will go,” said Insoo Hyun, a medical ethicist at Case Western Reserve University. “Scientists are not making chimeras just for fun  —   it’s to relieve the dire shortage of transplantable organs. ” Concern about human cells’ incorporation into a lower animal’s brain is not without basis. Dr. Steven Goldman of the University of Rochester Medical Center found in 2013 that mice injected with a special type of human brain cell had enhanced learning abilities. But other forms of humanized mice, such as mice engineered to have a human immune system, are routine laboratory animals that seem to occasion little angst. Dr. Izpisua Belmonte’s insertion of human stem cells into pig embryos was not affected by the N. I. H. moratorium on such chimeras because he used private funds. His experiment was approved by the authorities in Spain and in California, and following their advice, the development of the pig chimeras was stopped after four weeks in the womb. Dr. Nakauchi moved his lab to Stanford from Tokyo in 2014 because Japanese regulations do not allow chimera research, only to be hit with the N. I. H. moratorium a year later, which prevented him from making chimeras with human cells. His mouse pancreas experiment has taken eight or nine years to complete. “I have been in a very frustrating situation,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the latest on plans by some overly overzealous German government leaders to get the country to commit economic suicide through de-carbonization, at least that’s what German industry believes.
Online German national daily Die Welt has a piece by Daniel Wetzel titled: German Economy Fears Eco-Dictatorship.

Screen shot of Die Welt report
In the wake of the lofty declarations made at the Paris Conference to roll back global CO2 emissions, a number of high level Environment Ministry bureaucrats in Germany’s government have been eagerly concocting a “radical bill” dubbed “Climate Protection 2050” – designed to make Germany almost carbon-free by 2050.  Already the bill’s extremism and disconnect from reality are coming under heavy fire.
High costs would devastate the poor
In the wake of Paris, Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks has put together a “catalogue of measures” which she and her Ministry hope will be passed into law by early summer.
Should the proposals be enacted, Wetzel writes that it would mean “higher rental prices for apartments, higher taxes, mandatory renovations by building owners, speed limits and massive cost hikes for industrial enterprises“.
The proposals call for the mandatory, comprehensive renovation of buildings that owners would be forced by law to carry out. Such huge costs of course would have to be passed on to the occupants who rent or lease the buildings.

Wetzel writes that Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks is moving rapidly to get the bill enacted before summertime. Industry warns of “catastrophic consequences” should the CO2 restricting proposals be adopted. The catalogue of measures designed to lead Germany to a near zero-carbon society by 2050 has the industry spooked. Wetzel writes of an “urgent letter” by leading industry trade groups addressed to the Environment Ministry – one that uses uncharacteristically harsh terms such as “threatening ecology or climate dictatorship“. Copies of the letter were also sent to the heads of other German federal ministries, such as the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry Of Commerce.
“Poison list of draconian measures”
According to Wetzel some of the proposals include severe tax penalties for owners of “energy inefficient” buildings should they refuse to implement costly renovation works. The catalogue also calls for excruciatingly high taxes on heating oil and natural gas. Wetzel quotes Andreas Lücke of the German Heating Industry Association (BDH) who calls the “Climate Protection Plan 2050” a “poison list of draconian measures.”
The catalogue of climate measures also calls for the heavy taxation of coal power plants, which thus would put tens of thousands of coal mining and power sector jobs in jeopardy. Also the catalogue calls for a speed limit of 120 km/hr on the country’s famed autobahns and a snail-like speed of 30 km/hr. within all city limits.
The proposed climate protection bill also calls for eliminating fossil fuel combustion engines in motor vehicles by 2050, which means no internal combustion engine cars will be sold after 2030. Already today Germany’s plan to get one million cars onto the streets by 2020 is only some 2% fulfilled, as no one is interested in electric cars. Wetzel writes:
When the German government foresees the death of the combustion engine within the next 14 years, even though electric cars have failed to sell so far, it shows us the newly acquired level of radicalism that their climate-political demands and expectations have taken on”.
When examining the catalogue of measures proposed in the Environment Ministry’s bill, one has to wonder if the German government has any remaining connection left to reality. If this bill does not get watered down severely – very severely, then Germany may find itself needing a wall to keep the citizens and companies in – and not refugees out. It’s mind-boggingly radical and extreme. Germany’s Ministry Of Environment obviously does not have a balanced panel of advisors, but rather one likely made up of only extreme environmental activists.
Wetzel writes of requests being made by the WWF, which is calling for a transition over to the full electrification of the entire transport sectors, industrial processes and heating, and away from fossil fuels altogether. This, the WWF feels, can be accomplished with sun and wind. They also call for the end of coal power by 2035. However, the WWF gave no specifics how this should be accomplished.
From an energy engineering standpoint, little of what is proposed by the catalogue can be done without major sacrifice. So, it’s little wonder the government has already realized this and rightly scaled back on renewable energies over the past couple of years. But when the bill reaches Parliament in early summer, nothing can be excluded. Yet, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. Expect the highly corrosive measures to be severely watered down.

"**Basketball superstar LeBron James has weighed in on a row between the NBA and China, saying a team manager who caused uproar with a tweet about Hong Kong ""wasn't educated"" on the situation.**
In a now-deleted tweet, Houston Rockets' Daryl Morey expressed support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. He later apologised.
Mr James, the NBA's best-known player, often speaks out on social issues.
His latest comments were praised in China but drew ire in the US.
During a pre-game interview in Los Angeles on Monday, Mr James told reporters he believed Mr Morey was ""misinformed"".
""I don't want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey,"" he said, ""but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.""
Mr James added: ""We do all have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others and you're only thinking about yourself.""
Mr James' remarks sparked outrage from activists in Hong Kong, some US politicians and people on social media, with many users reposting one of his tweets from 2018 that quoted the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
One Republican senator, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, accused the athlete of ""parroting communist propaganda"".
In a clarifying tweet, Mr James said he was referring to the consequences of Mr Morey's comment, rather than the substance.
Chinese officials and media responded with outrage to Mr Morey's original tweet, which referred to months of pro-democracy protests that have consumed Hong Kong, a territory that is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
The NBA - which is hugely popular in China - has struggled to respond to the situation, with some Chinese partners suspending relations with the league by cancelling broadcasts and sponsorships.
Mr James has spoken out in the past on issues concerning race and police brutality and the NBA has been praised for accepting protest among its players.
Mr James has significant financial interests in China, through his lifetime endorsement deal with Nike and via millions of fans."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPuzzling drought history of Spain during the past 300 years
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German passages translated by P. Gosselin)
[NOTE: Comment moderation will be slow over the next couple of days due to limited WIFI access. -PG]
Gradually word is getting out that the current climate trend has to be put in an historical pre-industrial context before one can draw far-reaching conclusions on anthropogenic causes. The Spanish Research platform sinc published on 27 June 2016 a press release on the drought history of Spain during the past three hundred years:
Radiography of drought periods in Spain from the last 318 years
The Mediterranean Basin has been witness to increased droughts for at least five decades, but has this always been the case? A team from the University of Zaragoza has been successful in reconstructing, for the first time, the droughts from 1694 to 2012 based on the precipitation index and the study of tree growth rings. According to the study, the twelve months leading up to July 2012 were the driest.
In the Mediterranean Basin, droughts are a recurring phenomenon that negatively impacts society, economic activities and natural systems. No one seems to doubt the fact that temperatures all over the world have risen in recent decades. However, this trend does not appear to be perceived as clearly when it comes to precipitation (for which data from 1950 onwards is available). Thus, up until now, the study on the recurrence and severity of droughts in Spain has been based on information from weather stations, with sufficient data only as of the mid-twentieth century.
To test the evolution of the droughts, scientists from the Department of Geography at the University of Zaragoza utilised indirect information, such as the study of tree growth rings, to reconstruct the climate of the Iberian Range as far back as 1694 and to analyse dry periods using the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The researchers collected 336 samples and 45,648 growth rings from five different species (P. sylvestris, P. uncinata, P. nigra, P. halepensis, and Pinus pinaster) from 21 locations in the province of Teruel, in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, at an average altitude of 1,600 metres. The results, published in the ‘International Journal of Biometeorology’, made it possible to evaluate droughts from the last three centuries; they reveal that the twelve months leading up to July 2012 were the driest over the entire period studied. “We have been able to successfully identify seven especially dry periods and five wet periods since the end of the 17th century”, says Ernesto Tejedor to Sinc, the main author of the study.
The driest periods
According to the researchers, in addition to these periods there have been 36 extremely dry years and 28 very wet years since the end of the 17th century. “Some of these dry years, such as 1725, 1741, 1803 and 1879, are also identified in other drought reconstructions in Romania and Turkey, thus demonstrating the larger-scale coherence of the extreme deviations and their relationship with increasingly global atmospheric processes”, adds Tejedor.
Many of these extreme events are associated with catastrophic historical and cultural changes from the last three centuries. In fact, 1725 is known as ‘The year without a harvest’ in Monegros. These events are reflected in historical documents as the ‘pro-pluvia’ rogations, “since the intense droughts led to bad harvests with serious consequences for society”, comments Tejedor.

The reconstruction of droughts using dendrochronology does not make it possible to directly predict extreme future events, although these reconstructions are indeed used to validate future climate change models. “What we are seeing from the 20th century, and what we have seen so far in the 21st is an increase in the recurrence of extreme phenomena, including both wet and dry years”, stresses the researcher to Sinc. For the expert, predictions for precipitation variability and trends are not yet reliable like those for temperature, as other factors which are still being studied also play a role.

Using tree rings the authors documented 36 extremely dry years in Spain over the past 318 years. Somewhat sensationally they declared 2011/2012 the driest year ever, which as a single incident is hardly evidence of any climate trend. More interesting would be the distribution of the drought-intense periods over time. Here the press release is silent on this, and so we present the original chart from the paper to have a look.

When it comes to the trend, the press release is somewhat misleading.
Yes, there is an obvious increase in drought in 20th century. In the second half of the 20th century two longer periods of drought were registered while in the first half it was wetter. Yet there was also a higher frequency of drought phases in the 18th century and early 19th century – i.e. during the Little Ice Age. That could have been mentioned.
Instead the press release concluded that it was still too early to make trend projections. Yet as it stands it looks as if there isn’t any real long term trend over the centuries. Thus it would be false to infer any trend based on the droughts of the last decades alone.
A look back at the last major warm phase – the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) of 1000 years ago – shows how complex the Iberian peninsula is when it comes to precipitation. Within the scope of the MWP-charting project we identified a corridor on the Iberian peninsula where it got wetter during the MWP (green points on chart). To the contrary in the outer areas of the Iberian peninsula it became drier during the MWP (yellow points).

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_—_   
  
In Paris this December, the U.N. will hold its 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 Rio Treaty (officially known as the UN framework Convention on Climate Change). Like the 20 previous COPs, the goal will be to entice (browbeat) as many countries as possible to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" [“Dangerous anthropogenic interference” has been defined to mean a global average temperature rise of more than 2.0°C above the preindustrial global average temperature. We are highly doubtful that a 2.0°C rise (of which we are more than a third of the way there) will actually prove “dangerous” especially when adaptations are factored in, but we digress.]   
  
And like the 20 COPs that have come before, COP 21 will fail—largely because greenhouse gas emissions result primarily from burning fossil fuels to produce the energy which powers the modern economy. Those with a modern economy want to keep it rolling along, and those without, desperately strive for one. Neither group is willing to budge much from these wishes. Consequently global emissions continue to rise.   
  
Even the U.N. now is beginning to realize that meeting a 2.0°C warming target is virtually impossible—this despite rather absurd new calls for the target to be lowered to 1.5°C.   
  
Nevertheless, the U.N. continues to go through the motions (after all, COPs are big business).   
  
At last year’s COP 20, held in Lima, Peru, the best that everyone could agree on was assigning each country some homework along the lines of this: Describe what types of greenhouse gas emissions reductions (with targets and timetables) that you feel you may undertake; justify your answer. The assignment was due on March 31. Most countries are tardy.   
  
Under U.N. terminology, the homework must include a declaration of each country’s “Intended Nationally-Derived Contributions (INDCs)” –that is, what each “intends” to do to reduce their carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gas) emissions.   
  
A look through some of the work that has been handed in on time reveals a strange mélange on “intentions.”   




For example, Russia’s INDC reveals that its declared intent to the U.N. is less stringent than what it already intends to do via its own existing domestic programs. The chart below points out this rather odd occurrence:   






Basically, if we are understanding this right, Russia is proposing to the U.N. a more lax timetable than required via its existing domestic programs and a reliance to the “maximum possible” extent on carbon credits from carbon dioxide uptake by boreal forests.   
  
The Russian proposal already has enviros wringing their hands.   
  
Let’s move on to Mexico. What they claim they intend to do is virtually impossible.   
  
Mexico says it intends to peak its national CO2 emissions in 2026—just 11 years from now.   
  
That’ll be some trick; the charts below show why. The top one is Mexico’s population projections between 2010 and 2050. The forecast is for a robustly growing population, adding over 30 million people by 2050—all of which presumably will require energy to subsist. The bottom figure shows Mexico’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions history for the past 20 years. Again, robust growth indicating that Mexico is increasingly meeting its growing energy needs via the use of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.   






Yet Mexico tells the U.N. that it intends, in just over a decade, not only to halt the growth in per capita emissions, but to turn it downwards to such an extent as to offset population increases. And keep it heading that way.   
  
Predictably, environmental activists hailed Mexico’s announcement.   
  
The real world, on the other hand, isn’t so kind, revealing Mexico’s “intention” as being an empty promise.   
  
And what about the U.S.?   
  
The U.S. announced its intentions as:   




The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%.



Turns out that this a bit less than we proposed to do in when we were negotiating at the UN’s 15th COP in Copenhagen in 2009. There we pledged a 30% reduction by 2025 and a 42% reduction by 2030. Our declining pledge is probably is deference to a thing called reality—as depicted in the figure below (taken from the EPA).   






As seen in the figure, in Copenhagen, in 2009, greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. had been on the decline for about 5 years, and stood at 8% below our emissions in 2005. Now, five years later, the picture isn’t as rosy. Between 2009 and 2013 (the last year in the EPA has made data available), there has been scant change in our emissions (early indications for 2014 are for emissions up a bit from 2013). This despite natural gas replacing some coal-fired electricity generation (natural gas produces only about half the greenhouse gas emissions as does coal) and higher fuel economy cars.   
  
The President is finding that it is hard to grow the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time (something that we have been saying for a long time).   
  
Consequently, he is paring back our emission targets and timetables.   
  
But no matter the details, _any_ U.S. plan will never contribute much to mitigating future global climate change.   
  
Here’s why: even under the assumption we cut our fossil fuel emissions 100% by the year 2050 (the President’s plan only calls for cuts of about 80%), the amount of future global warming that will be averted is about 0.05°C by the year 2050 and 0.14°C by the year 2100. That’s it! Fourteen-hundredths of a degree—that’s what all the hubbub over carbon taxes, power plant emissions restrictions, Keystone XL pipeline, electric cars, ethanol, etc. is all about. _Fourteen-hundredths of a degree._ And even that is being generous, because it assumes a climate sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions that is a good 50 to 100 percent greater than what many new scientific studies are pointing to. If we do the same calculation using a climate sensitivity of 2°C rather than 3°C, the warming averted by the year 2100 drops to 0.10°C (one-tenth of a degree).   
  
You can see all this for yourself using our global temperature savings calculator—a great tool (based on a model developed in part by EPA funding) that everyone contemplating greenhouse gas emissions limitations ought to have at their fingertips.   
  
To get a sense of the temperature savings from what the U.S. is intending for Paris, use our tool and select a “CO2 Reduction” of 80% from the U.S.—that scenario matches very closely to the current U.S. plan.   
  
You’ll find a grand total of about 0.11°C of temperature savings by the end of the century. Too little to matter. Impossible to verify. Scientifically insignificant.   
  
All in all, pretty much par for the course when compared with the other INDCs.   
  
We’ll continue to track the Road to Paris. But thus far, it is a Road to Nowhere.

Sound familiar? A study revealing a stunning lack of reproducibility in psychological science triggers another instance of reluctance to share data with any but friends, and an “adjustment” of  data to fit a theory.
Frank Lee MeiDere writes:
By now most have probably heard about the paper published in the August 28 edition of Science magazine entitled “Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science.” Coordinated by the Center for Open Science, and headed by its executive director, Dr. Brian Nosek, the project examined 100 psychological studies mostly from three sources: Psychological Science, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition.
According to the The New York Times’ article, “Many psychology findings not as strong as claimed, study says,” written by Benedict Carey: “The vetted studies were considered part of the core knowledge by which scientists understand the dynamics of personality, relationships, learning and memory. Therapists and educators rely on such findings to help guide decisions.”
In the end, 60 of the 100 studies did not hold up well when reproduced.
This, of course, is disturbing in itself. As Carey points out, “the fact that so many of the studies were called into question could sow doubt in the scientific underpinnings of their work.”
Of more concern, however, is a quote from Dr. Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California: “There’s no doubt replication is important, but it’s often just an attack, a vigilante exercise” (italics added).
The problem is, that’s exactly what a replication is supposed to be: “an attack, a vigilante exercise.” It’s not a waltz with both partners in perfect step with each other; it’s a battle in which the invaders try every trick in the book to break through the castle walls. Schwarz’s attitude would seem to suggest a rephrasing of that famous justification for withholding data: “Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?”
Has this become the cry of all science? Hardly. In the physics world, for instance, new results are flung into the air for target practice like so many skeet. But then, the reproducibility rate in physics is pretty high — in fact, it makes up our entire technological world, virtually all of which is simply practical reproductions of laboratory experiments.
Other scientific foundations, however, are much shakier, and all too often their response is to ask everyone to sit quietly rather than examining the cause.
Psychology is especially prone to this shakiness. No sooner does one theory get established than it’s uprooted for another. In fact, there are numerous theories in play at any one time, each backed by its own body of “scientific” evidence. As Jelte Wicherts, associated professor of methodology and statistics at Tilburg University, Netherlands, said, “I think we knew or suspected that the literature had problems, but to see it so clearly, on such a large scale — it’s unprecedented.”
There are, of course, those who disagree with the findings of this study. The New York Times reports an email from Paola Bressan, a psychologist at the University of Padua who criticized the project for its reproduction of her study “Female preference for single versus attached males depends on conception risk.” Her complaint was that they used female psychology students as subjects whereas she had used female Italians. She is quoted as saying “I show that, with some theory-required adjustments, my original findings were in fact replicated.”
Any time the phrase “theory-required adjustments” is uttered there should be cause for alarm. This isn’t to say that it can’t be valid, but in this case we have to remember that Bressan’s original study was assumed to hold true universally (it wasn’t titled “Italian female preference” after all), and any adjustments made to “correct” the new study’s results in order to match her own could well be open to bias.
All scientific research should be considered “guilty until proven innocent” and requires an extremely strong defense to stand up to a justifiably hostile prosecutor. The idea of “settled science” is wrong in virtually every field, although there might be vast areas of strong replication and, therefore, confidence.
But at no point should we be under the old army edict of “Don’t ask: Don’t tell.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAre CO2 Emissions Driving Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise?
By guest writer Kenneth Richard
According to the below graph (Fig. 2 a) found in Gregory et al., 2013 in Journal of Climate (“Twentieth-Century Global-Mean Sea Level Rise: Is the Whole Greater than the Sum of the Parts?”), there was a very substantial increase in the glacier and ice sheet melt contribution to sea level rise in the early 20th century, reaching up to 2 mm/year sea level rise equivalent.

Source: Gregory et al., 2013 in Journal of Climate 
In recent years, the documented rise in sea levels contributed from glacier and ice sheet melt has not come close to reaching the high levels attained during the 1920s and 1930s period as documented by Gregory et al., 2013.
For example according to Shepherd et al., 2012 (see below), the total ice sheet melt contribution from the Antarctic (AIS) and Greenland (GIS) ice sheets combined was 0.59 mm/year (~2.3 inches per century) during the 1992-2011 period and the total ice sheet or glacier melt from all other land sources (not the AIS or GIS) was 0.41 mm/year (~1.6 inches per century) for 2003 to 2010 according to Jacob et al., 2012 (see below).
Together, the total melt contribution from global land ice was about 1 mm/year (~4 inches per century) through the first decade of the 21st century, which is still well below the melt rates achieved during the 1920s and 1930s.
Interestingly, during the 1920s to 1930s period of very high glacier melt rate contributions to sea level rise, human CO2 emissions were flat and only averaged about 1 GtC/year (see graph below).
In contrast, during the 1990s to 2010/2011 period, CO2 emissions rates reached 6 to 9 GtC/year.

Unanswered question
If anthropogenic CO2 emissions are truly driving ice sheet and glacier melt contributions to sea level rise, why was the melt contribution significantly higher during the 1920s and 1930s when CO2 emissions rates were flat and about 1/6th to 1/9th of what they’ve been in recent years?

"New York City apartments are notorious for their quirks and annoyances, from awkward layouts to windows that face a brick wall. When it’s time to sell, these can be major turnoffs for potential buyers. But, with a little creativity, many of these issues can be minimized, and you don’t have to spend a lot of money to do it. THE PROBLEM Low ceilings THE SOLUTION White paint, tall window dressings and   furniture Using a lighter shade of paint on the ceilings than the walls tends to draw the eye upward and make the ceiling look higher. “Use flat, not semigloss, on the crown molding, in the same shade as the ceiling,” recommends Pat Christodoulou, who stages   homes in Connecticut and New York. “This gives you an uninterrupted perspective, which results in visually raising the ceiling. ” If you don’t have moldings, she said, adding a cove molding, which begins on the wall and extends to the ceiling, will create an elongating effect. Minimalist furnishings that sit low to the floor will help increase the impression of height.    sheers will also “give the illusion of larger windows and higher ceilings,” said Elizabeth Kee, a broker at CORE in Manhattan, who recently hung   curtains in a $   rental in Chelsea to “create an optical illusion that the ceilings are soaring. ” THE PROBLEM Windows that face a brick wall or let in scant light THE SOLUTION Pops of bright color, strategically placed   bulbs or decorative window film “At a window that faced an alleyway or brick wall, we’ve had success with placing a fixture with a daylight florescent bulb behind the curtain,” said Jeff Schleider, the senior vice president of Business Development for Citi Habitats. “It gives the illusion of natural sunlight. ” In a small   on the Upper West Side, where all the windows faced out on an air shaft, Joseph G. Sheehan, a salesman with Bond New York, used “cheery yellow drapes” and sheer white curtains to dress up the windows, and bright throws, pillows and rugs to offer “a nod to sunlight and brightness” in the dark space. The apartment, which had originally been listed by another broker for $399, 000, went into contract for $435, 000 just two weeks after Mr. Sheehan brightened it up. Deanna Kory, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, recommends white shutters or white wooden Venetian blinds with   to   slats. “Any light that hits the windows will be reflected favorably and create a lighter feeling within the apartment,” she said. Another option: decorative window film, which lets in light while obscuring an unattractive view it can be found at Home Depot from about $25 for elderberry or etched lace designs. Hanging a framed   panel in front of the window offers a similar effect. If you’re willing to splurge, a custom   window may be the solution. That’s what a client of Madeline A. McKenna, a broker at Stribling  Associates, did more than a decade ago in a Midtown apartment with “a very depressing view” from the living room. It wasn’t a cheap fix, she said, noting that the multipane frosted window with    inlay cost about $10, 000. But the investment eventually paid off: In 2005, the client was able to sell the apartment quickly, for about $975, 000. “We didn’t have to apologize or make excuses for the ugly window view onto the ugly, dark, dank air shaft. It became a beautiful centerpiece for the living room instead,” Ms. McKenna said, adding that the unit sold again, in 2012, for $1. 25 million and was   in 2014, at $1. 35 million, with the same frosted window. “Seems everyone likes the aesthetic. ” THE PROBLEM An awkward layout THE SOLUTION Rework the floor plan The Yorkville, Manhattan, duplex apartment that Jai Lee, a saleswoman at Mdrn. Residential, listed for $599, 000 in July had plenty of assets: “The bathroom was amazing, with heated floor, enormous deep, deep tub and shower heads on both sides,” she said. But to get to it, “you had to walk past the open kitchen into the barely   bedroom. ” Down a spiral staircase from the living room was a finished basement area with a   and small adjoining den. “It certainly was not ideal,” said Ms. Lee, who came up with the idea of recasting the downstairs space as an unconventional master bedroom, with the master bathroom upstairs, along with a spacious closet (in what was the old master bedroom). “I started selling the idea of using the ‘master’ as your own dream   closet, with spa bathroom,” she said. To help potential buyers picture her vision, she drafted a new floor plan showing the lower level as a potential bedroom with a   and adjacent office or hobby room. “I made sure to only show the listing by appointment,” she added. “This way I could control the narrative and envisioning process. ” The unit sold within a month for the full asking price. THE PROBLEM A   unit with windows facing the street THE SOLUTION Curtains, decorative film or window boxes For   homes, especially those with bars on the windows, Anna Kahn, an associate broker at Halstead Property, recommends installing window boxes. “Live flowers add color and take away from the starkness of the grates,” she said. Another option: “ ” curtains, which are opaque near the floor and sheer at the top, to “allow sunlight to enter the apartment while still providing a sense of privacy,” suggested Mr. Schleider of Citi Habitats. Or consider using opaque film: “We sold an apartment with razor wire outside the bedroom windows,” said Vivian Ducat, a saleswoman at Halstead, who had covered part of the window, obscuring the wire. “Even though everyone opened the windows to see what was out there, they seemed satisfied that the apartment had integrity and could look good, from the look we gave it. ”"
"**Residents of Ethiopia's northern Tigray region have been ordered to mobilise by authorities who say they must ""defend"" themselves from ""flagrant aggression"" from the federal government.**
Fears are growing of civil conflict in the east African country.
Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed earlier rejected a request for peace talks from the Tigray authorities.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed in eight days of fighting between Tigray forces and the federal army.
Once the country's most powerful party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) which governs the Tigray region has been feuding with Prime Minister Abiy since he came to power in 2018 and promised reform nationwide.
Most recently, the TPLF defied a national ban on elections due to coronavirus. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote in Tigray illegal.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by TPLF forces.
The TPLF declared a state of emergency to ""defend the security and existence of the people of Tigray and their sovereignty"", the state broadcaster Tigray TV reported.
It relayed a government warning that ""action will be taken against anyone who fails to co-operate"".
The regional authorities also repeated the accusation that neighbouring Eritrea was involved in the conflict, something both Eritrea and the federal government have denied.
The federal authorities insist their fight is against the regional government - not the Tigrayan people.
**Mary Harper, BBC World Service Africa editor**
This is dramatic language from the Tigrayan regional leadership. But it matches that coming from the federal authorities, who have vowed to keep fighting until what they describe as the ""criminal junta"" running Tigray has been ""crushed"".
There has been a lot of talk of Ethiopia slipping towards civil war, with international bodies calling for a ceasefire and a negotiated way out of this crisis.
But many Ethiopians, especially those in Tigray, say their country has already sunk into war.
Thousands are fleeing a country that has been a beacon of relative stability in the crisis-prone Horn of Africa.
With both sides sticking stubbornly to war talk and little indication of any common ground for potential comprise, the fear is that the fighting will continue.
Ethiopia's neighbours will be sucked in, and civilians, many of whom are already living in precarious conditions, will be those who pay the heaviest price.
In other developments:
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy - who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea - dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government."

The Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary defines progress as “advancement to a further or higher stage, or to further or higher stages successively; growth; development, usually to a better state or condition; improvement… applied especially to manifestations of social and economic change or reform.”



In a world where we are constantly bombarded with bad news, it can sometimes be difficult to think of “progress” and “humanity” in the same sentence. Are there not wars taking place, people going hungry, children at work, women being abused, and mass poverty around the world?



In fact, for most of human history, life was very difficult for most people. People lacked basic medicines and died relatively young. They had no painkillers and people with ailments spent much of their lives in agonizing pain. Entire families lived in bug‐​infested dwellings that offered neither comfort nor privacy. They worked in the fields from sunrise to sunset, yet hunger and famines were commonplace. Transportation was primitive and most people never traveled beyond their native villages or nearest towns. Ignorance and illiteracy were rife. The “good old days” were, by and large, very bad for the great majority of humankind.





We haven’t achieved utopia, but a new website documents the enormous progress humanity has made, especially over the last two centuries.



Average global life expectancy at birth hovered around 30 years from the Upper Paleolithic to 1900. Even in the richest countries, like those of Western Europe, life expectancy at the start of the 20th century rarely exceeded 50 years. Incomes were quite stagnant, too. At the beginning of the Christian era, annual incomes per person around the world ranged from $1,073 to $1,431. As late as 1820, average global income was only $1,274 per person. (Angus Maddison, whose income estimates I use here, gives his data in 1990 dollars. I have adjusted Maddison’s figures for inflation.)



Humanity has made enormous progress—especially over the course of the last two centuries. For example, average life expectancy in the world today is 67.9 years. In 2010, global per capita income stood at $13,037—over 10 times what it was two centuries ago.



It is not only income and life expectancy that are improving. Harvard’s Steven Pinker has documented a propitious decline in physical violence. He writes,



Tribal warfare was nine times as deadly as war and genocide in the 20th century. The murder rate in medieval Europe was more than thirty times what it is today. Slavery, sadistic punishments, and frivolous executions were unexceptionable features of life for millennia, then were suddenly abolished. Wars between developed countries have vanished, and even in the developing world, wars kill a fraction of the numbers they did a few decades ago. Rape, hate crimes, deadly riots, child abuse—all substantially down.



If anything, the speed of human progress seems to be accelerating. As Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development writes,



4.9 billion people—the considerable majority of the planet – [live]… in countries where GDP has increased more than fivefold over 50 years. Those countries include India, with an economy nearly 10 times larger than it was in 1960, Indonesia (13 times), China (17 times), and Thailand (22 times larger than in 1960). Around 5.1 billion people live in countries where we know incomes have more than doubled since 1960, and 4.1 billion—well more than half the planet—live in countries where average incomes have tripled or more.…



According to a 2011 paper by Brookings Institution researchers Laurence Chandy and Geoffrey Gertz,



the rise of emerging economies has led to a dramatic fall in global poverty… [The authors] estimate that between 2005 and 2010, the total number of poor people around the world fell by nearly half a billion, from over 1.3 billion in 2005 to under 900 million in 2010. Poverty reduction of this magnitude is unparalleled in history: never before have so many people been lifted out of poverty over such a brief period of time. And using forecasts of per capita consumption growth, they estimate that by 2015 fewer than 600 million people will remain in poverty.



Similarly, the world’s daily caloric intake per person, an indirect measure of well‐​being, has increased from an average of 2,600 in 1990 to 2,840 in 2012. In sub‐​Saharan Africa, the caloric intake increased from 2,180 to 2,380. To put these figures in perspective, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that moderately active adult men consume between 2,200 and 2,800 calories a day and moderately active women consume between 1,800 and 2,000 calories a day.



The Internet, cell phones, and air travel are connecting ever more people—even in poor countries. More children, including girls, attend schools at all levels of education. There are more women holding political office and more female CEOs. In wealthy countries, the wage gap between genders is declining. Our lives are not only longer, but also healthier. The global prevalence rate of people infected with HIV/AIDS has been stable since 2001 and deaths from the disease are declining due to the increasing availability of anti‐​retroviral drugs. In wealthy countries, some cancer rates have started to fall. That is quite an accomplishment considering that people are living much longer and the risk of cancer increases with longevity. Our dwellings are larger and, in many ways, of better quality. Workers tend to work fewer hours and suffer from fewer injuries. Shops are bursting with a mindboggling array of goods that are, normally, less expensive and of higher quality than in the past. We enjoy more leisure and travel to more exotic destinations. To top it off, we enjoy more political freedom and economic freedom.



Yet progress can sometimes be derailed. Europe, for example, experienced an unprecedented period of peace and rapidly improving standards of living between the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Between 1820 and 1914, real or inflation‐​adjusted income per person rose by 127 percent in Western Europe. In Great Britain, for example, life expectancy at birth rose from 41 years 1818 to 52 years in 1914. In Sweden, the improvement was even more dramatic, with life expectancy rising from 39 years in 1814 to 58 years in 1914.



The period between the start of the 20th century and the outbreak of World War I saw the introduction of such life‐​changing technologies as the radio, the vacuum cleaner, air conditioning, the neon light, the airplane, sonar, the first plastics, the Model T motorcar and more.



On June 28, 1914, the heir to the throne of the Austro‐​Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia‐​Herzegovina. The murder led to the outbreak of World War I, in which some 39 million people lost their lives. Incomes in Western Europe fell by 11 percent between 1916 and 1919. Life expectancy in Great Britain, one of the war’s main participants, collapsed from 52 years in 1914 to 40 years in 1918.



Other horrors followed. The devastation of World War I undermined the Russian monarchy, leading to the rise of communism and the establishment of the USSR. Globally, well over 100 million people died because of purges and socialist economic mismanagement in communist countries. Defeat in World War I and harsh reparation demands led to resentment in Germany. That contributed to the rise of National Socialism, the outbreak of World War II, and the subsequent Holocaust. Some 73 million people died in World War II. After the war ended, communist dictatorships and free‐​market democracies fought in a variety of proxy conflicts as part of the Cold War, including the Korean Warand the Vietnam War.



In spite of all that suffering, people’s lives continued to improve. New technologies were introduced. They included the microwave oven, the mobile phone, the transistor, the video recorder, the credit card, the television, solar cells, optic fiber, microchips, lasers, the calculator, fuel cells, the World Wide Web and the computer. Medical advances included penicillin, cortisone, the pacemaker, artificial hearts, the MRI scan, HIV protease inhibitor, and vaccines for hepatitis, smallpox, and polio.



Over the course of the 20th century, the income of an average Western European rose by 517 percent. In terms of life expectancy, a typical Frenchman could expect to live 34 years longer in 1999 than in 1900.



The United States escaped much of the devastation of the two world wars, but suffered the Great Depression and carried many of the burdens of the Cold War. Between 1929 and 1933, the average U.S. income declined by 31 percent. It was not until 1940 that incomes returned to their pre‐​Depression levels. Over the course of the 20th century, however, average American income rose by 581 percent and life expectancy by 28 years.



In Asia, average per capita income rose by 473 percent between 1913 and 1999. Chinese incomes rose by 427 percent between 1820 and 1999. Indian incomes rose by 212 percent between 1821 and 1999. In China, life expectancy rose from 32 years in 1924 to 71 years in 1999—an increase of 39 years. Indian life expectancy increased from 24 years in 1901 to 61 years in 1999—an increase of 37 years.



The story of Africa is more complex and disheartening, but still, on balance, positive. Between the time of the European colonization in 1870 and African independence in 1960, a typical inhabitant of the African continent saw his or her income rise by 63 percent. Incomes increased by a further 41 percent between 1960 and 1999. While Africa had underperformed relative to the rest of the world, Africans were better off at the end of the 20th century than they were at the beginning. Moreover, since the start of the new millennium, Africa has been making up for lost time. In the 12 years from 1999 to 2010, African incomes rose by 36 percent.



When it comes to life expectancy, Africa has experienced serious progress. However, increases in life expectancy vary, mostly depending on the harm caused by the spread of AIDS. Life expectancy in South Africa rose from 34 years in 1930 to an all‐​time high of 62 years in 1990. But by 2011, life expectancy declined to 52 years. Ghana was less affected by the epidemic, which allowed life expectancy in the country to increase from 28 years in 1921 to 64 years in 2011.



The Great Recession reminds us that progress is uneven. In the United States, a country that was both originator and victim of the recession, per capita income, adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity, decreased by 3.1 percent, from $46,760 in 2008 to $45,305 in 2009. This relatively small fall in average income does not make the suffering of millions of Americans, especially those who lost their jobs and homes, any less real. Thankfully, at the time of writing, the economy appears to be on the mend, with average incomes rising of an all‐​time high of $49,965 in 2012.



 **Progress Is Not Inevitable**



We must keep human development in proper perspective. The present, for all of its imperfections, is a vast improvement on the past. Understanding and appreciating the progress that humanity has made does not mean that we stop trying to make the future even better than the present. That said, we should avoid making two mistakes.



First, we should correctly identify, preserve, and expand those policies and institutions that have made human progress possible. If we misidentify the causes of human progress, we could put the well‐​being of future generations at risk. One way of avoiding serious policy mistakes in the future is to avoid concentrating power in a single pair of hands or in the hands of a small elite. Instead, we should trust in the choices made by free‐​acting individuals. No doubt, some of those individual choices will turn out to be bad, but the aggregate wisdom of millions of free‐​acting individuals is more likely to be correct than incorrect.



Second, we should beware of utopian idealism. Utopians compare the present with what might be called the future perfect, not the past imperfect. Instead of seeing the present as a vast improvement on the past, they see the present as failing to live up to some sort of an imagined utopia. Unfortunately, the world will never be a perfect place because the human beings who inhabit it are themselves imperfect. Today, it is difficult to imagine the emergence of a powerful new utopian movement. But few people in 1900 foresaw the destruction brought on by communism and Nazism. We cannot rule out that utopian demagogues akin to Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao Zedong, or Pol Pot will emerge in the future.



When it comes to global standards of living, human history resembles a hockey stick resting on its side, with a long straight shaft and an upward facing blade. For most of our existence, progress was painfully slow (resembling that long straight shaft). At the start of the 19th century, however, the speed of human progress rapidly accelerated (resembling that upward facing blade). What was responsible for that acceleration? Many books have been written on this subject and it is beyond the scope of this essay to provide a full answer. That said, few scholars deny the central role played by two forces that are routinely demonized: industrialization and globalization.



 _Industrial Revolution_



First, let us look at the industrial revolution. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the industrial revolution was “the process of change from an agrarian, handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacture.” It started in Great Britain in the 18th century and then spread to other parts of the world.



The technological changes included the following: the use of new basic materials, chiefly iron and steel, the use of new energy sources, including both fuels and motive power, such as coal, the steam engine, electricity, petroleum, and the internal‐​combustion engine, the invention of new machines, such as the spinning jenny and the power loom that permitted increased production with a smaller expenditure of human energy, a new organization of work known as the factory system, which entailed increased division of labor and specialization of function.… These technological changes made possible a tremendously increased use of natural resources and the mass production of manufactured goods.… There were also many new developments in nonindustrial spheres, including the following: agricultural improvements that made possible the provision of food for a larger nonagricultural population, economic changes that resulted in a wider distribution of wealth, the decline of land as a source of wealth in the face of rising industrial production, and increased international trade, political changes reflecting the shift in economic power, as well as new state policies corresponding to the needs of an industrialized society, sweeping social changes, including the growth of cities, the development of working‐​class movements, and the emergence of new patterns of authority, and cultural transformations of a broad order.



The Industrial Revolution had many contemporary critics. Observers like Charles Dickens commented on the squalor of 19th‐​century cities and the backbreaking labor of the people, including children, in the factories in much the same way that our journalists today comment on the squalor of the rapidly industrializing Indian cities and backbreaking labor of people, including children, in Bangladeshi factories.



But things should be kept in a proper perspective. Life on an 18th‐​century farm was extremely difficult, and the city offered the former country dwellers higher wages and new opportunities. In time, sanitation, healthcare and other benefits of civilized life caught up with the cities’ rising population, giving us the modern metropolis. In a similar vein, legislation caught up with rising standards of living and codified in law what was happening already in practice—as productivity increased and wages rose, fewer children were needed to supplement their parents’ incomes. Increased productivity of workers led to greater competition for workers, and factory owners started taking better care of their employees. Working conditions improved and work injuries declined.



Another major criticism of the industrial revolution concerns the spoliation of the environment and exploitation of natural resources. Who can forget William Blake’s condemnation of industrialization in his 1808 poem Jerusalem?



And did those feet in ancient time  
Walk upon England’s mountains green?  
And was the holy Lamb of God   
And did the Countenance Divine  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here  
Among these dark Satanic mills?



Blake’s “satanic mills” refer to factories that in his view pockmarked the bucolic face of the English countryside. As was the case with other writers of the Romantic era, Blake’s description of pre‐​industrial society was highly idealized. The reality, alas, was much less appealing. Most pre‐​industrial societies, Great Britain included, were heavily dependent on agricultural output. Agricultural production was labor intensive, but productivity was very low. Before the arrival of machines powered by steam and combustion engines, agriculture depended on much less efficient human and animal labor. People and animals had to be fed, which meant that most of the calories produced on the farm were immediately consumed by the laborers. Prior to the industrial revolution, there were no synthetic fertilizers, such as nitrogen, and crop yields were much lower than what they are today. As a consequence, more land was required to feed people and pack animals. Land clearing was usually accomplished by burning of forests. Yet more trees were cut down to heat houses and cook food. Environmental damage aside, a major reason for switching from wood to coal was the simple fact that there were very few trees left. Thanks to the use of fossil fuels, global forest coverage has stabilized and is expanding in the world’s richest and most industrialized countries.



 _Globalization_



Second, let us consider globalization, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defines as “an increasing internationalization of markets for goods and services, the means of production, financial systems, competition, corporations, technology and industries. Amongst other things this gives rise to increased mobility of capital, faster propagation of technological innovations and an increasing interdependency and uniformity of national markets.”



Contrary to the common misperception, globalization is not a new phenomenon. The tradel inks between the Sumer and Indus Valley civilizations go back to the third millennium BC. Later, tere was the Silk Road between Europe and Asia, and European voyages into India and the Americas. Clearly, trade has been fundamental to the process of globalization from antiquity. But why do people trade?



Trade delivers goods and services to people who value them most. An additional ton of corn produced in Kansas may be of little importance to the people in the American Midwest, but it can be crucial to the people living in the drought‐​stricken East Africa. Trade, to use economic jargon, improves efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources. Another reason for trade is the principle of comparative advantage. As the Nobel Prize‐​winning economist Paul Samuelson noted,



The gains from trade follow from allowing an economy to specialize. If a country is relatively better at making wine than wool, it makes sense to put more resources into wine, and to export some of the wine to pay for imports of wool. This is even true if that country is the world’s best wool producer, since the country will have more of both wool and wine than it would have without trade. A country does not have to be best at anything to gain from trade. The gains follow from specializing in those activities which, at world prices, the country is relatively better at, even though it may not have an absolute advantage in them. Because it is relative advantage that matters, it is meaningless to say a country has a comparative advantage in nothing. The term is one of the most misunderstood ideas in economics, and is often wrongly assumed to mean an absolute advantage compared with other countries.



Moreover, trade allows consumers to benefit from more efficient production methods. For example, without large markets for goods and services, large production runs would not be economical. Large production runs are instrumental to reducing product costs. For example, early cars had to be individually hand crafted. The Model T assembly line revolutionized car manufacturing and allowed the Ford Motor Company to slash the price of the Model T from $850 in 1909 to $260 in the 1920s in nominal dollars (in 2013 dollars, the drop would be from $20,000 to about $4,000). Lower production costs, in other words, lead to cheaper goods and services, and that raises real living standards.



Besides better resource allocation, and greater specialization and economies of scale, trade encourages technological and cultural exchanges between previously disconnected civilizations. It is for those reasons that great commercial cities like Florence and Venice during the Renaissance, and London and New York today, also tend to be centers of cultural life and technological progress.



The development of the steam engine and the opening of the Suez Canal in the 19th century made seafaring faster and cheaper. The volume of traded goods greatly increased. Through the process of price convergence, prices fell and consumers benefited. The gold standard and the invention of the telegraph – and later telephone – also allowed for massive transfers of capital. Attracted by higher profits, capital flowed from more developed to less developed countries, thus stimulating global economic development. As the British economist John Maynard Keynes recalled, before World War I,



The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.… He could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages… He could secure … cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality.



This earlier era of globalization ended with the outbreak of World War I and the concomitant disruption of world trade. By some estimates, globalization did not reach its pre–World War I levels until the 1970s or even 1980s. In fact, it was the 1980s that marked the beginning of the period of globalization that we live in today. Spurred by economic deregulation within countries, trade liberalization between countries, privatization of state‐​owned companies, further improvements in transport and the arrival of the Internet, globalization got a new lease on life. As important—and in keeping with the dramatic decreases in violence and conflict noted above—past episodes of often‐​violent colonization and mercantilist economics has been mostly replaced by positive‐​sum exchanges among countries and individuals.



 **The World Is Getting Better, But There Is an Abundance of Skepticism**



As we can see, Europe and America, and, later, other regions of the world, experienced previously unimaginable improvements in standards of living. The process of rapid improvement that started in the early 1800s continues to this day. Accordingly, historical evidence makes a potent case for optimism. Yet optimism about the current state and future well‐​being of humankind is difficult to come by. As author Matt Ridley writes in his book, _The Rational Optimist_ ,



If… you say catastrophe is imminent, you may expect a McArthur genius award or even the Nobel Peace Prize. The bookshops are groaning under ziggurats of pessimism. The airwaves are crammed with doom. In my own adult lifetime, I have listened to the implacable predictions of growing poverty, coming famines, expanding deserts, imminent plagues, impending water wars, inevitable oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, mad‐​cow epidemics, Y2K computer bugs, killer bees, sex‐​change fish, global warming, ocean acidification and even asteroid impacts that would presently bring this happy interlude to a terrible end. I cannot recall a time when one or other of these scares was not solemnly espoused by sober, distinguished and serious elites and hysterically echoed by the media. I cannot recall a time when I was not being urged by somebody that the world could only survive if it abandoned the foolish goal of economic growth. The fashionable reason for pessimism changed, but the pessimism was constant. In the 1960s the population explosion and global famine were top of the charts, in the 1970s the exhaustion of resources, in the 1980s acid rain, in the 1990s pandemics, in the 2000s global warming. One by one these scares came and (all but the last) went. Were we just lucky? Are we, in the memorable image of the old joke, like the man who falls past the first floor of the skyscraper and thinks ‘So far so good!’? Or was it the pessimism that was unrealistic?



Ridley’s recollection raises an interesting question: Why are we as a species so willing to believe in doomsday scenarios that never quite materialize in practice?



In their 2012 book, _Abundance: The Future is Better than You Think_ , Peter H. Diamandis and Steven Kotler offer one plausible explanation. Human beings are constantly bombarded with information. Because our brains have a limited computing power, they have to separate what is important—such as a lion running toward us—from what is mundane. Because survival is more important than all other considerations, most information enters our brains through the amygdala—a part of the brain that is “responsible for primal emotions like rage, hate and fear.” Information relating to those primal emotions gets our attention first because the amygdala “is always looking for something to fear.” Our species has evolved to prioritize bad news. Pessimists survived, while optimists got eaten by lions.



Newspapers and other media have long since recognized that pessimism sells. According to one analysis, about 90 percent of all articles in _The Washington Post_ tend to be pessimistic in tone. As the old saying among journalists goes, “If it bleeds, it leads.” Politicians, too, have realized that banging on about “crises” increases their power and can get them reelected, and may also lead to prestigious prizes and lucrative speaking engagements. Thus politicians on both left and right play on our fears—from crime supposedly caused by playing violent computer games to health maladies supposedly caused by the consumption of genetically modified foods.



More than the physical structure of the human brain may be at play, of course. Take, for example, the role of ideology in shaping our perception of the world around us. If we start from a premise that the dominant economic system in the world today (i.e., some combination of private ownership, competition, free trade, deregulation, and moves toward liberalization) is either immoral or destructive, then it is difficult to reconcile that system with good news about human development. In other words, to maintain skepticism about the “system,” one is forced to ignore or discount positive developments in human well‐​being.



The dominant economic system in the world today is, of course, capitalism or, to use less ideologically loaded terminology, free enterprise or the free market. Just how “free” the free market really is, is debatable. In many supposedly free‐​market societies, like Europe and the United States, local and national governments tend to redistribute between 40 percent and 50 percent of the gross national product.



Where does the skepticism about free market come from? The late Harvard University philosopher Robert Nozick provides one plausible answer. The intellectual elite (i.e., the wordsmiths who occupy many positions within academia, the media, and government bureaucracies) tend to take a more negative view of free market than the one presented here. These individuals shape society’s language and access to information. As such, the anti‐​free‐​market sentiment of the intellectual elite carries great weight.



“From the beginnings of recorded thought,” Nozick writes, “intellectuals have told us their activity is most valuable. Plato valued the rational faculty above courage and the appetites and deemed that philosophers should rule; Aristotle held that intellectual contemplation was the highest activity.” Intellectuals have thus come to think of themselves as the “most valuable” members of society and “feel entitled to the highest rewards their society has to offer.” The markets, however, tend to reward “economic contribution.” Consequently, intellectuals tend not to be the most rewarded members of a free‐​market society. That runs counter to the intellectuals’ expectations. When they socialize with the most rewarded individuals in society, the intellectuals resent that they are not compensated to the same degree. To rectify this perceived injustice, intellectuals advocate for a society that distributes compensation in line with their expectations, rather than economic contribution.



It is perhaps best to start by explaining what the Human Progress website is not trying to accomplish. It will not try to convince you that the world is a perfect place. As long as there are people who go hungry or die from preventable diseases, there will always be room for improvement. To that end, we all have a role to play in helping the destitute in our communities and beyond.



Our goal, then, is not to paint a rosy picture of the state of humanity, but a realistic one. A realistic account of the world should focus on long‐​term trends, comparing living standards between two or more generations. Crucially, it should compare the imperfect present with a much more imperfect past, rather than with an imagined utopia in the future.



As such, this website has two main aims. First is to inform you about the many ways in which the world has become a better place. Second is to allow you to search for reasons that brought that improvement about. While we think that policies and institutions compatible with freedom and openness are important factors in promoting human progress, we let the evidence speak for itself and hope the website stimulates an intelligent debate on the drivers of human progress.

The dreadful Australian bushfires have recently demonstrated how dangerous Green policies can be. Hopefully, this will result in a review of some of their most dangerous policies, but in the meantime, their zeal and stupidity still raises its head in many places. In the last week, it has been announced that hospitals in this country are planning to introduce **‘meat free Mondays’** , as all patients will be fed vegetarian or possibly even vegan meals every Monday.



Making sick people eat a vegan diet? What could possibly go wrong?



Patients’ health will suffer if hospitals cut down on meat and dairy in meals, the country’s former chief education health and nutrition adviser warns. 



However, another researcher has backed the push for plants to replace meat and dairy in meals, saying our meat consumption seriously harms health **and the planet.**



The guidelines have been criticised by Grant Schofield, professor of public health at Auckland University of Technology. 



“Hospital food is generally of a pretty poor quality anyway, it is generally pretty highly processed. If you wanted to improve hospital meals you would look at the quality of the food, and meat would be my last possible target, because it is one of the best sources of nutrition, protein, good quality fat and vitamins and minerals. To take that out of it seems objectionable.” 



Most of the dietary advice available these days to promote good health tells us to limit carbohydrates, particularly sugar. While I have no problem with vegetarian options being available in a hospital, deliberately reducing patients’ allocation of healthy protein seems contra to the idea that being in hospital is supposed to help patients get well.



Schofield, who advocates a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet and quit his Government advisory role over a lack of action on obesity, said cutting meat and dairy in hospital meals to counter climate change was “nonsense”.



“I think we have unfairly demonised meat and got it into our heads that it is somehow ruining the planet.”



So the Greens slavishly insist, but the evidence that a meat-free and dairy-free diet is not a healthy way to live is well and truly out there. Many vegans and vegetarians are not particularly healthy. You have to be a really good cook and nutritionist to get all of your daily vitamins and minerals from a vegetarian, and particularly a vegan diet. Some people do it well; many do not.



I have a vegan friend who is not a particularly good cook. She lives on chips and 2-minute noodles. It is good to stand by your principles, but not if it risks damaging your health. Still, at least this is her choice. Hospital patients don’t have that luxury.



Associate Health Minister and Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter championed the guidelines. DHBs are expected to make appropriate and responsible decisions about food menus that consider both the nutritional requirements of patients, staff and visitors, as well as the environmental impact of those choices,” Genter said in a statement. 



The Greens in Australia prefer people and animals to be burnt to death rather than to deliberately cut down a single tree. **Greens in New Zealand don’t care if sick people are undernourished** , so long as they consider the environmental impact of what they eat. What absolute garbage.



After the guidelines were released Dietitians NZ, the professional body for dietetics, labelled the meat and dairy recommendation disappointing and not appropriate for those in hospital, **who are often malnourished.**



Some of them are probably vegans…



That position drew a response from Professor John Potter of the Centre for Public Health Research at Massey University, who wrote in a blog post that even if some patients needed more protein, this could be sourced from plants. Hospitals should go further and initiative meat-free Mondays and stop serving all processed meats .



What he neglects to mention is how very little protein can be obtained from plants. Not all protein is equal. It would take a couple of kilos of mung beans and 7 kilos of kale to get the protein a patient could obtain from one small steak. Also, protein from meat is much more satisfying than kale, so the only way a patient can end up without hunger pangs is for them to eat lots of carbohydrates – bread, pasta, potatoes or the like. Yep. Very healthy.



I did wonder if this might be a bit like the plastic bag issue, where supermarkets all jumped on the virtue-signalling gravy train, while dramatically improving their bottom lines. But to get the same nutritional value from plants as from meat would be an expensive exercise, and I doubt if it will happen. I am guessing that it will be baked beans on toast for dinner every Monday, take it or leave it. 



Of course, all the virtue signalling in the world will not get around human behaviour. How much do you want to bet that there is a surge of family members visiting their relatives in hospital on Mondays, and bringing them KFC. Yep, that will really help their recovery. And the planet.

"NBC is looking to place its new star Megyn Kelly in the morning hours. Ms. Kelly, who announced this month that she was leaving Fox News for NBC, will start at the network in May, and plans are beginning to take shape for her new show, two people briefed on the discussions said Friday. Ms. Kelly is being considered for a time slot at 9 or 10 a. m. for a show that is expected to begin in the fall. If she moves to 10 a. m. the popular fourth hour of “Today,” hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, will move to 9 a. m. One thing that is known for sure: The current iteration of the third hour of “Today,” hosted by Tamron Hall and Al Roker, will be a thing of the past once Ms. Kelly’s show begins. Ms. Kelly’s apparent move to the morning, which Variety reported earlier, removes her from the tricky minefield of syndicated daytime TV. Other TV news hosts, including Jane Pauley, Meredith Vieira and Katie Couric, have tried their hand at the format and failed. That was one of the reasons that NBC initially planned to make Ms. Kelly’s show a straight news show because other anchors could not make it work, the network saw no reason to try that strategy again. But in recent weeks, NBC executives have had more of an open mind over what direction her show should take: There have been discussions about whether it should be softer in focus than what was originally discussed, one person briefed on the plans said. They also have not decided whether Ms. Kelly’s show will be branded as part of the “Today” show. If Ms. Kelly locked up the 9 a. m. hour, it would also set up an intriguing battle royal that would pit her against another longtime morning host, ABC’s Kelly Ripa. The 9 a. m. hour for “Today” has long been a tricky proposition for NBC: Facing formidable competition against Ms. Ripa’s “Live With Kelly,” the network has tried a number of solutions, including bringing in Billy Bush last year. Shortly after Mr. Bush was brought in to host, he was let go after the infamous “Access Hollywood” recording of him and Donald J. Trump was released in October. Mr. Roker will continue to work on the early parts of “Today. ” And Ms. Hall, who is in contract negotiations with the network, will continue to host her MSNBC show and is also expected to make appearances on “Today. ” There are no concrete plans yet for the Sunday night newsmagazine show that NBC plans to have Ms. Kelly host, the people said. Fox News has not missed a beat since Ms. Kelly left her 9 p. m. time slot. Tucker Carlson, who replaced Ms. Kelly this month, has seen big ratings gains in the busy news weeks since his debut."

 _Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others…But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret – Matthew 6:1-4_.



While the bushfire crisis in Australia has seen Australians respond with their [characteristic generosity](https://www.countriesnow.com/which-country-gives-the-most-charity/), it has also sparked an unseemly game of one-upmanship, especially among the media-elite and in the sewers of social media. Like the hypocrites in the Bible, too many people are jumping on their little social-media stumps to trumpet their own moral virtue and smear and belittle others – who, oddly enough, seem invariably to be the standard targets of the left-elite.



What should be a unifying moment has become yet another platform for the left-elite’s Two Minutes of Hate.



Philanthropists Andrew and ­Nic­ola Forrest have made a $70m pledge to fight and prevent bushfires — and to help victims — as social media bickered over who has donated and how much.



The Forrests announced on Thursday that the charitable organ­isation they created, Minderoo Foundation, would give $10m to mobilise specialist volunteers from Western Australia, $10m for immediate bushfire recovery and a $50m investment to developing “a holistic assessment and blueprint of what Australia needs to do to improve resilience”.



Despite being one of Australia’s most generous philanthropists, Forrest is a regular Goldstein for the left. He might be extraordinarily generous (especially to indigenous causes), but Forrest is a mining magnate who is sceptical of the climate change narrative. Cue the torches and pitchforks.



But, if the left-elite hate Forrest, they hate Gina Rinehart infinitely more.



The donation came after a spokesman for Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, was prompted to issue a statement saying the billionaire preferred­ to make her donations privately.



Mrs Rinehart had apparently done so at a function for fire relief at her home on Tuesday, the same day comedian Celeste Barber named her in a tweet and wrote, “If you’re in Hawaii on a family holiday, I’m going to flip a f..king table”.



Barber has to be credited for starting an appeal that has raised nearly $50m – which makes it even more disgraceful that she then uses it as a platform for spewing idiotic leftist hate.



 _Many who were rich put in much. Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites…“Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury; for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood” – Mark 12:41-44._



Unlike Rinehart, who has largely observed the injunction to make her giving private, too many wealthy business people, and celebrities especially, are using the bushfires to trumpet their own assumed moral goodness.



The moral rule about keeping philanthropy private is not just some musty Christian moralism, either. Many wealthy philanthropists have criticised their peers for being too cynically eager to make their charity all about **them**.



AC/DC’s Brian Johnson, a generous (if quiet) philanthropist, once reprimanded other celebrities for their self-aggrandising: **“I’m sorry mate, do it yourself, spend some of your own money and get it done…Do a charity gig, fair enough, but not on worldwide television,” he said. “I do it myself, I don’t tell everybody I’m doing it.”**



Johnson’s “worldwide television” comment seems to be a jab at the massive celebrity fundraisers such as Live Aid, which AC/DC turned down. The Smiths, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Rod Stewart also declined. Depeche Mode noted that many Live Aid participants not coincidentally enjoyed massively increased sales, post-Live Aid, and questioned the motive behind making such a public display of generosity.



 **Charity should be a matter of giving without thought of reward, not an excuse to publicly signal your own moral superiority.**

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service in Offenbach has released data and results for the month of June 2016 in its latest press release.

Germany and much of Europe have seen plenty of rain in June – all flying in the face of earlier computer models that warned climate change would lead to scorchingly hot summers with protracted periods of drought. The opposite has in fact happened since the predictions were made.
Climate models 86% wrong
So far a vast majority (11 of 13) of Central Europe’s last summers over the past 13 years have been normal or wetter than normal. The current one has started off very wet, and is likely to make it 12 of 14 summers that will be normal wet or wetter than normal, thus making the climate models 86% wrong!
Last summer was drier than normal, receiving 85% of the normal rainfall. The current 14-day forecast for Germany sees rainy weather for the first part of July, with no signs of a dry period in sight.

June temperature in the normal range
June came in warmer than normal, as measured by the DWD’s 2000 measurement stations. The preliminary mean for June was 17°C, 1.2°C above the 1981- 2010 mean.
Precipitation was significantly above normal with an average of 115 liters per square meter falling – some 35% above the mean of 85 liters. Numerous severe thunderstorms and hail hit wide areas of the country.
Somewhat less sunshine than normal.
In June 2016 Germany saw a mean of 181 hours of sunshine, which is 9% below the mean of 198 hours. The northeast region of Germany saw the most sunshine – with areas near 300 hours.  The south and the west regions of the country saw far less sun with many areas seeing well below 150 hours of sunshine.

Phil Quin explains precisely [how counter-productive it is to abuse people on social media](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/118571161/dont-let-the-nasties-take-over-our-political-discourse) simply because they don’t agree with you:



“In an era of data overload and short attention spans,” _New York Times_ critic Michiko Kakutani writes in a superb decade’s-end [wrap-up](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_interactive_2019_12_27_opinion_sunday_2010s-2Damerica-2Dtrump.html&d=DwMFaQ&c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&r=0G2QzzJZWnekkP534Ylif1aH_LkH-5vBjsDcsWPhAQA&m=LCuuzArDHXK8nnYUUUE6rq8msXr7-I4B28s9TUoaslI&s=9yk_ifZyEl1YFl_di_vK1DAsCOMPaBDLPr98P4EF8kQ&e=), “it’s not the most reliable, trustworthy material that goes viral – it’s the loudest voices, the angriest, most outrageous posts that get clicked and shared.” (On the upside, the sheer ugliness of #TurnArdern inspired me to undertake a Christmas detox from social media, something I’d recommend to everyone from time to time).



Given the season, I briefly wondered whether these Twitter “activists” carry over their favoured modus operandi of “dismiss, demean and disparage” to face-to-face interactions. But of course they don’t – unless they want to be shunned from any future Christmas get-togethers. Conversations have few places to go when you scream “transphobic” at your 80-year-old in-laws.



In real life, we simply don’t treat others that way, not only to avoid offence, but also because we know in our personal and family lives that people are not the sum of their most objectionable views. When I came out as gay in the 90s, it was my godmother, a fairly doctrinaire Catholic, who was first to call me, offering her love.



People almost never say face to face what they’d happily tweet or Facebook. This is one of the problems of social media as in real life you’d get a punch in the face for poor and rude behaviour. On social media, it never happens so people feel safe to say truly awful things.



You might be asking, why should we even care about the histrionics of a tiny cabal of swivel-eyed keyboard warriors? The truth is we can’t afford to look away. While it’s the case that most people have better things to do than engage in partisan online bickering, we shouldn’t ignore the outsized role social media plays in setting the tone of the discourse.



 **Increasingly, it drives the news cycle – and most politicians can barely take their eyes off Twitter for long enough to Google themselves. Most worryingly of all, this all serves to inspire cynicism, apathy, even disgust, among the wider public – conditions that always, always, serve the cause of the regressive politics.**



Much has been written, including by me, about the troubling rise of populist Right-wing and nationalist sentiment across the West. Reactionaries are emboldened like never before, in my lifetime at least. Who knows whether the clamour they generate is the death rattle of a beleaguered elite or the roaring engines of a new and enduring conservatism? Certainly, I don’t; my once-sharpish political instincts are scrambled beyond recognition.



The rise is because, in part, the left has been out of control, trying to dramatically change people’s way of life. Like pushing a globalist agenda, forcing people to recognise numerous and ridiculous genders, pandering to the minute percentage of the population who think that they are a different sex, seeing racism everywhere, re-writing history to expunge facts and replacing them with feelz. Of course, there is also the hijacking of the climate debate to blame global warming for everything and all the world’s ills to which the only solution is socialism.



But, on the Left, **casting our adversaries as stupid bigots strikes me as obviously misguided. Likewise, our tendency to lord it over others with a hyper-abundance of certainty in our superior virtue is obnoxious; our refusal to contemplate the possibility of good faith among those with whom we disagree, alienating. Liberal condescension, paired with an unforgiving approach to ideological purity, risks sending perfectly well-meaning people into the arms of our adversaries or to retreat from politics altogether.**



The recently shellacked Jeremy Corbyn offered himself as a case-study in Left-wing hubris when he recently claimed Boris Johnson may have won the British election, but Labour “won the argument”. In one soundbite, he managed to convey staggering arrogance, self-delusion, insufferable smugness and, ultimately, defeatism. It’s a recipe for electoral irrelevance that too many seem eager to replicate.



I wonder if politicians like Golriz Ghahraman, who is currently carrying on as if Donald Trump has just killed Mary Poppins and not [a really bad wog](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/irans-khamenei-taunted-trump-before-strike-you-cant-do-anything-nek-minit/), will listen to what Phil Quin has to say?



Somehow I doubt it. 



The one thing about social media though, is that it removes the control of the message from the very elites who have been part and parcel of the rise of nationalism because they deigned to suppress the truth or facts and instead ran their own agendas. The liberal elite and the globalists are the ones truly to blame for the rise of nationalism. I can’t see them changing though, can you?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Facebook here Belgian organic chemistry professor Istvan Marko responded to Kenneth Richard’s post from yesterday citing very recent literature showing that glacier melting today is actually happening much more slowly than over much of the past 10,000 years.
Prof. Istvan Marko, photo source: Facebook
The literature thus refute the often heard media claims that glaciers and ice caps are “melting faster than ever“.
In his comment Prof. Marko, a native of Hungary, wondered that the studies cited by Richard were even able “to pass through the meshwork of pro-anthropogenic warming peer reviewers“.
Summarizing the results of the papers, Marko writes that the observations once again “contradict the sordid theories of the IPCC” and that atmospheric CO2 concentrations “absolutely do not correlate with the fluctuations of the levels of the oceans and the movements of advances and withdrawals of glaciers“. He writes that the IPCC science “failed again”.
Marko has been a harsh critic of the man-made climate change theory, appearing in a number of interviews.
In a recent English-language interview he blasted COP 21, claiming that it essentially resulted in nothing … “The result of COP 21 is no result” … “because there is nothing binding in this particular treaty“.  He adds the only thing to motivate CO2 reductions is “shame”, adding: “To my knowledge no politician knows what shame is at all. They are totally not subject to shame.”
In the interview he reminds listeners that the long-term temperature trend over the Holocene has been downward, and that today’s temperatures were exceeded by a number of other periods over the past 10,000 years. He dismisses the claim that CO2 plays a major role and believes that other far more powerful natural factors and cycles are at work.
Clearly the papers presented by Richard are just the latest evidence on a mountain of literature, which sadly the government-funded IPCC refuses to acknowledge.

"**The head of local forces in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray says they are still fighting near the regional capital, Mekelle, which was seized by government troops at the weekend.**
Debretsion Gebremichael, who leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), also says his fighters have retaken another key city.
The government denies the claims and insists the TPLF has been crushed.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in the month-long conflict.
Thousands have been displaced, while the UN and aid agencies have voiced concern about the humanitarian situation.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told parliament on Monday that not a single civilian had been killed since the government launched its offensive in early November.
With all phone lines and the internet cut off, it is impossible to independently verify statements from either side.
In another development, the TPLF said it had released more than 4,000 federal soldiers who had been held captive since Tigrayan troops attacked a federal military base earlier in November.
That attack led to the start of the federal army's operation in the region.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has phoned Mr Abiy to urge an end to ""the fighting and constructive dialogue to resolve the crisis"".
In a text message to Reuters news agency on Sunday, the TPLF leader said his forces had shot down a federal warplane and captured the pilot.
In another message on Monday, Mr Debretsion said the TPLF was ""close to Mekelle, fighting"".
He also said the TPLF had retaken the city of Aksum from the federal army.
On Monday, Fisseha Asgedom, a former Ethiopian ambassador to the UN with affiliations to the TPLF, told the BBC that reports by the Addis Ababa government of a sweeping advance were ""a joke"".
""The Addis Ababa government announced that they have captured Mekelle and six hours after they announced this they bombarded Mekelle... It's propaganda. Why can't they send the international community some videos?""
Mr Abiy announced that Mekelle had fallen to the federal army on Saturday, describing the move as the ""last phase"" in his government's offensive.
In a BBC interview on Monday, Minister of Democratisation Zadig Abraha, denied the TPLF's claims that they had captured Aksum and shot down a plane.
He also said the TPLF were ""not engaged in a guerrilla war"" but were ""running for their lives"".
""Their rank and file have disbanded. Everyone is surrendering,"" he added.
Redwan Hussein, a senior federal official in Tigray, said government soldiers had been careful not to involve civilians in their advance.
Troops ""just left the towns encircled and then moved on to the next. That's how we see no casualty out of our operation until we also reached Mekelle,"" he said.
On Sunday the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said supplies in Mekelle's main hospital - including body bags - were running ""dangerously low"" as doctors treated people involved in the fighting around the city.
However it gave no figures for the numbers of injured or dead. Neither did it say whether the victims were civilians or soldiers.
Ethiopian officials have promised to allow humanitarian groups to operate in Tigray, but the UN has said it is ""extremely concerned about the safety and welfare of civilians in Tigray"", and called for better access.
Ethiopia has deployed troops along Tigray's border with Sudan, preventing people fleeing the violence from leaving the country, according to refugees.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
The organisation was founded in the 1970s and spearheaded the uprising against Marxist dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in 1991.
It then went on to be the dominant political force in the country until Mr Abiy became prime minister in 2018.
Mr Debretsion has said the Tigray forces are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which dominated the entire country until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated.
The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal""."

The financial health of the savings and loan industry has drastically deteriorated. The industry has a negative net worth in excess of $70 billion, and it is experiencing significant liquidity problems. Through regulation and subsidy, government has caused large distortions in the financial markets. Regardless of changes in the economic climate, numerous S&Ls will be unable to meet their financial obligations. The federal government has three choices in dealing with the S&Ls: (1) Continue short‐​term “patching” policies, (2) Regulate other financial industries and/​or fully support the S&L industry, or (3) Deregulate the S&Ls. Adopting the first will create additional misallocations in the financial system, and the industry will ultimately default on many of its obligations. Adopting option (2) will detrimentally affect other sectors of the financial community without addressing the fundamental problems of the associations. Again, the misallocations will grow. The third option will allow the healthy S&Ls to adapt, integrating themselves into the financial community. Most importantly, past mistakes will not be perpetuated, and insolvent institutions will be liquidated. Government’s responsibility is to recognize its past mistakes before they become even more expensive to rectify. 



Originally, savings and loan associations were formed in small towns by citizens interested in acquiring a source of capital for financing home building. Before the 1929 Depression, S&Ls lent individuals money only for a short period of time, usually no more than five years. Lenders felt that the risk of longer term mortgages could not be justified by the returns. During the first years of the Depression, the character of the associations was fundamentally‐​altered. In 1932, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act established the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system with 12 regional banks. The Home Owners Loan Act, passed in 1933, authorized a federal charter system. In 1934, the National Housing Act was passed, which established the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). 



The Home Owners Loan Corporation made 15‐​year mortgages possible and with the National Housing Act, 20‐​year mortgages became economical to issue. Risk was transferred from the mortgage lender to the government. Eventually, the standard 30‐​year mortgage came into existence. FSLIC insurance gave depositors confidence in the safety of their funds. A myriad of regulatory rulings by the FHLB Board set the associations’ operations: They borrowed money from depositors through passbook accounts and lent it to home buyers in the form of 30‐​year fixed rate mortgages. The system seemed to work well, and few voices were raised against the regulatory restrictions. Home ownership became a part of the American way of life. Then the decade of the seventies shattered the mirage. 



Volatility increased in the credit markets. For the first time in memory, the economy experienced both inflation and stagnation. Most economists, influenced by the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, had not foreseen these developments and could not explain them.[1] The health of the S&L industry slowly deteriorated. Interest rates reached levels above 15 percent. Then in 1980 the financial community began to buzz with talk of the industry’s mounting problems. Now a campaign is being waged by regulators and industry officials to obscure the dangers facing the industry. Financial publications claim that “the FSLIC has more than adequate resources to prevent any loss to depositors,” that “when interest rates fall to more ‘reasonable’ levels, the industry will return to profitability,” and “(the industry’s) strong net worth position … shows its capacity to absorb considerable periods of adverse economic conditions” (from the U.S. League of Savings Associations’ 1981 Sourcebook). None of these contentions is true.

 **[Rosemary Williamson](https://theconversation.com/profiles/rosemary-williamson-191581)**  
[University of New England](https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-new-england-919)



Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been [harshly criticised](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-22/prime-minister-scott-morrison-hawaii-holiday-bushfires/11821682) for being on holiday in Hawaii as the catastrophic bushfires were burning Australia. 



Since his return, he has visited stricken communities – most recently, on [Kangaroo Island yesterday](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/11-million-funding-package-announced-to-support-small-businesses-affected-by-kangaroo-island-bushfires/news-story/a7075d119ce8c89005590107bb7a6c76). He has acknowledged the emotional toll on victims and promised practical support. 



But the criticism continues. Every detail of the prime minister’s performance is being scrutinised via the 24/7 news cycle and social media. There is plenty of scope for perceived missteps, and little tolerance of them. 



Disaster of any kind throws qualities of leadership – or the perceived lack thereof – under the spotlight. By what criteria, then, do we evaluate a leader’s performance at such times? What do we look for? 



These are questions that have guided [my research](https://primeministers.moadoph.gov.au/topics/i-had-to-come-to-see-for-myself) on how prime ministers have historically connected with Australians during times of peril. 



During crises, people expect two things, broadly speaking. One is practical information, advice and support to minimise the risk faced by those directly impacted. The other is “[humanistic communication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00909880601065664)” – or, the ability to offer comfort. 



Last March, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern [showed both of these qualities in her decisive response](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-shooting-jacinda-ardern-video-reaction-world-praise-a8832186.html) to the massacre of 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch. 



She immediately provided detailed information and promised aid and tighter gun control measures. And she unambiguously aligned all New Zealanders with the Muslim community [by what she said](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/jacinda-ardern-is-showing-the-world-what-real-leadership-is-sympathy-love-and-integrity) – “They are us” – and by standing with community leaders and comforting those in distress. 



Importantly, [Ardern also wore a headscarf](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/with-respect-how-jacinda-ardern-showed-the-world-what-a-leader-should-be) when meeting the families of victims. This was seen as a strong and culturally sensitive statement of solidarity and support – a mark of good political leadership. 



Australian leaders have long shown strength in times of need, but the way they do so has changed over time. Today, there’s much more emphasis on being visible.



Following the Black Sunday bushfires in Victoria in 1926, for example, The Age printed a speech by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in which [he promised federal government aid and praised the heroism and altruism of Australians](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/155775733?browse=ndp%3Abrowse%2Ftitle%2FA%2Ftitle%2F809%2F1926%2F02%2F18%2Fpage%2F18727995%2Farticle%2F155775733). 



When the Black Friday fires devastated the state 13 years later, The Age [quoted an “appalled” Prime Minister Joseph Lyons](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/19405913), who promised aid and expressed his “heartfelt sympathy” to victims.



But nothing was said in the newspapers back then about either prime minister interacting directly with victims. 



A leader wouldn’t get away with that these days. Since televisions became ubiquitous in people’s homes, it’s become necessary for leaders to be on the ground following a disaster, surveying damage and consoling victims. 



Prime Minister Harry Holt, a savvy user of the media in the early years of television, travelled to Tasmania in the aftermath of the Black Tuesday fires in 1967. Holt [said](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2019.1614647?journalCode=rjau20) he had to go to see for himself, to better understand people’s experience and needs. A [detailed study](https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1109993) of the 1967 bushfire response notes that Holt’s visit, while short, “caught the imagination” of journalists, who reported his reaction to the devastation in vivid detail. 



This is what we now expect. Visits to disaster sites have become [rituals vital to crisis management](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/politics-of-crisis-management/D91A08EC1089E0463A1BEDBF244176FA) and [a fixture](https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/21344) of disaster reporting. 



For a prime minister, such visits are also a chance to express those inherent qualities of “Australianness” that guarantee a full recovery. Everything that is said and done matters, which is why small details are heavily scrutinised. 



People do not expect to be held at arm’s length on these occasions. Expressions of empathy are often reinforced by physical contact, even hugs. 



Prime Minister Kevin Rudd demonstrated this following fires in Victoria in 2009, as did John Howard in the wake of the fires that swept through Canberra in 2003. They shook hands, patted backs and embraced survivors and emergency service workers.



Others have got it completely wrong. Among his many missteps in his response to Hurricane Katrina, President George W. Bush [delayed returning to Washington from his vacation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-04/bushfires-climate-change-scott-morrison-perplexing-failures/11839770) by two whole days. An image of him surveying the damage from Air Force One then [backfired](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/bushfire-crisis-burns-like-morrison-s-katrina-moment-20200103-p53ohw) – a decision Bush later called a “huge mistake”. 



When Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas in 2017, President Donald Trump was likewise [criticised](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/us/trump-texas-harvey.html) for paying too little attention to victims when he toured the site. And after the Grenfell Tower fire in London, UK Prime Minister Theresa May [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-grenfell-tower-fire-response-not-good-enough) that not meeting residents on her first visit was a mistake. 



Misjudging what type of response is welcome from a leader also risks being seen as symptomatic of poor leadership, of being out of touch with the people. As we saw recently with Morrison, not everybody appreciates a handshake. 



Even what a leader wears may be important. First Lady Melania Trump, for instance, was [widely mocked](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/melania-trump-hurricane-harvey-heels) for wearing stiletto heels to tour the Harvey devastation. 



And when Prime Minister Julia Gillard went to Queensland in early 2011 following extensive flooding and held a press conference with Premier Anna Bligh, [some commentators focused on the differences in their attire](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/captain-bligh-steers-the-ship-in-face-of-adversity-20110112-19ob0.html). Gillard, with her tidy suit, was criticised for not striking the right note. Bligh’s more casual appearance, meanwhile, had the look of someone more in touch with the suffering of the people. 



Earlier this year, Morrison was also faulted for wearing a [military camouflage jacket](https://thewest.com.au/opinion/mark-riley/scott-morrison-townsville-flood-tragedy-reveals-the-man-beneath-the-political-armour-ng-b881098307z) when touring a north Queensland flood zone, with some saying he was “[hamming it up](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/not-easy-being-green-scott-morrison-inspires-army-fatigue-with-choice-of-camouflage)” for the cameras.



The reactions to Morrison’s handling of the bushfires shows how important these qualities are in our presidents and prime ministers and how they will continue to influence perceptions of leadership in times of crisis. 



Just as every leader is different, every disaster also requires a distinct approach. Each demands quick and sensitive judgements about what’s appropriate for the occasion. Reaction to any perceived errors of judgement will be swift and will spread quickly. 



Above all, we look for [authenticity in these moments](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2018.1527712?journalCode=rjos20), rather than obviously scripted photo opportunities. And in times of crisis, we’re more attuned to those out-of-touch moments when authenticity seems to be lacking.

"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria  —   In a   concrete house on the outskirts of this city along the airport road, Abdulrahman Adam’s    body trembled as he struggled to keep down what little food he had in him. At first, his grandmother, Hauwa Saleh, sitting by his side on the dusty floor, thought Abdulrahman was teething. But everything he ate came right back up. It continued for days in September and he added a cough and started to have diarrhea. By then, the signs were clear: It was not a simple illness. In this northeastern part of Nigeria ravaged by the terrorist group Boko Haram, where there is not enough food to go around and no one goes to bed full, Abdulrahman was withering away from malnutrition. Nearly everyone in his neighborhood, crumbling under the influx of refugees fleeing the Islamist rebels, is skin and bones, starving and slowly dying. Nearby in the house, his    mother, Iyatu Adam, seven months pregnant and weak, slipped in and out of consciousness, and could not help. She had not eaten enough, either. The boy’s father had left the capital of Borno State to find a job as a day laborer because there were few jobs in the city. His uncles worked all day laying bricks to earn $1 each. With no one else able to help, Abdulrahman’s survival depended on his    grandmother. Over the next 40 days, she took him to one public hospital and then another. Both denied him. There were no vacant hospital beds, they told her. An uncle spent $35  —   nearly a month’s pay  —   to pay for his admission to a private hospital for a few days. He received fluids and medication and was released. Back home, his grandmother continued to care for Abdulrahman. They shared the only mattress in the house with the other young siblings. Everyone else slept on the ground, a thin mat between them and the hard floor. The backyard was strewn with trash, a hole dug in the ground for a toilet. Ms. Saleh walked 600 feet to retrieve the family’s drinking water from a well and took home what she could carry in small containers. Abdulrahman ate what grains the family could afford, or what was left over after they paid their rent with their harvest of groundnuts and beans, or what scraps their neighbors gave them. But the family was careful not to eat too much for dinner. They had to save something for breakfast. By early November, Abdulrahman’s health had rapidly declined. He was always tired and had a fever, no appetite and a stiff neck  —   a sign of deadly meningitis. His mother, who was near full term, was no better. His grandmother rushed her grandson and her daughter again to a public hospital, Umaru Shehu Ultra Modern Hospital, praying that this time it had enough room for them. A part of the hospital with 24 beds that had opened only weeks earlier, and was operated by the relief organization International Rescue Committee, accepted them on Nov. 4. Abdulrahman was placed in a bed enclosed in a mosquito net, with other malnourished children nearby. About 200 children die every day in this area of Nigeria, the international group Save the Children reported in November. “Our true way of being was always associated with extreme hunger,” said Ms. Saleh, sitting on the concrete stoop at the house. She has been the head of the household since her husband died seven years ago. “Ever since, my struggle to provide the family began, because I was left with no option other than to work hard and see the children grow,” she said. At the hospital, the boy’s mother was taken to a separate area and received intravenous fluids and medication. Her health improved, and Ms. Adam gave birth to a girl, who was named after her grandmother. But Abdulrahman’s health deteriorated. He died on Nov. 15, another victim in a region plundered by Boko Haram rebels, who have destroyed houses and schools, kidnapped thousands of young women and forced millions to flee their homes, plunging Nigeria into the worst recession in decades. During its yearslong insurgency, Boko Haram stripped the area’s farmland dry, stealing crops in the country’s most fertile region to feed its fighters. Farmers fled, and many have not returned. The rebels have warned that they left behind mines on the fields. “We only need food, food, food, and nothing else,” Ms. Adam said in an interview in December. “Hunger nearly killed me. ” By December, the International Rescue Committee’s center in the hospital had treated 210 children with severe acute malnutrition.   had died. In the first 11 months of 2016, Borno State had nearly 75, 000 extremely malnourished children. The World Food Program has declared that the region, where millions lack sufficient food, is experiencing “faminelike conditions. ” “The need for stabilizing children with severe acute malnutrition with medical complications is high,” said Mohamed Kassim, the operations manager of the International Rescue Committee’s medical center in the city. The center is working this year to treat up to 60 malnourished children a month, an increase from 50 a month in 2016, he said. Founded in 1933 and based in New York City, the International Rescue Committee is the newest beneficiary organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Of the eight groups assisted by the fund, it is the only one that works beyond the New York region. In 2015, the organization helped over 23 million people affected by conflict and disaster in more than 40 countries and 26 cities in the United States, with a focus on health, education and economic  . In addition to its health center in the city, the core of humanitarian and military support in Borno, the International Rescue Committee provides food and hygiene supplies to residents, and offers services for   violence and therapy sessions. “This crisis is sorely underfunded and has largely been ignored by the international community, despite the extreme violence and clear evidence of crisis levels of food insecurity,” said Stephanie Puccetti, the organization’s senior emergency program coordinator in Nigeria. In the two months since Abdulrahman died, Ms. Saleh and her daughter have returned home to lives still filled with uncertainty and peril. Ms. Saleh, who earned $10 a month as a housekeeper for a family, has not worked since that family left town. The   job was grueling and the pay was only enough to cover the cost of the bus fare there and back, so she had started to walk the approximately six miles round trip to save some money. But it paid in other ways: The family gave her leftovers to take home. Her sons, after a day’s work of laying bricks, pool their $2 to buy food to bring home. Ms. Adam is eating more often, but not the nutritious food she needs while she nurses her newborn daughter, Ms. Saleh said. A few weeks ago, Ms. Adam’s husband sent $15 to her that he had made working in another city. It paid for food. “We have been praying that may God grant that we get out of this situation soon,” Ms. Saleh said. “And for now, it’s only prayer, prayer and prayer. ”"

============================================
A small sensation goes unnoticed by the press: Solar activity indeed reached maximum value in late 20th century
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Previously it was constantly claimed that solar activity couldn’t possibly have anything to do with the warming of the late 20th century because both curves fully diverged from each other. As proof, the following charts from Wikipedia were used:

Figure 1: Comparison of global temperature, CO2 and solar activity. From Wikipedia. Source: Leland McInnes at the English language Wikipedia [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], via Wikimedia Commons.
The problem
Solar activity is not made up merely by the shaky sunspots. The above figure is an update from 2014 and was provided by a user with a less than trustworthy name of “Kopiersperre”.
The updated curve for solar activity is available from the Austrian Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG) and research group PAGES:

Figure 2: Fluctuations in solar climate drive on millennial, century and decadal scales. Top: The 20th century had the strongest solar activity in 11,000 years (here 7000 years are shown). Middle: The powerful drive of the Medieval Period and the scant amount of solar drive in the following centuries, followed by the extraordinary jump to the current level. Bottom chart: Only when using the short-term scale do we clearly see the 11-year cycle (Fröhlich 2000 aktual., Wagner and others 2007). Figure source: ZAMG.

Figure 3: Solar activity over the past 400 years. White curve; Total Solar Irradiance (TSI); Yellow curve shows sunspots. Figure source: PAGES.

The great changes in understanding solar activity were illustrated by Matthes & Funke at the end of 2015 at a conference contribution on page 9 (old curve SATIRE-TS in red):

Figure 4: The new and old curves for solar activity during the past 165 years. Source: page 9 in Matthes & Funke 2015.
But it gets even better
The sun not only reached its maximum at the end of the 20th century, but was apparently stronger than at any time over the past 10,000 years. Matthes et al. showed this in a very recent publication in the journal Geoscientific Model Development Discussions in 2016:

Figure 5: Source: Figure 20 in Matthes et al. 2016
Mysterious retreat
By the way, the unusually powerful solar activity in the second half of the 20th century had been already reported on by Sami Solanki in Nature here more than 10 years ago. Afterwards he mysteriously retreated from the climate discussion. Is this perhaps the reason why solar scientists operate almost unnoticed below the media radar?
Discomforting questions
The unexpectedly strong sun casts especially discomforting questions that some would just prefer to dodge. Couldn’t the high solar activity have something to do with the 1980-2000 warming after all?
In any case, now no one can insist that the solar activity and temperature curves diverge and thus refute the relationship. The attribution has to be re-examined altogether. There is no alternative.

"**Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the ""brink of total collapse"" after more than five months of protests, police have warned.**
The warning came as protesters clashed with police across the city on Tuesday.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who built barricades on the campus.
Earlier in the day, around 1,000 protesters rallied in central Hong Kong during the lunch hour blocking roads
Protesters, wearing office clothes, were seen chanting: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!""
The demonstrations come just a day after the territory saw a marked escalation in violence, with police shooting one activist in the torso. A pro-Beijing supporter was set on fire by anti-government protesters.
The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations, with activists demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong.
On Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Kong Wing-cheung hit out at the protesters, saying they had ""countless examples of rioters using random and indiscriminate violence against innocent"" people.
""Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the brink of total collapse as masked rioters recklessly escalate their violence under the hope that they can get away with it,"" he told reporters, adding that Monday's attack on the pro-Beijing supporter was being investigated as attempted murder.
Speaking at the same conference, Supt Li Kwai-wah defended the officer's decision to shoot the protester on Monday.
""We found out that our colleague did not only face threat from one person, instead it was a group of people with an organised plan attempting to steal the gun,"" he said.
""In a situation like this, we believe our police are reacting according to the guideline, to protect themselves as well as the people around them.""
Both the protester and the pro-Beijing supporter remain in hospital, with the latter in a critical condition.
Clashes erupted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with police firing tear gas to disperse students, while at City University there was a standoff between students and riot police which continued into the evening.
Police continued to use tear gas to try to disperse the protesters who responded with bricks and petrol bombs. Hundreds of protesters remain at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Students built roadblocks on streets in and around City University campus to stop police from entering. At one stage, a van used as part of a street barricade was set on fire.
Students at Hong Kong Polytechnic also tried to disrupt traffic near their campus.
In the morning, suspended railway services and road closures had already led to long traffic jams in the early rush hour. At noon, protesters moved into the city's central business district for a flash mob protest.
Protests continued to intensify throughout the day. A Christmas tree inside Festival Walk shopping mall was set on fire by protesters while others were seen smashing a glass railing with hammers.
Train stations were closed across the city.
Eight universities have announced they will suspend classes on Wednesday.
Monday's protests saw 260 people arrested bringing the number to more than 3,000 since the protests began in June.
**Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong**
The ground was strewn with bricks. The air was filled with the smell of tear gas. Fire was raging on campus. Hundreds of protesters, most of them clad in black, formed human chains to pass bricks and supplies to the front line.
Protesters set up makeshift stations to make petrol bombs using motor oil, flour and detergent non-stop.
One of the best universities in Hong Kong has turned into a battlefield after another day of intense clashes between students, who have been at the forefront of anti-government protests, and police.
The Chinese University students have been putting up resistance since the morning. On Monday, police seemed to change strategy by deploying forces to campuses. Students told me they should not be allowed there.
The university's management has tried to deescalate the situation. Vice-chancellor Rocky Tuan was also tear gassed as he was negotiating with police.
Dozens of students have been injured, including at least one hit in the eye by a projectile. The night is young and students swear they will not surrender.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks."

While listening to _Magic Talk_ off and on, I had a bit of a lightbulb moment regarding the Green’s true agenda. I missed a lot of it but the talk was about the use of large furnaces to burn plastics and other rubbish. My understanding of this process is that it is a two-edged sword. The heat from the fire can be converted into energy but equally importantly, mountains of plastic are burnt thereby helping to sort the massive pollution problem. 



According to NZ Green party politician **Eugenie Sage** , the Minister of Conservation, this is a no go and this is the bit I didn’t hear. Apparently her reasons for this were threefold:



Now I’m no brain surgeon but surely the plant could be scaled to suit and if need be we could even import the plastic as countries would be only too happy to ship it over for free. The emissions statement was also debunked by a caller who said that was ‘rubbish’ and that plants used in other countries gave no emissions or such a small amount to be negligible. Surely the small emissions must be better than mountains of plastic going in to landfill or just dumped into rivers and the sea? There has also been discussion of a 44-foot container system which has plastic fed into one end and biofuel comes out the other. The Greens are not interested in that idea either!



My light bulb moment was that the Greens just **don’t want to solve these problems** – probably because they would then have nothing left to do. The left is all about creating mountains out of molehills with no solutions or actually fixing the problem other than to give them money so that the state will fix it. 



A figure I heard this week was the spend in the US last year on climate change research (over 99% of which is for the pro man-made side), was **80 billion US!** Just imagine for a second how many pro-climate change advocates would be out of a job if that trough dried up?

Share this...FacebookTwitterLa Niña is coming: the Earth is cooling!
By Schneefan.
(Translated and condensed by P. Gosselin)
The warming El Niño weather phenomenon has been history since June 2016. The cool La Niña started in mid July 2016.
The daily anomalies in sea surface temperatures (SSTA) in the main Niño region 3.4 are now updated. In mid July it is in the La Niña zone at -0.74°K:

The plot above shows the daily SSTA with respect to the international climate mean of 1981-2010 in the main Niño region 3.4 with data from NOAA/CDAS (Climate Data Assimilation System). The SSTA reached and dipped below the -0.5°K mark in mid July. The latest value was -0.74°K (July 19, 2016). Source: www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/.
The following chart shows the current La Niña extending from the coast of Peru to the international dateline (180°):

The cold La Niña (blue at the equator) is shown developing. Source: www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/ocean/.
After a record warm February 2016 with an anomaly of +0.83°K using the unaltered UAH satellite data, the global temperature of the lower troposphere centered at 1500 meters fell by 0.49 K in June to +0.34°K, see the following chart:

UAH chart depicting monthly lower troposphere temperature anomaly (blue curve), along the 13-month smoothed moving average (red curve). Original text: “This gives a 2-month temperature fall of -0.37 deg. C, which is the second largest in the 37+ year satellite record…the largest was -0.43 deg. C in Feb. 1988. In the tropics, there was a record fast 2-month cooling of -0.56 deg. C, just edging out -0.55 deg. C in June 1998 (also an El Nino weakening year).“ Source: UAH Global Temperature Update for June 2016: +0.34 deg. C.

Finally, after months of disagreement, the major ENSO models are now almost in full agreement that La Niña conditions will start to take hold this summer, now that there is already a deviation of -0.7°K. See: http://www.bom.gov.au/Pacific-Ocean.
The ENSO model CFSv2 of the NOAA again looks totally confused, as it did in May. Today the ENSO monthly prognosis shows a broad scatter of +0.4°K to -2.2°K for January 2017, see following chart. That means: Nobody knows! 

The plot shows the CFSv2-ENSO prognosis from the NOAA July 17, 2016, for the monthly SSTA in the Nino region 3.4 up to April 2017. Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html.
The energy content of the water down to a depth of 300 m at the equatorial Pacific continues to show a negative anomaly for July 2016 at -1.0°K and thus has been in the cold La Niña range of under -0.5°K.

El Niño is dead – La Niña is coming! Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/enso.shtml.
It is therefore not expected that a significant cooling will take place in July this year. Dr. Roy Spencer (UAH) has already pointed that out here:
Just remember, the temperature anomaly can also temporarily rebound for a month, as it did in late 1998.”
However, it is already clear from the unaltered satellite data of the first half of this year: 2016 will not be a record warm year.

It’s true that disasters bring out the best in some people – and they also bring out the worst. Where’s there’s a disaster, there are always [looters and other opportunistic scum](https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-bushfires-three-men-charged-over-alleged-crimes-in-south-coast-communities/497cdd5a-dbe9-4c72-b2a5-752fb0236796). Then there are the green vultures who swoop on the first whiff of smoke.



Bullying left-wing thugs **GetUp** have already been exposed [soliciting donations for political campaigns](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/getup-hijacks-firefighters-to-kindle-its-funds-drive/news-story/83b5f7427f7993233965930c4b690824) on the back of Australia’s ongoing fire crisis. Shamelessly, they’ve gone even further.



The GetUp activist group is driving the campaign of some bushfire survivors who blame climate change for fires burning in southeast Australia and are calling for “100 per cent renewable energy for all”.



This should be no surprise. Shameless media tart, Tim “The Great Predicto” Flannery, likewise [cobbled together a muppet show of sock-puppets](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/experts-or-clueless-stooges/) to exploit the bushfire crisis for cheap political gain.



The bushfire survivors’ group gained national attention when it was launched in February with a personal endorsement from decorated former NSW Fire and Rescue commissioner **Greg Mullins**.



GetUp promoted the launch on its Twitter feed in advance, telling supporters Mr Mullins would join Bushfire Survivors for ­Climate Action at a press conference in Canberra.



Mullins, it should be noted, is top banana in Flannery’s climate muppet show. While his minders insist he has “no affiliation” with GetUp, it seems there is a lot more to the story.



The fire chiefs group led by Mr Mullins has no direct link to GetUp but some of the Climate Council’s supporters and contractors do have GetUp connections. The Mullins group, with Climate Council support, is pledging to hold a national summit after the fire season has ended early next year to devise a strategy on combating future fires that would take account of climate change.



This new GetUp astroturfing exercise is likewise fronted by a gallery of the activist group’s sock-puppets.



The GetUp website promoting Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action provides harrowing ­accounts of fire victims’ experiences. It seeks support for their cause and is authorised by GetUp’s ­national director, **Paul Oosting**.



The site says GetUp provides “in-kind support” while “ad hoc media support” comes from the Climate Media Centre…



Prominent among the group’s survival stories is **Lyn Trindall** ’s account of how she escaped her lower Blue Mountains home at Winmalee in October 2013. Ms Trindall, the local GetUp group co-ordinator and a former Blue Mountains councillor…Another survivor, ­retired teacher **Janet Reynolds** from Bega and a supporter of ­recent “school strike” protests over climate change…



Green opportunists really will exploit any tragedy to the hilt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt look at recent news articles on the Energiewende (transition to green energies) in the German mainstream media. Finding: the Energiewende has turned into a folly and the media are waking up.
Due to a shortage of time, I will present the main points of the DkS article.
The Energiewende Disenchantment
Things are not going well for Merkel’s Energiewende, and it would be almost entertaining if it were not such a serious issue. Globally countries looked at Germany with keen interest, wondering if the ambitious project would ever succeed. Now we see that the project has run aground. In Switzerland people are starting to feel pity for their northerly neighbors.
The Neue Zürcher Zeitung did not mince words in a June 15 article:
Berlin’s project of the century now in a precarious situation: The disenchantment with the Energiewende
In the discussion over the Energiewende, illusions and myths dominate. […] indeed the euphoria is gone. Recently the director on the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Michael Vassiliadis, depicted a ‘High-End-Version of GDR central planning economy’ as the state intervenes in increasingly more sectors in order to organize the ‘greenhouse gas-neutral’ society by 2050.”
A week later at Die Welt, Daniel Wetzel wrote on the Energiewnde madness – with drastic words:
The absurd excrescence of climate protection
Greenpeace revealed a study on what the world climate treaty of Paris would mean for the citizens. If implemented Germany would be unrecognizable in just a few years.”
On June 14, 2016, even the climate activist Focus allowed concerns by Florian Asche to be printed:
Climate protection-paradox. Commentary:
Energiewende is causing more damage than climate change itself is.
The Energiewende is supposed to rescue our planet. Here no cost or effort is to be spared. However, the good intentions will fall flat if we barrel over the original aims, FOCUS-Online-Expert Florian Asche believes. Politics seem to be ignoring this paradox. […]
A rescue that isn’t.”
So crazed is the rush to rescue the planet, that Asche writes:
Suicide because of the fear of death

Currently it is not climate change that is the big threat, but rather it is much moreso the unplanned climate protection that is threatening our spectrum of species. So here the German Wildlife Foundation estimates a quarter million strictly protected bats are lost per year because of wind turbines. The red kite, a species found only in Germany, has a total population of 13,000 birds. With an annual loss of 1000 birds, the days of this species will soon be numbered.”

Also at Spiegel the German government gets only sharp criticism:
Energiewende: No signs of Merkel
As the Schildburger fools noticed that they constructed their new town hall and forgot the windows, they came up with the brilliant idea simply bringing sunlight inside with buckets. This was also the same type of optimism that the architects of the German Energiewende demonstrated, as a recent report of the German Federal Grid Agency shows. As new wind turbines and solar systems get installed, almost everywhere transmission lines are missing. […] Acccording to the report, a total of 6000 kilometres of new power lines have to be installed.”
On May 30, 2016, the German Employers Association (DAV) disclosed that a very expensive Mother’s Day present was made.
On Mother’s Day 21 million euros were given away in 7 hours: More socialism is not possible.
The fun and games cost us 21.3 million euros. No, not the presents for mothers on Mother’s Day – rather to those who were kind enough to accept our surplus power. On Sunday, May 8, 2016, there were blue skies with lots of sun over the country, and much wind along the coast. […]
It works! The Greens cheered; sun wind and everything else could supply Germany with power completely. Such wacky aphorism spew green parliamentarians again and again across the country. When you don’t count the costs, it works.”
What remains ahead? The outlook is grim Die Welt stated in clear terms on June 10, 2016:

Energiewende – The worst remains ahead”

Especially wind turbines have become notorious. On May 10, 2016 Jan Grossarth described in the FAZ the incredible destruction of nature now taking place in Germany in the wake of the wind energy growth:
The countryside, a wind industrial park
Is the Energiewende leading to ‘more nature’? Absolutely not. We used to think that it would. Now it is clear for everyone to see in the countryside how the solar era looks: rapeseed, corn and wind turbine monocultures everywhere.”
Lüning and Vahrenholt add at DkS:
Not only the landscape is in danger, but also millions of birds have been killed. The Green Party has been quiet about this. Collateral damage that is to be tolerated? Blood is stuck to Green hands. In a few years, when the euphoria over wind disappears, there’s going to have to be an investigation. How could the green movement have gone so awry as to damage nature and wildlife – all motivated by a supposed climate protection, whose neffectiveness and necessity is becoming ever more questionable?”

"In 2004, France banned vending machines from schools. In 2011, it limited servings of french fries to once a week in school cafeterias. A year later, it imposed a “soda tax. ” On Friday, the government said no  restaurants can offer free refills of sodas and other sugary drinks.  The new regulation is the latest attempt to tackle what the government called a relentless rise in the national obesity rate.   restaurants, usually foreign chains, are expected to be targeted under the new law. The law, which takes effect immediately, said it aimed to “limit, especially among the young,” the risks of obesity and diabetes. The move by France is in line with recommendations by the World Health Organization, which has urged countries to impose a tax on sugary drinks to battle an increase in obesity, presenting data in 2016 on the beneficial health effects of such a tax. The French are, on average, less overweight than other Europeans and Americans. The share of obese adults (age 18 and older) in France was 15. 3 percent in 2014, just below the European Union average, 15. 9 percent, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Malta has the highest share of adult obesity of European nations, 26 percent. In the United States, it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the overall adult obesity rate in France appears to be relatively low, 57 percent of men and 41 percent of women 30 to 60 years old were overweight or obese, according to a report released in October by Bulletin Épidémiologique Hebdomadaire, the French medical journal. France has been at the forefront of tackling the issue, along with countries like Japan, where a national law requires companies and local governments to measure the waistlines of people between the ages of 40 and 74, and to encourage them to exercise. Mexico added a 10 percent surcharge on sugary drinks in 2014 to reduce alarming levels of diabetes there. After one year, sales of such beverages fell as much as 12 percent, while bottled water purchases rose 4 percent, a study found. Similar efforts are underway in the United States. Philadelphia became the first major city this year to introduce a tax on soda and other sugary drinks, provoking public outrage. In 2012, the New York City health board approved Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s plan to ban the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues. But a court struck down the proposal in 2013. The Bloomberg administration appealed and lost. The new law has divided the French, who consume fewer soft drinks per capita than residents of most other countries. “Each person has to take responsibility,” a    man told the newspaper Le Parisien. Restaurants “might as well put scales in front of each   joint. ”"

We all know the maxim that common sense just isn’t that common. Nothing proves this more than the current debate about Climate Change. ‘Global Warming’ has become the propaganda term of choice for those who make a living from scare tactics about the climate. Yet, brave souls in the scientific and political community are offering alternate views, views that receive scant regard in the mainstream media.
In a series of columns for carbon-sense.com we will investigate just how much, or little, common sense is being applied in the worldwide debate. We will expose the facts Al Gore and his cohorts don’t want the average citizen to know; and we will challenge the orthodox view that has enveloped the mass media and politicians of all stripes. More importantly, we will investigate the motivations of many of those who are on the climate change bandwagon – from simple economic avarice right through to an intent to alter the entire economic and political order.

Let’s start with a simple example – the Alliance for Climate Protection, set up by Al Gore. It’s aim? ‘A three to five-year campaign to educate people from all walks of life that the climate crisis is both critically urgent and something we can solve.’ The Alliance is trying to get people to sign a seven-part pledge, which requires countries and politicians to ‘join an international treaty within the next two years that cuts global warming pollution by 90 per cent in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy Earth.’ Apart from the ludicrous demand of 90% reductions in the West the pledge is not constrained by date or other specifics and hangs on the generalisations of ‘in time for the next generation’ and ‘a healthy Earth’. Exactly who appointed these people to be making decisions on behalf of those of us in democrat societies? More importantly, exactly how is the US or the Australian economy supposed to survive and grow if ‘global warming pollution’ is cut by 90% in a couple of decades at most?
Before we think these pledges are meaningless to our own lifestyles let’s note that the two most powerful Democrats in the United States signed up – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Mysteriously, there are no reports of Ms Pelosi and Mr Reid reducing their own emissions by 90% – yet. And don’t hold your breath waiting.
To undertake our analysis of the Climate Change debate we can begin by asking the questions that cry out to be answered:
Is climate change actually occurring? Is there a man-made component to climate change (anthropomorphic global warming or AGW)? Can we actually slow, or alter, climate change, whether or not human activity can be shown to be a cause? Despite attempts by Gore and his Australian disciples, Peter Garrett and Bob Brown, to pretend the contrary there is no scientific consensus on any of these questions.
Is the risk to our future so high that we must make huge changes to our economy and our daily lives to mitigate that risk? If so, how much change is required? What processes should be employed in making decisions about these changes? Can a worldwide response be developed, considering the strategic, political and economic needs of Russia, China, India and the Third World? Who should make these decisions and how transparent must the decision-making process be? Who, apart from a few celebrities and leftist political movements decided that the most dysfunctional political entity in history – the United Nations – should have the authority to impose its will upon Australia, the United States, China and India?
Who stands to gain from the changes proposed and the vast sums of money that will flow from carbon trading, carbon taxes, government subsidies and the like? Who stands to lose?
What are the myths peddled by the environmental movements? What are the real truths that are lost in the debate?
What do we, as individuals have to do to prepare our families, our friends, and our communities for the inevitable changes that will be wrought either by climate change, or the reaction to perceived climate change?
What should be done to protect freedom of speech for sceptics, both scientists and commentators, who do not agree with aspects of global climate dogma?
Perhaps most important of all, how do we protect our hard-won social and individual freedoms from the corporatist assault by the political left disguised as necessary environmental protections?
All things considered, we’ve run hands-on with a huge amount of extraordinary laptops under 500, so you have a bigger number of Best Laptops For Businessoptions than you may might presume. Immediately, these are the best tablets under $500 that have become through our labs
Almost every change proposed by the environmental movement and their fellow-travellers involves taxes; fines; laws against certain actions, processes or products; regulation; or emotional blackmail. Almost every change has the potential to inflict economic damage on the developed world and eliminate opportunity for the disadvantaged in developing countries and the Third World. Almost every change has a political flavour – restriction of personal and economic freedoms.
Through these columns we will come to a better understanding of the facts relating to the Climate Change debate; the possible consequences of actions or inactions we as individuals and societies take; and the destructive aims of the Marxist-dominated environmental movement.
If we have one responsibility as individuals it is surely this – we must inform ourselves of issues that affect our families, our society and ourselves. Surely this means investigating the issues ourselves and not simply serving as earpieces for propaganda and opinion masquerading as confirmed science.
Topical Note:
The New South Wales State Government plans to make water restrictions in Sydney permanent, the decision ‘made on the basis of scientific evidence on the future impact of global warming on Sydney’s rainfall’. In fact, the real reason this decision has been made is glaringly obvious – the politicians don’t want to spend the money required to build new dams, water saving and water recycling infrastructure. And they don’t want the political hassles that go with selecting sites for dams and desalination plants.

I often get emails asking me to comment in detail on an article on global warming that pretends the “problem” is worse than it is. Here is my reply to one such request.
Earth is a wilder [no], warmer [no] place since last climate deal made in 1997
By SETH BORENSTEIN, November 29, 2015 [At least he got the date right]
PARIS (AP) — This time, it’s a hotter [Satellites show no global warming for the 223 months (i.e., 18 years 7 months) since April 1997], waterier [Water vapour is difficult to measure, but some records show no change in water vapour except in the vital mid-troposphere, where it has actually declined], wilder Earth [The IPCC, both in its 2012 Special Report on Extreme Weather and in its 2013 Fourth Assessment Report, says there has been no particular overall trend in storminess, floods or droughts] that world leaders are trying to save [They are not trying to save the world: Bjorn Lomborg has reliably calculated that the effect of honouring all nations’ Paris pledges will be to reduce global temperature by 0.05-0.17 C° by 2100 compared with having no pledges, and the cost of getting that reduction will be $1 trillion]. 
The last time that the nations of the world struck a binding agreement to fight global warming was 1997, in Kyoto, Japan [It wasn’t binding: any nation had the right to give a year’s notice and just walk away, and one or two have done so]. As leaders gather for a conference in Paris on Monday to try to do more, it’s clear things have changed dramatically over the past 18 years [But according to the mean of the RSS and UAHv6 satellite records there’s been no global warming in all that time, so none of the changes that have occurred could have been caused by warming].

Some differences can be measured: degrees on a thermometer [a zero trend since April 1997], trillions of tons of melting ice [global sea-ice shows little change in extent or trend since satellite monitoring began 37 years ago], a rise in sea level of a couple of inches [the ENVISAT satellite showed that sea level is rising at a rate equivalent to 1.3 inches per century]. Epic weather disasters, including punishing droughts [declining for the past 30 years globally], killer heat waves [but killer cold snaps kill far more] and monster storms [nothing unprecedented], have plagued Earth [But no more than usual].

As a result, climate change is seen as a more urgent and concrete problem than it was last time [on no evidence: the rate of global warming since 1990, on all datasets, is well below the least rate predicted with “substantial confidence” by the IPCC in that year, and is only half to one-third of its central prediction].

“At the time of Kyoto, if someone talked about climate change, they were talking about something that was abstract in the future,” said Marcia McNutt, the former U.S. Geological Survey director who was picked to run the National Academies of Sciences. “Now, we’re talking about changing climate, something that’s happening now. You can point to event after event that is happening in the here and now that is a direct result of changing climate.” [The climate has been changing for 4 billion years: time to get used to it. Since there has been no global warming for 18 years 7 months, the extreme-weather events that are now occurring must be of natural and not manmade origin].
Other, nonphysical changes since 1997 make many experts more optimistic than in previous climate negotiations [for instance, Professor Richard Tol has said no net harm will occur unless there is at least 3.5 C° warming, but modellers’ reductions in their estimates of how the climate responds to direct warming caused by CO2 imply that not more than 0.5 C° of global warming will occur by 2100, even if we do very little to mitigate warming].
For one, improved technology is pointing to the possibility of a world weaned from fossil fuels, which emit heat-trapping gases [But the gases don’t trap anything like as much heat as was originally thought]. Businesses and countries are more serious about doing something, in the face of evidence that some of science’s worst-case scenarios are coming to pass [There is no evidence that worst-case scenarios are coming to pass, for the good and sufficient reason that for almost two decades, despite a considerable increase in Man’s emission of greenhouse gases, there has been no global warming at all to trigger those “worst-case scenarios”].

“I am quite stunned by how much the Earth has changed since 1997,” [except that global temperature has not changed since 1997, so any other changes were not caused by rising temperature] Princeton University’s Bill Anderegg said in an email. “In many cases (e.g. Arctic sea ice loss [which has been more or less matched by gains in Antarctic sea ice], forest die-off due to drought) [The most comprehensive recent drought survey, conducted just last year, found that the fraction of the Earth’s land surface suffering drought has declined throughout the period of record], the speed of climate change is proceeding even faster than we thought it would two decades ago.”[In 1995 the IPCC had issued predictions of warming that were in some respects even more extreme than those it had made in 1990: but there has been no statistically-significant global warming since 1990, and none at all since 1997]
Some of the cold numbers on global warming since 1997 [There has been no global warming since 1997]:
—The West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have lost 5.5 trillion tons of ice, or 5 trillion metric tons, according to Andrew Shepherd at the University of Leeds, who used NASA and European satellite data [Even if this were true, and there is plenty of evidence that it is not, it was not caused by global warming because there has not been any, and the analysis omits the 80% of global land-based ice that is on the East Antarctic ice sheet, and the ice there has been growing].

—The five-year average surface global temperature for January to October has risen by nearly two-thirds of a degree Fahrenheit, or 0.36 degrees Celsius, between 1993-97 and 2011-15, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [The correct statistical approach is to maximize degrees of freedom by using as many data points as possible, and the monthly NOAA global temperature data from 1995 to the present show a warming of less than 0.3 C°, equivalent to just 1.6 C°/century; however, until two years ago the NOAA data showed no warming since the late 1990s, just as the satellite data did, but NOAA tampered with the record in preparation for Paris and suddenly a warming trend has appeared: Congress is investigating, as is the former vice-chancellor of Buckingham University in the UK].

In 1997, Earth set a record for the hottest year, but it didn’t last. Records were set in 1998, 2005, 2010 and 2014, and it is sure to happen again in 2015 when the results are in from the year, according to NOAA [Its results have been tampered with in a manner that, when set against the satellite record, seems suspicious: hence the Congressional investigation. The satellites do not show 2014 as the warmest year, and will not show 2015 as the warmest year either. Besides, the weather was warmer in the mediaeval, Roman, Minoan, Old-Kingdom, and Holocene warm periods, so there is nothing special about today’s temperatures].

—The average glacier has lost about 39 feet, or 12 meters, of ice thickness since 1997, according to Samuel Nussbaumer at the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Switzerland [but that organization has taken measurements of mass balance at only 230, or one-seventh of one per cent, of the world’s 160,000+ glaciers. It has done very little work in Antarctica, which contains about 90% of the world’s ice mass, and which, except for a small area of West Antarctica, has not warmed or lost ice mass throughout the satellite era].
—With 1.2 billion more people in the world, carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels climbed nearly 50 percent between 1997 and 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The world is spewing more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide a day now [and yet, 265 years after the Industrial Revolution began, to the nearest tenth of one per cent there is no CO2 in the atmosphere at all, for the atmosphere is big and our emissions are small by comparison].
—The seas have risen nearly 2 1/2 inches, or 6.2 centimeters, on average since 1997, according to calculations by the University of Colorado [However, the GRACE gravitational-anomaly satellites showed no sea-level rise at all from 2003-2008, and the ENVISAT satellite showed sea level rising at a rate equivalent to 1.3 inches/century from 2004 to 2012, and the sea-level rise found by the University of Colorado is smaller than the intercalibration errors between the series of laser-altimetry satellites it relies upon; the sea level rise comes chiefly from an artificial and unjustifiable “glacial isostatic adjustment”; and Professor Mörner’s best estimate is that sea level is rising no faster this century than last – i.e., at about 20 cm/century].

—At its low point during the summer, the Arctic sea ice is on average 820,000 square miles smaller than it was 18 years ago, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. That’s a loss equal in area to Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico and Arizona combined [But, compared with the large annual summer-to-winter fluctuations, the loss is quite small, and it is largely compensated by an increase in Antarctic sea-ice extent].


—The five deadliest heat waves of the past century — in Europe in 2003, Russia in 2010, India and Pakistan this year, Western Europe in 2006 and southern Asia in 1998 — have come in the past 18 years, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster in Belgium [The centre, inferentially for political reasons connected with its funding, has not made any studies of loss of life caused by extreme cold, which, however, kills roughly 20 times as many people as extreme heat. Warmer weather would actually bring about fewer deaths than colder weather. In a single cold winter in just one country, the UK, four years ago, there were 31,000 excess deaths; the European heatwave may have killed 35,000-70,000 across Europe as a whole. The centre’s website returns only one search result for the word “cold” on its database, and that is a reference to the “Cold War”].
—The number of weather and climate disasters worldwide has increased 42 percent, though deaths are down 58 percent [This increase, to the extent that it exists, for no reference is provided, is likely to be attributable to better reporting: the IPCC is quite clear that there is no evidence for increased extreme weather in almost all categories]. From 1993 to 1997, the world averaged 221 weather disasters that killed 3,248 people a year. From 2010 to 2014, the yearly average of weather disasters was up to 313, while deaths dropped to 1,364, according to the disaster database [In fact, the annual number of deaths from extreme weather worldwide is at its lowest point in the satellite era, according to the Global Warming Policy Foundation: and that is what we should expect, given better forecasting of individual extreme events and a small increase in warmer weather, which reduces temperature-related deaths].

Eighteen years ago, the discussion was far more about average temperatures, not the freakish extremes. Now, scientists and others realize it is in the more frequent extremes that people are truly experiencing climate change [The reason why mean temperatures were the topic 18 years ago is that they had increased for 20 since 1976, largely influenced by the phase-change in that year from the cooling to the warming phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index, and the reason why Mr Borenstein does not want to focus on mean temperatures now is that they have not increased, and, since they have not increased, there is no reason to blame Man for any consequential increase in extreme temperatures].
Witness the “large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires,” former Vice President Al Gore, who helped negotiate the 1997 agreement, told The Associated Press. “There’s a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally right now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.” [But Al Gore is no scientist and, when his claims of disaster were subjected to court scrutiny in the London High Court in 2007 Mr Justice Burton said, “The Armageddon scenario that he depicts is not based on any scientific view.”]

Studies have shown that man-made climate change contributed in a number of recent weather disasters. Among those that climate scientists highlight as most significant: the 2003 European heat wave that killed 70,000 people in the deadliest such disaster in a century [even if one accepts the tampering by which the original estimate of 35,000 deaths (probably an exaggeration in itself) was doubled, just three typical British winters will cause more excess deaths than that one-off Europe-wide heatwave, which is known to have been caused not by global warming but by a blocking high]; Hurricane Sandy, worsened by sea level rise, which caused more than $67 billion in damage and claimed 159 lives [Sandy was also not caused by global warming but by a rare coincidence of three storms from different directions over a major population centre, and sea level at the New York Battery tide-gauge shows just 11 inches’ increase in 100 years, most of that before Man could have had any influence]; the 2010 Russian heat wave that left more than 55,000 dead [such events are neither new nor more commonplace now than formerly: the great multi-decadal drought in the Great Plans of the US before 1950 was far worse]; the drought still gripping California [the IPCC has repeatedly said one should not assign blame for individual weather events to global warming, and Hao et al. 2014 showed that the fraction of the globe under drought has been declining for 30 years]; and Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 in the Philippines in 2013 [but recorded history shows many far worse storms: in 1881, for instance, more than 20,000 corpses were recovered from the shoreline near Manila after a typhoon, and in those days the population was far smaller than today].
Still, “while the Earth is a lot more dangerous on one side [except that, on the evidence it isn’t: and, to this day, the believers have been unable or unwilling to state what the ideal global mean surface temperature is, and what variance either side of that temperature is net-beneficial], the technologies are a lot better than they were,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute. Solar and wind have come down tremendously in price [but they are still up to 20 times costlier per MWh generated than coal], so much so that a Texas utility gives away wind-generated electricity at night [That is because every wind turbine has to be backed up by a fossil-fuelled power station running at inefficient, highly-CO2-emitting idle-speed, so that, according to Professor Hughes of Edinburgh University, under most operating conditions wind power actually emits more CO2 than a coal-fired power station: accordingly, a grid surplus arises every time the wind blows, particularly when electricity demand is low at night-time].

Another big change is China. In Kyoto, China and developing countries weren’t required to cut emissions. Global warming was seen as a problem for the U.S. and other rich nations to solve. But now China — by far the world’s No. 1 carbon polluter — has reached agreement with the U.S. to slow emissions and has become a leader in solar power. [In fact, China has made no definite commitment of any kind; has absolutely refused to allow any international monitoring or control of its emissions; already emits one-third of all CO2 worldwide; has recently been found to have understated its emissions by as much as one-sixth; has built hundreds of surplus coal-fired power stations so that in a few years it can get the kudos for announcing a halt to its building programme; and is a “leader” in solar power only to the extent that, at huge environmental cost and using rigged low wages, it manufactures cheap and often unreliable solar panels for export].
“The negotiations are no longer defined by rich and poor,” Gore said. “There’s a range of countries in the middle, emerging economies, and thankfully some of them have stepped up to shoulder some of the responsibility.” [That’s as may be, but the “countries in the middle” will make little difference to global emissions either way, and in any event there will be no cuts in global CO2 emissions before mid-century at the earliest because China and India, the world’s two largest populations, will continue to burn cheap coal in ever-larger quantities, and have already begun to gain a massive commercial advantage by supplying coal-fired electricity at prices not more than one-third of the mean Western electricity price].
U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said there’s far less foot-dragging in negotiations: “There is not a single country that tells me they don’t want a good Paris agreement.” [And I want motherhood and apple pie too, but whatever happens in Paris will, on Bjorn Lomborg’s calculations, and on those of Professor Tol, make a barely measurable difference at a huge cost, and will not be necessary even if the predicted warming actually occurs, which on the record of the past couple of decades it will not].
Figueres said that while the Kyoto agreement dictated to individual nations how much they must cut, what comes out of Paris will be based on what the more than 150 countries say they can do. That tends to work better, she said. [Yeah, right: translate this as “The questioners have won, the consensus is absent, the science isn’t there, even if it was it would be cheaper to let warming happen and adapt the day after tomorrow than to try to prevent it today, and we can’t get a binding agreement anyway”].
It has to, Figueres said. “The urgency is much clearer now than it used to be.” [No, it isn’t. How can it be, given that on all terrestrial and satellite temperature records there has been at most half the warming that the IPCC originally predicted in 1990? The IPCC itself has been compelled almost to halve its predictions of medium-term warming, so there is far less “urgency” than there was. Indeed, there is now no urgency at all. The climate scare has died, but it will not be given a decent burial until the corpse smells so foul that the profiteers of doom can no longer make any money out of it at taxpayers’ expense].

From the University of York:

A new study led by a University of York scientist addresses an important question in climate science: how accurate are climate model projections?
Climate models are used to estimate future global warming, and their accuracy can be checked against the actual global warming observed so far. Most comparisons suggest that the world is warming a little more slowly than the model projections indicate. Scientists have wondered whether this difference is meaningful, or just a chance fluctuation.
Dr Kevin Cowtan, of the Department of Chemistry at York, led an international study into this question and its findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. The research team found that the way global temperatures were calculated in the models failed to reflect real-world measurements. The climate models use air temperature for the whole globe, whereas the real-world data used by scientists are a combination of air and sea surface temperature readings.
Dr Cowtan said: “When comparing models with observations, you need to compare apples with apples.”
The team determined the effect of this mismatch in 36 different climate models. They calculated the temperature of each model earth in the same way as in the real world. A third of the difference between the models and reality disappeared, along with all of the difference before the last decade. Any remaining differences may be explained by the recent temporary fluctuation in the rate of global warming.
Dr Cowtan added: “Recent studies suggest that the so-called ‘hiatus’ in warming is in part due to challenges in assembling the data. I think that the divergence between models and observations may turn out to be equally fragile.”
Dr Cowtan’s primary field of research is X-ray crystallography and he is based in the York Structural Biology Laboratory in the University’s Department of Chemistry. His interest in climate science has developed from an interest in science communication. This is his second major climate science paper. For this project, he led a diverse team of international researchers, including some of the world’s top climate scientists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe energy restriction that the global climate change movement is calling for is arguably about driving the masses back into the mud, and putting a small, elitist class into palaces.
Any study would show that global warming regulators, activists and scientists are the worst offenders when it comes to carbon emissions. Think Al Gore, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hillary Clinton (e.g. private jet for travelling just 20 miles), to name just a few. The most alarmist climate scientists are constantly flying and attending lavish conferences.
I’d even say that the aim goes far beyond us serving them instead of them serving us, rather, at least for some, it’s mostly about forcing us to worship them at their feet. This green movement as we know it is in large part tyranny disguised as rescuing the planet. 80% of the science is pure BS.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt deliver another prime example of climate arrogance in their latest post, where they write “Preach water, guzzle wine.”
The latest surrounds Swiss Vice President Doris Leuthard of the Christian Democratic People’s Party (CVP) and her in Abu Dhabi celebrating the completion of the around-the-world trip by sun-powered aircraft Solar-Impulse, which de facto was carried around the world.
The two German authors quote an except from an article by Markus Schär of the Swiss Weltwoche No. 30/2016, who writes:
Using the federal parliamentary jet, Doris Leuthard (CVP) flew to Abu Dhabi. She celebrated Bertrand ­Piccard and André Borschberg, who circled the globe in the monster aircraft ‘Solar Impulse’, which was accompanied a charter jet with a 65-man crew and mobile hangar inside, and that in only 425 days more than Jules Verne’s hero (‘Around the World in 80 Days’) back in 1872. A reporter from Blick [daily] was told by Leuthard that ‘Switzerland must somehow show the world how we can set up a world without fossil energies in the future’. (When asked the question why Abu Dhabi was the starting point and destination, she conceded that Switzerland was ‘simply no country for sunshine’). The Parliamentary jet emitted some 80 tonnes of CO2 just for one trip, the same as driving a car for 30 years. Leuthard’s own Federal Ministry for Commercial Aviation recommends against emissions, a ‘reduction of personal travel distances.’ And: “refraining from midsize and long journeys.’”
Of course people like Leuthard have no intention whatsoever of drastically scaling back their own lifestyles.
Power is not about equality, rather it’s all about creating glaring inequality.

"The departure board at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan has departed this life, but unlike Elvis, it has not left the building. Amtrak disconnected the board on Monday, stretching tarpaulins over one side of the familiar,   sign that told commuters whether the 5:54 to Metuchen, N. J. would be a touch late  —   and, when the time finally came, which track they could find it on. The other side of the board was left uncovered, a big, black, blank rectangle. Amtrak had said the departure board’s demise would begin around 10 p. m. on Monday, after the evening rush. For once, Amtrak was early. By the time commuters arrived at 6 p. m. the board was off, compounding the aggravation of a bad night caused by heavy winds and rain. Some commuters wondered if the   board was related to the delays on New Jersey Transit, which shares Penn Station with Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road. An Amtrak spokeswoman, Kimberly Woods, said it was not. She said the board was turned off for testing and restarted before the final shutdown after 10. As early as 3:37 p. m. New Jersey Transit had warned on Twitter that there would be “major delays” because a storm had knocked down power lines in Linden, N. J. Trains from Trenton to Metropark, a major station, were suspended for about 30 minutes during the evening rush, but the delays continued even after service resumed. The old board was replaced by video monitors that have been functioning for several months. There are large monitors at both ends of the main waiting area on the west side of the station and smaller ones above the gates. Another large monitor is in the rotundalike space on the east side of the station, where there is also an arrivals monitor. Ms. Woods said Amtrak made the change in “our ongoing effort to improve and upgrade the passenger experience. ” “It’s like anything else  —   modern times, and everything’s digital,” said H. Edward Wilkin III, an accountant who was on the way to Secaucus, N. J. on Tuesday morning. But the trains were no more modern. Mr. Wilkin had a noon appointment. The new departure screen reported that his 11:06 train would be delayed. For how long, it did not say. Some commuters said the change made no difference, because the old board had little to do with the reality of when trains actually pulled away from the station, and they doubted the new screens would be any more accurate. Amtrak said the old board would be dismantled over the next few nights, when crowds in the station were thinnest. “I’ve been taking these trains since I was 18, going to college,” said Joe Castaldo, 63, who grew up in Oceanport, N. J. and now runs a   firm in Manhattan. “I’m sad the board is gone. It’s nostalgic, I know. ” He said the new screens were better, but the change was jarring for his mother, whom he had just put on a train. “She was like, ‘What am I going to do now? ’” Mr. Castaldo said. The old board was a centerpiece, the thing that brought a community together  —   a community of strangers about to be on a train. The board on the west side of the station was the heart of the waiting area  —   the town square, such as it was. A town square with linoleum underfoot, not grass, and fluorescent lighting above, not a Norman Rockwell sky. Like something from the days when newspapers hung bulletins outside their offices, the board told stories  —   and like Twitter, it told them in a minimum of characters, with few full sentences. Explanations were not always provided for “Delayed” or “Standby. ” The departure board that was disconnected on Monday was not the one many thought it was. It was not the one made by the Italian company Solari that whirred and clicked like the boards on television game shows in the 1960s. That sign was replaced about 15 years ago by the device that went dark on Monday, which had become too difficult to keep going, Amtrak said last summer. “That one can only do letters and numbers and columns,” said Kevin Farley, a digital experience strategist who was on his way to Philadelphia on Tuesday. “It was a classic design. ” Then, nodding toward one of the new electronic screens, he added: “This is still a little  . We’d like to know: Is the wind going to affect us? They could do little messages like that. ” At the other end of the waiting area, Ritu Narula, a lawyer heading to Washington, complained about legibility. “You can’t see the track number as easily” on the new screens, she said. “But we’ll get used to it. ” Did the new screens make the wait more pleasant or the lines shorter? Some remembered the architect Vincent J. Scully Jr. ’s famous line about the old Penn Station, demolished in the 1960s, as compared with the present one: “One entered the city like a god one scuttles in now like a rat. ” “I always feel like a rodent in there, getting from Point A to Point B,” Lorraine B. Diehl, the author of “The Late, Great Pennsylvania Station,” said from her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. As for the departure screens, she said, “I can’t pretend it’s something I care about. ” “To me, the bigger picture has to be addressed,” she said. “We need a new station. ”"

As already[ reported in The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-green-vultures-swoop-pt-1-a-firestorm-of-astroturf/), the political jackals of the green-left are pouncing on Australia’s bushfire crisis before the ashes are even cool. First, there was [**Tim Flannery** ’s climate muppet show](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/climate-muppet-show-gets-a-gong-from-firies/), the “Emergency Leaders for Climate Action”. There being no show without Punch, **GetUp** have quickly got in on the act, too, touting its own activists as “Bushfire Survivors for ­Climate Action”.



But nothing else draws green scavengers like the scent of money.



While many around the nation mourn lives lost in bushfires still raging, others have sought to profit from the tragedy.



Enter GetUp.



The eco-activists have used the bushfires to ask for $12 donations to fight the “cashed-up mining lobby” they blame for the fires.



Many people, from pop stars to businessmen to kids washing cars have shown extraordinary generosity in raising funds for bushfire victims. Not GetUp. They’re not asking for money for bushfire victims.



 **These disgusting jackals are putting their hands out for themselves only.**



Families have lost everything. Loved ones, homes, communities.



Some have broken down in tears after escaping with just the shirts off their back.



But rather than asking for donations to help these people, GetUp wants you to finance its propaganda outfit which is short on cash after being banned from living off foreign donations.



On Saturday, a few hours after the woman found in Wytaliba died, GetUp national director **Paul Oosting** wrote this email.



“As bushfires rage across the east coast, people are taking climate action in unprecedented numbers – protesting the inaction of our government and climate wrecking corporations,” he said.



“But with Morrison now actively working with the cashed-up mining lobby – now, more than ever, we need to stand united.



“Can you chip in $12 to a fighting fund to defeat Scott Morrison’s authoritarian climate crackdown?”



The timing of such a request is sickening.



It’s not just GetUp, either.



 **The Wilderness Society** are also touting for donations, using the bushfires as a stump for their shameless opportunism.



For the last several weeks, Australia has been on fire. Beyond the devastating human cost, these fires are game-changing for Australia’s iconic nature […]Will you help to reach our end of the year fundraising goal of $200,000?



These people really have no shame at all.

It seems that some on the left are panicking that their death-grip on taxpayer-funded academia may be slipping. Former Labor senator **Kim Carr** (a notorious head kicker for Labor’s Socialist Left faction) is horrified that Australia’s Education Minister wants taxpayer money spent, not just on Australian research, but, horror of horrors, research that **isn’t** specifically slanted to denigrate our nation.



Even worse, the wicked conservative government seems to have the unmitigated gall to believe that government-funded leftist academics **don’t** have a God-given right to tell the rest of us what to think.



Do Australians really need “fewer people telling us what to think”? Federal Education Minister **Dan Tehan** wrote that on this page on Monday.



The very nerve! I mean, let people start thinking for themselves, and, before you know it, you have a **Trump** , a **Morrison** , a **Bolsonaro** , **Orban** or **Johnson** winning democratic elections.



What’s the point of even orchestrating decades of the [Long March through the institutions](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/how-the-long-march-left-are-erasing-the-enlightment/), if the left can’t even claim their rightful places as our superiors?



If these funds are to be alloc­ated by the normal peer-review process and without political interference, as Tehan assures us they will be, the outcome may well be that some of our present disputes become more acute.



This is true enough, in that the leftist academic establishment will fight furiously to hold onto what it has come to regard as its right and privilege to control the national discourse. One need only look at the righteous meltdown from the establishment left when the Ramsay Foundation attempted to establish a [Centre for Western Civilization ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/academic-idiots-are-betraying-australia/)at just one university.



The “normal peer-review process” Carr lauds is, in fact, at the heart of the problem. **The stifling leftist death-grip on academia is such a stranglehold that “peer-review” actually means “pal review”.** The last thing this leftist echo-chamber tolerates is independent thought.



He wants historians and other humanities scholars to do what they do, so long as they don’t tell us what to think.



Perhaps he means that what they do is all right if they agree with what he thinks.



Perhaps Carr might want to consider the old adage about pots and kettles?



In trying to demonise the Morrison government, Carr, the fossilised old lefty, descends into farcical cherry-picking.



It will be remembered that Tehan’s predecessor as minister, **Simon Birmingham** , vetoed 11 grant applications in the humanities and social sciences that had been recommended by the ARC…



The 11 projects Birmingham decided were not in the national interest included: research into the social impact of shutting down the Australian car industry; responses to climate change by the MCG and other sporting venues; and a comparative study of indigenous politics in the US and Australia.



He also rejected an application by an internationally renowned musicologist who was conducting research into birdsong.



Well, gosh – however can we as a nation live without knowing the finer points of how sporting venues are responding to climate change? 



Carr might also have been more honest to outline some of the other, oh-so-vital research that Tehan kyboshed. Such as “Beauty and ugliness as persuasive tools in changing China’s gender norms”, “Post-orientalist arts in the Strait of Gibraltar”, and “Soviet cinema in Hollywood before the blacklist”.



Well, I don’t know about you, but I can’t sleep at night for worrying about China’s gender norms and post-orientalist arts in the Strait of Gibraltar.



If Carr was trying to destroy the perception of academia as a bunch of out-of-touch leftists circle-jerking each other at the taxpayer’s expense, he certainly has an odd way of going about it.

By Kenneth Richard
A new 368-year tree ring temperature reconstruction has established that regional (China) summer temperatures were warmer than they are now (2012) during the mid-1600s and early 1700s, and that the temperature variations can be linked to variations in solar activity, volcanic forcing (cooling), and natural oceanic-atmospheric oscillations (AMO/PDO).
The authors are intent on pointing out that it is “noteworthy that 20th century warming was not very obvious in our reconstruction.”  This “noteworthy” finding is mentioned four different times in the paper.
The lack of a conspicuous 20th century warming — and the warmer periods during the 1600s and 1700s — are clearly shown in the summer temperature graph below:

Annual and 11-year smoothed regional July–August mean maximum temperature reconstruction (blue and red lines, respectively); superimposed is the 11-year smoothed instrumental record (pink line).
Zhu and co-authors also do not mention CO2 as a “possible forcing mechanism” in their extensive discussion of the causes of temperature variations for the last 368 years, probably because there is little to no correlation between the decadal-scale temperature variations (warming and cooling periods) and the precipitous rise in atmospheric CO2 during the 20th and 21st centuries.
Below is a summary of the key points from the paper Zhu et al., 2016:

A 368-year maximum temperature reconstruction
During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.
[S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, volcanic eruptions in the corresponding periods might also be a cooling factor (Fig. 7b). A longer cold period (e.g., 1820s–1840s) was interrupted by transient warming, thus forming a plurality of discontinuous short cold periods. Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b). The cold (1765–1769 or 1869–1877) and warm (1655–1668) periods were highly consistent with other studies (Fig. 7).
Possible Forcing Mechanism
Accompanied by significant peaks at 60.2 and 73 years, the continuously periodicities around 49–114 years in our regional temperature reconstruction might tentatively be related to PDO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; En- field et al., 2001) as well as solar activity (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999; Peristykh and Damon, 2003; Raspopov et al., 2004; Braun et al., 2005). The AMO was an important driver of multidecadal variations in summer climate not only in North America and western Europe (Kerr, 2000; Sutton and Hodson, 2005) but also in the East Asia (Feng and Hu, 2008; Liang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011, 2015; Zhu et al., 2011). The 60.2-year peak associated with AMO demonstrated that multidecadal variations in late summer temperature in the NWSP NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be controlled by AMO.
[S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b).
Conclusion
Overall, the RLST [mean maximum temperature] variability in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be associated with global land–sea atmospheric circulation (e.g., ENSO, PDO, or AMO) as well as solar and volcanic forcing.

Yesterday I happened to watch Germany’s ARD 8 pm news, and was a bit surprised by its reporting on the GOP Convention.
According to Wikipedia, the ARD is the “world’s largest public broadcaster with a budget of €6.5 billion and 20,616.5 employees”.
The ARD 8 pm news is in fact such an institution, that one of the first unwritten rules one learns when moving to the country is that you do not call anyone at their home between 8 and 8:15 pm because you risk disturbing them as they loyally watch their ARD evening news.
Over the years, however, the ARD has become glaringly one-sided politically, and an avid purveyor of political correctness. It can be argued that elements of elitism have long seeped into leading network heads over time, as is the case with much of the established German media.
Lately all-out Trump and GOP bashing has become a full-time sport not only at the ARD, but throughout the massive German public media complex. Hillary Clinton, the scandal-fraught Democrat candidate, gets a free pass.
White network labels Republicans racist?
What caught my eye yesterday was the degree of zealousness and lengths that the network went to, to portray the RNC in Cleveland as racially tinged, telling viewers near the 12-minute mark that only among the “overly white event” only 18 of the over 2472 delegates are black (skipping the fact that a number of minorities made speeches at the convention, and that the party in fact is ethnically diverse, i.e. see the original GOP candidate field).
Grotesquely distorted, blind journalism
The ARD’s portrayal of the GOP was a carefully crafted and designed to grotesquely distort and discredit the true spirit of the party.
As Germany takes in immigrants of other cultures and countries, and as the country over the past decades has changed to one of having a greatly increased share of minorities, one might think that by now, in the year 2016, at least the country’s flagship media board of directors, especially at the flagship ARD, would reflect the public it serves. But looking at their own boards, we see it is virtually all snow-white.

Of the 8 ARD top board members, see image above, zero are non-white:
The same is true of their other supervisory boards, whose structures I’m not going to get into. Here we see pure vanilla.
Things are not any better at ZDF, the other leading network.
Or at renowned centre-left weekly Der Spiegel.
In the USA any major organization of that scale with such a lack of diversity would have had their pants sued off long ago.
German media far less diversified than GOP
So what could the GOP possibly learn from the ARD on ethnic representation and diversity? Nothing….except for what one should not do. And what excuse does Germany’s media have for employing so few minorities? Silence.
It’s of low human character to go around accusing others of a practice that you yourself are far more guilty of doing, and it is equally deplorable to falsely and deceptively portray the USA’s other major party as intolerant and to imply it is racist. Stunningly there even appears to be 2 members of clergy on the board here.
All white. Perhaps the ARD should rename itself to AFD
The ARD and most of German media are the very last who should be preaching others on ethnic diversity. It’s disgusting and offensive that they are attempting to cast half of the USA’s political spectrum as being tainted with racism when they themselves cannot be bothered to place any minorities on their very own boards.
Moreover, when ones looks at the boards at most major German corporations, the story is much the same. The reality is that corporate Germany, which likes to fancy itself as progressive and hip, is at least 30 years behind the USA or Scandinavia on affirmative action.
Those German institutions and organizations, who seem to like branding others as intolerant, really first need to look at themselves before passing judgement.

Just days ago Kenneth Richard posted on the subject here and showed using published scientific literature that this is likely far from being true.
In recent years, the documented rise in sea levels contributed from glacier and ice sheet melt has not come close to reaching the high levels attained during the 1920s and 1930s period as documented by Gregory et al., 2013.”
Unfortunately Deutsche Welle was sloppy in that they didn’t bother to fact-check, and so as a result they put out overly alarmist information to the public.

Sent: 22 March 2016
Topic: Film “Das große Gletscher-Schmelzen” [The great glacier melt] from 27 February 2016
Dear editorial board,
Concerning the above mentioned broadcast, the film commentary claims beginning at the 1:55 mark: ‘Globally glaciers are losing ice faster than ever before’. That is not correct, as in the past in the Alps there have always been characteristic ice melt phases – the last 1000 years ago during the Medieval Warm Period. 5000 years ago (during the mid-Holocene climate optimum) Glaciers in the Alps were in fact almost completely melted away. The claim made in the film does not meet the latest level scientific knowledge. I also very much wondered as to why you completely left out the crucial paleo-climatological context in the report, thus as a result making the current ice melt appear more threatening than it really is.
I would like to receive your comment on this, which I would like to publish at www.kaltesonne.de.
Yours sincerely
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning

"_Warning: This story contains images some people may find distressing_
**With the Ethiopian government conducting a military offensive in the northern Tigray region, some people have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation online.**
This includes material either not directly related to the conflict or, sometimes, altered to make it look like it is.
Some have been sharing photos they say show an S-400 Russian missile defence system, claiming it is in use in the Tigray region to ward off Ethiopian air attacks.
They also claim a Russian-made flamethrower system is being used.
Accompanying text reads: ""This weapon you see on the picture, even Ethiopia doesn't own it as a country.""
""The Tigrayans have it to protect themselves from air strikes.""
The photos each show a soldier in what appears to be the uniform of Tigray special forces, standing nearby.
But these images have been manipulated, with the soldiers added in.
Their shadows are either pointing in the wrong direction when compared with those from other objects or are too dark.
In one of the photos, the soldier is also out of proportion when compared with the background.
An online image search revealed the photos of the weapons system are from military exercises in the Astrakhan region, in southern Russia.
A Russian-language video of that exercise was posted online in September, showing the system in action.
The S-400 is an advanced Russian surface-to-air missile system, which only a few foreign countries have bought.
And Ethiopia is not one of them.
""Ethiopia has never imported an S-300 series or S-400 series... system and neither have any neighbouring countries,"" says Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), in London.
Hundreds of Facebook users have been sharing a picture purporting to show a downed Ethiopian military plane burning on the ground.
One post says: ""Tigray special forces were attacked from the air.
""They have destroyed one [Ethiopian] fighter jet and killed lots of special-force military (commando).
""The fight is still going on.""
But a reverse image search reveals this picture is not from Ethiopia.
An identical image appears:
Some have been sharing photos from the site where a civilian Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 crashed, killing more than 150 people shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa in March last year.
A misleading Facebook post - now deleted - claimed they showed body bags near the Tigray region, containing the remains of soldiers from the neighbouring Amhara region.
There've been militia forces from Amhara fighting along with Ethiopian government forces.
But other users pointed out correctly that these images were nothing to do with the current fighting in the Tigray region.
A Facebook page which supports the Ethiopian government's operations in Tigray has shared a video which appears to show military action in a mountainous area.
The text for the video says it shows Ethiopian forces attacking fighters from Tigray, and talks about ""victory for our army.""
The post has had 1,000 shares, but the video is not from Ethiopia.
We found this same video on a Twitter handle affiliated to the Ministry of Defence in Armenia.
The Armenian video - showing conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region - was uploaded online on 4 October and pre-dates the start of hostilities in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.
Screenshots of what appears to be a tweet by Ethiopian Health Minister Lia Tadesse have been circulating, mocking her for apparently posting Covid safety instructions to the military during a conflict.
The translation of the supposed tweet reads: ""With social distancing, sanitiser and wearing our masks properly, let all concerned bodies contribute towards the peaceful end of the war.""
But the screenshot is fabricated.
And this tweet does not appear on her actual Twitter timeline.
A look at genuine posts by the minister also shows she posts using an iPhone - and not an Android device as shown in these screenshots.

Our comment primarily concerns the Department of Energy’s (DOE) use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the cost/​benefit analysis of the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Compressors proposed rulemaking. The DOE’s determination of the SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide—two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions. It is also at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses. It is based upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which have little utility because of their great uncertainties. They provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) (whose results were incorporated by the DOE in this action), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnection between climate changes and the SCC value. Further, we show that the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) is not supported by the mainstream climate science.

Guest essay by Mike Jonas
Introduction
This article is the third in a series of four articles.
Part 1 of the series (Part 1) is here
Part 2 of the series (Part 2) is here
In Part 1, simple mathematical formulae were developed to emulate the carbon dioxide (CO2.) contribution to global temperature change, as represented in the computer climate models.
In Part 2, the formulae were used to have a look at the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA).
Part 3 uses the formulae to have a look at the longer term – at the period used to great effect by Al Gore in his film An Inconvenient Truth.
Note : This article does not say anything new, or claim to find any new results. It has all been said many times before. But by using simple formulae that emulate the internal workings of the computer climate models, it allows the CO2 and non-CO2 components of global temperature change to be quantified using a spreadsheet [4] instead of a sophisticated climate model.
Please note : In this article, all temperatures referred to are deg C anomalies unless otherwise stated.
The data
In An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore showed graphs of temperature and CO2 for the last 400,000 years. The data is available from studies of ice cores at Vostok in Antarctica [1] [2], and it looks like this:

Al Gore presented the graphs of temperature and CO2 separately, but the correlation between temperature and CO2 is perhaps easier to see if they are presented in a single graph, as in Figure 1.
There is a well-known connection between temperature and CO2 : as temperature rises, the oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere [3], thus a rising temperature causes rising levels of CO2. The result is clearly visible in Figure 1, with CO2 following some years after the temperature changes.
But what about the connection the other way, ie, CO2 warming the ocean? After referring to this time lag (“CO2 starts to rise about 800 years (600-1000 years) after Antarctic temperature”) RealClimate [3] puts it this way :
<blockquote>All that the lag shows is that CO2 did not cause the first 800 years of warming, out of the 5000 year trend. The other 4200 years of warming could in fact have been caused by CO2, as far as we can tell from this ice core data.
The 4200 years of warming make up about 5/6 of the total warming. So CO2 could have caused the last 5/6 of the warming, but could not have caused the first 1/6 of the warming.</blockquote>
Well, the formulae established in Part 1 can be used to test this idea.
The calculation
Applying the formulae established in Part 1 to the Vostok data gives the following picture of the CO2 and non-CO2 contributions to global temperature :

Before discussing this picture, some caveats are needed:
· The temperature range in Figure 2 is much greater than the temperature range used to establish the formulae. This makes the formulae unreliable over the period in Figure 2, as addressed in the following dot points.
· The basic formulae used, namely
Rcy = 5.35 * ln(Cy/C0) – j * ((T0+Tcy-1)^4 – T0^4)
δTcy = k * Rcy
(see Part 1) make no reference to the ice-free ocean area, but it is implicitly built in.
· As the temperature falls and sea ice area increases, the oceans’ influence on global temperature decreases, so CO2’s influence decreases too. (Extreme example : at 100% sea ice, ECS is zero). This means that CO2’s influence will in practice be less than as shown in Figure 2. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) will be lower at lower temperatures and the time taken to reach equilibrium will be longer.
· Similarly, at higher temperatures than today’s ECS will be higher, but since the average area of sea-ice is currently only a small proportion of the ocean surface (20m in 360m sq km) the increase in ECS would be very small.
· What the factors are that cause these major temperature changes is unimportant. The distinction in Figure 2 is between CO2 and non-CO2. All of the CO2 feedbacks claimed by the IPCC are built into the formulae and are accounted for fully in Figure 2. All the rest of the temperature change is non-CO2 regardless of the actual mechanisms, and regardless of whether those mechanisms are built into the computer climate models.
· At the low temperatures, it is possible that the CO2 feedbacks change too. Whether they increase or decrease is not known, but given that the oceans’ influence is lower at the low temperatures, and given that the feedbacks apply to radiative forcing (not just CO2 radiative forcing) and that non-CO2 radiative forcings must have been operating to produce the low temperatures in the first place, it is reasonable to assume that CO2’s overall contribution, including the feedbacks, is actually lower than as shown in Figure 2.
Now, looking at Figure 2, it is clear that CO2 has little influence on global temperature over this longer timescale. Note also that from about -130,000 to -100,000 CO2’s contribution remains at around its highest level while temperature falls more than 8 degrees. Similarly from about -400,000 to -350,000. In all of the major temperature increases, CO2 contributes no more than about 1/6 of the temperature increase.
In Part 2, there was some room for doubt about whether the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global, and attention was drawn to the accusation that climate scientists had tried to get rid of the MWP. With the very high publicity given to An Inconvenient Truth, and with the high reputation of the Vostok data (at least to the kind of accuracy needed here), it seems unlikely that anyone will attempt to “get rid of” the temperature and CO2 changes in the Vostok data. Even getting rid of the 800-year time lag of CO2 behind temperature would make no noticeable difference to Figure 2.
Conclusion
The picture of global temperature and its drivers as presented by the IPCC and the computer climate models is one in which CO2 has been the dominant factor since the start of the industrial age and other factors have had minimal impact. In order to support this picture, the IPCC has sought to portray CO2 as having been an important driver of global temperature in the past.
The idea that CO2 has been an important driver of global temperature over the last 400,000 years is not supported by the evidence.
The idea that CO2 has been the dominant driver of global temperature over the last 400,000 years is laughable.
Footnote
It is important to recognise that the formulae used here represent the internal workings of the climate models. There is no “climate denial” here, because the whole series of articles is based on the premise that the climate computer models are correct, using the mid-range ECS of 3.2.

 **Terry Dunleavy**



 **“Time for Action”** would be a good slogan for National for the coming election (in contrast to Labour’s talk-a-lot, do-nothing virtue signalling). We can’t start too soon, and this could underline Simon’s potential as a **walk-the-walk, decisive achiever-leader**. He should tackle Ardern head-on! The woke and the lefties will wail, but the news media will lap it all up.



The BFD’s excellent piece _[Will Ihumatao Be Ardern’s Waterloo?](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/will-ihumatao-be-arderns-waterloo/)_ is a good opening.



Simon needs to say: “C’mon Jacinda, put up or shut up! You’ve inserted yourself into the Ihumatao mess. What are you gonna actually DO? If you’re going to sneak money to buy off Fletchers and undermine our system of property law and our historic accepted process for Treaty settlements, stop fiddling, have the guts to say so, and take the consequences.”



I have to say that my personal attitude has been hardened by these comments from one of my Climate Science Coalition colleagues:



“Unfortunately for NZ, the final statement “- the hubris of a tiny cadre whose grand visions and lack of humility far exceed their ability to deliver” also applies perfectly to the ‘neo-liberal/right wing’ cadre of Treasury, Douglas, Caygill, Bassett, de Cleene, Palmer, Trotter, Kerr, Richardson, Birch and Bradford, who applied extreme theories that do not even work in theory.



As a result, the opposite of what was supposed to occur happened:



Debt did not go down, it ballooned;



Many of the most significant costs to homes and businesses soared;



The (true) skill base was devastated;



The bureaucracy at both central and local government level ballooned; and



Internal efficiency declined, and overall international competitiveness declined.



The reason that the public demanded that MMP (which is not popular with many members of this executive) be introduced was that for several elections, the public were promised one agenda at election time, and then were subjected to a completely different agenda (that of the tiny cadre described above, with a complicit moronic media) when elected. Pure fraud, similar to that which John Rofe correctly accuses Comrade Ardern of.”



I think Simon has to stop worrying about inevitable retorts from the woke and the left about why we didn’t address these issues during our nine years of National-led Government. I think Simon’s reply to that has to be along the lines of: “That’s history. That was then and this is now. National is under new leadership with a new and decisive reaction to the non-delivery by this current Coalition which is dragging New Zealand backwards. We won’t just talk about problems, we’ll fix them; we’ll put the country right” [my pun fully intended!].



Another issue Simon should attack – from another mate in North Shore about what’s happening in Auckland:



Have you heard about the Government’s ‘Urban Development Agency’? Not surprising if you haven’t. The Government seems to want to push it through Parliament under cover of Christmas and summer holidays. The Government introduced it into the House as late as 10th December. Submissions close on 14th February.



It seems the Minister in charge of this is **Mr Phil Twyford**. who previously made many fine speeches and claims about solving the housing crisis. This seems to be another such attempt. In my view, the proposed legislation might make even a totalitarian government blush.



Most of us probably believe that our home is our ‘castle.’ Not any more! Your house, your garden, your parks, can all be taken over compulsorily. by this new agency (disguised as Kainga Ora) for ‘large scale developments of intensive housing’ (undefined.)



This new legislation can override many other Acts of importance. It can also override the Unitary Plan, regional plans, reduces the time and grounds for resource consents, takes no account of climate change, or the environment generally.



Do read it and weep – or make a submission. See ‘NZ Parliament – Urban Development Bill.’ 



In the pre-election environment which has just begun, and will intensify when Parliament resumes next week, “Time for Action” begins with taking the gloves off and starting well-aimed and clear counter-punches at the virtue-signalling CoL. As for Winston: simply ignore him!



Kia kaha!

I’ve spent the Christmas/New Year period listening to podcasts and looking to see some parallels between the recent UK election and New Zealand politics.



The video posted above is a great example of where Labour went wrong.



Basically Labour didn’t listen to what was obvious as the problems voters were seeing and experiencing. Consequently, they provided solutions to problems most people don’t rate as important.



The major point is that people’s values are being ignored all for the sake of diversity and the minority. A strong leader in the National Party would pick up on this and run with it. A sensible caucus would recognise that too. The pity is that they currently don’t and it seems that their plan is to be as much like Labour as possible.



Politics is about action and reactions. Sitting in the middle afraid to ever upset anyone is a recipe for a long term in opposition.



Politicians need to realise that the **shouty types on Twitter and Facebook** **are not the majority** of the population **.** The left-wing is susceptible to listening to them, but National is falling for the trap too. They set up a troll army to hound the left-wing on Twitter. It is controlled and operated by Todd McClay and his right-hand man outside of parliament. They are very vocal and are actually operating in the same way as the nasties from the left on Twitter.



Labour in the UK had their Twitter proxies, celebrities and pundits all leaping around the country lobbying and hectoring. One prominent exponent was Owen Jones who has a record of being wrong almost as bad as Martyn Bradbury. Just a few short weeks after the massive loss, Owen Jones is still talking up a storm of doom and gloom. It’s nice to think we will have another five years of lefty moaning. I am in favour of him campaigning, even more, as he reminds everyone why they hate the whinging left.



  
[Chris Trotter posted](https://bowalleyroad.blogspot.com/2019/12/if-you-want-to-know-why-clinton-and.html) this video at Bowalley Road that also explains brilliantly why the candidates and parties of the Left keep on losing to the Right.



What both of these videos also highlight for me is how much our NZ version of the MMP electoral system gets in the way of resolving voter’s needs, wants and desires. The mere fact that losing parties can end up ‘winning’ through coalition negates the will of the primary party. The refrain of pro-MMP activists was to look at two elections that badly showed that the majority will of the people was thwarted by FPP. Those elections were [1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_New_Zealand_general_election) and [1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_New_Zealand_general_election). Both of those elections saw National win despite scoring less votes. Now we have had 2017 and the leading party left out of government. This has caused resentment and as such it creates a situation in NZ not dis-similar to the Brexit situation, where **people feel disenfranchised and powerless.**



The problem for National, of course, is that they lack partners that they previously relied upon to govern. It is simply a pipe dream to believe that Simon Bridges will achieve that which failed John Key, a majority government. John Key always enjoyed a net positive popularity rating, Simon Bridges is yet to even get a zero score, mired in deeply negative territory. Only Jim Bolger has managed to surmount that, in 1990, and under FPP. **Those conditions simply cannot occur under MMP** , and they certainly won’t occur with an unpopular leader.



So, in summary, the conditions for a backlash exist, but our system prevents truly wonky results. National needs to get smart, let Labour pander to intersectionality and inclusiveness along with the climate change fraud, and **create a real point of difference for voters.** More of the same just ensures there is no compelling reason for the middle to swap sides from Labour.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIncredible String of Failures by Rahmstorf Continues: New Study Finds no Robust Relationship Between Shrinking Sea Ice and European Cold Waves
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Photo above: by NASA (public domain)
It was some three years ago when Potsdam climate scientist Srtefan Rahmstorf railed against the German DWD National Weather Service at his Klimalounge site. The DWD indeed had dared to contradict Rahmstorf. The issue was about the relationship between Arctic sea ice extent and cold winter weather in Europe. Rahmstorf’s simple model: less Arctic sea ice [from global warming] causes cold European winters.
To back this up, he listed studies and claimed:
In my view, the above studies provide strong evidence for a link between Arctic ice loss due to global warming, more frequent winter high pressure, especially over the Atlantic-European part of the Arctic, and an associated influx of cold air to Europe. As we have often seen in recent winters – for example in a spectacular way in the first half of February 2012.”
Here Rahmstorf made wild assertions and dished out loads of harsh criticism, calling the DWD “embarrassing”, and incompetent with questions concerning climate change, and claiming that it couldn’t even read scientific publications, and that it had made a trivial argument”. That’s an unusually aggressive manner of discussion one seldom sees in science. Rahmstorf tone:
However, the taz quoted [German paper] yesterday the spokesman of the German Weather Service [DWD in German] as saying that if there was a direct relationship with the sea ice cover,  the entire winter would have to be very cold in Germany. I think this trivial argument with which he would like to wipe from the table the climate research results shown above  is pretty embarrassing for the DWD.  Of course open water in the Arctic  does not prevent stochastic weather variability.  There will always be warm and cold periods. In all these studies it comes down to changing probabilities in the prevailing weather patterns: Petoukhov and Semenov estimate that the probability of cold winter extremes could triple, that is even in the Abstract. One wonders whether the DWD representative has read the relevant studies at all – and if not, why he feels the urge to comment on them in the media. Unfortunately, it has a certain tradition that meteorologists dealing with weather, are not familiar with climate science.”
It’s now been three years since Rahmstorf’s outburst. In the meantime research has since looked at the subject professionally and is now able to present the first robust results. On 11 August 2016 a group of scientists led by Hans Chen of Pennsylvania State University presented a paper in the Journal of Climate that will cause some sleepless nights for Stefan Rahmstorf.
Rahmstorf was not even close
The bitter findings: Rahmstorf was not even in the ballpark. He unjustifiably mistreated the DWD. The truth is, according to Chen et al. 2016, there is no robust relationship between Arctic sea ice and the weather at the middle latitudes.
Here are some excerpts of the study:



<!--

These results show that the linear relationship between Arctic  sea-ice loss and mid-latitude weather patterns is weak, suggesting that the remote atmospheric  response is small compared with the internal variability, or highly nonlinear with respect to the  sea-ice area anomalies.”
And:
Thus, our results do not show evidence of an unusually elongated jet stream associated with  Arctic sea-ice loss on a monthly time scale.”
And:
We have shown using several different metrics that the remote atmospheric response can be non-robust due to internal dynamics alone,  and leave diagnosis of mechanisms behind this non-robustness for future studies.”
In anutshell: Cold weathers are weather.
Rahmstorf’s attempt to “anthropogenize” winter weather failed big-time. Yet it does reveal a hasty attempt to “climatize” some cold winters. Solid science would never need to stoop to such cheap publicity gags.
What follows is the abstract of the new study by Chen et al. 2016:
The robustness of mid-latitude weather pattern changes due to Arctic sea-ice loss
The significance and robustness of the link between Arctic sea-ice loss and changes in mid-latitude weather patterns is investigated through a series of model simulations in Community Atmosphere Model 5.3 with systematically perturbed sea-ice cover in the Arctic. Using a large ensemble of ten sea-ice scenarios and 550 simulations, it is found that prescribed Arctic sea-ice anomalies produce statistically significant changes for certain metrics of the mid-latitude circulation but not for others. Furthermore, the significant mid-latitude circulation changes do not scale linearly with the sea-ice anomalies, and are not present in all scenarios, indicating that the remote atmospheric response to reduced Arctic sea ice can be statistically significant under certain conditions, but is generally non-robust. Shifts in the Northern Hemisphere polar jet stream and changes in the meridional extent of upper-level large-scale waves due to the sea ice perturbations are generally small and not clearly distinguished from intrinsic variability. Reduced Arctic sea ice may favor a circulation pattern that resembles the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, and may increase the risk of cold outbreaks in eastern Asia by almost 50 %, but this response is found in only half of the scenarios with negative sea-ice anomalies. In eastern North America the frequency of extreme cold events decreases almost linearly with decreasing sea-ice cover. Our finding of frequent significant anomalies without a robust linear response suggests interactions between variability and persistence in the coupled system, which may contribute to the lack of convergence among studies of Arctic influences on mid-latitude circulation.”
And how did the German media react to this important publication? Four years ago they reported on Rahmtorf’s visions of cold waves extensively (Zeit, Welt). Today there is silence. Not a single major daily took up the story. Obviously the media did not want to embarrass itself. It is yet another example for our category “Schweigen im Walde” (“inconvenient scientific results that do not get reported on by the German language press or media because its does not fit the solidly established climate alarmism storyline in German journalism.

A couple of days ago we ran a piece at WUWT: Did We Really Save the Ozone Layer? In light of this press release, the question is worth pondering again.
From the NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
Annual Antarctic ozone hole larger and formed later in 2015

The 2015 Antarctic ozone hole area was larger and formed later than in recent years, said scientists from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
On Oct. 2, 2015, the ozone hole expanded to its peak of 28.2 million square kilometers (10.9 million square miles), an area larger than the continent of North America. Throughout October, the hole remained large and set many area daily records. Unusually cold temperature and weak dynamics in the Antarctic stratosphere this year resulted in this larger ozone hole. In comparison, last year the ozone hole peaked at 24.1 million square kilometers (9.3 million square miles) on Sept. 11, 2014. Compared to the 1991-2014 period, the 2015 ozone hole average area was the fourth largest.
“While the current ozone hole is larger than in recent years, the area occupied by this year’s hole is consistent with our understanding of ozone depletion chemistry and consistent with colder than average weather conditions in Earth’s stratosphere, which help drive ozone depletion,” said Paul A. Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
The ozone hole is a severe depletion of the ozone layer above Antarctica that was first detected in the 1980s. The Antarctic ozone hole forms and expands during the Southern Hemisphere spring (August and September) because of the high levels of chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere. These chlorine- and bromine-containing molecules are largely derived from man-made chemicals that steadily increased in Earth’s atmosphere up through the early 1990s.
“This year, our balloon-borne instruments measured nearly 100 percent ozone depletion in the layer above South Pole Station, Antarctica, that was 14 to 19 kilometers (9 to 12 miles) above Earth’s surface,” said Bryan Johnson, a researcher at NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. “During September we typically see a rapid ozone decline, ending with about 95 percent depletion in that layer by October 1. This year the depletion held on an extra two weeks resulting in nearly 100 percent depletion by October 15.”
The ozone layer helps shield Earth from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and suppress immune systems, as well as damage plants. The large size of this year’s ozone hole will likely result in increases of harmful ultraviolet rays at Earth’s surface, particularly in Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere in the coming months.
Ozone depletion is primarily caused by man-made compounds that release chlorine and bromine gases in the stratosphere. Beginning in 1987, the internationally agreed-upon Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer has regulated these ozone-depleting compounds, such as chlorine-containing chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerants and bromine-containing halon gases used as fire suppressants. Because of the Protocol, atmospheric levels of these ozone depleting compounds are slowly declining. The ozone hole is expected to recover back to 1980 levels in approximately 2070.
This year, scientists recorded the minimum thickness of the ozone layer at 101 Dobson units on October 4, 2015, as compared to 250-350 Dobson units during the 1960s, before the Antarctic ozone hole occurred. Dobson units are a measure of the overhead amount of atmospheric ozone.
The satellite ozone data come from the Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA’s Aura satellite, launched in 2004, and the Ozone Monitoring and Profiler Suite instrument on the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, launched in 2011. NOAA scientists at the South Pole station monitor the ozone layer above that location by using a Dobson spectrophotometer and regular ozone-sonde balloon launches that record the thickness of the ozone layer and its vertical distribution. Chlorine amounts are estimated using NOAA and NASA ground measurements and observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard NASA’s Aura satellite. These satellites continue a data record dating back to the early 1970s.

"A response to the Green Paper on Climate Change – a comment by Viv Forbes, Chairman of the Carbon Sense Coalition. 16 July 2008
The Climate will fluctuate.
It always has, it always will.
Get used to it.
The Government Green Paper completely ignores the main question – should Canberra try to control the weather, or is it better to foster a strong Australia able to cope with whatever climate change brings us?
The Government also justifies the need for action on completely worthless long term forecasts of Australia’s weather.

Not even the IPCC claims an ability to forecast the weather beyond a few days, but the CSIRO has sullied its reputation by pretending they can project temperature and rainfall 30 years into the future. Why have they not revealed the calculations for these predictions? In the corporate world, anyone making such wild unsubstantiated claims would be quickly disciplined by the regulators. Public figures who repeat and embellish these scaremongering prophecies lack common sense and should also be called to account.
The only credible weather forecast for such a long period is “It will Fluctuate”.
Minister Wong obviously believes that if we give her enough powers to tax and regulate, she can change the world’s weather.
This belief is as silly as the CSIRO weather forecasts out to 2040. Man has never been able to control the weather and there is no credible evidence that his activities have caused unusual weather. In fact, despite all the hot air about carbon emissions, the world has not warmed since 1998 and has been cooling for the last 6 years. Moreover, we have had extreme droughts, floods, ice ages and global warming long before man started using coal and oil.
Minister Wong should make sure Australia has the industrial ability and economic strength to cope with any adverse weather that occurs, be it floods, fires, droughts, snow, heat, cyclones or tsunamis.
Poor people cannot cope with Climate Change and the Rudd/Garnaut/Wong carbon taxes will make every Australian poorer.
This Deep Green Paper should be recycled and replaced by an enlightened White Paper outlining how to make Australia strong and prosperous. This will provide the best insurance for our children against any climate change.

This post responds to the last of Conor Clarke’s comments on my study, “What to Do About Global Warming,” published by Cato. This series started with the imaginatively titled, Response to Conor Clarke Part I, and continued with Cherry Picking Climate Catastrophes and Do Industrialized Countries Have a Responsibility for the Well-Being of Developing Nations?   
  
CONOR said:   
  
**I think Goklany is a bit picky and choosey with the evidence.** ... I also _like_ the Goklany paper a lot. [THANK YOU!! I'll take whatever I get.] But in this case it's hard to resist. [ **Emphasis in original**.]   
  
To take one example (of several), Goklany's hunger estimates rely heavily on those published by _Global Environmental Change_ (GEC), which he uses to make the argument that ""the world will be better off in 2085 with respect to hunger than it was in 1990 despite any increase in population."" But the GEC produced two estimates of hunger and climate change -- one that assumes the benefits of CO2 fertilization and one that does not. Goklany picks the former estimate (I have no idea why), despite the fact the GEC says the effects of climate change ""will fall somewhere between"" the two. … [I}f you embrace _anything_ other than the most Pollyanish CO2 fertilization estimate -- the one that Goklany uses in his Cato paper -- we will be living in a world in which climate change puts tens of millions of additional people at risk of starvation by 2085.   
  
My RESPONSE:   
  
First, let me elaborate on my selection of the set of studies that I used in my paper. Essentially, the selected set of studies (published in _Global Environmental Change_ ) was the only one that had estimated **global** impacts using detailed process models in conjunction with the IPCC’s latest scenarios, and were peer reviewed. Moreover, they come with a provenance that people who may be unhappy with my results cannot impugn. [This is important only because many people arguing about global warming seem to be more concerned about who did the study and whether the results bolster their predilections, than how the study was done.] Specifically, virtually all the authors were intimately connected with the IPCC. The senior author of the hunger study was also the co-chairman of the IPCC’s Work Group II, which was responsible for compiling the portion of the IPCC’s latest assessment that dealt with impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. The authors of the water resource and coastal flooding studies were the lead authors of corresponding chapters in that IPCC report. An earlier version of the same set of impact studies was the basis for the claim by Sir David King, erstwhile science advisor to Her Majesty’s Government, that global warming was a more serious threat than terrorism (see here). The Stern Review also drew quite heavily from these studies (see below).   




Let’s now turn to Conor’s comments on the hunger study and why I assumed that the benefits of carbon fertilization would be realized in the future. Indeed, the hunger study (Parry et al.) produced two separate estimates — one assuming that carbon fertilization is a reality, and the other assuming zero carbon fertilization. But the two estimates are not equally likely. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of experimental studies that show carbon fertilization is a reality (see also here), that higher CO2 not only increases the rate of photosynthesis, but also increases the efficiency of water use by plants (i.e., it confers a degree of immunity to drought), among the many other benefits CO2 bestows on plants and other carbon based life, including all creatures – big and small -- in the biosphere that depend directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. The probability that direct CO2 effects on crop growth are zero or negative is virtually non-existent (IPCC, 2001b: 254–256). Second, the positive effect of carbon fertilization was based on the **average** of experimental studies; it’s not an upper bound estimate. On the other hand, the notion of “zero fertilization” is an assumption not supported by the vast majority of empirical data. So averaging results from the two estimates makes no sense and would understate the average benefits that would likely result from carbon fertilization.   
  
Notably, the Stern Review, invoked a study by Long et al. (subscription required) to estimate future levels of hunger based on “zero fertilization” using precisely the same study (Parry et al.) that I -- and Conor, in his comments -- used. But Long et al.’s results have been disputed by other scientists (also see here), including some contributors to the IPCC’s assessment. More importantly, Long et al. only suggested that under field conditions, carbon fertilization may be a third to less than half of what is indicated by experiments using growth chambers, not that it would be zero. It also noted that fertilization may be stronger under drought conditions or if sufficient nitrogen is employed. But drought is one of the bogeymen of global warming, and increased use of nitrogen is precisely the kind of adaptation that would become more affordable in the future as countries become wealthier, as they should if the IPCC’s scenarios are to be given any credence. Indeed, that is one of the adaptations allowed in Parry et al. Also, the fact that crop yields are higher in richer countries is partly because they can more easily afford nitrogen fertilizers (see here, p. 78). In fact, China’s nitrogen use per hectare is already among the world’s highest. For all these reasons, even if one accepts the Long et al. study as gospel, it is reasonable to assume that the effect of carbon fertilization will be closer to the “higher” estimate from the Parry et al. study than to the “zero fertilization” case.   
  
But, more importantly, the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the CO2 fertilization effect is most likely swamped by a major source of overestimation of hunger in Parry et al.’s estimates.   
  
Although Parry et al. allows for some secular (time-dependent) increases in agricultural productivity, increases in crop yield with economic growth due to greater application of fertilizer and irrigation in richer countries, decreases in hunger due to economic growth, and for some adaptive responses at the farm level to deal with global warming, Parry et al. itself acknowledged that these adaptive responses are based on the “current range” of available technologies, not on technologies that would be available in the future or any technologies developed to specifically cope with the negative impacts of global warming (Parry et al., p. 57). The potential for future technologies to cope with global warming is large, especially if one considers bioengineered crops (see here, chapter 9), which Parry et al. admittedly didn’t consider. Moreover, an examination of the sources cited in Parry et al. indicates that the “current range” of technology is actually based on 1990s or earlier technology. That is, it is not quite current.   
  
The approach used in Parry et al. to estimate the impacts of global warming decades from now is, in essence, tantamount to estimating today’s level of hunger (and agricultural production) based on the technology of 50 years ago. In fact, the major reason why Paul Ehrlich’s _Population Bomb_ turned out to be a dud was that it underestimated or ignored future developments in agricultural technology.   
  
As noted in Part I of this series of responses, ignoring technological change can, over decades, lead to overestimating adverse impacts by orders of magnitude. Notably, due to a combination of technological change and increasing affluence, U.S. death rates due to various water related diseases – dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid, other gastrointestinal disease, and malaria – declined by 99%–100% from 1900 to 1970. For the same reasons, during the twentieth century, global death rates from extreme weather events declined by over 95%.   
  
This basic methodological shortcoming, however, is not unique to Parry et al. It is common to ALL global warming impact studies that I have read – and I have read plenty of them.   
  
For all these reasons, the adverse impacts of global warming for hunger (as well as other aspects of human well-being, e.g., due to malaria and coastal flooding) that I used in my paper are, more likely than not, substantially overestimated. And by the same token, ignoring technological change (and not fully accounting for increases in wealth) also assures that the positive impacts of global warming are likely to be underestimated, further overestimating the net negative impacts of global warming.   
  
Therefore, far from being Pollyanish, the estimates used in my paper most likely substantially exaggerate the net negative impacts of global warming. Despite that, those estimates cannot justify emissions cuts that go beyond no-regret actions at this time or through the foreseeable future.

There are strident calls for the reduction and elimination of carbon dioxide (CO2)

emissions of CO2 will reduce global warming.
The basis of the scientific method is that a series of observations are made, a
hypothesis is drawn up to explain the observations, then a series of tests are made to
see if the hypothesis holds under all circumstances. If test results indicate the
hypothesis is flawed, then the hypothesis must be altered to fit ALL data.
The following data DO NOT FIT the assumption that human activities result in global
warming. It follows then that the assumption that anthropogenic CO2 causes global

"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   There was once a nice sea view at the Al Jazira beach club, and umbrellas of palm fronds sticking from the sand are reminders of nicer days. Nowadays, the place is surrounded by an   garbage dump. “It used to be a beach,” said Hassan, a Syrian man who works as a caretaker at the club and insisted on being identified only by his first name because of a lawsuit concerning the landfill. “There was sea. There were rocks. I used to fish. ” Just up the shoreline, Mohammed Jradi, who has been fishing the waters of the Mediterranean off Beirut for 20 years, said the trash had driven even the fish away. “All over the world, they have solutions for this, but not here,” he said. There is no end, it seems, to Lebanon’s trash crisis, a potent symbol of the dysfunctional,   politics that define this tiny country  —   just half the size of Vermont, the journalist and historian David Hirst has noted. When trash piles built up across this city two years ago, enveloping Beirut in a nasty stench, they spawned a protest movement, called “You Stink,” against the political class. Now, the latest episode of the crisis has become a uniquely Lebanese story, entwining bird migration, civil aviation, mysterious gunmen and the long story of Lebanon’s struggle to become a functioning state that can at least take care of its trash, more than 25 years after emerging from a long civil war. Last year, as a   solution to the garbage crisis, the municipality opened the Costa Brava landfill here on the shoreline, not far from Beirut’s Rafic Hariri International Airport. And so for many visitors to Beirut, a city whose   architecture, great cuisine and French colonial influences are otherwise enchanting, the first thing to greet them was a strong whiff of garbage. The landfill also attracted birds  —   lots of them  —   not just the sea gulls that normally fly around the coast, but others on migratory patterns from Europe and North Africa. “In other words,” wrote one local blogger, “a giant free Lebanese restaurant for birds. ” More seriously, this posed a problem to civil aviation. When an airliner with Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines hit a bird this month  —   an episode that recalled Capt. Chesley Sullenberger’s crash landing in the Hudson River eight years ago after hitting a flock of birds  —   Lebanon’s trash problem suddenly became a matter of aviation safety. Almost immediately, gunmen showed up on the coast line, apparently deployed by the government to shoot the birds out of the sky, raising the ire of environmental activists, not to mention the fishermen. “I used to see sea gulls everywhere,” Mr. Jradi said. “But today there are none. They were shot down. ” He added: “Of course, I am missing them. They were entertainment for us. For me, it was an entertaining scene, watching them fly. ” Activists have said that the killing of the birds was in violation of the Barcelona Convention, which aims to protect wildlife in coastal regions of the Mediterranean, and that the government could have found other solutions, like using tranquilizer guns on the birds. “Lebanon is an important bird area,” said Paul Abi Rached, a prominent Lebanese environmental activist, noting that millions of birds from Europe and North Africa pass through Lebanon each year on migratory patterns. “So what you are killing are not Lebanese birds,” he said. “They are the birds of Europe. That is the catastrophe. ” The chairman of Middle East Airlines, Lebanon’s national carrier, told an interviewer with the TV channel MTV this month that the safety of airline passengers was more important than the lives of birds, saying that the hunters would continue their work as needed. The garbage problem has long been a symbol of a failure of Lebanese politics, one that activists say has its roots in the time shortly after the country’s civil war, which ended in 1990. Soon after the war ended, the government set up a trash collection company, called Sukleen, that was connected to political parties and over the years became a vehicle for corruption, say activists. This thwarted the possibility of other solutions, like recycling, and in a country as small as Lebanon it has been hard to find enough space for landfills. “Lebanon is a very densely populated place,” said Habib Battah, the founder of the news website Beirut Report, who has written about the Costa Brava landfill. “Other countries have big, open spaces, but we don’t have that. ” He said that in the long term, recycling was the answer, because when trying to find new places for trash dumps, “wherever you go in Lebanon there is a village nearby. ” Mr. Battah said the problems with garbage went back to the decision at the end of the war to privatize trash collection. He said that Lebanon offered a lesson to other postwar societies on the dangers of rushing into privatization too fast, and that he often wished he could bring   libertarians to Lebanon for a field trip to see what can happen in the absence of strong government regulations. “Basically, when you do that, people in power get richer,” he said. Public services across the board, not just trash collection, have long suffered in Lebanon, he said, forcing political leaders to confront a difficult question: “What do you fix first? The water? The garbage? The internet?”"

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
We’ve put together an interesting collection of articles this week for your consideration.   
  
First up is a shout out to lukewarming from Bloomberg View columnist Megan McArdle. In her piece “Global Warming Alarmists, You’re Doing It Wrong,” McArdle suggests that lukewarmers have a lot to bring to the climate change table, but are turned away by the entrenched establishment and tarred with labels like climate “denier”—a label which couldn’t be further from the truth. McArdle writes:   




Naturally, proponents of climate-change models have welcomed the lukewarmists' constructive input by carefully considering their points and by advancing counterarguments firmly couched in the scientific method.   
  
No, of course I’m just kidding. The reaction to these mild assertions is often to brand the lukewarmists “deniers” and treat them as if what they were saying was morally and logically equivalent to suggesting that the Holocaust never happened.



In her article, McArdle calls for less name calling and less heel digging and more open, constructive discussion:   




There is a huge range of possible beliefs that go into assessing the various complicated theories about how the climate works, and the global-warming predictions generated by those theories range from “could well be catastrophic” to “probably not a big deal.” I know very smart, well-informed, decent people who fall at either end of the spectrum, and others who are somewhere in between. Then there are folks like me who aren’t sure enough to make a prediction, but are very sure we wouldn’t like to find out, too late, that the answer is “oops, catastrophic.”   
  
These are not differences that can be resolved by name calling. Nor has the presumed object of this name calling -- to delegitimize thoughtful opposition, and thereby increase the consensus in favor of desired policy proposals -- been a notable political success, at least in the U.S. It has certainly rallied the tribe, and produced a lot of patronizing talk about science by people who aren’t actually all that familiar with the underlying scientific questions. Other than that, we remain pretty much where we were 25 years ago: holding summits, followed by the dismayed realization that we haven’t, you know, really done all that much except burn a lot of hydrocarbons flying people to summits. Maybe last year's Paris talks will turn out to be the actual moment when things started to change -- but having spent the last 15 years as a reporter listening to people tell me that no, really, we’re about to turn the corner, I retain a bit of skepticism.



How was this bit of advice from McArdle received by some of the loudest name-callers? Not well, as she describes in this follow-up:



In response, climate scientist Michael Mann tweeted this:   






Then he blocked me. You will correctly infer that I was also inundated with other interlocutors on social media and e-mail. Many of them were respectful. Others were … less so. At worst, they suggested, I was a paid shill for fossil fuel interests. (Not so. I accept no pay from anyone other than Bloomberg.) At best, they said, I was a fool who was giving aid and comfort to the enemy. My editor was thusly chided for the column: “shame on you for publishing it, especially if you have children.”



This should come as a big surprise to no one.   
  
Next, we point you to Judith Curry’s (herself no stranger to treatment like McArdle's, and worse) excellent blog post in which she provides a 21st-century update to Michael Polanyi’s 1962 essay titled “The Republic of Science: Its Political and Economic Theory.” Curry delivers an introduction to his work (“Polanyi provides an interesting perspective from the mid 20th century, as the U.S. and Europe were contemplating massive public investments in science. Polanyi’s perspective was colored by his early years in Hungary, which led him to oppose central planning in the sciences.”) and excerpts from Polanyi’s work and then follows with an offering of comments as to how Polanyi’s perspective stands up some half a century later. For instance [embedded links in original]:   




Polanyi’s analogy of the scientific process with markets captures the pure incentives that drive scientists – search of truth, intellectual satisfaction and individual ego. What happens when the externalities of the Republic of Science produce perverse incentives, and careerism becomes a dominant incentive that requires publishing a lot of papers rapidly and producing headline-worthy results (who even cares if these papers don’t survive scrutiny beyond their press release)? (see What is the measure of scientific success?) What happens is that you get increasing incidence of scientific fraud (see Science: in the doghouse?), cherry picking and meaningless papers on headline grabbing topics that don’t stand up to the test of time (see Trust and don’t bother to verify).   
  
And what happens when the ‘hand’ guiding science isn’t ‘invisible’, i.e. science is driven by politics, such as a political imperative to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy? Federal funding can bias science, particularly in terms of selecting which scientific problems receive attention (link).   
  
And what of Polanyi’s statement: “ _Such self-coordination of independent initiatives leads to a joint result which is unpremeditated by any of those who bring it about.”_ The ‘result’ of dangerous anthropogenic climate change and the harms of dietary fat were hardly unpremeditated.



We also have our own humble opinion on Polanyi, and how he influenced Thomas Kuhn, who, as a result of Polanyi’s view, noted that the intellectual market may not be all that fluid. From “Lukewarming: The New Climate Science that Changes Everything”:   




…Polanyi…recognized the horrors of government intervention in science and the pernicious influence of central planning. He argued that science should be considered a free market with spontaneous order a perspective akin to [a list of libertarian economist luminaries]. Thomas Kuhn, a physicist and philosopher who attended several of Polanyi’s lectures, went him one better and argued in his classic _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ that order created paradigms, or encompassing philosophical strucures, that lie at the core of science. 



We went on to demonstrate that paradigms must become even more entrenched when the government becomes the monopoly provider of funding for science with political and policy consequences.   
  
Curry offers up these suggestions as to how to improve on the current sad state of scientific affairs [again, links in original]:   




So, what should the Republic of Science look like in the 21st century? The overwhelming issue for the health of science is to reassert the importance of intellectual and political diversity in science, and to respect and even nurture scientific mavericks. The tension between pure (curiosity driven) science and use-inspired and applied science [see Pasteur’s quadrant] needs to be resolved in a way that supports all three, with appropriate roles for universities, government and the private sector. And finally, the reward structure for university scientists need to change to reward more meaningful science that stands the test of time, versus counting papers and press releases, which may not survive even superficial scrutiny even after being published in prestigious journals that are more interested in impact than in rigorous methods and appropriate conclusions.   
  
Failure to give serious thought to these issues risks losing the public trust and support for elite university science (at least in certain fields). Scientists are becoming their own worst enemy when they play into the hands of politicians and others seeking to politicize their science.



We urge you to read the whole thing. As always, Curry is insightful, interesting, informative, and right on target.   
  
And finally, we suggest that you ought to have a look at Julie Kelly’s “The EPA vs. Science” in _National Review_. In this article, Kelly looks at recent developments in the long-running controversy surrounding the use of the herbicide glyphosate (i.e., Roundup) and EPA’s recent released and then withdrawn report on glyphosate’s health effects. Here’s a teaser:   




On April 29, the EPA posted a report concluding that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide and other products) is “not likely to be carcinogenic.” The committee found no relationship between glyphosate exposure and a number of cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. The 86-page assessment was signed by the EPA’s cancer review committee back in October 2015 and marked “final.”   
  
_But the EPA took it down on May 2, claiming the documents were “inadvertently” posted and only a preliminary report. “EPA has not completed our cancer review. We will look at the work of other governments. . . . our assessment will be peer reviewed and completed by end of 2016,” said an EPA spokeswoman.  
_



Kelly notes “GMO foes are now targeting glyphosate in their ongoing campaign against genetically engineered crops” and “[a]ctivists are also using the court system to punish companies that use glyphosate” and adds “[i]t seems that the EPA may be taking some cues from these anti-GMO activists.”   
  
House Science Committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) is looking into what prompted the rather unusual move by the EPA. According to Kelly:   




Chairman Smith also senses that EPA foot-dragging might be based more on politics than on science: “That the EPA would remove a report, which was marked as a ‘Final Report’ and signed by thirteen scientists, appears to be yet another example of this agency’s attempt to allow politics rather than science [to] drive its decision making. Sound, transparent science should always be the basis for EPA’s decisions.”



Kelly smartly concludes:   




If the science indeed shows (again) that glyphosate does not cause cancer, the anti-pesticide Center for Biological Diversity says it will be a “major roadblock” for the anti-GMO movement, which wants to ban genetically engineered crops worldwide. It will be a blow the anti-GMO movement richly deserves.

In a way, everything is technology,” noted one of the world’s greatest economic historians, Fernand Braudel, in his monumental study _Civilization and_ _Capitalism_. “Not only man’s most strenuous endeavors but also his patient and monotonous efforts to make a mark on the external world; not only the rapid changes … but also the slow improvements in processes and tools, and those innumerable actions which may have no immediate innovating significance but which are the fruit of accumulated knowledge,” he continued. Yes, land, labor, and capital (that’s to say, the factors of production) are important components of economic growth. In the end, however, human progress in general and global enrichment in particular are largely dependent on invention and innovation. That is surely even clearer now that humanity’s hopes for the end of the pandemic and for our liberation from the accompanying lockdown rest on further scientific breakthroughs within the pharmaceutical industry. Let’s take a brief look at the impact of technology on health care, food supply, work, and sociality in the time of COVID-19.



 **HEALTH CARE**  
The impact of modern technology is surely most keenly felt and anticipated within the sphere of human health care. Consider some of the worst diseases that humanity has had to face in the past. Smallpox, which is thought to have killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone, originated in either India or Egypt at least 3,000 years ago. Smallpox variolation, it seems, was practiced in China in the tenth century, but it was not until the late 18th century that Edward Jenner vaccinated his first patient against the disease. Smallpox was fully eradicated only in 1980. Similar stories could be told about other killer diseases. Polio, which can be seen depicted in Egyptian carvings from the 18th dynasty, is of ancient origin. Yet the disease wasn’t properly analyzed until the year of the French Revolution, with Jonas Salk’s vaccine appearing only in 1955. Today, polio is close to being eradicated (just 95 cases were reported in 2019).



Malaria, probably humanity’s greatest foe, is at least 30 million years old (the parasite has been found in an amber‐​encased mosquito from the Paleogene period). It was only after the discovery of the New World that knowledge about the fever‐​reducing benefits of the bark of the cinchona tree spread to Europe and Asia. Quinine was first isolated in 1820, and chloroquine was introduced in 1946. Artemisinin drugs, which we still use, were discovered in the late 1970s. That’s to say that humanity lived with deadly diseases for millennia without fully knowing what they were, how they were transmitted, and how they could be cured. The fate of humanity, our ancestors thought, fluctuated under the extraneous influence of the “wheel of fortune” and there was nothing that anyone could do about it. One day you were alive and next day you were not.



Let’s take a brief look at the impact of technology on health care, food supply, work, and sociality in the time of COVID-19. 



Contrast that glacial pace of progress, and the fatalistic acceptance of disease and death, with our response time to the current pandemic. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported the existence of a cluster of cases of “pneumonia” in Wuhan on December 31. On January 7 the Chinese identified the pathogen (novel coronavirus) responsible for the outbreak. On January 11 China sequenced the genetic code of the virus, and the next day it was publicly available. That enabled the rest of the world to start making diagnostic kits to identify the disease. To take one example, the first COVID-19 infection in South Korea was identified on January 20. On February 4, the first test kit (made by Kogene Biotech) entered production. On February 7, the test kit was available at 50 locations around the country. Other countries followed suit.



The World Health Organization, which declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, may have acted too late. Still, it is noteworthy that just two months expired between the first sign of trouble and the time when the entire world put measures in place to retard the spread of the disease. In the meantime, we have learned a lot about governmental incompetence and regulatory overreach. But we have also learned a great deal about the spread and symptoms of the disease. Instead of starting from scratch, medical specialists in Europe and America can draw on the expertise of their colleagues in the Far East. Before the telegraph appeared midway through the 19th century, it took up to a month for a ship to carry information from London to New York. Today, we learn about the latest COVID-19 news (good and bad) and research in seconds.



By mid April, thousands of highly educated and well‐​funded specialists throughout the world were using supercomputers and artificial intelligence to identify promising paths toward victory over the disease. Some 200 different programs are underway to develop therapies and vaccines to combat the pandemic. They include studies of the effectiveness of existing antiviral drugs, such as Gilead’s Remdesivir, Ono’s protease inhibitor, and Fujifilm’s favipiravir. The effectiveness of generic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, is also being evaluated. Takeda is hard at work on convalescent plasma (TAK-888) in Japan, while Regeneron works on monoclonal antibodies in the United States. New vaccines, such as Moderna’s mRNA‐​1273, Inovio’s INO-4800, and BioNTech’s BNT162, are under development.



We don’t know which of these treatments (if any) will work, but here is what we can be sure of: There has never been a better time for humans to face and defeat a global pandemic. The world is richer than ever before, and money is what enables us to sustain a massive pharmaceutical industry and pay for highly sophisticated medical research and development. Coronavirus may be deadly, but it is not the bubonic plague, which had a mortality rate of 50 percent. Luckily, it is a far milder virus that has reawakened us to the danger posed by communicable diseases. Once the immediate crisis is behind us, researchers will collect billions of data from dozens of countries and analyze the different governmental responses to the pandemic. That knowledge will be deployed by governments and the private sector to ensure that best practices are adopted, so that next time we are better prepared.



 **FOOD**  
When the Black Plague struck Europe in 1347, the disease found the local population ripe for slaughter. Following the close of the Medieval Warm Period at the end of the 13th century, the climate turned cold and rainy. Harvests shrunk and famines proliferated. France, for example, saw localized famines in 1304, 1305, 1310, 1315–17, 1330–34, 1349–51, 1358–60, 1371, 1374–75, and 1390. The Europeans, weakened by shortages of food, succumbed to the disease in great numbers.



The people of yore faced at least three interrelated problems. First, the means of transport and the transportation infrastructure were awful. On land, the Europeans used the same haulage methods (carts pulled by donkeys, horses, and oxen) that the ancients had invented. Similarly, much of Europe continued to use roads built by the Romans. Most people never left their native villages or visited the nearest towns. They had no reason to do so, for all that was necessary to sustain their meager day‐​to‐​day existence was produced locally. The second problem was the lack of important information. It could take weeks to raise the alarm about impending food shortages, let alone organize relief for stricken communities. Third, regional trade was seldom free (France did not have a single internal market until the Revolution) and global trade remained relatively insignificant in economic terms until the second half of the 19th century. Food was both scarce and expensive. In 15th‐​century England, 80 percent of ordinary people’s private expenditure went for food. Of that amount, 20 percent was spent on bread alone. Under those circumstances, a local crop failure could spell the destruction of an entire community. (Those who think that COVID-19 exposed the fragility of modern society should look up the Great Famine.)



By comparison, by 2013 only 10 percent of private expenditure in the United States was spent on food, a figure that is itself inflated by the amount Americans typically spend in restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, while most have been forced to close their doors, the restaurateurs use apps to deliver excellent food at reasonable prices. Moreover, months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the shops are, generally, well stocked and regularly replenished by the largely uninterrupted stream of cargo flights, truck hauling, and commercial shipping. Due to the miracle of mobile refrigeration, fresh produce continues to be sourced from different parts of the United States and abroad. Shortly before writing this piece, I was able to buy oranges from California, avocados from Mexico, and grapes from Chile in my local supermarket. Globalization may be under pressure from both the left and the right of the U.S. political spectrum, but should the pandemic impair U.S. agricultural production, many will be forced to acknowledge the benefits of the global food supply and our ability to import food from COVID‐​19‐​unaffected parts of the world.



This extensive and, at this point, still sturdy supply chain is, of course, a technological marvel. Computers collate information about items on the shelf that are in short supply, adjust the variety and quantity of items shipped between stores, fill new orders, etc. And so, commerce that’s still allowed to go on goes on. So does charity. Feeding America, a network of more than 200 food banks, feeds tens of millions of people through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, etc. Since 2005, the organization has been using a computerized internal market to allocate food more rationally. Feeding America uses its own currency, called “shares,” with which individual food banks can bid on the foods that they need the most. Grocery‐​delivery services bring food to the doorsteps of those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes. The old and the infirm can also use phones, emails, and apps to call upon volunteers to do their shopping and delivery.



 **WORK**  
The nature of work has changed a lot over the last 200 years or so. Before the industrial revolution, between 85 percent and 90 percent of the people in the Western world were farm laborers. Their work was excruciatingly difficult, as witnessed by one 18th‐​century Austrian physician who observed that “in many villages [of the Austrian Empire] the dung has to be carried on human backs up high mountains and the soil has to be scraped in a crouching position; this is the reason why most of the young people are deformed and misshapen.” People lived on the edge of starvation, with both the very young and the very old expected to contribute as much as they could to the economic output of the family (most production in the pre‐​modern era was based on the family unit, hence the Greek term _oikonomia_ , or household management). In those circumstances, sickness was a catastrophe: It reduced the family unit’s production, and therefore its consumption.



The industrial revolution allowed people to move from farms to factories, where work was better paid, more enjoyable, and less strenuous (which is largely why people in poor countries continue to stream from agricultural employment to manufacturing jobs today). Moreover, wealth exploded (real annual family income in the United States rose from $1,980 in 1800 to $53,018 in 2016). That allowed for ever‐​increasing specialization, which included a massive expansion of services catering to the desires of an ever‐​more‐​prosperous population. The service sector today consists of jobs in the information sector, investment services, technical and scientific services, health care, and social‐​assistance services, as well as in arts, entertainment, and recreation. Most of these jobs are less physically arduous, more intellectually stimulating, and better paid than either agricultural or manufacturing jobs ever were. Crucially, many of these service‐​sector jobs can be performed remotely. That means that even in the midst of the government‐​imposed economic shutdown, some work (about a third, estimates suggest) can go on. The economic losses from COVID-19, in other words, will be astronomical, but not total.



My own organization, for example, shut its doors in mid March. Since then, everyone has been scribbling away at home or appearing on news shows around the world via the Internet. All of us are in regular contact via the phone, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Other organizations are doing the same. As we already discussed, a great deal of shopping is taking place online. Shipping and delivery companies are expanding, with Amazon hiring 100,000 additional workers in the United States. Home entertainment, of course, has grown tremendously, with Netflix adding millions of new customers and expanding its offerings with thousands of new films and television shows. With over 30 million American children stuck at home, online learning companies are booming, and educators from high‐​school teachers to college professors continue to perform their jobs remotely. Telehealth is expanding, allowing patients to see their doctors in a safe and convenient way. Even minor medical procedures, such as eye exams, can be conducted remotely, and multiple companies will deliver your new specs to your front door. Banking and finance are still going on, with many people taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages. Finally, the often unfairly maligned pharmaceutical industry is expanding as we all wait and hope for the release of a COVID-19 vaccine or effective therapeutic treatment.



 **SOCIALITY**  
Aristotle observed that “man is by nature a social animal” and noted that without friends we would be unhappy. But the role of sociality (that is to say, the tendency to associate in or form social groups) goes much deeper than that. As William von Hippel explained in his 2018 book _The Social Leap_ , sociality is the mechanism by which _Homo sapiens_ came about. When early hominids were forced down from the trees (perhaps as a result of a climatic change that dried up African forests), they became more vulnerable to predators. To cover longer distances between the fast‐​disappearing trees while maintaining a modicum of protection against other animals, our ancestors developed bipedalism, which allowed them to free their upper body to carry weapons such as sticks and stones.



Even more important was the invention of cooperation. While a stick‐​wielding ape is slightly better‐​off than an unarmed one, a group of armed apes is much better at dispatching predators. Individuals in more cooperative bands survived to adulthood and bred more often, resulting in more‐​cooperative species. Furthermore, since living alone was tantamount to a death sentence, selfish apes who didn’t care about being ostracized for not pulling their weight died off, resulting in a desire for communal cooperation and a deep‐​rooted fear of rejection by the group.



The early hominids had brains more like those of chimps than those of modern humans. That’s because the evolutionary pressures that created the former — such as predation and food scarcity — could be overcome without tremendous intelligence. These pressures to survive were part of the physical landscape — a challenging but static environment that didn’t require a lot of cognitive ability to navigate. The environmental pressure that resulted in modern humans was the social system itself. The social landscape is much more dynamic than the physical one. Once they had banded together in groups, our ancestors were forced to forge relationships with, and avoid being exploited by, individuals with divergent and constantly shifting interests. Those who couldn’t keep up with the increasingly complex social game either died or were unable to mate.



This new pressure created a positive evolutionary cycle: Banding together created more complex social systems, which required bigger brains; bigger brains needed to be fed; and the best way to get more food was more cooperation and a more sophisticated social system. The main cognitive development that evolved from this evolutionary cycle is known as the “theory of mind.” In short, the theory of mind is the ability to understand that other minds can have different reasoning, knowledge, and desires from your own. While that seems basic, the theory of mind distinguishes us from all other life on Earth. It allows us to determine whether an affront, for example, was intentional, accidental, or forced. It allows us to feel emotions such as empathy, pride, and guilt — abilities that are keys to a functioning society.



So sociality and human beings are inseparable, as we have all been clearly reminded by the sudden restrictions on our ability to interact with others. As we sit at home, working away on our computers or watching television, most of us feel a tremendous sense of isolation (“social distancing”) from our family, friends, and colleagues. The urge to be around others is innate to us. It is who we are. Dissatisfied with impersonal modes of communication, such as email and texting, we have rediscovered the need for a face‐​to‐​face interaction with our fellow humans. To that end, we utilize digital platforms such as Zoom, Google Hangouts, Facebook Live, and FaceTime to catch up on the latest news in other people’s lives, or simply to complain about the misery of loneliness and the pathetic inadequacy of our public officials (of both parties). Throughout the nation, people engage in virtual happy hours, dinners, book clubs, fitness classes, religious services, and group meditation. As my Cato Institute colleague Chelsea Follett recently wrote, “Technology has made it easier than ever to hold a physically‐​distanced ‘watch party’ synchronized so that viewers in different locations see the same part of a movie at the same time. For those who like to discuss movies as they watch, technology also enables a running group commentary of each scene in real time.” In the saddest of cases, technology enables people to say goodbye to dying friends and relatives. In a very real sense, therefore, technology keeps us sane (or, at the very least, saner).



Technology, then, allows us to cope with the challenges of the pandemic in ways that our ancestors could not even dream about. More important, technology allows our species to face the virus with grounds for rational optimism. In these dark days, remember all the scientists who are utilizing the accumulated store of human knowledge to defeat COVID-19 in record time and all the marvelous (not to say miraculous) ways the modern world keeps us well fed, psychologically semi‐​balanced, and (in many cases) productively engaged.

“We can’t just drill our way out of the problem.”



That was the[ oft-repeated phrase of President Barack Obama](https://www.dailysignal.com/2018/09/14/obama-was-wrong-on-oil-we-did-drill-our-way-out-of-the-problem/), who[ throughout his presidency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyPkY0Kf-Y) argued that the key to beating higher gasoline prices was to subsidize alternative energies, such as solar and wind.



The fracking revolution has turned the United States into a net exporter of oil. 



It was a common sentiment from those who fretted that the world had reached “peak oil,” and that America was simply doomed to become increasingly reliant on a few big international oil producers for a rapidly dwindling resource.



It also played well into the narrative that fossil fuels were inherently evil, destroying the planet by escalating climate change.



But the doomsayers were wrong.



Thanks in large part to American ingenuity and technological innovation, the script has been flipped—and the dividends have been enormous.



Recent events in the Middle East underscore the dramatic change that’s occurred.



It’s been remarkable that following the September attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities and the recent U.S. strike[ on Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani](https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/01/04/5-things-to-know-about-top-iranian-general-killed-by-us-airstrike/), oil prices have remained more or less stable.



This is a huge departure from what has transpired after major incidents in the Middle East in the past. As Foreign Policy’s C.K. Hickey[ noted](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/10/record-u-s-oil-production-is-keeping-crude-prices-from-spiking/):



The August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait led to a surge in the price of oil from $15 a barrel that month to $40 by October ($65.68 adjusted for inflation as of 2019). In February 2003, the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq once again led to a spike in prices to nearly $40 a barrel, or around $55 in today’s dollars, a level that hadn’t been seen since the Gulf War.



This time was different.



Why?



U.S. oil production has boomed in the past decade, thanks largely to innovation in the use of fracking, which has allowed the U.S. to tap into not only enormous amounts of shale oil, but also natural gas and other petroleum resources.



In fact, U.S. production has ramped up so much that in 2018, the U.S.[ became a net exporter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-06/u-s-becomes-a-net-oil-exporter-for-the-first-time-in-75-years) of oil for the first time in nearly 75 years.



Perhaps even more incredibly, for a brief time at the end of 2019,[ the U.S. surpassed Saudi Arabia to become the world’s top oil exporter](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/12/investing/us-oil-exports-saudi-arabia/index.html).



That, of course, produced jobs and a[ boon to the American economy](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0820), but it also created the conditions for a global oil market more resistant to supply and price shocks—which were sometimes created by OPEC nations. Many of the latter are in the Middle East or generally hostile to the U.S.



But now, a world suddenly deprived of, say, Iranian oil, can rely increasingly on U.S. oil.



As political scientist Walter Russell Mead[ wrote](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fracking-our-way-to-mideast-peace-1513035925) for The Wall Street Journal, the Middle East is now a region “being fundamentally reshaped by drillers in Texas, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and elsewhere.”



As my colleague Nick Loris, an expert on energy and environmental policy, has noted, the huge increase in domestic oil production[ doesn’t mean that the U.S. is truly energy independent](https://www.sacbee.com/news/news-services/article239344703.html). We are still very much affected by the global supply and the actions of countries abroad.



Nevertheless, the surge in production has transformed the American economy and given the U.S. an invaluable tool in foreign relations.



That has transpired in spite of efforts by the Obama administration and the left to strangle an industry they fundamentally dislike, an effort that would be stepped up massively if the so-called Green New Deal became law.



The Green New Deal,[ a badly disguised Trojan Horse for socialism](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/01/04/the-green-new-deal-is-a-trojan-horse-for-socialism/) and of[ dubious environmental benefit,](https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/11/14/the-green-new-deal-isnt-just-expensive-its-also-bad-environmental-policy/) would end and reverse the oil production advances that have been such a broad-based benefit for the U.S. economy.



Hopefully, the strong economy and stable oil markets amid turmoil in the Middle East will serve as a reminder that reversing the incredible advances in oil drilling of the past decade would be a huge mistake.

Undeterred by the Senate’s refusal to ratify the mandatory reductions of greenhouse gases stipulated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the federal government has plunged ahead with a $1 billion annual program to reduce industrial emissions that may contribute to global warming. The Climate Change Technology Initiative–administered by five separate cabinet departments–employs an amalgam of tax credits, research and development funds, product labeling and public awareness programs, demonstration projects, industry subsidies, and regulatory programs to increase energy efficiency and the economic attractiveness of renewable energy.



The program, however, is little more than a sham. The CCTI is but a repackaging of failed programs that have littered the federal budget for 20 or more years. The program offers misleading and incomplete cost/​benefit analyses, is obsessed with remedying market failures that do not in fact exist, projects emission reductions that are wildly implausible, asserts a correlation between energy efficiency and energy consumption that is demonstrably false, proposes counterproductive labeling and product standards, and misleads the public about the ability of such a program–even if it performs as advertised–to measurably affect global temperatures.



The CCTI is built on economic ignorance and political symbolism. Regardless of one’s position on the threat of global climate change, the CCTI is nothing but an empty and expensive political gesture.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBecause the data behind the man-made global warming hypothesis is turning out to be so frail and flakey, we often hear the proponents claiming “97% of climate scientists agree that man is now driving the climate” as an argument.
Never mind the 97% figure is a bogus one to start with.
Whenever the data basis underpinning a theory is a shambles, then claims of consensus among experts are often the last go-to argument in a bid to salvage the theory. This is not only true in climate science, but also in the science of nutrition and heart disease.
Dr. Tim Noakes has posted a video on the horrible misconceptions involving the once highly ballyhooed high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. For some 40 years 99% of the experts claimed the diet was good for our hearts and health. Saturated fat was villainized by junk science cranked out by a less-than honest-vegetable oil industry.
So what does Tim Noakes think of consensus in science?
At the 10:16 mark we hear something us man-made global warming skeptics can truly relate to (and AGW proponents can’t stand hearing). It’s why the argument of “consensus among experts” is in fact just the last gasp of a dying scientific theory and so must never be accepted. He tells his audience:
So, these are consensus guidelines. And you must never trust consensus guidelines because they are anti-science. Science is not about consensus; it’s about disproof, disbelief and skepticism. It’s not about consensus. When you have consensus, you got trouble.”

Of course there are are some not-so-bright readers out there who will claim that a few lumps of sugar does not disprove “climate science”. Of course it doesn’t. But what it does show, however, is that consensus among scientists does not make the science right – no matter how broad it is. Scientific consensus is often totally wrong. This we now seeing in the case in the high-carb, low-fat diet, and it it is also becoming clear that it is also the case with CO2 and climate.
Just think for a moment of all the major factors warmists currently deny within the science itself, everything from the models being wrong, the 18-year pause, the sun’s impact on climate cycles, the oceanic cycles, the Medieval Warm Period, etc.
Also in the case of climate science, “follow the money”.
Also do note that despite the overwhelming evidence and huge success of Dr. Noakes in treating obesity, there continue to be the stubborn diehard stalwarts of the old theory – desperately clinging to it to the very end. It doesn’t matter what massive evidence gets presented to them, they’ll continue denying, denying, denying.
Myself I can confirm what Dr. Noakes professes. I’ve been on a low-carb, high-fat diet for some one and half years and have seen a huge difference in health.

More reports are out that Germany’s string of problems surrounding its ambitious installation of offshore wind parks has been extended once again.
North German online news site www.nwzonline.de (NWZ) reports there is “no longer a connection” to two North Sea windparks due to “a faulty transmission cable”.
According to the NWZ, the 135-kilometer Dolwin 2 cable runs from the North Sea to the North German coast and ends in the Emsland town of Dörpen. Engineers suspect the fault is somewhere onshore.
Dolwin 2 cable delivers power from wind parks Godewind 1 and 2, which are operated by Danish energy company Dong. The two wind parks comprise 97 wind turbines and have a rated capacity of 582 megawatts, the NWZ reports.
According to NWZ, grid operator Tennet blames Swedish engineering giant and cable manufacturer ABB for the problems. Currently ABB has not been able to identify the source of the problem and the power interruption is expected to cost (consumers) millions.

The BARD 1 debacle
Dolwin 2 is hardly the only debacle that has plagued the German offshore wind industry. Another embarrassment was the BARD 1 offshore wind park, which was planned to deliver power to Germany in early 2014, but because of a series of major engineering faults, the wind park did not deliver power until one and half years later – in October 2015. Read here and here.
So great were the losses at BARD 1 that a bank was forced to take over the project. The project ended up costing 3 billion euros and was much more expensive than anticipated.
Riffgat’s half-year outage
Also giant wind park Riffgat stopped delivering power late last year – also a faulty transmission cable. Read here. There’s no news from the Riffgat site on whether or not the park has been returned online. The site has not issued a press release in over 2 years.
The online OZI here reported as of April 27, 2016: “Still no power coming from Riffgat“. However, just days ago – after more than half a year of being shut down – Riffgat hobbled back online.
It seems the wind industry has been busier repairing offshore wind parks than operating them.

The story goes, so we are told: Evil mankind burns petrochemicals. This creates CO2. Human CO2 has an extraordinarily amazing effect on the greenhouse earth. The planet gets dangerously warmer. The ice on land (glaciers, Greenland & Antarctica ice sheets etc) melt. Sea level rises. _[Arctic sea ice does not count as it is floating anyway so has nil effect.]_



Rinse and repeat. Sea level rise accelerates. In other words, there is a greater and greater sea-level rise every year. This is a bad thing because Al Gore and Obama have seaside mansions and all the 1,196 Maldives Islands will be completely underwater by September 2018.



But is this sea-level rise acceleration really true? _The Spectator_ has an in-depth look at the issue.



Way back in the 1700s the Liverpool Harbour Master began recording tide data. This has continued to become the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) which now maintains a database of tide gauge data from all over the world.



Along come the IPCC and their computer models which predicted an acceleration in sea-level rise. The data were scoured looking for the conclusive proof of mankind’s perfidy. But alas, despite all their efforts, the committees in 1990 (13 experts), 1995 (24 experts) and 2001 (36 experts) stated that they could find **no acceleration of sea-level rise in the 20th century despite the rise of CO 2 during that time.**



There is **no firm evidence of acceleration in sea level rise** during this century



Clearly, more experts were required and the 2007 IPCC sea-level committee numbered 70 scientists, now armed with satellite data. 



The first sea-level satellite (Topex – Poseidon) was launched in 1992 and replaced by the Jason 1 satellite in 2001. The satellites were showing sea-level rise around 30 cm per 100 years while the tide gauges examined at earlier IPCC meetings showed a much lower sea-level rise of 15-18 cm per 100 years.



But, obviously, a satellite and all the high-tech wizardry has got to be better than a float in a tube down the wharf somewhere, so it must be true. Proof positive of what they were looking for – acceleration.



This interpretation was made without any detailed review of the reliability of tide gauge data from all over the Earth and technical altimetry problems in a satellite system; a system where **a one millimetre of error in its 1,366 km orbital distance from the Earth’s surface translated to a sea level rise error of 10 cm in 100 years!**



But then …



The sea level debate became an even larger can of worms in 2018. The University of Colorado, which manages the Jason satellites on contract to NASA, reported that not only had there been no acceleration of sea level rise in the satellite data there had been a deceleration in the last decade (2008-2018); **so even the satellite data had not been able to detect acceleration of sea level!** It was proposed that a cooling event due to the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines had delayed the sea level acceleration that would have eventuated by 2018 but would still emerge from the noise of internal climate variability in the coming decade barring another major volcanic eruption.



This lack of sea level rise acceleration was consistent with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association report in 2016 on 200 tide gauges from the east and west coasts of the USA and from some Atlantic and Pacific islands. **The US report showed there was no acceleration of sea level in these records.** So two methods with vastly different results still showed no sea level acceleration! It was now crystal clear that the reports of no sea level acceleration (IPCC reports of 1900, 1995 and 2001) were correct and that the reports of sea level acceleration (IPCC reports of 2007 and 2014) were based on false logic; the spurious by-product of differences between two measuring systems.



The technical altimetry problems with the satellite system were eventually exposed in 2012 when NASA reported that there was a level of error that contaminated climatological data records, such as measurements of sea level height from altimetry missions. […]



Obviously any quotes about sea-level rise and acceleration are still based on the flawed system as honesty is not a hallmark of the doomer alarmists.



How can recent scientific articles published in ‘peer-reviewed’ literature stridently announce to the scientific community and the world media accelerated ice loss into the ocean from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets when there is no corresponding acceleration of sea level rise due to that ‘extra ice’. **These articles tinged with panic do not make sense.** The lack of any evidence of sea level acceleration in the PSMSL tide gauge data, the NOAA tide gauge data or even in the flawed NASA satellite data shows that these articles are either biased or based on insufficient data derived from flawed ice mass measurement methodologies. **In contrast, the data from thousands of tide gauges clearly show no acceleration of sea level rise in the last 120 years.**



For some reliable sea level data see [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567), especially Appendix A which includes Dunedin as a station with a reliable long term data set.

Both of these factors are weather events, not climate events:

The new findings show that a pregnant woman’s exposure to reduced precipitation and an increased number of very hot days indeed results in lower birth weight.

One wonders if they might find correlations to more days days with high rainfall (seasonal monsoon) and cold days (winter) as well, if they looked. As I understand biology, any stress like this in early development can show up  later.

From melting glaciers to increasing wildfires, the consequences of climate change and strategies to mitigate such consequences are often a hotly debated topic. A new study led by the University of Utah adds to the ever-growing list of negative impacts climate change can have on humans–low birth weight.
The first of its kind, the two-year project led by U geography professor Kathryn Grace examined the relationship among precipitation, temperature and birth weight in 19 African countries. Grace and her team utilized high quality, detailed climate data in conjunction with extensive health data to focus on climate change and its effects on birth weight in the developing world.
The new findings show that a pregnant woman’s exposure to reduced precipitation and an increased number of very hot days indeed results in lower birth weight.
“Our findings demonstrate that in the very early stages of intra-uterine development, climate change has the potential to significantly impact birth outcomes. While the severity of that impact depends on where the pregnant woman lives, in this case the developing world, we can see the potential for similar outcomes everywhere,” said Grace.
The other authors are Frank Davenport, Heidi Hanson, Christopher Funk and Shraddhanand Shukla. The team reported the findings in Global Environmental Change. Christopher Funk (US Geological Survey) and UC Santa Barbara Climate Hazards Group provided the climate data used in the study, and have just detailed exceptional East African rainfall declines in a new paper in Nature Scientific Data.
Impacts of low birth weight are far-reaching
With the inaccuracy of determining exactly when a pregnancy began in rural countries which lack pregnancy tests and the inability to measure characteristics like a newborn’s cognitive development, low birth weight is the most reliable measure of whether a pregnancy has been negatively affected by an external factor. Low birth weight is defined by the World Health Organization as any baby born under 2,500 grams.
Low birth weight infants are more susceptible to illness, face a higher risk of mortality, are more likely to develop disabilities and are less likely to attain the same level of education and income as an infant born within a healthy weight range.
Consequently, the financial burden of a low birth weight infant can be significant. The costs of newborn intensive care unit stays and services, re-hospitalization and long-term morbidity can add up quickly, and in developing countries where such support services are less common and physical disability is considered a social stigma, low birth weight can be particularly impactful.
The first continent-wide analysis
In 2013, Grace and colleagues combined health data from Demographic and Health Surveys, which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development to collect and disseminate data on health and population in developing countries, and growing season data, with temperature and rainfall data from a variety of sources.
The team collected growing and livelihood zone information from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Famine Early Warning System program and precipitation data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data set.
In total, the team examined nearly 70,000 births in 19 African countries between 1986 and 2010 and matched these births with seasonal rainfall and air temperatures, as well as variables describing the mother and mother’s household, such as education level and whether the household had access to electricity.
This is the first time researchers utilized fine-resolution precipitation and temperature data alongside birth data to analyze how weather impacts birth weight.
To generate precipitation records for each birth, the team calculated the average precipitation for a given month within 10 km of the child’s birth location. This was done for each month up to one year prior to each child’s birth. The values were then summed over each trimester.
The same method was used to generate temperature records for each birth. The team first calculated the maximum daily temperature for a given calendar day within 10 km of a child’s birth location. From there, the number of days in each birth month where the temperature exceeded 105 F and 100 F as the maximum daily temperature were summed over trimesters.
Evidence and impact of climate change
The results show that an increase of hot days above 100 F during any trimester corresponds to a decrease in birth weight. In fact, just one extra day with a temperature above 100 F in the second trimester corresponded to a 0.9 g weight decrease; this result held with a larger effect when the temperature threshold was increased to 105 F.
Conversely, higher amounts of precipitation during any trimester resulted in larger birth weights. On average, a 10 mm increase in precipitation during a particular trimester corresponds to an approximate increase in birth weight of around 0.3-0.5 g.
“While the results are dependent on trimester and location, the data shows that climate change–a combination of increased hot days and decreased precipitation–correlate to lower birth weights,” said Grace.
“At the end of the day, the services we invest in to support these developing countries won’t reap the same level of benefits as long as climate change continues. Services such as education, clean water efforts and nutrition support won’t be as effective. We need to work faster and differently to combat the evident stresses caused by climate change.”

A key feature of the U.S. economy is the dramatic increase in expenditures by all levels of government beginning in the 20th century. At the national level, the U.S. government annually spent roughly $142 (in 2017 dollars) per capita from the 1790s to the 1910s compared to $11,500 per capita in 2017.1 Expenditure growth outpaced the growth in income as well as population, with U.S. government expenditures accounting for 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1930 compared to 20.5 percent of GDP in 2017. The behavior of state government expenditures parallels that of the U.S. government: total state government spending increased from $1,470 (in 2017 dollars) per capita in 1960 to nearly $6,980 per capita in 2017. Total state government expenditures increased from 5.8 percent of GDP in 1960 to roughly 12 percent of GDP in 2017.



The growth in government has attracted considerable academic research that has generated numerous theories to explain (or partially explain) government growth in the United States. All theories assume that a market for public sector output and expenditures exists (Mueller 2003).2 The demand for government output and expenditures is determined by individual citizens or a collection of citizens organized into special interest groups. Essentially, demand-side theories argue that government has grown because citizens have demanded more government. These theories make use of the median-voter model (Downs 1957, 1961) to explain why citizens have had an increased demand for public goods (e.g., increased income) and a reduction in externalities (Baumol 1967; Ferris and West 1996; Mueller 2003), as well as a greater demand for more redistribution of income (Meltzer and Richard 1978, 1981, 1983).3 In addition, citizen-based interest groups can increase government size by organizing members and applying political pressure more effectively than individuals (Olson 1965; Becker 1983; Ekelund and Tollison 2001).



Supply-side theories of government growth argue that government expenditures are determined by legislators and bureaucrats who face certain incentives, the inherent inefficiencies in the provision of government goods, and the structure of government (e.g., representative democracy versus democracy). Niskanen’s (1971) theory of bureaucracy postulates that government bureaucrats maximize the size of their agencies’ budgets in accordance with their own preferences, and are able to do so because of the unique monopoly position of the bureaucrat.4 Fiscal illusion theory (Buchanan 1967) assumes that government, specifically legislators and the executive branch, can deceive voters as to the true size of government by using taxes and tax collection measures that are less obvious to citizens.5 Finally, the idea that representative governments behave as monopolists was first suggested by Breton (1974) and extended further by Brennan and Buchanan’s (1977, 1980) model of leviathan government where a monopoly government’s sole objective is to maximize revenue.6



It is not unreasonable to argue that government growth is likely the result of both demand-side and supply-side factors. Thus, research along these lines to deepen our understanding of the market for government output and expenditures seems warranted. In this article, we argue that the introduction of air conditioning in states’ capitol buildings was a permanent technology shock that may have contributed to the growth in state government output, and thus expenditures, by increasing the productivity (output per unit of labor input) of legislators, lobbyists, bureaucrats, and others involved in producing government output and expenditures. We also argue that the effects of air conditioning would have been most pronounced in warmer states.



The following quotations suggest that the hypotheses of this article merit more rigorous attention:



The installation of air conditioning in the 1930s did more, I believe, than cool the Capitol, . . . . members were no longer in a hurry to flee Washington. The southerners especially had no place else to go that was half as comfortable [Martin 1960: 49].



Six months of every year, the nation enjoyed a respite from the promulgation of more laws, the depredation of lobbyists, the hatching of new schemes for Federal expansion and, of course, the cost of maintaining a government running at full blast. Once air conditioning arrived, Congress had twice has much time to exercise its skill at regulating and plucking the population [Baker 1978: 6].



Prior to air conditioning, attempts to cool buildings or rooms, including those in states’ capitols, were typically done with electric fans or swamp coolers (which worked on the principle of evaporation), neither of which reliably cooled rooms to comfortable levels (Arsenault 1984).7 Air conditioning, however, effectively lowered both room temperatures and humidity levels, thus greatly improving working and living conditions. There is little doubt that the introduction of air conditioning transformed society during the 20th century by increasing the productive efficiency of businesses and households (Arsenault 1984; Cooper 1998; Solomon 2003). There is thus reason to presume that the public sector was also influenced by the transformative and productivity-enhancing effects of air conditioning.



Our theory of government growth is not an independent explanation for growth but rather a contributing explanation. That is, we take the supply-side and demand-side factors as given and reasonable and argue that the introduction and existence of air-conditioning has _enhanced_ the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been hypothesized to influence state government growth — for example, lobbying in states’ capitols by citizens and legislators became more pleasant and occurred all year without summer break. While we are agnostic about the precise effect of air conditioning on specific supply-side and demand-side factors that influence state government growth, it seems reasonable to suggest that air conditioning could have a direct effect on the productivity of all parties involved in producing government output just as it did for households and businesses.



The analysis proceeds in several steps. As a motivation for our empirical methodology, we first present a simple model of technological growth to demonstrate how the introduction and subsequent existence of air conditioning in a state capitol may have led to increased growth in state government output. A brief discussion is then provided to motivate the link between state government output and state government expenditures. We then discuss the panel data, identification strategy, and the empirical methodology that is used in order to test our hypothesis that the growth in state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning in states’ capitols. Finally, we present our empirical results, which support our hypothesis that the growth in state government expenditures was higher after the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols, and that this effect was more pronounced in the warmer southern states.



As the starting point for our conceptual framework, it is important to first examine how the introduction of air conditioning could have influenced the growth in the output of state governments. As discussed shortly, there is a direct link between the growth in government output and the growth in government expenditures.



We assume that the introduction of air conditioning, both generally and in state capitols, acted as a one-time and permanent labor-augmenting technology shock.8 Let the labor-augmenting technology be represented by the parameter _A_ , where _A_ = 1 before the labor-augmenting technology shock and _A_ >1 after the technology shock. We can write a representative production function for a state government’s output ( _q_ ) as



 _q_ = _q(K, A_ • _L),_



where _K_ and _L_ are capital and labor inputs, respectively.9 Rewriting the above production function as a function of time to capture output growth as a result of air conditioning gives



(1)



 _q_ ( _t_ ) = _q_ ( _K_ ( _t_ ), _A_ • _L_ ( _t_ )).



Totally differentiating with respect to _t_ yields





Dividing both sides by _q_ gives





or, equivalently,



(2)





Rewriting in familiar terms gives the following expression for output growth due to labor-augmenting technological progress:



(3)





where ε _q,K_ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital and ε _q,L_ is the elasticity of output with respect to labor.10 It should be clear from (3) that output growth, , is higher after the introduction of air conditioning ( _A_ > 1) than before the introduction of air conditioning ( _A_ = 1), regardless of whether the usage of inputs remains constant or increases over time.11 Note that the technology shock essentially increases output by increasing the marginal product of labor, (∂ _q/_ ∂ _L_ ) • _A_ , in equation (2) even if the quantity of labor remains constant.



There is a clear link between government output and government expenditures; namely, that government expenditures reflect the total cost of producing total government output.12 This cost not only includes the cost of inputs but also the cost of maintaining government programs (social programs, military, etc.). Thus, our line of reasoning is that air conditioning in a state’s capitol was a positive technology shock that increased legislative output in a state capitol by “shifting up” the government production function, which resulted in an increase in the total output of the respective state government. This increase in total output then resulted in an increase in state government expenditures after the introduction of air conditioning.



We also argue that air conditioning enhanced the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been argued to also contribute to government growth. On the demand side, the presence of air conditioning in state capitols may have facilitated lobbying by consumer and business interests by making lobbying more comfortable, thus leading to additional legislative output and, following the explanation made earlier, ultimately an increase in government expenditures. On the supply side, theory and evidence suggest that governments are not cost minimizers. The additional total physical output due to air conditioning would therefore not be produced at the lowest cost. In other words, air conditioning would have further increased the cost inefficiencies of government, thus increasing state government expenditures even more.



It is worthwhile to summarize our conceptual framework and resulting hypothesis, as both serve as the basis for our empirical setup. Government output and expenditures were increasing before the introduction of air conditioning due to changes in input usage as well as supply-side and demand-side factors. The introduction of air conditioning was a one-time, permanent technology shock that increased output and expenditures by not only increasing the marginal product of labor, but also by enhancing the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been found to contribute to government growth. This implies that the average annual growth rate of state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning. In the following section we discuss the empirical methodology used to test our hypothesis.



We use a panel dataset of U.S. states in order to test our hypothesis that the growth of state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning in each state’s capitol. In order to account for population growth that has occurred over time (which would affect the government expenditures via the supply and demand for government), our dependent variable is real per capita state government expenditure.13 Our empirical approach is to examine whether the trend-rate of growth in state government expenditures, where the trend captures the behavior of expenditures due to all aforementioned supply and demand factors, was greater after the introduction of air conditioning, especially in warmer states.



Testing for differences in the trend-rate of growth in state expenditures before and after air conditioning requires identifying the point in time in which the “break” in the trend occurred. Our identification of this break in trend is the year in which air conditioning was installed in each state capitol. One issue we faced was how to define the existence of “air conditioning.” Prior to the installation of central air-conditioning systems, some offices in state capitols had window air-conditioning units that cooled individual offices while leaving many other offices, conference rooms, and the legislative chambers uncooled. We consider the year when central air conditioning (e.g., HVAC) was introduced throughout the entire state capitol as the date in which air conditioning was introduced.



Much effort went into contacting state historians, legislative archivists, and even “old-timers” who had worked in the state capitol for decades, in order to determine when air conditioning was installed in each state capitol. We were able to obtain air-conditioning installation dates (years) for 21 states. The first year after each state installed air conditioning in its capitol building serves as the break in the trend for each state’s expenditure growth that we test for in our empirical models.



As suggested earlier, it seems likely that the effect of air conditioning on state government expenditures would differ depending upon the relative difference in indoor air temperature due to air conditioning compared to indoor air temperature without air conditioning. That is, the relative increase in indoor comfort levels due to air conditioning would be greater in the states with warmer and more humid climates compared to the states with cooler and less humid climates. Thus, the hypothesized effects of air conditioning should be greater in warmer and more humid states. To explore this possibility, our empirical analysis considers the impact of air conditioning on state government expenditures in “warm” states compared to “cool” states.



We followed several steps in order to classify each of the 21 states in our sample as either a “warm” state or a “cool” state. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat-index level as that above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.14 Thus, we classify a state as “warm” (“cool”) if its average summertime heat index is above (below) 80. To calculate the summertime heat index for each state, we used the primary formula used by NOAA.15 This formula requires data on air temperature and humidity levels. For each state, we therefore obtained the average air temperature and humidity levels over the months of June, July, and August in 2010 for each state’s capital city.16 We then calculated the heat index for each state’s capital city and used the heat index benchmark of 80 to either classify the state as a warm state or a cool state.



Not surprisingly, it turned out that warm states had air conditioning installed sooner than many cool states. In order to be able to make a comparison between the effect of the introduction of air conditioning in warm and cool states, we omitted from our final sample those cool states that had air conditioning installed much later than any warm state. Our final sample includes all seven warm states for which we were able to obtain the dates of air conditioning installation and five cool states that had air conditioning installed during the same time period as warm states. Table 1 presents the 12 states in our panel of data, the year that air conditioning was installed in each state’s capitol, and the classification of each state as “warm” or “cool.” In these 12 states, air conditioning in the capitol buildings was installed between 1959 and 1969.17 In order to ensure a sufficient number of year-observations before and after the introduction of air conditioning, our panel includes the years 1950–75.18





Our empirical objective is to test whether the trend growth in state expenditures is larger after the introduction of air conditioning, and whether the difference in expenditure growth as a result of air conditioning varies between warm states and cool states. To meet this objective, we first created binary variables that denote whether a state is warm or cool, as well as a variable that denotes the presence of air conditioning in each state’s capitol. We construct the variable _Cool_ that has a value of ‘1’ if state _i_ has been classified as cool, and has a value of ‘0’ if state _i_ has been classified as warm. Similarly, we construct another binary variable _Warm_ that has a value of ‘1’ if state _i_ has been classified as warm, and has a value of ‘0’ if state _i_ has been classified as cool. The variable _PostAC_ has a value of ‘1’ for all years in which air conditioning was present in each state’s capitol, and has a value ‘0’ otherwise. We also create a linear time trend variable ( _Trend_ ) to capture the growth in state government expenditures, where _Trend_ _t_ = _t_ for years (observations) _t_ = 1, 2, . . . 26.



The variables we use in our empirical models are as follows. The variable _WarmTrend_ _it_ is constructed as _Warm_ _it_ • _Trend_ _t_ , and this variable captures the time trend for all states classified as warm. Similarly, the variable _CoolTrend_ _it_ is constructed as _Cool_ _it_ • _Trend_ _t_ , and this variable captures the time trend for all states classified as cool. These two variables are then interacted with the variable _PostAC_ to arrive at the variables _WarmTrendPostA_ C _it_ and _CoolTrendPostA_ C _it_. With these variables in hand, we can specify our regression equation as



(4)



 _G_ _it_ = _a_ 0 \+ _a_ 1 • _WarmTrend_ _it_ \+ _a_ 2 _WarmTrendPostAC_ _it_ +  
 _a_ _3_ • _CoolTrend_ _it_ \+ _a_ 4 • _CoolTrendPostAC_ _it_ \+ _a_ 5 •  
 _Inc_ _it_ \+ δ _i_ \+ _θ D60_ \+ _θ D70_ \+ δ _i_ • _θ D60_ \+ δ _i_ • _θ D70_ \+ ε _it_ ,



where _i_ denotes each state ( _i_ = 1, 2 . . . 12) and _t_ denotes each year ( _t_ = 1, 2, . . . 26) in our sample of panel data. The dependent variable, _G_ , is total state government expenditures. We first specify this variable as the natural log of real per capita expenditures so that the trend coefficients reflect the average annual growth rate of expenditures. As an alternative measure, we also estimate this regression with the dependent variable measured as the level of real per capita state expenditures. Fixed state-effects ( _δ i_) are included to account for cross-state heterogeneity, as well as allowing the initial level of government growth to differ by state. Fixed decade-effects ( _θ D_60 and _θ D_70) are included to account for decade-specific shifts in government expenditures. We also interact these decade-effects with each state’s fixed-effect to account for state-specific decade-effects, such as crisis episodes (Higgs 1987; Bologna and Young 2016), changes in the federal/state relationship (Sobel and Crowley 2014) that have been shown to be state specific and have differing effects on state government expenditures, and other technological changes (e.g., the introduction of computers) that may have occurred. Finally, we include per capita state personal income ( _Inc_ _it_ ) to control for the demand-side effect of income growth on government expenditures. Our key trend variables thus capture the behavior of government expenditures due to all possible aforementioned reasons except income growth.



The interpretation of the coefficients of interest in equation (4) is as follows. When the dependent is specified as the natural log of real per capita expenditures, the coefficient _α_ 2 reflects the growth in government expenditures for warm states after the introduction of air conditioning _relative_ to the growth in government expenditures for warm states prior to the introduction of air conditioning ( _α_ 1). Similarly, the coefficient α4 reflects the growth in government expenditures for cool states after the introduction of air conditioning _relative_ to the growth in government expenditures for cool states prior to the introduction of air conditioning ( _α_ 3). When the dependent variable is specified as the level of real per capita expenditures, _α_ 2 and _α_ 4 reflect the marginal difference in per capita spending after air conditioning relative to spending before air conditioning in warm and cool states, respectively. As stated earlier, the goal of our empirical framework is not to determine the significant factors that explain the growth in the state government expenditures, but rather to see if there is a break in the trend (where the trend reflects the behavior of government expenditures due to all possible aforementioned reasons, except income) after the introduction of air conditioning.



It is worthwhile to briefly discuss our expected empirical results based upon the previous conceptual framework. Regarding warm state capitols, it seems reasonable that air conditioning would have likely resulted in a significant marginal improvement in comfort levels, and thus productivity and expenditures. If air conditioning increased the growth in government spending in warm state capitols, we expect to find that _α_ 2 is positive and statistically significant. However, with respect to cool states, the marginal improvement in comfort levels as a result of air conditioning may not have had a significant impact on subsequent expenditure growth. More importantly, however, if air conditioning had a greater impact on expenditures growth in warm states than it did in cool states, we should find that _α_ 2 is significantly larger than _α_ 4.



This section presents the empirical results from equation (4) as well as the results from the above-mentioned hypothesis tests. In addition, we present empirical results from growth regressions that consider various components of state government spending.



The Growth Rate of State Government Expenditures before and after Air Conditioning



The empirical estimates for equation (4) with the dependent variable specified as the natural log of real per capita expenditures (so the trend coefficients reflect the average annual growth rate of expenditures) are shown in the first column of Table 2. We find that, not surprisingly, expenditure growth in both warm and cool states was increasing before the introduction of air conditioning, where warm states had an average growth rate of 4.6 percent and cool states had an average growth rate of 4.1 percent. Per our hypothesis, we wish to examine whether the growth in expenditures was higher after the introduction of air conditioning in the capitols. For warm states, we find that the relative annual expenditure growth in warm states after the introduction of air conditioning was 0.29 percentage points larger than annual expenditure growth before the introduction of air conditioning. For cool states, we find no statistically significant change after the introduction of air conditioning. Per the bottom of column (1), this difference in expenditure growth for warm states after air conditioning is found to be statistically larger (0.20 percentage points) than expenditure growth in cool states after air conditioning. In sum, the results in column (1) support our conceptual hypothesis as well as the notion that the introduction of air conditioning in cool states may not have resulted in significant marginal improvement in comfort levels to influence productivity and expenditures.







Having shown that the growth in state government expenditures in warm states was higher after the introduction of air conditioning, we now examine whether the growth rate of various components of state government spending were similarly affected by the introduction of air conditioning. Doing so not only provides additional support for our hypothesis but provides insight into the underlying drivers of the previous results for total state government expenditures. We consider four components of state government spending in the subsequent analysis: education spending, health spending, welfare spending, and transfer payments to local governments. Equation (4) is estimated for each component of state government spending, where the dependent variables are now the natural logarithm of each of the four components of state government expenditures. The results from these regressions are shown in column (2) through column (5) of Table 2.



The results are similar to our findings for total state government expenditures. There was positive growth in per capita expenditures in each component of state government expenditures in both cool states and warm states before introduction of air conditioning. After the introduction of air conditioning in warm states, the spending growth rate for each component except welfare was higher. In addition, the increase in the growth rates of education spending and transfer payment spending in warm states after air conditioning are greater than the increase in spending on these categories in cool states after the introduction of air conditioning, as evident from the _t_ -tests shown at the bottom of Table 2. There was no statistically significant difference between increases in spending on health and welfare between warm and cold states.



State Government Expenditures before and after Air Conditioning



Here we repeat the previous analyses but use the _level_ of real per capita expenditures instead of the natural logarithm. These results are presented in Table 3. First considering total state government expenditures, the results in column (1) show that per capita expenditures have increased after the introduction of air conditioning in both warm and cool states. Specifically, per capita expenditures increased by $5.13 per capita in warm states after the introduction of air conditioning and by $1.42 dollars in cool states after the introduction of air conditioning. As shown in the bottom of column (1), the difference in the relative effects ($3.71) for warm state and cool states is statistically significant. Considering the four components to total spending in column (2) through column (5), we find that per capita spending on all the components has increased after introduction of air conditioning in both warm and cool states. The effect of air conditioning was greater in warm states than in cool states for per capita expenditures on education, health care, and transfer payments, with significant differences of $1.83, $0.23, and $1.74, respectively.







Previous research has found that the introduction of air conditioning led to a substantial increase in the productivity of households and businesses, especially those located in warmer climates. In this paper we argued that a contributing reason for the growth in state government expenditures that occurred during the latter half of the 20th century was due in part to the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols. Our conceptual framework of state government production demonstrated that the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols was a positive technology shock that would have increased the productivity of all demand-side and supply-side groups involved in producing public sector output. By collecting and assembling a unique data set containing the various dates when air conditioning was installed in state capitols, we tested our hypothesis using a quasi-experimental empirical framework.



Our empirical work supports our hypothesis. We find that the annual rate of growth in expenditures for warmer states was significantly higher after the introduction of air conditioning in these state capitols than was the annual growth of expenditures in cooler states. In addition, we also find that the growth rates for each of several components of government spending — education, health care, transfer to local governments — were significantly higher in warmer states after the introduction of air conditioning compared with cooler states. Similar results were obtained with per capita expenditures. Both our conceptual framework and empirical results not only contribute to the literature on government growth, but they also provide a contribution to the literature on the productivity effects of air conditioning.

2Also see Garrett and Rhine (2006) for a more thorough discussion of demand-side and supply-side theories of government growth.



3The median voter’s demand for government is typically modeled as a function of income, the relative price of public goods to private goods, and tastes.



4Mueller (2003: chap. 16) provides a summary of 70 studies that examined the cost of public- versus private-sector provision of identical services. The majority of studies find that public provision is more costly.



5Examples include the federal withholding of income taxes and property tax collection through monthly mortgage payments



6Breton (1974) argues that the party in control of the legislature has an objective function that includes the probability of reelection, personal pecuniary gain, and the pursuit of personal ideals. While providing basic public goods, a monopoly government can obtain its objectives by bundling narrowly defined issues that benefit individual members of the government (see Tullock 1959).



7We discuss different types of air conditioning (e.g., window units versus central systems) later in the article.



8We argue that air conditioning was a labor-augmenting shock since government output is predominantly determined by the actions of citizens and legislators. However, the impact of technological growth on output is similar regardless of how the technology is specified (e.g., capital augmenting or augmenting both inputs).



9We assume that there was no technological progress in air conditioning. Dropping this assumption would give us a parameter _A_ that is a function of time, resulting in output growth being a function of technological growth in air conditioning over time. While technology may have improved the efficiency and cost of air-conditioning systems over time, it is unlikely there would have been significant improvements in the cooling ability of subsequent air-conditioning systems since initial air-conditioning systems already provided cool and low-humidity environments (Arsenault 1984).



10Recall that the growth rate of any variable _x_ per unit of time is _ẋ_ = ( _dx/ x_ )/ _dt_.



11It is certainly possible that the introduction of air conditioning would have also increased labor supply and hours worked. Air conditioning in state capitols made the workplace more pleasant; thus, on the margin, employees would work more hours and consume fewer leisure hours. More hours worked would then have led to an increase in output. Unfortunately, we cannot isolate this effect with the available data.



12Measures of government output have included the number of bills, acts, or statutes (termed legislative output) enacted during a specified period of time, as well as legislative session length (Mayhew 1991; Howell et al. 2002; Clinton and Lapinski 2006). More legislative output will increase the total output of the respective public sector by increasing, for example, the scope and number of agencies, the number of new social programs, and, ultimately, expenditures on these programs, and so on. In our empirical models, we use government spending rather than the aforementioned government output measures due to the annual availability and consistency of expenditure data across states compared with state-specific data on bills, acts, or statutes (e.g., more bills or statutes passed in one state does not necessary imply that that state will have higher expenditures, because expenditures depend upon the purpose of the bills and statutes). We argue that government spending is a more comprehensive measure of (the dollar value of) government activity than bills, acts, statutes, or session length because spending not only captures the effects of the number of bills, acts, statutes, and session length, but also the demand-side and supply-side factors that occur outside of the legislative session.



13All state government expenditure data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s _State Government Finances_ (various years). State population data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. All data are in CPI base-year dollars (1983).



14See www.nws.noaa.gov/os/heat/heat_wave.shtml.



15See www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml.



16Air temperature and humidity data are readily available from The Weather Underground at www.wunderground.com/history.



17The omitted cool states (Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) had air conditioning installed in their capitol buildings as late as 1992.



18In addition to ensuring a sufficient number of years pre– and post–air conditioning, we chose to end our sample in 1975 to (1) avoid potential confounding effects from the national and state fiscal crises of the late 1970s, and (2) to best capture the effects of air conditioning that are likely to be seen soon after the introduction of air conditioning rather than later years due to dilution of the potential effect over time. Similar results are obtained using alternative end-dates around 1975. These results are available from the authors.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Journalists in Pakistan have condemned government inaction with respect to climate change, which they blame for unusually harsh winter weather, and heavy snowfall.
According to The Express Tribune;
Swept under the carpet: Climate change remains little-known threat in K-P
PESHAWAR:
Climate change is a subject that is not widely discussed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa even though spending in this regard has increased by 88% over the last four years from Rs13 billion to Rs24.4 billion.
While this matter is brushed under the carpet, weather anomalies under the El Nino effect have drastically increased. Through this phenomenon, when the surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean rises, more rain and snowfall is expected in winter.
The effects of this phenomenon are likely to grow manifold in 2016.
However, this has not encouraged officials of the provincial government to put their heads together and come up with a workable strategy to address the effects of climate change.
…
Implications
Winter has become particularly harsh and the precipitation levels have also been affected.
Snowfall that was expected in February began in November. Erratic patterns of rainfall have caused flooding. This has resulted in a considerable loss to life in urban areas and dealt a heavy blow to the provincial exchequer.
According to estimates, each spell of rain in urban areas across the province has resulted in the death of at least three people.
Floods triggered by the glacial lake outburst phenomena (GLOF) phenomenon have killed more than 90 people across Malakand Division. And yet, there are a series of doubts as to what has caused these events.

Here I was thinking that the Himalayas were melting away. Luckily journalists on the scene have corrected this misapprehension, and helped us to understand that global warming causes harsher winters and a massive increase in snow accumulation. Though placing the blame on local politicians seems a bit unfair – perhaps the politicians are simply holding back, keeping their UN climate money safely deposited somewhere on behalf of the public, until next year, when global warming will cause the end of snow.

Biofeul life cycle Image: LLBL.gov
US investment in biofuels are to be expanded under proposals advanced by the US EPA.
Under the proposed rule announced Friday, the amount of ethanol in the gasoline supply would increase in coming years, just not as much as set out under federal law. That approach drew criticism from ethanol and farm groups that have pushed to keep high volumes of ethanol in gasoline.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for a robust renewable fuels standard while campaigning in Iowa, host of the leadoff presidential caucuses next year.
…
In a bid to ethanol producers, the administration also announced Friday that the Agriculture Department will invest up to $100 million to help improve infrastructure for delivering ethanol to cars, such as fuel pumps capable of supplying higher blends of renewable fuel.

When will this madness to stop? Even green journalists like George Monbiot, and former members of the UN like Jean Ziegler, people who believe wholeheartedly in the alleged dangers of anthropogenic climate change, think biofuels are a crime against humanity.
Burning hundreds of millions of tonnes of staple foods to produce biofuels is a crime against humanity. Since 2007, the EU and US governments have given lavish support to agribusinesses to fill car fuel tanks with food – compulsory targets, and tax breaks and subsidies(pdf) worth billions annually. The result? Increased hunger, land grabbing, environmental damage and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands of lives lost.
…
EU policies promoting biofuels have, since 2008, diverted crops out of food markets at the bidding of powerful agribusinesses, in their pursuit of private profit. This use of large quantities of food and commodity crops for relatively small amounts of transport fuel has had three disastrous consequences.
First is an increase in world hunger. Almost all biofuels used in Europe are made from crops, such as wheat, soy, palm oil, rapeseed and maize, that are essential food sources for a rapidly expanding global population. Europe now burns enough food calories in fuel tanks every year to feed 100 million people.

If there is ever a reckoning, a demand by victims of green policies for redress for the injustice and brutality they have suffered, at the hands of well meaning fools, the biofuel lunacy will surely top the list of wrongs to be righted.

 **Leah Shaffer**  
[www.sapiens.org](https://www.sapiens.org/).



In January 2016, Cathryn Townsend set out to live among “the loveless people.” So named by anthropologist Colin Turnbull, the Ik are a tribe of some 11,600 hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers living in an arid and harsh mountainous region of Uganda.



Turnbull studied the Ik in the 1960s and famously characterized them as “inhospitable and generally mean” in his book _The Mountain People._ He documented how young children were abandoned to starve and how people would snatch food from the elderly. Townsend, a Rutgers University anthropologist, visited the Ik decades later to see how a culture that supposedly lacked basic kindness operated.



Her interest stemmed from an ongoing, multidisciplinary investigation called [The Human Generosity Project](http://www.humangenerosity.org/), which examines why and how human cooperation, in the form of generosity, threads its way through different cultures. The project began in 2014, through a partnership between Lee Cronk, a Rutgers University anthropologist, and Athena Aktipis, a psychologist at Arizona State University. Together, the pair wanted to investigate the cultural and biological factors behind generous behaviour. Today, through this project, more than 20 participating researchers use an array of tools, including economic simulations and computer modelling, to study altruism and cooperation at nine field sites.



In certain communities, giving to those in need, with no expectation of return, is normalized and expected. The project researchers have found such behaviour around the world, including among herders and hunter-gatherers in East Africa. And [findings thus far](http://www.humangenerosity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Chapter-for-Global-perspectives-on-long-term-community-resource-management-draft-for-posting.pdf) suggest that such generous societies are more likely to survive during difficult times.



If that pattern holds up, lessons from The Human Generosity Project could be vital as the world faces a multitude of unpredictable challenges from the onslaught of climate change and increasing economic inequality. “Ultimately, it would be nice if we could encourage higher levels of cooperation and higher levels of generosity,” Cronk says.



Townsend, a member of the project, went to study the Ik to find a counterexample to generous cultures. She and her colleagues wanted to see how an allegedly “selfish” society operated. But when she arrived, she found something different: Even among “the loveless people,” there was a thriving tradition of generosity.



Generosity, as Townsend, Cronk, and their colleagues study it, can be thought of as a form of insurance. In certain communities, when disaster strikes, people spring into action to help one another, as though an unwritten contract stated: _When it’s really bad, I’ll help you because you would help me in the same circumstances_. The Human Generosity Project researchers call this spirit of reciprocal giving “need-based transfer.”



In August 2017, as Hurricane Harvey deluged Houston, Texas, for example, an informal network of boat owners from Louisiana who first emerged during Hurricane Katrina more than a decade earlier streamed into Texas to rescue those trapped in the flood. They call themselves the “Cajun Navy,” and they, too, live in flood-prone regions.



Such volunteerism is not the only way to respond to a crisis. “Humans have been organizing to manage risk associated with injury and illness since time immemorial,” Aktipis notes. In contrast to need-based transfer, many modern societies offer a market-based alternative in the form of insurance companies, which help people pool risk against future hazards. Participants pay into a network with the presumption that they will be able to tap it if injury, illness, or disaster occurs.



Aktipis explains that although insurance offers an efficient solution, in that it rapidly gathers money in one place, it’s not a perfect fix. “Oftentimes [insurance] doesn’t actually cover you when you need it,” Aktipis says. For instance, as wildfires swept through California in 2018, some residents discovered that their homeowners insurance would no longer cover them because their homes were [too close to dry brush](https://eu.vcstar.com/story/money/business/2018/08/03/california-homeowners-insurance-dropped-fire-season/788621002/).



Need-based transfer, on the other hand, is based on relationships, making it a more reliable solution. You care about your neighbours, and they care about you. “[It] insures against the uninsurable,” Aktipis says.



One of the best examples of such giving comes from Maasai herders in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who are connected by their _[osotua](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/can-vampire-bats-teach-us-friendship/)_[network](https://www.sapiens.org/culture/can-vampire-bats-teach-us-friendship/). (The word osotua means umbilical cord in the Maasai’s language.) If one of the members needs help, others in the network support him or her by giving livestock or labor, without any expectation of payback.



Anthropologist and Human Generosity Project researcher Dennis Sonkoi, himself a member of the Maasai, says he didn’t truly appreciate the protective power of osotua until he came to the United States from Kenya in 2008. At the time, he wanted to learn new resource management techniques to safeguard his homeland’s still mostly pristine forests. When he met Cronk and discussed generosity, however, he realized Maasai cultural practices, such as osotua, had likely spared his homeland’s natural resources from development thus far. It was like a “pin dropping in my thoughts,” says Sonkoi.



Computer modelling confirmed what Sonkoi had deduced. Aktipis and her colleagues used an algorithm to compare outcomes in three kinds of community: one using need-based transfer, another in which sharing resources occurs with the expectation of repayment (a practice called account keeping), and a third in which there is no sharing at all. The test was modelled after the Maasai pastoral lifestyle, which involves sharing cattle. The simulation would randomly generate drought or disease, and the researchers could see how the herds endured in each simulated society. Both forms of sharing, the simulation revealed, resulted in better herd survival than no sharing of cattle. But need-based transfer led to more pooling of resources, longer survival of the herd, and greater wealth equality than account keeping.



To date, The Human Generosity Project has turned up many examples of need-based transfer. In Fiji, for instance, extended families in villages practice _kerekere_ , the act of sharing resources when requested, without expectation of short-term repayment. In the arid and semi-arid U.S. Southwest, ranchers fill in with free labour in the event that a fellow rancher is recovering from illness or injury. They call this practice “neighbouring.” In Central Appalachia, which includes some of the poorest communities in the U.S., neighbours still help each other by providing free labour without being asked.



But Townsend journeyed to Uganda to see a community with a very different reputation from these altruistic societies that first served as a focal point for the project. In his book, Turnbull painted a dramatic portrait of the Ik, warning in the preface that the reader would be shocked by the tribe and tempted to think “how primitive … how savage … how disgusting” and “how inhuman.” (The book, incidentally, left its mark on the tribe and on Western culture, inspiring a play in 1975 called _The Iks_ by director Peter Brook and appearing in Richard Dawkins’ _The Selfish Gene_.)



But “loveless” is not at all how Townsend would describe the community she came to live with in 2016. Among a tribe that had been derided as cruel, she found notable acts of generosity. For example, she witnessed how the community provided meals for an elderly man who lived alone and shared food with Townsend without her needing to ask. “They’re really people who have very little, but the little they do have is stuff that they’re willing to share,” she says.



Townsend probes generous behaviour among the Ik using an experiment called the “[dictator game](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10683-011-9283-7).” One person (the “dictator”) is given the choice to distribute a sum of money to another player. She tweaks the game to see whether various factors will affect how much the “dictator” gives.



In general, Townsend says, the Ik are “fairly normal” in what they give away when comparing them to how members of other societies play the game. In other words, there is nothing inherently more generous or selfish about the Ik.



Turnbull, it turned out, had studied the Ik during a famine that plagued the region in 1965 and 1966. It was a time that a neighbouring tribe still calls a “year of one cup,” in reference to the meager annual rations they received from the government: one cup of maize per person.



That period of the Ik’s history revealed that there can be limits to cooperation and generosity. Extreme deprivation may prevent a community from caring for its own. But these circumstances can change. The Ik survived and, Townsend found, they maintain a culture of sharing with extended families and neighbours in need of food, shelter, or labour. Among the much-maligned “loveless people,” there was a rich tradition of need-based transfer.



The Ik’s choice to share food based on need indicates that they have passed the starting point for complex cooperative behaviour, Townsend says. When individuals begin to move beyond the most basic need to survive, forms of cooperation that further ensure survival emerge, such as need-based transfers, trade, or something she calls “demand sharing,” where successful members of a society share their surplus by default—a pattern akin to taxation.



Looking across communities, Townsend and other Human Generosity Project researchers have concluded that the world is not divided into generous versus selfish societies. Rather, charity and reciprocity are baked into human civilization. It’s the mix of cooperation and risk-pooling strategies (such as account keeping, need-based transfer, or market-based insurance) that varies—and it’s probable that societies benefit from combining them.



Going forward, The Human Generosity Project aims to understand which approaches are most beneficial in given circumstances in order to inject these concepts into other cultures. “It’s really about taking these findings and translating them into interventions that can help build the social infrastructure for dealing with challenges of the future, whether they’re disaster response or resource management,” Aktipis says.



Scaling up solutions can be difficult. [Aktipis has found](http://www.humangenerosity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Aktipis-2016-Evolutionary_Applications.pdf) that the bigger the society, the harder it is to detect cheaters in a need-based transfer system. However, Aktipis writes that a society’s belief in the supernatural may play a particularly strong role in helping people solidify generous behaviour. The Maasai, for instance, consider osotua so sacred that it would be unthinkable to take advantage of that bond. Christians in the U.S. may experience something similar when the collection plate comes by at church.



“I don’t think we share or are generous to each other for any one reason,” says Wesley Allen-Arave, a University of New Mexico anthropologist who is not affiliated with The Human Generosity Project. Allen-Arave interviewed more than 500 households in the United States about charitable giving and found that while people sometimes give to help others in need, they give much more often when they have a personal relationship with the person asking for donations.



And Townsend, too, has seen spirituality tip the scales. If she adjusts the dictator game to mention the _kijawikå_ , earth spirits in whom the Ik believe, the Ik become even more generous. They believe the _kijawikå_ will reward the generous and punish the stingy.



But she’s also observed an additional, intriguing pattern—one that further nuances our understanding of societies in need. As Townsend was conducting the dictator game, she noticed that those people who had experienced trauma in the past were more generous than others who had not. It’s an aspect of the Ik she aims to explore with further research. “It seems that might be some kind of catalyst for extraordinary generous behaviour,” Townsend says.



In retrospect, it’s ironic that the Ik were meant to be a prime example of a selfish society. To this day, the Ik barely get by. They face challenges from other tribes and drought, but they stay alive by sticking together, according to Townsend.



“The way that they cope,” Townsend says, “is not by being selfish but by sharing.”

"
"**Ethiopia appears to be fast approaching civil war. Fighting between forces loyal to the federal government headed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has claimed hundreds of lives and is threatening to rip the country apart.**
While battles rage on the ground, the two sides are also fighting a war of words. Each is trying to rally their people and also to convince the world that they have the moral high ground.
The government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF accuse one another of starting the conflict. Mr Abiy has said that army officers were murdered in cold blood.
The Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael says there was a co-ordinated attack by Ethiopian special forces and troops from neighbouring Eritrea.
Until there is an independent investigation, the rival stories remain allegations, which are being used to whip up hostile sentiments.
The two sides see Ethiopia's history totally differently.
Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a revolution in 1974. A military junta known as the Derg seized power.
It inflicted the infamous ""Red Terror"", when tens of thousands of young people were murdered by the military regime, and a prolonged civil war against insurgents across the country.
The Tigrayans remember those as years of darkness, when daily bombing raids by air force jets forced them to move only at night. In one terrible air raid in 1988 on the town of Hausien, 1,800 marketgoers died and the smoke and dust from the bombardment literally turned a bright day as dark as midnight.
A coalition led by the TPLF, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) defeated the military government in 1991.
On the day they took power, the EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, a Tigrayan, said that his number one goal was for Ethiopians to be able to eat three meals a day.
Over the EPRDF's 27 years in power the child mortality rate fell from about one in five to one in 20.
Famine was banished. Large-scale civil war was ended.
But Ethiopia did not see democracy. Prime Minister Abiy and his followers call these ""27 years of darkness"".
A rising generation of young people felt silenced and shut out of political participation.
They argue that a clique of Tigrayans dominated politics, the army and the economy for their own benefit.
Abiy Ahmed, an ethnic Oromo, was swept to power on a wave of discontent. The EPRDF chose him as party leader - and hence prime minister - in 2018.
He rapidly liberalised politics. He dissolved the EPRDF coalition and set up a new party - the Prosperity Party.
These moves won him popular acclaim. His critics acidly remarked ""to dismantle is not to build"".
Mr Abiy made peace with Eritrea, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and became a close confidante of President Isaias Afwerki, despite the Eritrean leader's long-stated aim of dismantling Ethiopia, beginning with its army.
Mr Abiy is a devout Pentecostalist and often speaks as though his mandate is from God.
His writings, including his PhD summary, read like self-help business school manuals. He has supreme confidence that dynamic, self-assured active leadership generates its own reality.
He is believed to be now drawing much of his support from ethnic Amharas in Addis Ababa and the Amhara region. But neither he nor his new party have faced any electoral test.
Yet Mr Abiy says that the TPLF crossed a red line when it held regional elections in September.
The federal government had not authorised those elections and the Prosperity Party was not able to contest.
The TPLF counters that national elections had been scheduled for earlier in the year and repeatedly postponed - partly because of Covid-19 - and that the government's term had expired without a firm date for a poll. They say that theirs is the only regional government with a mandate from the voters.
The political battleground is Ethiopia's constitution.
The country has a federal system in which the major ethnic groups administer their own regions.
This was adopted in 1994 shortly after the EPRDF took power. Mr Abiy wants to do away with it.
Uniquely, Ethiopia's regional states have a right to self-determination.
The spirit of this provision was that if there were to be a democratic collapse at the centre, a region could go its own way.
This was demanded not just by the Tigrayans, but by leaders from other historically marginalised groups, including the Oromo - Ethiopia's largest ethnic group.
The TPLF has not demanded separation. But the logic of today's confrontation is leading them down that path.
TPLF political domination was resented by many Oromos and other ethnic groups in southern Ethiopia. But all of them treasured the self-government articles in the constitution.
Indeed, one of these groups - the Sidama - voted to have their own federal state last year.
This year, Mr Abiy has turned against the Oromo youth movement that brought him to power.
After the killing of the Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa, more than 150 people died in riots and Mr Abiy clamped down and imprisoned upwards of 10,000 people.
Among them are Jawar Mohamed, founder of the Oromo Media Network, who faces terrorism charges. Another is veteran opposition leader Lidetu Ayalew who remains in prison despite a court ordering his release.
Armed gangs calling themselves the Oromo Liberation Army killed more than 50 Amhara villagers in Wollega district two weeks ago.
Mr Abiy blamed ""Ethiopia's enemies"" determined to ""rule or ruin the country"" - code words for the TPLF.
His power base is among a mostly Amhara political elite that wants to abolish the federal system in favour of a unitary government system.
There are many good reasons to criticise ethnic federalism, but Ethiopia's diverse groups have made it clear that - well armed and politically aware - they cannot be ruled against their will.
Reports from the war front indicate a massacre of Amhara civilians. Reports from Addis Ababa and other towns tell of the mass round-up and internment of Tigrayans.
Government forces have been accused of imposing a news blackout on Tigray, and of mounting a total blockade on the region, halting supplies of humanitarian aid.
The TPLF says it has captured Eritrean troops who invaded Tigray.
Mr Abiy's declared war aim is to impose federal control on Tigray.
No observer of Ethiopia believes that is possible. Eritrea's president, who some believe may have been involved in the planning of the military operation in Tigray, has not spoken.
Ethiopia's conflict is escalating out of control by the day.
This will probably cost tens of thousands of lives. And as the government's own 2002 national security white paper foresaw: ""The prospect of disintegration cannot be totally ruled out.""

"**China's leaders are signalling that they are preparing to change how they deal with Hong Kong, following months of pro-democracy protests.**
Shen Chunyao, director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters they were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive is appointed and removed.
He did not elaborate on what exactly might change.
The statement could further inflame protests, which began in June.
There were demonstrations on Friday and more are expected over the weekend.
Initially protesters were demonstrating against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
These proposals have now been dropped, but the protests widened to include four more demands, including the implementation of complete universal suffrage (the right of almost all adults to vote in elections).
The protests, the largest since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, have presented a serious challenge to China's leaders, who have painted the demonstrators as dangerous separatists and accused foreign powers of backing them.
**by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent**
It's on! â¦but what is ""it""?
A four-day plenum session in the Chinese capital this week clearly had the Hong Kong political crisis way up on its agenda.
Shen Chunyao, a senior official from the Hong Kong and Macau Basic Law Committee, was one of the speakers at a press conference after the session. This is no accident.
He said they were looking to ""perfect"" the system of appointing and replacing Hong Kong's leader. What does that mean?
The chief executive is currently selected by a committee stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists; protesters are calling instead for direct elections to choose the city's leader. There's nothing to indicate that any changes would be moving in the direction activists want but, in truth, we simply don't know and the party seems to like it that way.
The communiquÃ© also pledged to establish ""a legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security"" in Hong Kong.
Analysts think this could mean the central government introducing national security laws which could be imposed on Hong Kong from Beijing but - again - who knows?
Mr Shen said ""of course"" the topic of the protests was discussed at the plenum, a meeting of China's ruling Communist Party leaders which took place behind closed doors this week
He said the leaders discussed ways ""to improve the central government's mechanism of appointing and removing Hong Kong's chief executive and other key officials"", adding that Beijing would ""improve the central government's system of governance over the region"".
Currently, Hong Kong - a former British colony - operates on a basis known as ""one country, two systems"", giving residents unique freedoms which mainland China does not enjoy.
But protesters say those freedoms have eroded. Meanwhile, the plenum has emphasised that ""one country"" is the foundation for ""two systems"", according to news agency Reuters."
"The essential ingredient for all growing plants is CO2 in the atmosphere. But organic matter in the soil is also of value for the plant life on which we all depend. It can only be put into the soil by growing plants (including fungi) and the bacteria, worms and other microbes that live on and beside the plants. All plant and soil carbon comes, in the end, from CO2 in the atmosphere.

Leaves collect carbon and oxygen from the air, roots collect minerals, water and nitrogen plus some carbon from the soil. Plants can live without carbon in soil (as in hydroponics), but not without carbon dioxide in the air.
The biggest stupidity in the carbon debate is treating carbon dioxide as an atmospheric pollutant. All food for plants and animals comes from this gas of life – it is not a pollutant.
The second biggest stupidity in the soil carbon debate is the biofuel myth that we can use the “waste” from crops or grasslands to produce motor spirit without affecting soil fertility and productivity. There is no “waste”in a sustainable farming operation. All organic “waste” should be mulched back into the soil, to feed the soil microbes that add humus, that holds mineral nutrients and soil moisture. Every tonne of carbon trucked off from a bit of land reduces soil productivity and has to be replaced from the CO2 in the air.
Once the biofuel gets burnt in motors, it gets back to the soil or the oceans eventually via carbon dioxide in the air (unless some fool has buried the CO2 in geo-sequestration cemeteries).

"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  —   Back in his days as a test pilot at   Air Force Base in Ohio, Gus Grissom had a message for his wife, Betty. “If I die, have a party,” he said. Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the   memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40. Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and NASA officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men. At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather’s alma mater, Purdue University. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and NASA spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down. “It is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,” said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. “And that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet. ” Ms. Grissom said this year’s ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a NASA tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. “I thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,” she said. This year’s event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a   space fan. “We need heroes today, and these were heroes,” said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian. People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends. Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. “It’s not the distance  —   it’s in here,” he said, pointing to his heart. “I’m just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings. ” Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie “Abandon in Place,” the site was decorated with three     floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event’s grande dame as people lined up to speak with her. “I want you to know it is such an honor,” said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. “The first time you walked in my shop and said, ‘I’m Betty Grissom,’ I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way. ” “I never quit,” Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered. Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger. “Just two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,” said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. “They met at the pad and decided to invite the families. ” The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee’s wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White’s daughter Bonnie. “This is the families’ memorial,” said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. “Not the Air Force and not NASA. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price. ” When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: “Hey, we’re burning up. ” Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated. “I don’t want any of this forgotten,” Ms. Grissom said. “Gus Grissom was a human being. ” Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously “screwed the pooch”  —   as Tom Wolfe put it in “The Right Stuff”  —   when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility. Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a   telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G. I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an   Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea. Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the   the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral. When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend’s home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had “already died 100, 000 deaths” living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband’s coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said. The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the “space burbs” by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed “Togethersville” because of its exclusivity. In the late ’60s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue NASA’s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350, 000. On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, “The stars are out tonight. ” Earlier, she spoke of how her husband’s sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, “I’m pretty sure he got to the moon before they did. ” She added: “Of course he didn’t make it, but in spirit I think he was already there. ”"
"Brent Musburger is calling it a career at ESPN after being the    man in the booth at sporting events enjoyed by millions of Americans, most prominently when he was the lead voice for CBS Sports in the 1980s. Musburger, who is 77, said he was leaving active sportscasting to help his family get a sports handicapping business started and to use some of the millions of airline miles he has earned for recreational travel. His last game will be the   men’s basketball game Tuesday night. That takes him back to Rupp Arena, where he called Villanova’s upset over Georgetown in the final of the N. C. A. A. tournament in 1985. Musburger and ESPN said his comments about the Oklahoma football player Joe Mixon that were criticized as insensitive during the Sugar Bowl this month had nothing to do with his exit. On the broadcast, Musburger said that he hoped Mixon, who had been suspended for a year after punching a woman and breaking her jaw, would make the most of his second chance. He did not initially talk about Mixon’s victim. A former sportswriter, Musburger’s broadcast fame took off through his work on “N. F. L. Today,” the pro football pregame show. He broadcast the N. B. A. college basketball, the Masters golf tournament and tennis  —   most of CBS’s marquee events. He was behind the mike for one of college football’s most memorable plays, Doug Flutie’s “Hail Mary” pass that beat Miami for Boston College in 1984. He confessed to Flutie later that it took him awhile to identify Gerard Phelan, Flutie’s roommate, as the receiver of that pass  —   and Flutie told him he didn’t know, either, until he had run off the field. Musburger was abruptly dropped by CBS in 1990 in what was perceived as a salary dump, then went to work for ABC and ESPN. “Brent made every event feel larger,” said Stephanie Druley, ESPN senior vice president for events and studio production. “To me, there is probably not a greater storyteller as a    person. He can spin a yarn like nobody else, and it made games definitely more enjoyable to watch. ” Musburger’s opportunities for national exposure grew more limited in recent years when ESPN assigned him to its SEC Network for college football. But he still called college basketball regularly, and even though ESPN has been trying to save money lately by cutting   talent, Druley said the network had no interest in seeing him leave. Sportscasting today “has become more and more numbers driven, advanced statistics and everything,” Musburger said. “That’s fine. I was never going to change because I’m a people guy. I like pulling up a chair in a saloon with a cold beer and telling stories. ” Musburger took heat in 2013 when he extolled the attractiveness of an Alabama quarterback’s girlfriend, a controversy he found silly. “I called a beauty queen beautiful,” he said. “Are you kidding me?” He said he hoped people felt comfortable listening to him. “Not everyone approved of everything I said,” he said. “I understand that. I come from a sportswriting background, and I’m not afraid to take a position on certain things from time to time. But for the most part, I thought people should be coming to a game to escape for three hours and forget about what their individual problems are. ” He said he was not ready to fully retire (“I don’t do shuffleboard well,” he said) but his decision lets ESPN escape from an uncomfortable decision. Having a broadcaster of college games publicly identified with a sports handicapping business wouldn’t fly. That accounts for the odd timing of his departure in the middle of the college basketball season his family wants the site fully operational by the N. C. A. A. men’s basketball tournament. If anything, the move will force Musburger to change a pat answer when he is approached by fans. “They always ask me my favorite game, and I always say, ‘The next one,’ ” he said. After Tuesday, that will no longer be applicable."

[ **climatescience.org.nz**](http://www.climatescience.org.nz/blog/australian-bushfires-read-what-poet-henry-lawson-wrote-in-1911)



Did legendary Australian poet Henry Lawson call his country’s bushfires climate change? He most certainly did not. It’s nothing more than Mother Nature at her fiery worst. Tragic as it may well be, it’s happened before and it will happen again. It’s just a question of how they live with and manage the Australian bush. [Fail to ‘back burn’](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/its-ok-to-burn-colonists/) during the cooler, less windy months, the fuel load will surely grow and sooner or later, due to either man or lightning strike, it will surely burn, often with dire consequences for those who choose to build and live nearby.

"**Vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there, a top UN official said.**
""Shortages of basic commodities such as flour and fuel are being reported,"" Catherine Sozi, UN country director in Ethiopia, told the BBC.
Fighting in Tigray between the federal government and a regional force broke out eight days ago.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed as fears of an escalating conflict grow.
Long-standing tension between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, boiled over into military clashes last week.
The Ethiopian government has also carried out airstrikes on military targets in Tigray.
As a result of the fighting at least 7,000 civilians have crossed the border into Sudan. They fled either the fighting itself or the fear of attack and there are concerns that many more have been forced from their homes but are still living within Tigray.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The UN supplies at least 600,000 people in Tigray with food relief on a regular basis and ""assistance... is bound to be interrupted if the supplies are not restocked and if movement is not permitted"", Dr Sozi told the BBC's Newsday programme.
Given that banks are closed in Tigray, she also warned of cash shortages affecting people's ability to buy food.
But the UN is committed to staying ""as long as our security can be reassuredâ¦ we will go on as long as stocks are not exhausted"".
Getting information from the region is hard as roads have been blocked, the internet is down and telephone lines have been cut.
But in a tweet on Thursday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his government was providing assistance in the areas of Tigray controlled by the federal army. This could not be independently verified.
Both the federal government and Tigrayan authorities are scaling up efforts to mobilise resources indicating that the conflict may go on for some time, the BBC's Kalkidan Yibeltal reports from the capital, Addis Ababa.
On Wednesday, Tigrayans were told by the TPLF to ""defend"" themselves from ""flagrant aggression"" from the federal government.
Demonstrations and blood donation campaigns have also been held by groups in other parts of Ethiopia showing their support for the federal army.
The government is sounding confident and has urged Tigrayan forces to surrender. The prime minister has tweeted that the west of Tigray has been ""liberated"" but again this cannot be verified.
Defence Minister Kenea Yadeta said it would not be long before the TPLF leaders were on trial. He also talked of appointing an interim administration in areas taken by federal troops.
Parliament has voted to strip dozens of MPs from Tigray of their immunity from prosecution.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy - who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea - dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run.
The row worsened in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government."

**Introduction**



The national debate over what to do, if anything, about the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has become less a debate about scientific or economic issues than an exercise in political theater. The reason is that the issue of global climate change is pregnant with far‐​reaching implications for human society and the kind of world our children will live in decades from now.



Introducing nuance and clear‐​headed reason to this debate is something of a struggle. As Cato Institute chairman William Niskanen has noted, for any international action to merit support, all of the following propositions must be proven true:



The case for any one of those statements is surprisingly weak. The case for a global warming treaty, which depends on the accuracy of all those statements, is shockingly weak. My talk this afternoon will concentrate on a few of the most important of those propositions.



 **A Continued Increase in the Emission of Greenhouse Gases Will Increase Global Temperature**



First off, this subject is terribly complex; the 2nd Assessment Report of the International Panel on Climate Change is 500 pages long with 75 pages of references. As Ben Santer, author of the key IPCC chapter that summarized climate change science, has noted, there are legions of qualifications in those pages about what we know and what we don’t. But, unfortunately, those qualifications get lost in the journalistic and political discourse.



I will dispense with an introductory discussion of the rudimentary elements of greenhouse theory. I’m sure you’re all familiar with it. Largely on the basis of computer models, which attempt to reflect what we know, what we assume, and what we can guess, many people believe that continued emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gasses will increase global temperatures anywhere from 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius.



At this point, I should note that those estimates have been coming down over time. The 1990 IPCC report predicted a little more than twice this amount of warming, and projections have been declining ever since as better models have been constructed. One wonders, at this rate, whether the models will continue to predict increasingly smaller amounts of warming until even the upper bound forecasts become so moderate as to be unimportant.



 _ **What We Know – And What We Don’t Know**_



Here’s what the data say, about which there is little debate; ground‐​based temperatures stations indicate that the planet has warmed somewhere between .3 and .6 degrees Celsius since about 1850, with about half of this warming occurring since WWII. Moreover: 



But even here, we have uncertainties. Shorter sets of data collected by far more precise NASA satellites and weather balloons show a slight cooling trend over the past 19 years, the very period during which we supposedly began detecting the greenhouse signal. Those data are generally more reliable because satellite and balloons survey 99% of the earth’s surface, whereas land‐​based data (1) only unevenly cover the three‐​quarters of the earth’s surface covered by oceans and (2) virtually ignore polar regions.



While some of that cooling was undoubtedly a result of Mt. Pinetumbo and the increased strength of the El Nino southern oscillation, those events fail to explain why the cooling occurred both before and after those weather events were played out and why, even correcting for those events, the temperature data show no significant warming during the 19‐​year period.



While it is true, as critics point out, that the satellite and weather balloons measure temperatures in the atmosphere and not on the ground



Even assuming that ground‐​based temperature data are more reflective of true climate patterns, that still leaves us with a mystery. When fed past emissions data, most of the computer models predict a far greater amount of warming by now than has actually occurred (the models that are reasonably capable of replicating known conditions are a tale unto themselves to which I’ll return in a moment). Notes the IPCC, “When increases in greenhouse gases only are taken into account … most climate models produce a greater mean warming than has been observed to date, unless a lower climate sensitivity is used.” Indeed, the most intensive scientific research is being done on why the amount of warming that has occurred so far is so low. After all, a .3-.6 degree Celsius warming trend over the last 150 years all but disappears within the statistical noise of natural climate variability. 



There are three possibilities:



 ** _Indirect Evidence of Global Temperature_**



Scientists who argue the first possibility cite the largely incompatible, imprecise, and incomplete nature of even recent land‐​based temperature records. Those observations, of course, are absolutely correct. Instead, these scientists concentrate on indirect evidence suggesting that the planet has been warming and has been warming significantly over the relatively recent past. They typically point to precipitation trends, glacial movement, sea level increases, and increased extreme temperature variability as suggestive of a significant warming trend. Let’s take each of these issues in turn. 



Precipitation Trends:



Glacial Movement: 



Sea Level: 



Extreme Weather Variability: 



**_The Masking Theory_**



The second theory is more widely credited. The most likely masking culprit according to the IPCC are anthropogenic aerosols, primarily sulfates, that reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space and thus have a cooling effect on the climate. That aerosols have this affect is widely understood. But as ambient concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols continue to decline (yes, global pollution is on the decline, not on the rise), the argument is that this artificial cooling effect will be eliminated and the full force of anthropogenic greenhouse gas loading will be felt in short order.



This theory becomes particularly attractive when the details of temperature variability are considered. The warming, as noted a moment ago, is largely a nighttime, winter phenomenon; patterns, which suggest increased cloud cover, might have something to do with the temperature records.



The best evidence marshaled thus far in support of the masking theory was published in _Nature_ in the summer of 1996. The study, by Santer et al., used weather balloon temperature data from 1963 to 1987 to determine temperature trends in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere, where virtually no sulfates exist to counter greenhouse warming. The article, which caused a sensation in the scientific world, showed marked warming and seemed to confirm the argument that, when sulfates were absent, warming was clearly evident. The article was featured prominently in the 1995 IPCC report as strong evidence that artificial sulphate masking was behind the dearth of surface warming.



Yet it turns out that, if one examines a fuller set of data from the Southern Hemispheric (1958–95, 13 years’ worth of data that Santer et al. did not use), no warming trend is apparent. Moreover, if we carefully examine the land‐​based temperature records, we discover that it is the regions most heavily covered by sulfates – the midlatitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere – that have experienced the greatest amount of warming. That, of course, is the exact opposite of what we should discover if the masking hypothesis were correct. 



**_Climate Sensitivity_**



As I noted a few moments ago, a few of the climate models come reasonably close to replicating past and present climatic conditions when historical data are entered. Those models, interestingly enough, predict the least amount of future warming based on present trends. The two most prominent of those models, those of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the U.K. Meteorological Organization, predict warming of only 1.2 degrees Celsius and 1.3 degrees Celsius over the next 50 years; the lower‐​bound estimates reported by the IPCC. 



The argument for moderate climate sensitivity to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions largely rests on three observations: 



**_The Anatomy of the “Consensus”_**



Despite all the uncertainty, we are constantly told that there is a “consensus” of scientific opinion that human‐​induced climate changes are occurring and that they are a matter of serious concern. That belief is largely due to the weight given the IPCC report, where this consensus is supposedly reflected. Here is the talismanic sentence in the executive summary of that report, a summation of the 500 pages written not by the scientists who produced that report but by a small, politically appointed executive committee: “the balance of the evidence suggests” that human influences explain some of the detected warming. Now, compare that statement with this, which appears on p. 439 of the report:



On p. 411, the statement is even clearer:



Counterbalancing IPCC’s note of cautious concern are other, far harsher judgements about the scientific evidence for global climate change:



A recent joint statement signed by 2,600 scientists under the auspices of the environmental group Ozone Action is less than compelling. A survey of those signatories by Citizens for a Sound Economy concludes that fewer than 10% of them had any expertise at all in any scientific discipline related to climate science.





 **An Increase in Average Temperature Will Generate More Costs Than Benefits**



How costly might global warming prove to be 100 years hence? Well, that largely depends on the distribution of warming through time and space. It also depends on how much warming occurs; will it be the upper bound or lower bound estimate that comes to pass?



 ** _Benign Warming Patterns_**



For what it’s worth, I tend to agree with the IPCC’s summary statement that the “balance of the evidence suggests” that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions explain some of the detected warming observed thus far over the past 100 years. But as noted earlier, that warming has been extremely moderate, has been largely confined to the northern latitudes during winter nights, and has exhibited no real detrimental effects thus far. I expect those trends to continue and that’s the main reason why I doubt that the costs of warming will be particularly consequential. 



The present observed warming pattern is certainly consistent with our understanding both of atmospheric physics, which indicates the following:



Virginia state climatologist Pat Michaels concludes that



Indeed, this warming scenario predicts benign, not deleterious, effects on both the environment and the economy. 



But what if the warming turns out to be more serious than this? What if the median estimate reported by the climate models comes to pass: a 2.5 degree Celsius warming over the next 100 years?



There have been six particularly comprehensive or prominent serious studies undertaken to estimate the macroeconomic consequences of such a warming. None of them gives us much reason for alarm. The main reason is that most modern industries are relatively immune to weather. Climate affects principally agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which together constitute less than 2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Manufacturing, most service industries, and nearly all extractive industries remain unaffected by climate shifts. A few services, such as tourism, may be susceptible to temperature or precipitation alterations: a warmer climate would be likely to shift the nature and location of pleasure trips. 



**_1974 Department of Transportation Study_**



Back when the world was more concerned with global cooling than global warming, the DOT brought together the most distinguished group of academics ever assembled before or after to examine the economic implications of both cooling and warming. In 1990 dollars, the DOT study concluded that a .9 degree Fahrenheit warming would save the economy $8 billion a year. Only increases in electricity demand appeared on the “cost” side of the warming ledger. Gains in wages, reduced fossil fuel consumption, lower housing and clothing expenses, and a slight savings in public expenditures appeared on the “benefit” side. The amount of warming examined by DOT is roughly equivalent to what the ground‐​based monitors suggest the planet has experienced over the last 100 years. 



**_1986 EPA Study_**



Crafted mostly by internal staff (not one of whom had any economics training), the EPA produced few figures, and no quantitative estimates of costs or benefits, failed to even refer to the DOT study of only 12 years earlier, and was littered with qualifications like “could” and “might.” While conceding that global warming would reduce mortality slightly, the report nonetheless concluded impressionistically that warming would probably cost the economy.



 _ **1991 Nordhaus Study**_



Perhaps the most prominent academic study of the economic consequences of warming was produced by Yale economist William Nordhaus, an informal adviser to the Clinton administration. Nordhaus calculates that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would cost the economy approximately $14.4 billion in 1990 dollars, or about 0.26% of national income. On the “cost” side, Nordhaus places increased electricity demand, loss of land due to flooding, coastal erosion, and the forced protection of various threatened seaboard properties. On the “benefits” side, Nordhaus places reductions in demand for nonelectric heat. He concludes that agricultural implications are too uncertain to calculate but estimates that losses could be as great as $15 billion annually while gains could reach $14 billion annually. Finally, Nordhaus assumes that unmeasured impacts of warming could dwarf his calculations, so he arbitrarily quadruples his cost estimates to produce an estimate of warming costs somewhere around 1% of GDP. 



_**1992 Cline Study**_



One of the most extensive treatments of the economic consequences of climate change and climate change abatement was produced by economist William Cline of the Institute for International Economics. Instead of assuming a median – 4.5 degree Fahrenheit – estimate of warming a century hence (as all other studies tend to do), he assumes 18 degree Fahrenheit warming by 2300 and works back from there. Moreover, Cline includes an extremely low “social” discount rate to calculate the value of future investment. Despite all this, his preliminary calculations reveal that, for every $3 of benefits to be gained by emission restrictions, $4 of costs is incurred. Only by applying arbitrary adjustments after his initial calculations are performed does he find that the benefits of control exceed their cost; but that won’t occur, even according to Cline, for at least a century.



Even more controversial are Cline’s allocations of costs and benefits of warming. He finds no benefits whatsoever. Costs are found not only in the traditional places (sea level rise, species loss, and moderately increased hurricane activity) but also in areas where most economists have found benefits: agricultural productivity, forest yields, overall energy demand, and water demand. His net estimate is that, spread out over 300 years, the costs of warming will be approximately $62 billion annually. 



Unfortunately, it is the Cline study that receives the lion’s share of attention from the IPCC. The existence of contrary studies is often simply ignored in the document.



 _ **1997 Mendelsohn Study**_



Robert Mendelsohn of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies calculated late last year that a temperature hike of 2.5 degrees Celsius would lead to a net benefit of $37 billion for the U.S. economy. Farming, timber, and commercial energy sectors all benefit, with agriculture enjoying “a vast increase in supply from carbon fertilization.”



 ** _1998 Moore Study_**



Economist Thomas Gale Moore of Stanford University might be termed the “anti‐​Cline.” Whereas Cline has reported the steepest potential costs of warming, Moore’s review of the literature this year in addition to his own investigation pegs net annual benefits of the median warming scenario at $105 billion. While Moore too finds costs in species loss, sea level rise, increased hurricane activity, and increased tropospheric ozone pollution, he finds moderate benefits in agricultural productivity, forest yields, marine resource availability, and transportation. Moreover, he argues that major benefits will accrue from reduced energy demand, improved human morbidity, an increase from miscellaneous amenity benefits, lower construction costs, greater opportunities for leisure activities, and increased water supplies. 



**_Historical Evidence_**



There is some historical precedent for optimism regarding the consequences of the median computer model warming scenario. The period 850 AD – 1350 AD experienced a sharp and pronounced warming approximately equivalent to that predicted by the median warming scenario; 2.5 degrees Celsius. That period is known to climate historians as the Little Climate Optimum. While there were some climatic dislocations such as coastal flooding, there were marked increases in agricultural productivity, trade, human amenities, and measurable improvements in human morbidity and mortality.



Only when the climate cooled off at the end of the Little Climate Optimum did trade drop off, harvests fail, and morbidity and mortality rates jump largely due to an increase in diseases, particularly the plague.



The reason for optimism here is that human civilization was far more weather dependent a millennia ago than it is today. And even our more primitive, weather dependent ancestors appeared to do fairly well during their episodic warming. 





**Early Measures to Control Emissions Are Superior to Later Measures**



Assuming even the worst about the consequences of unabated anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and their economic consequences does not necessarily imply that emissions controls today make more sense than emissions controls tomorrow.



There is no compelling need to act now. According to a recent study by Wigley et al. in _Nature_ , waiting more than 20 years before taking action to limit anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions would result in only about a .2 degree Celsius temperature increase spread out over a 100‐​year period.



Why might we want to wait a couple of decades before acting? First, we might profitably “look before we leap.” There are a tremendous number of uncertainties that still need to be settled before we can be reasonably sure that action is warranted. Second, we can’t anticipate what sorts of technological advances might occur in the intervening period that might allow far more efficient and less costly control or mitigation strategies than those before us today. Given the low cost of waiting, it would seem only prudent to continue to try to answer the open questions about climate change before making major changes to Western civilization. 





**Controlling Emissions Is Compatible with a Modern Industrialized Economy**



The restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions agreed to in Kyoto are not in any way minor or insubstantial. Reducing U.S. emissions 7% below what they were in 1990 by the year 2012 means reducing emissions almost 40% below what they would be absent the agreement. Adjusted for expected population growth, this means a 50% reduction per capita in greenhouse gas emissions. Virtually everyone agrees that these targets can only be met only by reducing fossil fuel consumption, the main source of virtually all anthropogenic emissions.



Environmentalists argue that such reductions can occur relatively painlessly, that we can cut the amount of fuel we use by 50% and actually produce even more economic growth as a result. Virtually no mainstream academic economist shares that opinion. The two most prominent and well respected academic specialists — Robert Stavins of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and William Nordhaus of Yale — maintain that only the functional equivalent of a $150 per ton carbon tax can accomplish this, which they calculates would reduce GDP by 3%, or, as Stavins puts it, “approximately the cost of complying with all other environmental regulations combined.” A recent survey in Forbes summarizing the recent macroeconomic modeling that’s been done on the subject broadly agrees with Stavins’s and Nordhaus’s estimates.



Then there is the matter of whether the emissions cuts presently on the table are even worth the bother. According to the best computer model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Kyoto agreement, even if signed by all the nations of the world, would reduce global warming by an infinitesimal .18 degrees Celsius over the next 50 years. That’s not much bang for the global warming buck.



The reason is that, according to all observers, actually stopping any further global warming from occurring (assuming the median predictions of present climate models) would require a 70% reduction of present emissions, roughly the equivalent of completely abandoning the use of fossil fuels. This, according to Jerry Mahlman, director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton, “might take another 30 Kyotos over the next century.” Indeed, environmentalists are frequently quoted as saying that, ultimately, we will need to completely restructure society around the objective of energy efficiency and sustainability, the economic and political costs of which we can only imagine.



Unless we’re prepared to see that journey to its completion, there’s little point in even bothering to sign the Kyoto agreement because, in and of itself, it will make virtually no difference to our planetary climate. 





**Conclusion: A Matter of Perspective**



Let me wind up my comments on a provocative note. We are constantly urged to act because “we shouldn’t be gambling with our children’s future.” In fact, our kids are marshaled endlessly to shame us into planning for the worst … for their sake. But even assuming the absolute worst case about future planetary climate change and the most extreme estimates about what that climate change will ultimately cost society, conservative estimates are that our grandchildren 100 years hence will not be 4.4 times wealthier than we are – as they would be absent global warming – but will instead be only 3.9 times wealthier than we are at present.



I ask you, would you have been comfortable had your grandmother impoverished herself so that you could be 4.4 times wealthier than she rather than 3.9 times wealthier than she? Remember also that increased energy costs are borne most directly by the poor, who spend a greater portion of their income on energy than do the wealthy. Moreover, the poor who will pay the highest price of greenhouse gas abatement will be those in the developing world who will be denied the opportunity to better their lifestyle and standard of living. They will be “saved” from the fate of industrialization and experiencing even the most rudimentary comforts of Western consumer societies.



We’re not really gambling with the lives of our grandchildren. They’ll be just fine regardless of how the climate plays itself out. We’re gambling with the lives of today’s poor, who stand to lose the most if we act rashly.



Thank you very much. I will now entertain any questions you may have.

"By Emeritus Professor Lance Endersbee, AO.
The accompanying paper, Climate Change is Nothing New [PDF, 1.2MB], was published in the March 2007 issue of the journal, New Concepts in Global Tectonics (http://www.ncgt.org/).
I was invited to prepare the paper by the Editor as a scientific response to the IPCC report, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policy Makers, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, February 2007. The paper can also be regarded as a response to the movie by Al Gore, and to the report on carbon trading by the London financier, Sir Nicholas Stern.
The key points of the paper are:-


The Earth, the Sun, and indeed the Cosmos, comprise an inter-acting, dynamic, and evolving system. It is all in a state of continuing change. There is no steady state. In contrast, the IPCC assumes that the Earth was in a steady state until 250 years ago, which was upset by Man through increasing use of carbon fuels, and that led to atmospheric changes and consequential global warming.
In geological time, the climate of the Earth has been influenced by the immediate environment of the solar system as it travels through our Milky Way Galaxy. There were times when the solar system was enveloped in vast clouds of gas and dust, causing extreme cooling on Earth, and ice ages lasting for millions of years. In recent times the solar system has been travelling through space that is virtually empty, enabling a benign climate in which our civilization has flourished.
The Sun is the dominating influence on the climate of the Earth. That simple fact is not recognised by IPCC. The Sun is a churning, quivering body of hot plasma, generating intense electromagnetic fields in space that envelop the Earth. The electromagnetic behaviour of the Sun dominates and determines the electromagnetic and geotectonic response of the Earth, and thereby climate.
The climate of the earth has always changed. There have been times lasting centuries when the Earth was warmer or colder than now. The period of 500 years from 800 to 1300 AD was warmer. It brought prosperity to Europe. It is known as the Medieval Warm Period. Many great cathedrals were built, the Vikings discovered a verdant land they called Greenland, and there were vineyards in England. After that, for the next 450 years from 1300 to 1750 AD, Europe experienced a progressively colder climate. It is known as the Little Ice Age. It was especially cold for 100 years from 1600 to 1700 AD, when there was famine and starvation in the northern parts of Europe. In London, the River Thames often froze in winter.
A key part of the IPCC report is the presentation of evidence of parallel increases in both global temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is claimed by IPCC that the increased carbon dioxide emitted by Man is causing global warming. In my paper it is shown that the cause and effect relation is exactly the opposite; that natural global warming has caused an increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, simply because of the reduction in solubility of carbon dioxide in sea water with increasing sea temperatures.
It is the vast surface area of the oceans that determines the interchange of gases between the oceans and the atmosphere. The oceans breathe carbon dioxide and methane in and out with the seasons, and the oceans release carbon dioxide and methane with the natural warming caused by the Sun. If in the future there is a significant decrease in the electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, the Earth will cool down, and the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere will then decline.
IPCC refers to a rise in sea levels over the past century as evidence of global warming caused by Man. I show that the rise is due to the great exploitation of non-rechargeable groundwater over the past century which has led to a net addition to the hydrosphere, and thereby, the oceans.
Air pollution and global warming are scientifically separate issues. Global warming is natural and global. Atmospheric pollution is man-made and mostly close to the sources of emission. The IPCC have locked themselves into a scientifically untenable position by interweaving air pollution and global warming.
The deadly pollution of dust, acid gases, and water vapour entering the atmosphere in many cities of the world should be the focus of action. A large number of cities are most unhealthy places, with a lower expectation of life. The problems are not global but local. The correction of the problems must be industry and city-centred.
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, it is essential to all life. There is no need for carbon trading or geosequestration. The concept of carbon trading has been advocated by IPCC, and by many governments signing the Kyoto agreement, and is being welcomed by the financial community. But carbon trading has not arisen from the normal operation of the market. It is the result of fears about global warming created by IPCC and others. It thereby presents risks to investors. If it comes to be recognised that global warming has a natural cause, and the fears subside, the value of carbon credits will then drop to zero, and the market in carbon trading will collapse.

So, the Australian Greens have yet another fairy king trying on the party’s coveted golden clown shoes. When the party’s Oberon, **Bob Brown** , abdicated the toadstool throne, he was replaced by **Richard di Natale** , the ass-headed Nick Bottom of Australian politics. Eschewing the chance to show their progressive credentials and install a Titania as queen of the fairy parade, the party has opted for yet another white male, **Adam Bandt**.



Bandt was quick to show that he’s as far away with the fairies as the party faithful could desire.



New Greens leader Adam Bandt has stood by his accusations that Scott Morrison and big business are responsible for “killing people.”



After replacing Richard Di Natale on Tuesday, Mr Bandt said the Prime Minister’s climate change approach would lead to “three times as many deaths” as the 2019-20 bushfires.



Like all little pixies, Bandt pipes a merry tune about “science”, while demonstrating unequivocally that he doesn’t know science from fairy dust.



On Wednesday, the Greens leader said he was “just stating the science.”



“My point is that Scott Morrison, when he says that we are on track to meet our emissions targets, we are on track for more than three times as much warming as we’ve witnessed so far,” he told ABC News.



“And that means more than three times as much devastation.”



Almost none of that is remotely true. The only factual statement in Bandt’s farrago of nonsense is that PM Morrison – correctly – states that Australia is more than meeting the targets set by the **Paris Agreement**.



When Bandt excitedly babbles that “we are on track for more than three times as much warming”, he merely shows that he can’t comprehend the difference between a fairy tale and a science textbook. “Three times as much warming” is something even the IPCC admits is a far-fetched, worst-case scenario which is almost certain not to occur. The IPCC regularly publishes a range of scenarios, from best to worst-case. As history shows, its worst-cases have never come to pass; in fact, what climate alarmists have characterised as wild optimism has actually been the real-world case.



Pixie Bandt’s claim that three times as much warming means “three times as much devastation” only further demonstrates his idiotic failure to comprehend that climate is a non-linear system.



Still, Bandt has a long history of subscribing to leftist fairy tales. After all, his PhD thesis (which he tried to [hide from public scrutiny](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/how-greens-deputy-leader-adam-bandt-hid-his-phd-thesis/news-story/19665bd3193cb8f57f70660fc2749989)) was on **Marxism** , and praised “the divine violence of the revolutionary general strike”. It was during his university days that Bandt also opined that the Greens were just another “bourgeois party”, albeit one that was ripe for a Marxist takeover.



Of course, the idea that a supposedly environmentalist party would be used by shadowy Marxists as a catspaw for their radical, far-left agenda is just another of Bandt’s fairy-tales, surely?

The Week That Was: 2015-08-29 (August 29, 2015) Brought to You by SEPP (www.SEPP.org) The Science and Environmental Policy Project
THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Divergence: It is summertime in the US, and temperatures are warmer. Several readers have asked TWTW for comments on the recent claims that July 2015 was the hottest month ever and similar announcements by certain US government entities, including branches of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These entities are making strong public statements that the globe continues to warm, and the future is dire. A humorist could comment that the closer we are to the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11, the hotter the globe becomes.
However, there are three significant forms of divergence that are being demonstrated. One divergence is the increasing difference between atmospheric temperatures and surface temperatures. The second divergence is the growing difference between temperatures forecast by models and observed temperatures, particularly atmospheric temperatures. This leads to the third divergence, the difference between the activities of what can be called the Climate Establishment and what is observed in nature.
The atmospheric temperatures are reported by two independent entities: the largely NASA-financed UAH entity at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) in California. The surface temperatures are reported by NOAA, NASA, and Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office, combined with those of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia. These measurements depend, in part, on the historic record maintained by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). Unfortunately, for more than two decades, the historic record of the surface temperatures has been adjusted numerous times, without adequate records of the details and the effects. The net effect is an inflation of a warming trend, particularly obvious in the US where excellent historic records continue to exist. The UAH data have been adjusted, but the adjustments and effects have been publically recorded.
The divergence between the temperatures forecasted by the global climate models and the observed temperatures is becoming extremely obvious, particularly with the observed atmospheric temperatures. The adjustments to surface temperatures lessen this divergence somewhat, particular with the latest adjustments by the NCDC, where superior measurements taken by fixed or floating buoys were inflated to correspond with earlier, inferior measurements taken by ships. The director of NCDC, Tom Karl, was a lead author in the paper announcing this change. As a result, we should see announcements that sea surface temperatures, and global surface temperatures, are increasing, although the increase may be strictly an artifact of human adjustments rather than an occurrence in nature.
The questionable adjustments in reported surface temperatures leads to the third form of increasing divergence – the differences between what is reported by the Climate Establishment and what is occurring in nature. The Climate Establishment can be defined as those who embrace the findings of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), particularly the assertion of a high confidence, a high degree of certainty, that human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming. Simply because data is adjusted to reflect the IPCC view, does not mean that the IPCC view is occurring.
The greenhouse effect takes place in the atmosphere, yet it is not being observed in the atmosphere. The satellite data, independently verified by four sets of weather balloon data, clearly shows it is not. There has been no significant warming for about 18 years. These data are the most comprehensive temperature data existing and are largely independent of other human influences that bias surface data such as urbanization, including building of structures and impervious surfaces, and other changes in land use. Those who broadcast claims of the hottest year ever, based on adjusted surface data, are actually emphasizing the divergence between science practiced by the Climate Establishment and Nature, and are not engaged in a natural science.
Unfortunately, many government entities and government-funded entities are involved in the Climate Establishment. The leaders of such government entities and funding entities demonstrate a lack of concern for institutional credibility, no respect for the scientific bases on which such institutions were built, including those who came before them and those who will replace them, and will leave their institutions in an inferior condition, rather than strengthen them.
It is important to note that not all government-funded entities are so involved. The National Space Science & Technology Center (NSSTC) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), which is largely funded by the federal government (NASA) is a notable exception.

Ice Ages: Nature Communications published a new study proclaiming evidence that greenhouse gas concentrations drive the advance and retreat of glaciers, including those in the last Ice Age. The assertion was immediately emphasized by various organizations in the mass media. The opening sentence illustrates the quality of the work: “The ongoing retreat of glaciers globally is one of the clearest manifestations of recent global warming associated with rising greenhouse gas concentrations.” At best, the statement is a logical fallacy, petitio principii, better known as “begging the question.” That is, the main point of contention, the influence of greenhouses gases on temperatures, is assumed to be conceded.
The logic used in the abstract is similar to that Al Gore used in his film “An Inconvenient Truth.” Studies of carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperatures from ice cores with finer resolution than used by Gore showed that the inflection points [significant change in direction] do not match, and the CO2 inflection points lagged behind temperature inflection points by up to 8 to 10 centuries. If CO2 is the primary driver of temperature change, changes in its concentration should occur first.
In informal correspondence, physicist Donald Rapp, author of Ice Ages and Interglacials: Measurements, Interpretation, and Models, makes similar observations about the study, and states that the authors may have confused cause with effect. He emphasizes that no one really understands why and how the last ice age ended over a 10,000 year period from about 18,000 to 8,000 years ago. The hypotheses that have been advanced are highly speculative. We know that as the earth came out of the ice age, CO2 levels rose as the oceans warmed, but why did the oceans warm? See links under Un-Science or Non-Science?
*********************
Dramatic Sea Level Rise? A newly formed NASA Sea Level Change Team issued a press release stating it found dramatic increase in sea levels. According to team member Steve Nerem: “Given what we know now about how the ocean expands as it warms and how ice sheets and glaciers are adding water to the seas, it’s pretty certain we are locked into at least 3 feet of sea level rise, and probably more.” The date not specified, except it is sometime in the future. Further, it may be completely unrelated to carbon dioxide.
The press release goes on to state: “Scientists estimate that about one-third of sea level rise is caused by expansion of warmer ocean water, one-third is due to ice loss from the massive Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and the remaining third results from melting mountain glaciers. But, the fate of the polar ice sheets could change that ratio and produce more rapid increases in the coming decades.”
If the claims can be substantiated, the findings are significant, and disturbing. But as of August 29, there is little else to review other than the press release. The world-wide sea level rise that is claimed to be observed, 3 inches since 1992, significantly exceeds that observed using traditional tidal gauges. We must await the details, otherwise the whole episode just becomes an example of science by press release. See links under Lowering Standards.

Limits of Knowledge: The New York Times has an op-ed with the provocative, and perhaps misunderstood headline “The Case for Teaching Ignorance.” Understanding the limits of knowledge is an important part of education. Learning to form penetrating questions are often critical to advancing knowledge. The approach explained in the article is refreshing, compared with the unfounded certainty commonly found in professional life. See link under Other News that May Be of Interest.
*********************
Other Causes of Warming? According to recently published research in Advances in Space Research, the surface temperatures of many rocky planets and moons in the solar system can accurately be predicted over a broad range of atmospheric conditions and radiative regimes only using two forcing variables: top-of-the-atmosphere solar irradiance and total surface atmospheric pressure. The planets and moons considered are Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Titan (a moon of Saturn), and Triton (a moon of Neptune). If the research is verified, then the case for global warming from increased greenhouses gases becomes weaker.
This analysis brings up an interesting issue raised by some global warming alarmists. At the surface, the atmospheric pressure of Venus is about 90 times that of earth at its surface. As the ideal gas laws indicate, this pressure, alone, will result in far greater temperatures on Venus than on earth. The atmosphere of Venus is about 96% carbon dioxide. Yet, many alarmists have warned that Venus is an example of what will happen on earth with the an increased greenhouse effect, not pressure, if human created greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere from three to four parts per 10,000.

1. Why Is the EPA Cleaning Up Mines?
Private mining companies have already shown they are better equipped to deal with the mess.
By Rhett Larson, WSJ, Aug 21, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-is-the-epa-cleaning-up-mines-1440196476
SUMMARY: The author, an associate professor of law at Arizona State University, opens with the blunt statement: “Images of the bright-yellow Animas River in Colorado, fouled by millions of gallons of toxic wastewater accidentally released from an abandoned mine by contractors working for the Environmental Protection Agency last week, prompt a serious question: Why was the EPA even managing this waste in the first place? Mining companies that have the skills and experience to clean up such sites should be doing this work.”
“There are more than 557,000 abandoned hard rock mines in 32 states throughout the country. These sites often have been inactive for decades, and the responsible party either no longer exists or cannot be found. Abandoned mines can have devastating effects on the environment, and mismanaging them can lead to catastrophic spills like the one in the Animas River. Acids, heavy metals and toxic sediments from these spills can persist for years, preventing use of the water and harming agriculture, fishing, wildlife and recreation.”
The author cites specific examples of successful clean-up operations performed by private companies, then states that mining companies are reluctant to take on such tasks. If the EPA “disaster had occurred at the hand of a mining company, the firm and its leaders would face a public relations nightmare, and perhaps a legal one. Mining companies are understandably reluctant to risk such liability without some assurance that they will not be punished for accidents resulting from reasonable efforts to clean up somebody else’s mess.
 
“Three reforms can get the best people involved in cleaning up pollution from abandoned mines. First, mining companies that voluntarily agree to help remediate orphaned mines should be eligible for “Good Samaritan” permits for cleanup operations. These permits could provide that, if mining companies use the best available pollution prevention measures and otherwise comply with permit requirements, they would be shielded from liability under state and federal law.
 
“Second, companies that generate net ecological benefits by remediating orphaned mines should qualify for expedited permitting for other projects. New mines typically must obtain permits under the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and other environmental laws before they begin operations. When a mining company agrees to remediate an orphaned site in connection with a new mining project, the regulatory system should make such permits less expensive and easier to obtain.
 
“Third, states could form environmental credit markets that would enable mining companies to make money from activities that help the environment. When a mining company remediates an abandoned mine and improves water quality, it could receive credits allowing certain other limited discharges into that river or aquifer, so long as those discharges do not violate water quality standards. Even if the mining company does not itself have any use for the credits, it could sell them to another firm—say, a manufacturer whose operations release pollutants into the water.

2. Improved Storm Modeling Since Katrina Changes Insurance Equation
By Ben DiPietro, WSJ, Aug 27, 2015
http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2015/08/27/improved-catastrophe-modeling-since-katrina-changes-insurance-equation/
SUMMARY: “Hurricane Katrina changed the way insurance companies and some corporations build catastrophe models and calculate the potential damage from a big storm, leading to more accurate damage predictions, better risk assessments and more strategic and cost-effective insurance policy decisions, some risk management experts said.
 
“Catastrophe storm models from when Katrina hit 10 years ago were fairly crude and largely used by insurers to assess portfolio exposure–basically attempting to understand how much risk a company or insurer had in a given geography, wind zone, earthquake zone or flood zone, said Steve Truono, vice president of global risk management and insurance at Starwood Hotels & Resorts. But those models in many cases were inaccurate and weren’t necessarily developed or tailored to address complications that might arise, he said.”
The article emphasizes the more accurate modeling by insurances companies of the costs of replacing losses, including how they collect and assess data from storms, rather than better modeling of significant storms. All this applies to risk management as seen at the corporate level.

3. The EPA’s Own Email Problem
Another government employee, another private account, another crashed hard drive.
By Kimberley Strassel, WSJ, Aug 27, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-epas-own-email-problem-1440718297
Discussing the subpoena of Phillip North by a federal court in regard to EPA’s denial to a permit for the Pebble mine in Alaska, the author states: government workers don’t use private email because it is “convenient.” “They use private email to engage in practices that may be unsavory, or embarrassing, or even illegal. Let’s be clear about that.
 
“Mr. North was, until a few years ago, a biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency, based in Alaska. Around 2005 he became enmeshed in reviewing the Pebble Partnership’s proposal to develop a mine there. Mr. North has openly admitted that he was opposed to this idea early on, and he is entitled to his opinion. Still, as a government employee his first duty is to follow the law.
 
“In the normal course of law, Pebble would file for permits and the Army Corps of Engineers would get the first say over approval. The EPA has a secondary role. But records show that EPA officials, including Mr. North, had no intention of letting the process get that far. They set about to “pre-emptively” veto the mine, before Pebble could even file for permits. But for the EPA to so flagrantly insert itself into the process, it needed cause. This is where Mr. North and his private email come in.
 
“The biologist was deeply involved in most of the work on Pebble, and would later brag about his role in killing the project. He had briefed high-level officials; drafted an early “options paper” laying out the veto strategy; and taken a star role in the “science” the EPA would use to justify the 2014 veto. But perhaps Mr. North’s biggest contribution was as serving as a liaison to (and coordinating with) anti-mine activists.
 
“The EPA would ultimately claim that it acted ‘in response to petitions’ filed against the mine in 2010 by Native American tribes. But those petitions didn’t spring from nowhere. According to documents Pebble has given a federal court, Mr. North was working with those outside activists to engineer the petitions—from inside the EPA. He also worked with the activists, including a lawyer representing the tribes, to hone the EPA’s veto strategy. And he did this via a private email address. Why? Because he shouldn’t have been doing any of it.”
 
It gets weirder, in that Mr. North was one of those Obama employees whose government hard drives conveniently crashed. Only after Congress started investigating the Pebble scandal did the EPA inform lawmakers that Mr. North’s crash just happened to wipe out documents from the period in question.
 
“Mr. North, meanwhile, has fled the country. He retired from the EPA in the spring of 2013. The House Oversight Committee in July of that year asked him to appear for an interview. They went round and round on a possible date, until in October 2013 he claimed he was on a world boat tour, and that moreover his boat had suffered damage. He also hired a lawyer, who has not made Mr. North available for in-person or telephone interviews. He’s thought to be in Australia.
 
“That’s why Pebble in mid-August asked a federal court to subpoena Mr. North and his documents. The EPA for its part has continued to suggest that Mr. North was only a junior employee who had no real role in the veto process.”
After quoting the judge who expressed that the court would be surprised if the EPA were not as anxious as Pebble to obtain testimony and access to documents controlled by Mr. North, the author concludes that agencies such as the EPA “know exactly why their employees use private email. And they know the release of it means nothing but trouble.”

Sweden’s Nuclear Shutdown A Sign Of What’s To Come
By Michael McDonald, Oil Price.com, Aug 27, 2015
http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Swedens-Nuclear-Shutdown-A-Sign-Of-Whats-To-Come.html
“Sweden is a prime example of this. The country generates almost 35 percent of its electricity from nuclear power – just shy of the amount that it generates from all renewable sources combined.
“As governments around the world have opted to subsidize renewable power while taxing other forms of power, renewable supplies have increased. This supply increase in turn has pushed down wholesale power prices, which has led to lower profits for conventional utility companies. Then as renewable use has expanded, production costs have fallen dramatically leading to still more investment in renewables, greater supply of wholesale electricity, and even more pain for utility companies.”

"**Ethiopia's forces have captured two towns in the northern region of Tigray where soldiers loyal to the local political party are fighting the central government.**
Tigray's leader confirmed the losses but said it was a temporary setback and vowed to defeat the government.
Ethiopia's prime minister has said that his army is advancing on the Tigrayan capital Mekelle.
Hundreds of people have reportedly died in two weeks of clashes.
Verifying information from Tigray is hard due to a blackout on most communications.
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopia's central government.
When Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed postponed a national election due to coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two groups. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate to lead the country.
The government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons, which the TPLF denied. In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive, accusing the TPLF of treason.
Government forces seized the towns of Shire and Raya after a three-day deadline given by Prime Minister Abiy to Tigray's forces to surrender expired on Tuesday.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was born in Shire, confirmed to a local TV station that his soldiers had lost control of the towns in the south and west of Tigray. But he said their victory was temporary and he vowed to defeat Mr Abiy's forces.
As fighting raged on Wednesday, Mr Gebremichael said his forces were inflicting ""heavy defeats on all fronts against the forces that came to attack us"". He called on all Tigrayans including children to mobilise and join the ""struggle"".
Ethiopian officials accused the TPLF of destroying four bridges close to the Tigray capital Mekelle, but the group denied the claims.
The prime minister suggested on Tuesday that the fighting was coming to an end, saying ""the final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days"".
At least 27,000 people have fled over the northern border to Sudan as the UN warned a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"" was unfolding.
TPLF adviser Fesseha Tessema, a former Ethiopian diplomat, told the BBC that civilian sites in Mekelle were being bombed by federal forces.
""[The people of Tigray] haven't done anything wrong, they are in their own homes, churches,"" Mr Fesseha said.
The federal government has denied targeting civilians and said that air attacks are aimed at the Tigrayan military.
**By a BBC reporter in Mekelle**
A deadly air strike just before noon on Tuesday killed two people and injured others in Mekelle, doctors said. It is not yet clear who carried it out.
I was out on the streets shortly afterwards and saw an ambulance carrying people to hospital. Witnesses told me a young boy - one of the wounded - died on arrival, and three others are still receiving treatment.
Because the banks had reopened, people in the city were out shopping at the time the incident took place. There have been other strikes in the city which did not cause casualties but caused a lot of damage to buildings.
I went out to assess the situation and found houses with collapsed walls and roofs, and bridges destroyed. Artillery has created craters on key roads. Local people have been milling around in the affected areas, discussing the attacks and the damage.
The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said that thousands of people have been fleeing the fighting.
The agency was ""on stand-by to provide assistance in Tigray when access and security allow"" spokesman Babar Baloch said.
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday last week.
Mr Abiy has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings. The TPLF has denied involvement, saying it will welcome an independent international investigation.
Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.2
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries.
_ **Correction 20 November 2020: This story has been corrected to say the government has taken the town of Raya, not Aksum.**_"

Christopher Monckton of Brenchley sends this article by Grant Goldman, a popular radio host in Sydney, Australia.
In July 1937 when the Marco Polo Bridge incident launched Japan’s aggression against China, that was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against Japan.
In March 1939 the German occupation of Czechoslovakia was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the Nazis.
In November 1956 Soviet troops overrunning Hungary was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the USSR.
In October 2013 the massacre of Syriac Orthodox Christians and destruction of 14 churches in Sadad in Syria was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the Jihadis responsible.

The likelihood that there are more slaves in the world today than at any previous time in human history is not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the slave trade.
Three terrible genocides were perpetrated in the twentieth century.  By the Turks against Armenian, Assyrian and Greek Christians in 1915, by the Soviets against the Ukrainians in 1932-1933, and of course by the Nazis against the Jews from 1939 to 1945.
None of these horrible events prompted Australian religious leaders to act with one voice.
Why am I telling you all this?
What is important enough for Australian religious leaders purporting to represent Anglicans, Catholics, Hindus, Buddhists and Jews, to get together and write to the Government and the Opposition demanding action?
Well, a person named Thea Ormerod, representing a numerically insignificant outfit called Australian Religious Response to Climate Change, drafted a letter for them all to sign, calling for a 40% cut in the level of carbon dioxide emissions compared with 1990 levels by the year 2025, and an 80% cut by 2030.

We are talking here about the comprehensive economic destruction of Australia, with mass unemployment, grinding poverty, widespread hunger and disease, shocking child mortality and truncated lifespans for everybody who is not amongst the elite.
Thea Ormerod is likely related to Neil Ormerod, who is Professor of Theology at the Australian Catholic University.  Oh yes, this is the educational institution which a month ago awarded two scholarships, each for full tuition fees for four years, to honour executed drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.
This leads me to observe that the worthy goal of getting Australia to lead a worldwide campaign to abolish capital punishment is not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action.   But strong action against carbon dioxide is what they want.
The Church of England has been pushing the anti-energy barrow for some time. They actually ran a Global Divestment Day on February 14 this year.  It attracted little attention because St Valentine’s Day is the day when most people are busy chatting each other up and eating chocolate.

What issues do you want your Church to concentrate on?  World peace? Ending poverty?  Defeating disease?  Combatting crime?  Protecting minorities? Saving children from sexual abuse?  Helping the homeless?  Maybe, just maybe, even campaigning against sin?
What about preaching forgiveness?   That is what churches used to do.  Or do you want your church to act like basically a subsidiary of the Greens?
It’s your Church, and it’s your money that pays the bills.  If the Churches do forget that, then people will get baptised, married and buried online.  It’s cheaper.
The Church of England is part of a push to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions compared with 1990 levels by the draconian figure of 80% in the next fifteen years, which would make Australia unable to feed, house and clothe Australians.
In Britain, North America and Australia the Church of England has declared war on coal, through a combination of divestment programs and propaganda from the pulpit.
Time for some facts about coal.   The gerontologist and evolutionary biologist Caleb Finch tells us that since the early 1800s life expectancy in Europe has doubled.  The single greatest factor in the longevity revolution has been coal.

Beginning in the eighteenth century and accelerating into the nineteenth century, coal made possible stunning increases in productivity.  Coal saved from destruction the forests of Britain which by the mid eighteenth century were rapidly disappearing.
Coal dramatically reduced pollution caused by cooking and heating with wood and animal dung.  Coal permitted large scale smelting of metals. Coal made possible modern medical science and modern agriculture. Coal opened the way to commerce and freedom of movement on a scale never before imagined.
Thanks to coal, for the very first time ordinary workers who were not members of the aristocracy nor of the clergy had leisure time.  Life was still tough, but thanks to coal life rapidly improved.
Instead of being permanently enslaved to tasks like collecting wood to heat and to cook, women had the opportunity to learn to read and become educated or musical or artistic or political or charitable as they wished.
Coal made possible the growth of democratic institutions and, vitally important, the abolition of slavery.   Nineteenth-century Britain saw the flowering of culture with bands, orchestras, choirs, drama societies, literary societies, trade unions, and, of course, the flowering of the Church of England.


I’ll mention some of the great hymnists of the late eighteenth century and the nineteenth century.  In chronological order (top left to bottom right): John Wesley (1703-1791); Edward Perronet (1726-1792); William Cowper (1731-1800); John Newton (1725-1807); Reginald Heiber (1783-1826); Joseph M. Scriven (1819-1886); Matthew Bridges (1800-1894); Carl Gustav Boberg (1859-1940).
Thanks to coal, hymn books could be printed cheaply and thanks to coal there were trees left in the land to make the paper.
In Britain, by 1860 around 400,000 coal industry workers were each producing around 175 tonnes of coal in a year for an annual total of seventy million tonnes of coal.  In 1913 around 1,100,000 coal industry workers were each producing around 264 tonnes of coal in a year for a total of 290 million tonnes.
This great increase in coal production coincided with wonderful progress in every aspect of society.  People lived longer, ate better and their purchasing power increased year by year.

As the twentieth century dawned, coal was already popularising the wonderful blessing of electricity.  The former major disadvantage of coal-fired power – sulphur dioxide emissions – was overcome with fluidised bed combustion using limestone, and coal has continued as the world mainstay of electrical power.

Tragically, 1.3 billion people – eighteen percent of the world’s population – have no access to electricity and so are deprived of all the wonderful things we take for granted.  Expansion of coal production is vital as part of the energy mix necessary to offer the poor and disadvantaged of the world an escape route from poverty, misery and short lifespans.

By declaring war on coal, people who purport to represent the Church of England are committing a terrible crime against the world’s poorest people.
My suggestion to the people purporting to lead the Church of England is re-read the Parable of the Talents.  It’s still there in Matthew Chapter 25, verses 14-30.

The Parable of the Talents (etching): Lucas van Doetechum (floruit 1554-1572)

James E. Hansen wiped sweat from his brow. Outside it was a record‐​high 98 degrees on June 23, 1988, as the NASA scientist testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during a prolonged heat wave, which he decided to cast as a climate event of cosmic significance. He expressed to the senators his “high degree of confidence” in “a cause‐​and‐​effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming.”



With that testimony and an accompanying paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Mr. Hansen lit the bonfire of the greenhouse vanities, igniting a world‐​wide debate that continues today about the energy structure of the entire planet. President Obama’s environmental policies were predicated on similar models of rapid, high‐​cost warming. But the 30th anniversary of Mr. Hansen’s predictions affords an opportunity to see how well his forecasts have done—and to reconsider environmental policy accordingly.



Mr. Hansen’s testimony described three possible scenarios for the future of carbon dioxide emissions. He called Scenario A “business as usual,” as it maintained the accelerating emissions growth typical of the 1970s and ’80s. This scenario predicted the earth would warm 1 degree Celsius by 2018. Scenario B set emissions lower, rising at the same rate today as in 1988. Mr. Hansen called this outcome the “most plausible,” and predicted it would lead to about 0.7 degree of warming by this year. He added a final projection, Scenario C, which he deemed highly unlikely: constant emissions beginning in 2000. In that forecast, temperatures would rise a few tenths of a degree before flatlining after 2000.





James Hansen issued dire warnings in the summer of 1988. Today earth is only modestly warmer.



Thirty years of data have been collected since Mr. Hansen outlined his scenarios—enough to determine which was closest to reality. And the winner is Scenario C. Global surface temperature has not increased significantly since 2000, discounting the larger‐​than‐​usual El Niño of 2015–16. Assessed by Mr. Hansen’s model, surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon‐​dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect. But we didn’t. And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong. Models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have, on average, predicted about twice as much warming as has been observed since global satellite temperature monitoring began 40 years ago.



What about Mr. Hansen’s other claims? Outside the warming models, his only explicit claim in the testimony was that the late ’80s and ’90s would see “greater than average warming in the southeast U.S. and the Midwest.” No such spike has been measured in these regions.



As observed temperatures diverged over the years from his predictions, Mr. Hansen doubled down. In a 2007 case on auto emissions, he stated in his deposition that most of Greenland’s ice would soon melt, raising sea levels 23 feet over the course of 100 years. Subsequent research published in Nature magazine on the history of Greenland’s ice cap demonstrated this to be impossible. Much of Greenland’s surface melts every summer, meaning rapid melting might reasonably be expected to occur in a dramatically warming world. But not in the one we live in. The Nature study found only modest ice loss after 6,000 years of much warmer temperatures than human activity could ever sustain.



Several more of Mr. Hansen’s predictions can now be judged by history. Have hurricanes gotten stronger, as Mr. Hansen predicted in a 2016 study? No. Satellite data from 1970 onward shows no evidence of this in relation to global surface temperature. Have storms caused increasing amounts of damage in the U.S.? Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show no such increase in damage, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product. How about stronger tornadoes? The opposite may be true, as NOAA data offers some evidence of a decline. The list of what didn’t happen is long and tedious.



The problem with Mr. Hansen’s models—and the U.N.’s—is that they don’t consider more‐​precise measures of how aerosol emissions counter warming caused by greenhouse gases. Several newer climate models account for this trend and routinely project about half the warming predicted by U.N. models, placing their numbers much closer to observed temperatures. The most recent of these was published in April by Nic Lewis and Judith Curry in the Journal of Climate, a reliably mainstream journal.



These corrected climate predictions raise a crucial question: Why should people world‐​wide pay drastic costs to cut emissions when the global temperature is acting as if those cuts have already been made?



On the 30th anniversary of Mr. Hansen’s galvanizing testimony, it’s time to acknowledge that the rapid warming he predicted isn’t happening. Climate researchers and policy makers should adopt the more modest forecasts that are consistent with observed temperatures.



That would be a lukewarm policy, consistent with a lukewarming planet.

We’d be remiss if we didn’t acknowledge Winter Storm “Cato” is probably going to do a pretty good job limiting the government tomorrow, as well as shortening tempers throughout the country if it jams up the BosNYWash flyway on the day before Thanksgiving. Surely many climate alarmists will blame this garden‐​variety coastal cyclone on global warming.   
  
  
Rational minds should know that these types of storms are largely powered by the midlatitude jet stream. The jet is nature’s way of dissipating the difference in energy between warm tropical air and polar cold on a rotating earth—the larger the temperature difference is between the tropics and the North Pole, the more powerful it is. Greenhouse gas‐​induced climate change warms the poles much more than the tropics, which reduces the temperature difference and should make storms of Cato’s ilk _less_ powerful and/​or frequent.   
  
  
Many pundits are fond of blaming these storms on changes in the “polar vortex” (which itself has existed ever since the earth acquired an atmosphere) caused by global warming, a notion that was thoroughly debunked by Colorado State’s Elizabeth Barnes last year in _Geophysical Research Letters_.

"HAENGCHI VILLAGE, South Korea  —   Each day hundreds of visitors, many with young children, make a pilgrimage to Haengchi Village, where Ban   was born 72 years ago. They wander through a replica of Mr. Ban’s old   house. They learn about his personal journey to the United Nations, where he was secretary general for 10 years. Despite criticism of his tenure there, Mr. Ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of South Koreans. School textbooks, for example, celebrate him as a “man who made South Korea proud. ” And many South Koreans want Mr. Ban to be their next president, succeeding Park   whom the National Assembly voted to impeach last month on corruption charges. When Mr. Ban arrived home on Jan. 12, crowds of   turned out at the airport, waving flags and shouting, “Ban   please save this country!” Yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid, especially among the nation’s progressives. They say he is trying to be part of the establishment yet against it at the same time  —   a “Mr. ” in the words of critics. (The word “ban” in Korean means “half. ”) Mr. Ban calls himself “a child of the United Nations,” part of a generation of South Koreans who remembered United Nations handouts in the destitute years after the   Korean War, as well as   United Nations Forces who fought in the war. Many of his contemporaries view the United States as South Korea’s savior and protector. “I am ready to give my all to uniting the divided country and making South Korea a   nation,” Mr. Ban said. “As United Nations secretary general, I have seen why some nations prosper and why some fail. ” His advocates say he is a seasoned,   diplomat who can best deal with both North Korea’s advancing nuclear weapons program and President Trump, who has raised questions about Washington’s trade and defense commitments to its allies. One of the first things Mr. Ban did after his homecoming was support the deployment of an American missile defense system that has angered North Korea and China. Critics say his place in the establishment makes him unsuitable as a figure who can restore trust in government. They believe the political class has been disgraced by Ms. Park’s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks whether Ms. Park should be formally unseated. As Mr. Ban crisscrossed the country after his return, paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors, his detractors trailed him, holding signs that called him “an opportunist,” or worse. “He has spent his entire life on the sunny side,” said Moon   an opposition leader who comes in ahead of Mr. Ban in surveys on presidential hopefuls. “He is not the kind who shares the people’s desperate desire for change. ” Lee   who served as South Korea’s prime minister when Mr. Ban was its foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, called Mr. Ban “a diplomat who looks twice but does not leap. ” Mr. Ban won his United Nations job 10 years ago with the support of Roh   then the president, a progressive who handpicked him as a candidate. Critics called Mr. Ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives, including Ms. Park. His popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of Ms. Park’s scandal. Since he has returned home, Mr. Ban has defined himself as a “progressive conservative” who can mend an ideologically fractured country. But some local news media suspect him of   while he tries to find an ally among the existing political parties or to woo enough lawmakers away to form his own. They also call him a “slippery eel,” accusing him of being notoriously vague on tough questions, a trait that has sometimes served him well as a diplomat but now is under harsher scrutiny as he considers a presidential bid. As United Nations secretary general, he praised the deeply unpopular agreement Ms. Park struck with Japan to end a dispute over “comfort women,” or Korean sex slaves for Japan’s World War II army. But as a presidential hopeful, he began raising questions about the deal, saying that an agreement that failed to satisfy the surviving victims was not enough. With his popularity ratings stuck behind Mr. Moon’s, the usually   Mr. Ban began bridling at criticism. When journalists recently dogged him with hard questions and then wrote articles that accused him of being   over the comfort women issue, he called them names. (He later apologized.) He has also called himself a Mr. Clean, responding to the outcry over Ms. Park’s scandal. But to people weary of recurring corruption scandals among political leaders and their families, Mr. Ban’s claim has already lost some of its luster this month, the United States indicted his nephew, who is a New York real estate broker, and his younger brother in South Korea on charges of attempting to pay bribes to facilitate a Korean company’s sale of a   commercial building in Vietnam. Mr. Ban denies involvement. Yet here in his home province of Chungcheong, pride in Mr. Ban is compared to a personality cult by his critics. Streets, marathons and   contests are named after him. Songs are written about him, including one that calls him “Korea’s favorite son who embraced five oceans and six continents. ” In Eumseong, the seat of the county that includes this village, a park displays a circle of bronze busts of Mr. Ban and other former United Nations secretaries general. And this hamlet, which has only a dozen households, is a veritable Ban   theme park. A monument erected by the local Ban clan calls him a “sacred peak of the world” whose “warm smile dissipated international conflicts. ” Visitors stroll around the “Ban   Peace Land,” a small park with a granite monument in the shape of the United Nations headquarters surrounded by flags of member states. In the “Ban   Memorial Hall,” biographical sketches and video clippings tell how Mr. Ban, with his quiet tenacity and “warm charisma,” overcame his humble origin and became the “president of the world. ” “If I sleep now, I may dream, but if I study now, my dream will come true,” goes one of the 19 Ban   sayings in a museum handout. Older villagers remember the young Mr. Ban walking on a dirt road with his eyes fixated on an English textbook. (His English skills gave him his first big break: As a teenager in 1962, he excelled at an   contest, winning a Red   trip to the White House, where he met President John F. Kennedy and resolved to become a diplomat.) A roadside motel here added more rooms because so many newlyweds believed that if their firstborns were conceived with the blessing of the energy of the mountains surrounding the village, they would grow up to be luminaries like Mr. Ban. “I brought my children here so they can learn from Secretary General Ban’s life that there is no easy way in life but that if you try hard, your dream comes true,” said Lee   42, who recently visited here with his daughter and son. Kim   65, a   owner who recently visited Mr. Ban’s birthplace, said Mr. Ban’s “vast experiences and  ” will make him a great president, enabling him to avoid the kind of mistakes that led to Ms. Park’s scandal. “It’s an honor to have him in our country,” he said. But another visitor, Kim   also a Ban fan, feared that Mr. Ban might not survive the thrust and parry of domestic politics. “I wonder why he risks ruining his image by entering domestic politics,” he said. “It’s a mud pit, and he could end up losing all. ”"

What’s one big difference between the left and the right?



Tens of thousands of armed, angry right-wingers hold a political rally, and there’s no violence, just one minor arrest – and they leave the place cleaner than they found it.



Right-wing scum!



A gun-rights rally in Richmond that brought thousands of people from across the country to protest a push by Virginia Democrats for comprehensive gun control ended peacefully without any major incidents.



This is despite the legacy media trying to play up scare-stories of violence and “far-right fascists”, for all they were worth.



Threats of violence had escalated in the days leading up to Monday’s demonstration following reports that white supremacists, armed militia and other extremist groups were planning to attend.



 **Gov. Ralph Northam** , a Democrat, had declared a state of emergency late last week and beefed up security around the Capitol…



The president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League – the nonprofit organizer of the rally – told Fox News that it wasn’t the pro-gun groups who had been stoking fear of potential violence at the event.



“It’s the Democrats,” **Philip Van Cleave** said. “It’s almost like they want something to happen. It sounds crazy, but they keep doing it and you have to start wondering if that’s intentional.”



Get a few dozen left-wingers like Antifa together and, like all bullies and thugs, they start to feel all big and brave with their mates around them. Violence inevitably follows. Along with dozens of arrests. The sole arrest out of these 20 000 gun-totin’ far-right fascists was for…a bandana.



The Joint Information Center, made up of representatives from the Capitol, Richmond and Virginia State Police, estimated 6,000 people were allowed into a fenced-in area of Capitol Square.



They estimated another 16,000 were outside the gates, though event organizers said many more had turned out. Many of those outside the barrier carried long firearms and wore bright orange stickers that read “Guns Save Lives.”



Capitol Police said a 21-year-old woman had been arrested and charged with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. Law enforcement said they warned the woman twice to remove a bandana covering her face but she had refused.



Even worse than their deliberate, provocative law-abiding peacefulness, these fascists actually picked up their garbage!



Protesters in support of the Second Amendment sought to leave Richmond, Virginia cleaner than they found it this morning.



Video from WSET reporter **Caroline Eaker** shows demonstrators collecting garbage in plastic bags.



The man called it “a birthday present for Ralph Northam,” the commonwealth’s governor.



That stands in stark contrast to the self-declared environmentalists who take to the streets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs of mid-September, there have already been 77 peer-reviewed scientific papers authored by several hundred scientists linking solar activity to climate change.  There were 43 as of the end of June, as seen here.   In other words, there have been 34 more papers linking solar forcing to climate change made available online just since July.
This publication rate for 2016 is slightly ahead of the pace of published papers linking solar forcing to climate change for  2015 (95 Solar-Climate papers ) and 2014 (93 Solar-Climate papers).   At this rate, it is likely that a list of 300+ scientific papers linking solar forcing to climate change will have been made available between 2014 and 2016.
In addition, there have already been 41 papers published in science journals this year linking natural oceanic oscillations (i.e., ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO) to climate changes.  There were 27 such papers as of the end of June.
The solar-ocean oscillation climate connection has gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community.  For example, see “35 New Scientific Publications Confirm Ocean Cycles, Sun Are the Main Climate Drivers”
The latest papers linking solar activity as well as ocean oscillations to climate changes are listed below.   Not only do these papers describe solar activity and ocean oscillations as the dominant mechanisms of climate change, they provide evidence that the modern, post-1950 period does not contain the highest temperatures of the last few hundred years.  In fact, these papers each document that temperatures during some periods of the 1700s and/or 1800s were just as warm or warmer than present temperatures.
That periods with much lower CO2 concentrations (of about 280 parts per million, or 0.028% of atmospheric gases) could have warmer-than-now temperatures (with present CO2 concentrations reaching 400 parts per million) defies claims that variations in CO2 primarily (or even exclusively) determine the temperature of the planet’s water and air, and that natural variations in solar activity, ocean heat distribution/cycling, clouds, volcanic activity…play little to no role in long-term climate change.
Perhaps this CO2-drives-climate paradigm needs to be updated to reflect the growing body of scientific evidence that the Sun and natural ocean cycling are primarily what drive temperature variations — not CO2.
 
1. Incarbona et al., 2016   (Sicily, Aegean Sea)
Comparison between the records and multi-decadal atmospheric circulation patterns and climatic external forcings indicates that Mediterranean circulation destabilisation occurs during positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and negative Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) phases, reduced solar activity and strong tropical volcanic eruptions. They may have recurrently produced favourable deep-water formation conditions, both increasing salinity and reducing temperature on multi-decadal time scales.
[B]oth NAO and AMO are of importance for the Mediterranean climate variability. In particular, at multidedacal scales, positive NAO phases lead to decreased precipitation (i.e. higher salinity) while negative AMO leads to reduced SSTs. Both processes may have favoured deep-water formation events on relatively long time scales.
Thermohaline circulation destabilisations in the Mediterranean circulation also seem to be linked to reduced solar activity (ref. 40; Fig. 4D) and to frequent volcanic eruptions (ref. 41; Fig. 4E). Solar activity modulates patterns in surface temperature and pressure that resemble NAO phases, through dynamical coupling processes between the stratosphere and the troposphere that transmit the solar signal to the Earth’s surface. The increase in sulphur aerosols from tropical volcanic emissions produces stratospheric and surface conditions that resemble the positive NAO phase and cause decrease in oceanic heat content, with long-lived temperature anomalies extending to the mid-depth and deep ocean, an increase in sea ice volume and enhancement in the overturning circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean following these eruptions. These phenomena may have shaped the North Atlantic atmospheric pattern, which in turn may have led to Aegean SSTs cooling and thus surface buoyancy loss and enhanced Eastern Mediterranean deep-water formation during EMT-like events.

2. Lyu et al., 2016   (China)
The reconstructed April–July MMT series exhibited six cold and seven warm periods. The longest cold period lasted from AD 1645 to 1677 (33 years), with an average temperature of 0.5 ◦C below the mean value. The longest warm period, however, lasted from AD 1767 to 1785 (19 years), and the average temperature was 0.69 ◦C above the mean value (Table 4). Four cold (1605–1616, 1645–1677, 1911–1924, and 1951–1969) and warm (1795–1807, 1838– 1848, 1856–1873, and 1991–2008) periods were consistent with other results of tree-ring reconstructions in northeast China (Shao and Wu, 1997; Yin et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2015). In addition, two cold periods (1645– 1677 and 1684–1691) were consistent with the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), an interval of decreased solar irradiance (Bard et al., 2000). … The three temperature series exhibited significantly low temperature periods during the 1950s–1970s, which coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity from AD 1940 to 1970 (Beer et al., 2000; Fig. 7).
[P]revious studies suggest that climate change in northeast China was also linked to the solar activities and global land–sea atmospheric circulation during certain pre-instrumental periods (Chen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). It is generally accepted that the climate warms during periods of strong solar activity (e.g., the Medieval Warm Period) and cools during periods of low solar activity (e.g., the Little Ice Age; Lean and Rind, 1999; Bond et al., 2001).

“Reconstruction of April-July minimum temperature on Laobai Mountain for the last 414 years [1600-2014].  The smoothed line indicates the 11-year moving average, and blue dots represent minimum freezing events.”
3. Sunkara and Tiwari, 2016  (India)
To study the imprints of the solar–ENSO–geomagnetic activity on the Indian subcontinent, we have applied singular spectral analysis (SSA) and wavelet analysis to the tree-ring temperature variability record from the Western Himalayas. Other data used in the present study are the solar sunspot number (SSN), geomagnetic indices (aa index), and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for the common time period of 1876–2000. Both SSA and wavelet spectral analyses reveal the presence of 5–7-year short-term ENSO variations and the 11-year solar cycle, indicating the possible combined influences of solar–geomagnetic activities and ENSO on the Indian temperature. Another prominent signal corresponding to 33-year periodicity in the tree-ring record suggests the Sun-temperature variability link probably induced by changes in the basic state of the Earth’s atmosphere. In order to complement the above findings, we performed a wavelet analysis of SSA reconstructed time series, which agrees well with our earlier results and increases the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby showing the strong influence of solar–geomagnetic activity and ENSO throughout the entire period. The solar flares are considered responsible for causing the atmospheric circulation patterns. The net effect of solar–geomagnetic processes on the temperature record might suggest counteracting influences on shorter (about 5–6-year) and longer (about 11–12-year) timescales. The present analyses suggest that the influence of solar activities on the Indian temperature variability operates in part indirectly through coupling of ENSO on multilateral timescales. The analyses, hence, provide credible evidence of teleconnections of tropical Pacific climatic variability and Indian climate ranging from inter-annual to decadal timescales and also suggest the possible role of exogenic triggering in reorganizing the global Earth–ocean–atmospheric systems.

A 368-year maximum temperature reconstruction
During the period 1875–1955, late summer temperature fluctuated less strongly than before or thereafter. In general, the average length of cold periods was shorter than that of warm periods. The cold period of 1869–1877 was the longest and coldest cool period had a mean of 17.63°C. The longest warm period extended from 1655 to 1668, and the warmest period in AD 1719–1730 had a mean of 20.37°C. However, we should point out that the rapid warming during the 20th century was not especially obvious in our reconstructed RLST.
[S]even cold periods and three warm periods were identified during the past 368 years (Fig. 4d). All the cold periods were during the Maunder (1708–1711) or Dalton (1818– 1821, 1824–1828, 1832–1836, and 1839–1842) solar minima periods, except for the cold periods of 1765–1769 and 1869–1877 (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999), which indicated that RLST [mean maximum temperature] variations in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ] might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b). On the other hand, volcanic eruptions in the corresponding periods might also be a cooling factor (Fig. 7b). A longer cold period (e.g., 1820s–1840s) was interrupted by transient warming, thus forming a plurality of discontinuous short cold periods. Warm periods of 1719–1730 and 1858–1859 both had more sunspots (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999) and lower volcanic forcing (Fig. 7b). The cold (1765–1769 or 1869–1877) and warm (1655–1668) periods were highly consistent with other studies (Fig. 7).
 

          Possible Forcing Mechanism
Accompanied by significant peaks at 60.2 and 73 years, the continuously periodicities around 49–114 years in our regional temperature reconstruction might tentatively be related to PDO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; En- field et al., 2001) as well as solar activity (Eddy, 1976; Shindell et al., 1999; Peristykh and Damon, 2003; Raspopov et al., 2004; Braun et al., 2005). The AMO was an important driver of multidecadal variations in summer climate not only in North America and western Europe (Kerr, 2000; Sutton and Hodson, 2005) but also in the East Asia (Feng and Hu, 2008; Liang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011, 2015; Zhu et al., 2011). The 60.2-year peak associated with AMO demonstrated that multidecadal variations in late summer temperature in the NWSP NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China]  might be controlled by AMO.
[S]ignificant multidecadal- and centennial-scale cycles of our temperature reconstruction might include the signs of solar activity, such as the Gleissberg cycles (Peristykh and Damon, 2003), Suess cycles (Braun et al., 2005), Bruckner cycles (Raspopov et al., 2004), and Schwabe cycles (Braun et al., 2005). The Maunder (ca. AD 1645–1715) and Dalton (ca. AD 1790–1840) solar minima periods were generally associated with temperature depressions (Eddy, 1976), and the Damon (ca. AD 1890– 1920) solar maximum period occurred in a relatively warm period, which further confirmed that late summer temperature variation in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China]  might be driven by solar activity (Fig. 7b).
Conclusion: Overall, the RLST [mean maximum temperature] variability in the NWSP [northwestern Sichuan Plateau, China ]  might be associated with global land–sea atmospheric circulation (e.g., ENSO, PDO, or AMO) as well as solar and volcanic forcing.

When I first saw the New Conservative launch in 2018, I panned the idea. “The new conservatives are just as boring as the old” was my response. I didn’t expect to hear much of them ever again, but then something unexpected happened. I got a message from deputy leader **Elliot Ikilei** , who told me that he had read my critically dismissive review, he thought I had some good points, and he wanted to meet up to talk about it. That one simple olive branch changed my life and I know he’s extended many more like it to others. Perhaps enough to alter the course of this nation.



I initially thought the name would be a dud, but in hindsight, it’s very clever. There’s a lot of talk now about a “new conservatism” that’s infused with traditionalism and populism. One of my favourite commentators proclaims daily that “a new conservative age is rising” throughout the world. In that context the party name is perfect.



The final New Conservative meeting for 2019 was in Botany. They ran dozens of meetings up and down the country last year, often attended by over a hundred people. There’s enthusiasm that’s not reflected in the polls. It’s a chicken and egg problem because most prospective voters will only vote for you if they think you’ll win. Despite this, New Conservative is building up a grassroots movement and much of their rhetoric is honed in on fighting the culture war. For me, that’s key.



There were three speakers at that meeting: Leighton Baker, Elliot Ikilei, and Victoria O’Brien.



 **Leighton Baker** , party leader and builder by trade, was far more polished than I expected. He’s got a great stump speech, he was funny, charming, and played the crowd well. Does Leighton Baker have what it takes to storm parliament in 2020? I don’t know, but what I can say is that he brings some normalcy and stability to New Zealand’s conservative politics that has been repeatedly tarnished by weirdos. He’s a brave man to give it a go, and he is most certainly dedicated to restoring the image of New Zealand conservatism. He says that to him it’s all about family and freedom.



 **Elliot Ikilei** , deputy leader, preceded his own speech with a Samoan dance routine. (He told me later it raised a few eyebrows out in the provinces.) Elliot highlights that the two foundational pillars of Greek democracy and Christian morality that underpin civilisation are both under unprecedented attack by our government and the bureaucracy. He exposes the degeneracy taught to children as young as five in government schools and through social programmes. He plays up his own Pacific heritage, throws in a few phrases of Samoan and Maori, and says that western culture is superior to all other cultures as it can be adopted by all ethnicities and transcends all cultures. **That’s a line you won’t hear from any other politician.** “Our civilisation is the greatest ever built”, he says with energy and passion. Those statements would likely have been front-page news if they had been said anywhere outside of a **New Conservative** meeting.



 **Victoria O’Brien** their firearms spokeswoman gave her first speech at this meeting. She was able to demonstrate the importance of the freedom to access information from her own experience of **authoritarianism** in Singapore. She brings a lot of knowledge and credibility to the New Conservative firearms policy, having been an E-endorsement holder at the time the recent amendments started to roll in. Like Leighton and Elliot, she expresses her reluctance for getting into politics, but all three are doing this because someone has to. They’re worried about losing the country they love to the progressive darkness.



The people running New Conservative are not career politicians, lobbyists, or public personalities. They’re just everyday New Zealanders from front-line jobs trying to do what has never been done before: get a fresh party over the 5% electoral threshold. I’ve encountered many who don’t believe they’ll get there— perhaps I don’t really either—but that does not matter to me. There’s no one else for a conservative to vote for.



It’s not all perfect either. Some aspects of the organisation still look slightly amateurish, which is to be expected from a party with no wealthy donors. I’ve complained about the lack of a distinct economic vision, but that’s easy to fix in due time. New Conservative is definitely not a “Christian party”, as some would accuse it of being, but it is based on timeless values and the primacy of the family.



There’s plenty of room to contrast New Conservative with **National** and **ACT.** National is always chasing the elusive “centre vote”. On abortion, they trot out the Clinton line. On climate change, they pretend to believe it because they think it will get votes. On immigration, they just want more cheap labour to prop up the facade of GDP growth. Yes, National has a few conservative electorate MPs, but they wield insignificant power in the party at the moment. The ACT party are as socially progressive as the Greens, they support mild climate change action, and on immigration, it’s a similar story to National. Only New Conservative embraces social conservatism, family values, calls out the climate scam, and has a net-zero immigration policy. Between ACT and NC there is also a great chasm on a philosophical level with **libertarian individualism** pitted against the **conservative focus on the family, morality, and nation.** I’ll tell you what National’s philosophy is once I figure it out.



There’s a bit of common ground between these parties, but unless you’re a single-issue voter who wants your one issue represented in parliament, then that’s not good enough. There’s no point in voting to win a small battle and lose the bigger war. That’s why the question of New Conservative reaching the electoral threshold is irrelevant to me: that issue must be approached as a case of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.



I understand some of those in the wider conservative demographic who won’t be joining the New Conservative movement. There’s no obligation to support a party if you don’t believe it will follow through on the issues most dear to you or if you’ve lost hope in politics altogether. I still caution anyone from placing their faith in politics or politicians, but the **progressives have accelerated their attempts to silence us.** [My experience over the past year](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/breaking-the-raids-have-begun-all-for-a-22-bunny-gun/) has made it abundantly clear to me, once you get yourself into this game of thrones, you either keep playing it or you end up dead.



There are plenty of signs that point to the viability of a solid right-wing conservative party in New Zealand’s parliament, but there’s a lot of work to be done. No one says it’s going to be easy, but don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible.



New Conservative NZ is more than a political party, it’s a movement. Politics remains downstream from culture, so a grassroots social movement is core to eventual political action. This is not just about an election, this is about the heart and soul of the land we call home, whether by choice or by birth. Don’t just vote, but focus on developing what matters in your own life, family, and community. Conservatism is about conserving the natural order and the best of our traditions. It’s about preserving our way of life and developing our unique identity among the nations. It’s about stewardship of our natural resources and beautiful landscapes. If you believe that there’s a more conservative, nationalist-populist, and traditionalist future for New Zealand, then please consider joining the movement.

How on Earth can anyone vote for that … [fill in the blank]? This is a question some Americans ask during every presidential primary race, but this year our mutual incomprehension feels especially intense. A year ago, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were expected to be the frontrunners, but now a senator from the far right (Ted Cruz) and a political neophyte from no known political zip code (Donald Trump) have come in first and second among Republicans in Iowa, taking more than 50 percent of the vote between them. On the Democratic side, an avowed socialist essentially tied with Clinton. What is happening?





Politics is in many ways like religion: Voters reward candidates who are effective preachers for a set of moral concerns.



Political scientists and commentators have a standard toolbox they use to explain elections, including variables such as the state of the economy, changing demographics, and incumbency fatigue. But this year, the standard tools are proving inadequate. Experts are increasingly turning to psychology for help. A recent article in Politico was titled ""The One Weird Trait that Predicts Whether You're a Trump Supporter."" It argued that the psychological trait undergirding Trump's popularity is authoritarianism — a personality style characterizing people who are particularly sensitive to signs that the moral order is falling apart. When they perceive that the world as they know it is descending into chaos, they glorify their in-group, become highly intolerant of those who are different, and feel drawn to strong leaders who promise to fix things, and who do not seem shy about using force to do so.



But now that Trump has lost in Iowa, there is increasing interest in the moral and psychological profiles of those who support other candidates. Iowa entrance polls showed that Cruz took the lion's share of voters who said it was most important to elect a candidate who shares their values. But what are those values, exactly? Is that just code for ""evangelical Christian?""



On the Democratic side, Sanders attracts supporters who are younger, whiter, and further to the left — but is that all there is to it? What are socialist values, anyway? Can authoritarianism tell us anything about the supporters of these other candidates, or do we need other instruments, with finer resolution?



 **What is Moral Foundations Theory?**



We'd like to add another psychological tool to the toolbox: Moral Foundations Theory. One of us (Haidt) developed the theory in the early 2000s, with several other social psychologists, in order to study moral differences across cultures. Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) draws on anthropology and on evolutionary biology to identify the universal ""taste buds"" of the moral sense, while at the same time explaining how every society creates its own unique morality.



Think of it like this: Evolution gave all human beings the same taste receptors — for sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami (or MSG) — but cultures then create unique cuisines, constrained by the fact that the cuisine must please those taste receptors. Moral foundations work much the same way. The six main moral taste receptors, according to MFT, are:



As with cuisines, societies vary a great deal in the moralities they construct out of these universal predispositions. Many traditional agricultural and herding societies rely heavily on the loyalty, authority, and sanctity foundations to create rituals, myths, and religious institutions that bind groups together with a strong tribal consciousness.



That can be highly effective for groups that are often attacked by neighboring rivals, but commercial societies (such as Amsterdam in the 17th century or New York City today) are far less in need of these foundations, and so make much less use of them.



Their moral values, stories, and political institutions flow more directly from the liberty and fairness foundations — well suited to a culture based on exchange and production — and are therefore much more tolerant and open to ethnic diversity.



In recent years, MFT has been used to study political differences between the American left and right. Republicans and Democrats in the United States are now in some ways like citizens of different countries, with different beliefs about American history, the Constitution, economics, and climate science. Using questionnaires, text analyses, and other methods, psychologists have found that progressives put more emphasis on the care foundation than do other groups, while social conservatives see more value in loyalty, authority, and sanctity than do other groups. Libertarians, meanwhile, put liberty far above all other moral concerns.



Fairness, important to all groups, nonetheless has subtypes: The left values fairness more when it is presented as equality, particularly equality of outcomes between groups (which is at the heart of social justice). The right values fairness more than the left when it is presented as proportionality — a focus on merit, which includes a desire to let people fail when they are perceived to have been lazy or otherwise undeserving.



But these are broad-brush generalizations. Each person has a unique morality developed over the course of a lifetime. Each political party is a coalition of interest groups and political philosophies that appeal to people with diverse values. In the chaos of this political season, can MFT help us find some order? Can it improve our ability to predict which people will gravitate to which candidate, over and above the predictions we can make from standard variables such as age, race, gender, education, and self-ratings on the liberal-conservative dimension?



 **Our study**



In November 2015 one of us (Ekins) was part of a team that surveyed 2,000 Americans as part of a Cato Institute/YouGov national public opinion study. The study included a battery of questions measuring each of the six moral foundations, and also asked respondents which presidential candidate they liked best. (See the bottom of this essay for the exact items we used.) When we analyzed the data, we found that the 2016 presidential candidates have indeed attracted unique voter constituencies with distinct sets of moral priorities. As we shall see, these moral differences among supporters map on pretty closely to real policy debates among the candidates.



To analyze the data, we first ordered the candidates from left to right based on their supporters' self-described political ideology. The scale ran from 1 (""very liberal"") to 5 (""very conservative""). We included candidates who had at least 35 respondents in the survey, although we leave out supporters of Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie in subsequent figures and analyses because their supporters' moral profiles were similar to those of Marco Rubio supporters. (Please see our supplemental blog post for many more graphs and analyses, including those for Fiorina and Christie supporters).





**How do the candidates compare?**



Next, we looked at how each candidate's supporters prioritize each of the moral foundations _compared with the average American_ (Figure 1). Bars above zero indicate that the candidate's supporters place more emphasis on that particular moral foundation compared with the average voter. Bars that dip down below zero do not mean those supporters do not care about the moral concern, only that they gave relatively lower ratings to it compared with the rest of our nationally representative survey sample.





Let's walk through the graph, one set of bars at a time.



 **1) Care (blue bars):** The care foundation measures the psychological tendency to believe that morality requires caring for and protecting the vulnerable. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""compassion for those who are suffering is the most crucial virtue."" Individuals who score high on this foundation tend to support a more activist government with a more generous safety net.



 **2) Fairness as proportionality (green bars):** Proportionality is the desire for people to reap what they sow — for good deeds to be rewarded and bad deeds punished. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""people who produce more should be rewarded more than those who just tried hard.""



In practice, a strong desire for proportionality is highly predictive of a preference for small government and a dislike of activist government and the welfare state. (We only asked about fairness as proportionality in our survey, not fairness as equality — which is always higher on the left.)



 **3) Liberty (orange bars):** The liberty foundation measures the psychological tendency to resist being controlled or dominated. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""everyone should be free to do as they choose, so long as they don't infringe on upon the freedom of others.""



 **4) Authority/loyalty/sanctity (red bars):** For simplicity, we took the average of each respondent's answers to all six questions for these three foundations, because they tend to go together as the foundations of social conservatism, and in this data set they generally tell the same story about each candidate. (See our supplemental blog post for graphs and extended analyses of each foundation separately.) Authority shows up in political life in strong support for the police and a ""tough on crime"" attitude; a sample question in our survey asked respondents whether it is relevant to moral judgment that ""an action caused chaos or disorder."" Loyalty shows up in political life in strong patriotism and a desire to protect the flag; a survey item we used asked if it was relevant to morality that a person ""showed a lack of loyalty."" Sanctity shows up in political life in culture war debates related to sexuality (including same-sex marriage) and also to the sanctity of life (including abortion). An item we used asked if respondents agreed that ""some acts are wrong on the grounds that they are unnatural.""



 **Moral Foundations Theory gives us a clearer picture of what voters care about**



What do moral foundations add to our understanding of voter preferences? If you already know a person's age, sex, education level, income, race, and self-reported ideology (liberal to conservative), you can make an educated guess about which candidate he or she is most likely to support. But if you add on top of all that the person's responses to our Moral Foundations questions, does that improve your ability to predict his or her vote?



To find out, we conducted a very stringent test: We performed a series of regression analyses, one for each candidate. (We carried out LOGIT regressions separately for the Democratic candidates among Democratic respondents and Republican candidates among Republican respondents). Then we examined how well each of the moral foundations predicted the likelihood that any particular person would pick each candidate as his or her favorite, while also accounting for the effects of demographic and political variables as well as the other moral foundations.



We wanted to see if adding the moral foundations improved prediction _above and beyond_ the demographic factors that are usually used.



It did.



 **Table 2** shows what we found. Each row shows which moral foundations were statistically significant predictors of vote choice in the regression analysis for each candidate. The numbers in parentheses show the size of the ""standardized beta weight,"" which quantifies how big the contribution was. Negative numbers mean that the predictor worked in the reverse direction (e.g., scoring _low_ on care makes a Republican more likely to vote for Trump, holding everything else constant).





Among Republicans, four moral patterns stand out. First: Voters who still score high on authority/loyalty/sanctity and low on care — even after accounting for all the demographic variables — are significantly more likely to vote for Donald Trump. These are the true authoritarians — they value obedience while scoring low on compassion. They are different from Huckabee supporters, who appeared to score even higher than Trump supporters on authority/loyalty/sanctity, but also scored high on care, as we saw in Figure 1.



Authoritarianism is often assessed in social science research by asking people two or three questions about the relative importance of teaching their children obedience and respect, but our data shows a limitation of this approach: Not everyone who wants their kids to be obedient is an authoritarian. Some past research has been too quick to lump in social conservatives with authoritarians. MFT offers a more nuanced assessment of voters' moral concerns.



The second pattern picks up the voters who seem to be most concerned about proportional fairness. They want society to reward people according to what they have earned, not according to their needs. These voters are split between Cruz and Rubio. The fact that our proportionality items predicted support for these candidates even after taking background and ideology into consideration shows how directly these candidates are appealing to the core moral concerns of the Tea Party.



But it revealed something else: Despite often being portrayed as opposites (Rubio is ""establishment""; Cruz isn't), and Cruz being seen as more aligned with Donald Trump, Rubio and Cruz actually draw from voters with a similar moral profile. Each would probably be doing better in the polls if the other weren't in the race.



The third moral pattern we tracked was Republicans who were _not_ strongly focused on enforcing proportional fairness in society. A low score on the proportionality questions predicted support for Bush (and, we would guess, for Kasich, although we did not have enough Kasich supporters in our data to test that hypothesis).



The fourth moral pattern was the classic libertarian archetype: high on liberty, low on the social conservative virtues of authority/loyalty/sanctity. Those voters gravitate to Rand Paul. Now that Paul has dropped out of the race, the moral profile of his supporters suggest they may find a new home with Cruz, Rubio, or even Sanders, who draws civil libertarians.



Now turning to the Democratic primary: Before controlling for demographic factors, the liberty foundation positively predicts a vote for Sanders and a vote against Clinton. But this effect seems to be driven by young libertarians. Once age is included in the analysis, the liberty foundation no longer adds significantly to the prediction of support for Sanders. When accounting for demographics, Sanders support is actually predicted by _low_ proportionality and _low_ authority/loyalty/sanctity.



Meanwhile, Moral Foundations do not significantly predict a vote for Hillary Clinton; demographic variables seem to be all you need to predict her support (being female, nonwhite, and higher-income are all good predictors).



 **Much of this contradicts conventional wisdom about the candidates**



The 2016 presidential campaign is among the most unusual and confusing in many years, but moral psychology can help us make sense of what is going on. Moral values matter a great deal in both parties. Despite the fact that the Moral Foundations questions don't ask about public policy, they still uncovered distinct moral profiles of each candidate's supporters that map onto actual policy differences that we hear coming from the candidates.



The Democratic candidates are both competing to show how much they care about the poor and vulnerable. It makes sense that they would both covet this impression: There is no difference between their supporters on the care foundation. But beyond care, Clinton and Sanders appeal to different moral values.



Like Barack Obama in 2008, Bernie Sanders draws young liberal voters who have a strong desire for individual autonomy and place less value on social conformity and tradition. This likely leads them to appreciate Sanders's libertarian streak and non-interventionist foreign policy. Once again, Hillary Clinton finds herself attracting more conservative Democratic voters who respect her tougher style, moderated positions, and more hawkish stance on foreign policy.



On the Republican side, we see evidence that the ""Reagan coalition"" has fractured. No candidate has yet brought together the conservatives, libertarians, and foreign policy hawks. Our survey was conducted last November, but today it is clear that the leading candidates are striving to outdo one another on appealing to social conservative policies (particularly immigration) and hawkish foreign policy (including ""carpet-bombing"" our enemies).



Despite Trump's longevity in the polls, authoritarianism is clearly not the only dynamic going on in the Republican race. In fact, the greatest differences by far in the simple foundation scores are on proportionality.



Cruz and Rubio draw the extreme proportionalists — the Republicans who think it's important to ""let unsuccessful people fail and suffer the consequences,"" as one of our questions put it. Bush and Huckabee attract those who are not so focused on enforcing proportional fairness. Trump and Paul fall in between on this dimension.



One surprise in our data was that Trump supporters were not extreme on any of the foundations. This means that Trump supporters are more centrist than is commonly realized; consequently, Trump's prospects in the general election may be better than many pundits have thought. Cruz meanwhile, with a further-right moral profile, may have more difficulty attracting centrist Democrats and independents than would Trump.



One last interesting finding: Jeb Bush supporters are closest to the average American voter, despite the fact that his campaign has thus far has failed to gain any traction among Republican primary voters.



Bush's failures may have more to do with his poor debate performances than with his moral profile, but in this time of high and rising polarization, cross-partisan hostility, and anger at elites and the establishment, Bush appears to be suffering from an excess of agreeability: He has no standout moral message that connects to any particular moral foundation, even at the risk of alienating supporters of another.



Politics is in many ways like religion: Voters reward candidates who are effective preachers for a set of moral concerns. Candidates who understand this realize that electoral campaigns are not won just by articulating the most effective policy responses to the pressing issues of our time — they are not even won by appealing to self-interest.



Rather, an effective political preacher offers a clear moral vision of America. That vision includes a historical narrative about where we went wrong, and then tells us how we can set things right. It also includes strong moral arguments that connect with and validate the moral judgments of voters.



So the next time you hear someone ask, ""How on Earth can anyone vote for that ... person?"" tell them to think about all six foundations of morality.

"**Shaquille O'Neal has spoken out in support of a basketball executive's comments that sparked a row between the NBA and China.**
The basketball legend said Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey ""was right"" to tweet support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
The NBA is hugely popular in China and Mr Morey's comments unleashed a wave of anger in the country.
Sponsorship and telecast deals have been cut in the lucrative market.
Speaking on TNT Television's Inside the NBA show on Tuesday, O'Neal defended the Houston Rockets manager's tweet that ignited the dispute.
""Daryl Morey was right,"" he said.
""Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say 'That's not right' and that's what he did,"" O'Neal said.
Mr Morey tweeted an image earlier this month captioned ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong"". He later apologised for the post.
It came in the midst of months of protests in Hong Kong sparked by proposed changes to an extradition bill.
Though the changes have been abandoned, the unrest has continued, expanding into demands for greater democracy.
Basketball is among the most popular sports in China with 300 million people playing the game, according to the NBA.
The league has around 800 million fans in the country supporting millions of dollars of business.
NBA hall of famer O'Neal noted the significance of the Chinese market to the US and pointed to ""free speech"" in his defence of Mr Morey's comments.
""We as American people do a lot of business in China. And one of our best values here in America is free speech.
""We're allowed to say what we want to say and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes.
""And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.""
O'Neal is not the first basketball star to speak out on the feud.
Earlier this month the NBA's best-known player LeBron James weighed in on the row, saying Mr Morey ""wasn't educated"" on the situation.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. ere we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
Since the Earth Day coverage this year seemed rather meager—a sign, perhaps, that everyone is growing tired of the pessimistic drone that defines the current environmental movement—it is possible that you may have overlooked a few stories out there that shine a more positive light on the human condition and the way forward.   
  
You ought to take a few minutes and take Alex Epstein’s short course from Prager University. It is presented in the form of a 5-minute video titled “Why You Should Love Fossil Fuel.” Here's course description:   




Every year on Earth Day we learn how bad humanity's economic development is for the health of the planet. But maybe this is the wrong message. Maybe we should instead reflect on how human progress, even use of fossil fuels, has made our environment cleaner and healthier. Alex Epstein of the Center for Industrial Progress explains.



We hope you like this, because you’ll undoubtedly be hearing much more from Alex in the future as we are happy that he has joined us at the Center for Study of Science as one of Cato’s newest adjunct scholars.   




Also trying to bring a positive light to our future and change the course of modern environmentalism are Michael Schellenberger and Ted Nordhaus from the Breakthrough Institute. These guys are co-authors of the _Ecomodernist Manifesto_ that we highlighted in these pages last issue. For Earth Day, they wrote a piece for _USA Today_ titled “Want to Save the Planet? Say Bye-bye to Nature.” They mean “bye-bye” not in the sense of nature going away, but that we (humans) should bid it farewell as we exit. Here is the lead:   




Since before the first Earth Day in 1970, environmentalists have argued that solving environmental problems required humans to get closer to nature. The ""back to the land"" movement urged people to leave cities, which were viewed as crowded and polluted. Renewable energy was recommended because it integrates human civilization into natural energy flows, such as water, biofuels and the sun. Similarly, organic agriculture was better because it integrated farmers and consumers into the natural rhythms of nature.   
  
In recent years, though, a growing number of environmental scientists and activists are saying that the best way to protect nature is not by returning to it, but rather by leaving it alone.



This fits closely with the idea that technology and advanced society leads to better environmental protection—an opinion that we share. You ought have a look.   
  
And also, be sure not to miss the _Wall Street Journal_ op-ed penned by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Last week, Smith's committee held a hearing on the justification and feasibility of the Obama administration’s recently announced “UN Climate Pledge.” Rep. Smith’s op-ed was in response to President Obama fossil-fuel-burning Earth Day foray into the Florida Everglades to tell us that we need to take action to restrict the burning of fossil fuels in the name of mitigating climate change. While we have a good suggestion for the President as to some fossil-fuel saving measures that immediately come to mind, we’ll bite our tongue because they wouldn’t have any impact on the climate anyway. In fact, this is true for all emissions-limiting actions that come from the United States—a point that Rep. Lamar stresses in his _WSJ_ piece (with help from information originating from our work and conveyed to him via last week’s testimony of Dr. Judy Curry).   
  
In the end, Rep. Smith astutely concludes:   




When assessing climate change, we should focus on good science, not politically correct science.

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, knows exactly what’s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752, 000 young undocumented immigrants. In 2012, in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security, she signed the document  —   nothing more than a policy memo  —   that created the program. So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The university estimates that almost 3, 800 among its 190, 000 students are undocumented, many but not all with DACA. Ms. Napolitano, retaining her law enforcement instincts, does not mention the word “sanctuary” when describing what the university could offer. “Sanctuary is such a vague term, we don’t use it,” she said crisply. Instead, the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students, including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration. Through the Davis campus law school, the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation. Another worrisome prospect, Ms. Napolitano said, is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work. Undocumented students, including any losing DACA, will continue to pay   tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded, in part, by the university. “We want to do everything we can so students are safe on our campuses,” Ms. Napolitano said, “so they can focus on what they are there to do, which is to study. ” Students at dozens of college campuses, galvanized by Mr. Trump’s depictions of immigrants as criminals or potential terrorists, have pressed administrators to provide sanctuary for those without legal papers. But universities have had differing ideas about what that would mean in practice, and most leaders have been careful to say they would not defy the law. Some institutions have flatly rejected sanctuary plans as encouraging lawbreaking. At New Mexico State University, the president, Garrey Carruthers, said that banning federal agents from campus might imperil its federal funding. One of the first presidents to declare a sanctuary campus explicitly was Michael S. Roth of Wesleyan, who announced in November that it “will not voluntarily assist” any efforts by federal authorities to deport students (a policy he reaffirmed on Jan. 29). Soon after, John Coatsworth, the provost of Columbia University, said that it would not allow immigration agents on campus without a warrant. Some administrators point out that student information, including their immigration status, is already protected under   privacy laws requiring the authorities to show a warrant or court order before any data can be released without students’ consent. In Georgia, Emory, which is a private university, considered but ultimately decided against protective measures. “Emory is not seeking to establish itself as a sanctuary campus, for which there is no legal definition,” the university said in a Jan. 4 statement. Taking a tougher line, the University System of Georgia said that any call for sanctuary was “unacceptable” and added, “We expect our institutions to follow the law. ” In his first formal briefing, on Jan. 23, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, suggested that canceling DACA would not be a priority for the new administration, but he did not provide any explicit reassurance that the program would continue. Ms. Napolitano is still contemplating the bitter possibility that Mr. Trump will sweep away her most significant immigration accomplishment. She hopes to persuade him that the program is a good use of executive power, emphasizing that DACA immigrants pose little security risk because they pass background checks to get into the program. Her message for Mr. Trump: “Why waste resources trying to deport good students who’ve done everything right?”"

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
This post provides an update of many of the ENSO-related variables we presented as part of last year’s 2014-15 El Niño Series.  For the posts this year, we’ve used the evolution years of different El Niños as references to the goings-on this year.  This month we’re including the 1997/98 El Niño because it was the strongest El Niño in our short instrument temperature record.  For the other reference, we’re using 1987, which is the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño.  Next month, we’ll compare this year to the El Niños of 1982/83 and 1997/98.
Figure 00 compares NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies for the evolutions of the 1986/87/88 and the 2014/15/16 El Niño. Sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region did reach El Niño conditions in the latter part of 2014 so it’s reasonable to compare the two events.

Figure 00
We can see that 1987 (the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño) began with noticeably higher NINO3.4 temperature anomalies than in 2015.  However, the 1986/87/88 El Niño started to decay before the usual end-of-year peak in 1987, while the El Niño this year continues to evolve.
Note: Depending on the sea surface temperature dataset, the 2014/15 El Niño registers on NOAA’s Oceanic NINO Index as an “official” El Niño.  See the comparison in Table 1.  With NOAA’s ERSST.v3b data, 2014/15 was an “official” El Niño, but with the new NOAA ERSST.v4 “pause buster” data, 2014/15 was not an “official” El Niño. It did, however, reach El Niño conditions even with the ERSST.v4 data.

Table 1
We discussed the differences in the new and former versions of NOAA’s ONI index in the post here.
INTRODUCTION 
There are a couple of notable things this month. First, NINO3.4 region sea surface temperature anomalies, which NOAA uses as its primary metric for determining the strength of an El Niño, are still running neck-and-neck with the 1997/98 El Niño.  See the weekly comparison here.   Considering the volume of warmer-than-normal water below the surface of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, we definitely should not expect the El Niño to decay anytime soon.  See the NOAA animation of subsurface temperature anomalies through October 25 here. In fact, we should expect the NINO3.4 region anomalies to continue to rise.
Second, there appears to have been yet another westerly wind burst in the western tropical Pacific recently.  As a result, the El Niño should continue to strengthen.
ENSO METRIC UPDATES
This post provides an update on the progress of the evolution of the 2015/16 El Niño with monthly data through the end of September 2015, and for the weekly data through late-October. The post is similar in layout to the updates that were part of the 2014/15 El Niño series of posts here. The remainder of the post includes 13 illustrations so it might take a few moments to load on your browser.  Please click on the illustrations to enlarge them.
Included are updates of the weekly (and monthly) sea surface temperature anomalies for the four most-often-used NINO regions. Also included are a couple of graphs of the monthly BOM Southern-Oscillation Index (SOI) and the NOAA Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI).
For the comparison graphs we’re using the El Niño evolution years of 1997 and 1987 (a very strong El Niño and the second year of a multiyear El Niño) as references for 2015.
Also included in this post are evolution comparisons using warm water volume anomalies and depth-averaged temperature anomalies from the NOAA TOA project website.
Then, we’ll take a look at a number of Hovmoller diagrams comparing the progress so far this year to what happened in both 1997 and 1987.
I’ve excluded the comparisons of the maps and cross sections (2014 and 2015) from the GODAS website this month.  We already know the 2015 El Niño conditions are stronger than those of 2014.  Next month I’ll include the animations again so that we can watch the evolutions of conditions in both 2014 and 2015.
NINO REGION TIME-SERIES GRAPHS
Note: The weekly NINO region sea surface temperature anomaly data for Figure 1 are from the NOAA/CPC Monthly Atmospheric & SST Indices webpage, specifically the data here.  The base years for anomalies for the NOAA/CPC data are referenced to 1981-2010.
Figure 1 includes the weekly sea surface temperature anomalies of the 4 most-often-used NINO regions of the equatorial Pacific. From west to east they include:

NINO4 (5S-5N, 160E-150W)
NINO3.4 (5S-5N, 170W-120W)
NINO3 (5S-5N, 150W-90W)
NINO1+2 (10S-0, 90W-80W)

As of the week centered on October 21, 2015, the sea surface temperature anomalies for the often-referenced NINO3.4 region are closing in on the values reached at the peak of the 1997/98 El Niño.  But they’re falling well behind the 1997/98 El Niño in the NINO3 and NINO1+2 regions.

Figure 1
Note that the horizontal red lines in the graphs are the present readings, not the trends.
EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS FOR NINO REGION SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES
Using monthly sea surface temperature anomalies for the four NINO regions, Figure 2 compares the goings on this year with the 1997/98 and the second year of the 1986/87/88 events.  All of the NINO regions this year are warmer than during the same times in 1987…the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño. The NINO1+2 and NINO3 regions are now lagging well behind the 1997/98 El Niño.

Figure 2
In other words, the 1997/98 El Niño was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the 2015/16 El Niño.
The monthly Reynolds OI.v2 sea surface temperature data are available from the KNMI Climate Explorer.
THE MULTIVARIATE ENSO INDEX
The Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) is another ENSO index published by NOAA.  It was created and is maintained by NOAA’s Klaus Wolter.  The Multivariate ENSO Index uses the sea surface temperatures of the NINO3 region of the equatorial Pacific, along with a slew of atmospheric variables…thus “multivariate”.
According to the most recent Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion, strong El Niño conditions exist, but they haven’t yet reached “super” El Niño conditions:
Compared to last month, the updated (August-Spetember) MEI has increased by 0.16 standard deviations to +2.53, or the 2nd highest ranking, surpassed only in 1997 at this time of year. This new peak value of the current event ranks third highest overall at any time of year since 1950, closing in on 1982-83 and 1997-98 with ‘Super El Niño’ values around +3 standard deviations.
There’s something else to consider about the MEI.  El Niño and La Niña rankings according to the MEI aren’t based on fixed threshold values such as +0.5 for El Niño and -0.5 for La Niña.  The MEI El Niño and La Niña rankings are based on percentiles, top 30% for the weak to strong El Niños and the bottom 30% for the weak to strong La Niñas.   This is difficult to track, because, when using the percentile method, the thresholds of El Niño and La Niña conditions vary from one bimonthly period to the next, and they can change from year to year.
The Multivariate ENSO Index update discussion and data for August/September were posted back on October 3rd.  Figure 3 presents a graph of the MEI time series starting in Dec/Jan 1979.  And Figure 4 compares the evolution this year to the reference El Niño-formation years of 1997 and 1987.

Figure 3

Figure 4
Like the sea surface temperature-only based ENSO indices, the MEI started out higher in 1987 than in 2015, but decayed early.
EL NIÑO EVOLUTION COMPARISONS WITH TAO PROJECT SUBSURFACE DATA
IMPORTANT NOTE:  The 1987 values of the TAO Project subsurface data have to be taken with a grain of salt. The deployment of the TOA project buoys started in the late 1980s and was not compete until the early 1990s.  Also keep in mind that these values are the output of a reanalysis, not observations-only-based data.
The NOAA Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Project website includes the outputs of a reanalysis for two temperature-related datasets for the waters below the equatorial Pacific.  See their Upper Ocean Heat Content and ENSO webpage for descriptions of the datasets.   The two datasets are Warm Water Volume (above the 20 deg C isotherm) and the Depth-Averaged Temperatures for the top 300 meters (aka T300).  Both are available for the:

Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W)
Eastern Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W)
Total Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-80W)

Keep in mind that the longitudes of 120E-80W stretch 160 deg, almost halfway around the globe. For a reminder of width of the equatorial Pacific, see the protractor-based illustration here. Notice also that the eastern and western data are divided at 155W, which means the “western” data extend quite a ways past the dateline into the eastern equatorial Pacific.
In the following three illustrations, we’re comparing reanalysis outputs for the evolution of the 2015/16 “season” so far (through month-to-date October 2015) with the outputs for the evolutions of the 1997/98 and 2014/15 El Niños. The Warm Water Volume outputs are the top graphs and the depth-averaged temperature outputs are the bottom graphs.  As you’ll see, the curves of two datasets are similar, but not necessarily the same.
Let’s start with the Western Equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 120E-155W), Figure 5. The warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies show the Western Equatorial Pacific began 2015 with noticeably less warm water than during the opening months of 1997, but higher than in 1987. Both western equatorial datasets now, though, are higher than in both 1987 and 1997, but note that the values this year are now negative and have been for a number of months.  They simply aren’t as “cool” as they were in 1987 and 1997.

Figure 5
Both warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies in the Eastern equatorial Pacific (5S-5N, 155W-80W) continue to lag behind the values of 1997, but are greater than the 1987 values.  See Figure 6.

Figure 6
The total of the TAO project eastern and western equatorial subsurface temperature-related reanalysis outputs, Figure 7, are as one would expect looking at the subsets. Warm water volume and depth-averaged temperature anomalies in 2015 are higher than they were in 1987, but comparable to where they were in 1997.

The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is another widely used reference for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.  We discussed the Southern Oscillation Index in Part 8 of the 2014/15 El Niño series. It is derived from the sea level pressures of Tahiti and Darwin, Australia, and as such it reflects the wind patterns off the equator in the southern tropical Pacific.  With the Southern Oscillation Index, El Niño events are strong negative values and La Niñas are strong positive values, which is the reverse of what we see with sea surface temperatures.  The September 2015 Southern Oscillation Index value is -17-7, which is a much greater negative value than the threshold of El Niño conditions. (The BOM threshold for El Niño conditions is an SOI value of -8.0.)   Figure 8 presents a time-series graph of the SOI data.  Note that the horizontal red line is the present monthly value, not a trend line.

Figure 8
The graphs in Figure 9 compare the evolution of the SOI values this year to those in 1997 and 1987…the development year of the 1997/98 El Niño and the second year of the 1986/87/88 El Niño. The top graph shows the raw data. Because the SOI data are so volatile, I’ve smoothed them with 3-month filters in the bottom graph. Referring to the smoothed data, the Southern Oscillation Index has recently surpassed the values in 1987 and 1997.  We can also see the early decay of El Niño conditions in 1987.

Figure 9
Also see the BOM Recent (preliminary) Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) values webpage. The current 30-day running average is a very high negative value, as is the 90-day average.
COMPARISONS OF HOVMOLLER DIAGRAMS OF THIS YEAR (TO DATE) WITH 1997 AND 1987
NOTE:  The NOAA GODAS website has not yet added 2015 to their drop-down menu for Hovmoller diagrams. For the following illustrations, I’ve used the Hovmolller diagrams available for the past 12 months, deleted the 2014 data and aligned the 2015 data with the other 2 years.
Hovmoller diagrams are a great way to display data.  If they’re new to you, there’s no reason to be intimidated by them. Let’s take a look at Figure 10.  It presents the Hovmoller diagrams of thermocline depth anomalies (the depth of the isotherm at 20 deg C.  Water warmer than 20 deg C is above the 20 deg C isotherm and below it the water is cooler). 2015 is in the center, 1997 on the left and 1987 to the right.  (Sorry about the different sizes of the Hovmollers, but somewhere along the line NOAA GODAS changed them, but they are scaled, color-coded, the same.)
The vertical (y) axis in all the Hovmollers shown in this post is time with the Januarys at the top and Decembers at the bottom.  The horizontal (x) axis is longitude, so, moving from left to right in each of the three Hovmoller diagrams, we’re going from west to east…with the Indian Ocean in the left-hand portion, the Pacific in the center and the Atlantic in the right-hand portion.  We’re interested in the Pacific. The data are color-coded according to the scales below the Hovmollers.

Figure 10
Figure 10 is presenting the depth of the 20 deg C isotherm along a band from 2S to 2N. The positive anomalies, working their way eastward early in 1997 and 2015, were caused by downwelling Kelvin waves, which push down on the thermocline (the 20 deg C isotherm).  We can just see the end of a strong downwelling Kelvin wave at the beginning of 1987 and a couple of weaker ones that followed that year.  You’ll note how, in 1997 and 2015, the anomalies grew in strength as the Kelvin waves migrated east. That does not mean the Kelvin waves are getting stronger as they traveled east; that simply indicates that the thermocline is normally closer to the surface in the eastern equatorial Pacific than it is in the western portion.
The El Niño conditions were much stronger in 1997 than they were in 1987 and so far in 2015.
Figure 11 presents the Hovmollers for wind stress (not anomalies) along the equator.   The simplest way to explain them is that they’re presenting the impacts of the strengths and directions of the trade winds on the surfaces of the equatorial oceans. In this presentation, the effects of the east to west trade winds at various strengths are shown in blues, and the reversals of the trade winds into westerlies are shown in yellows, oranges and reds.  To explain the color coding, the trade winds normally blow from east to west; thus the cooler colors for stronger than normal east to west trade winds. The reversals of the trade winds (the yellows, oranges and reds) are the true anomalies and they’re associated with El Niños, which are the anomalous state of the tropical Pacific.  (A La Niña is simply an exaggerated normal state.)

Figure 11
The two westerly wind bursts shown in red in the western equatorial Pacific in 1997 are associated with the strong downwelling Kelvin wave that formed at the time. (See the post ENSO Basics: Westerly Wind Bursts Initiate an El Niño.) Same thing with the three westerly wind bursts early in 2015, January through March:  they initiated the Kelvin wave this year. Throughout 1997, there was a series of westerly wind bursts in the western equatorial Pacific. There were comparatively few westerly wind bursts in 1987, according to this GODAS reanalysis, and those that did occur were not as strong as we’ve seen in 1997 and 2015. So far in 2015 we’ve had a good number of westerly wind bursts. The most recent one happened in October 2015 and should help to strengthen the El Niño this year.
Figure 12 presents the Hovmollers of wind stress anomalies…just a different perspective.  But positive wind stress anomalies, at the low end of the color-coded scale, are actually a weakening of the trade winds, not necessarily a reversal.

Figure 12
NOTE: There are a number of wind stress-related images on meteorological websites.  Always check to see if they’re presenting absolute values or anomalies.
And Figure 13 presents the Hovmollers of sea surface temperature anomalies. Unfortunately, the Hovmoller of sea surface temperature anomalies is delayed a few weeks at the GODAS website.

Figure 13
Notice how warm the eastern equatorial Pacific got during the evolution of the 1997/98 El Niño. While the sea surface temperatures this year have reached well above threshold of a strong El Niño, they’ve still well behind those of the 1997/98 El Niño…especially east of 120W (to about 90W), where sea surface temperature anomalies were more than 4.0 deg C at this time.
That is, as noted earlier, the 1997/98 was a stronger East Pacific El Niño than the one taking place in 2015.

"WASHINGTON  —   Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot. The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor. The event’s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google. “We’ve partnered with Google on events before, but nothing like this party,” said Alex Skatell, founder of The Independent Journal Review, a news   with a   millennial audience, which also helped host the event. The event was emblematic of an   by Google. Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company,  advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1. 3 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26, 000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings. Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump’s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a   Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold. That has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said had cost at least $50, 000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a “conservative outreach” employee in its Washington office. “Google has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Even though it has reached out to Republicans, it can’t shake the image. ” Google said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy. “We’ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,” the company said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do exactly that. ” A spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, “Eric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum. ” Other Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting. One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States. ”It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. “We’ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so. ” Google has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges, even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012. Now warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump’s circle. Some of the president’s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration’s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon’s skeptical stance on climate change policy. Mr. Trump’s team is particularly wary of one Google executive  —   Mr. Schmidt  —   who has been allied with Democrats. During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her   party circulated widely in the conservative media. Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt’s funding of a   called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Mr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Bennett said. “It takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened. ” Google has denied it tweaked its search results, which are determined by algorithms, and the company declined to comment on Mr. Schmidt. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. For many years, Google’s support of Democrats was plain. Google’s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign at $804, 240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google’s PAC and employees were sixth with $817, 855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama’s Republican opponents in either of those elections. About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the   House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites. In 2011, Google hired Stewart Jeffries, a former member of the House Judiciary Committee, to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill. That same year, it quadrupled its number of outside lobbying firms  —   including many with Republican lobbyists  —   to 24, from six in 2010. In 2012, Google named a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari of New York, to lead its Washington office. Google also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The company has hosted Republican lawmakers including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Darrell Issa of California at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google’s Washington office is now roughly split between Republican and Democrats. The company spent $15. 43 million in lobbying in 2016, according to federal lobbying documents, making it among the top dozen firms in lobbying spending last year. For the first time last year, Google’s PAC gave more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even so, Google’s Republican ties got little notice because of the company’s strong relationship with Democrats. Several Google employees joined the Obama administration while dozens of government bureaucrats were employed by the tech company. Google’s head of global public policy, Caroline Atkinson, was Mr. Obama’s former national security adviser. A former Google executive, Megan Smith, became the nation’s chief technology officer. During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable   box reforms last year. “Google was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies. Since the election, Google has accelerated efforts to win over the Republican White House and Congress. Before his visits to Trump Tower, Mr. Schmidt met with Mr. McCarthy and Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, who is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Days after Mr. Trump’s victory, Google also contacted The Independent Journal Review, which it had worked with on events during the Republican campaign debates. Google told the news   that it would provide the main funding for the party at the Smithsonian. Google said the event was open to both parties. But pairing with the conservative site sent a clear message to attendees. “We definitely helped draw Republicans and people from across the spectrum,” said the site’s founder, Mr. Skatell. At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company’s heft and power. “When I think of technology and Google, I don’t think of dominance,” said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. “I think of innovation. ”"
"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
ON the 24th December this year, Montreal was a poster child for the “new normal” – mild weather, no snow in sight. All that came to an abrupt end on the 29th, when Montreal strayed off narrative with a record breaking snowfall.
From the 24th;
Montreal’s Christmas Eve record-breaking temperature matches Los Angeles
Dec. 24 high of 16 C matches cities synonymous with sunny, warm weather at this time of year
…
The balmy temperature was the last thing Anaum and Muhammed Sajanlal were expecting when the siblings arrived in Montreal from Kuwait recently.
They had big plans for winter fun.
“I was looking forward to building a snowman because we see in the movies and cartoons that they build lots of snowmen. We can’t do that in Kuwait,” said Anaum, 11, on CBC Montreal’s Daybreak.

Fast forward to December 29th;
Montreal saw a record snowfall for a Dec. 29 on Tuesday after 39.2 centimetres of snow blanketed the city and caused delays at the airport and left streets a mess for motorists and pedestrians.
Environment Canada confirmed the record, which eclipsed the 30.5 cm of snow that fell on Dec. 29 in 1954.
A few more centimetres were expected Wednesday, but no other major accumulations are in the forecast for the moment, Environment Canada told the Montreal Gazette.
City crews and contractors began the lengthy cleanup process at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, with all of the city’s boroughs getting to work by 7 p.m. to clear as much snow as possible before a pause for New Year’s Eve kicks in at 7 p.m. on Dec. 31.
Clearing operations are to resume Jan. 2 at 7 a.m.
Read more: http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-sets-new-snowfall-record-after-tuesdays-storm
No doubt all that snow was due to CO2 causing climate alarmists to make fools of themselves. Thankfully civic authorities in Montreal ignored the hype; Mayor Denis Coderre’s new snow clearing programme appears to be a resounding success.

"**Photographer Lauren Crothers grew up in Hong Kong. Now based in New York, she was drawn back to the territory to document the recent protests that began against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China, but have grown into a wider pro-democracy movement. Here, Crothers talks about her portraits of the protesters.**
For months, I'd been watching and reading intently as the protest movement in Hong Kong evolved. By September, I decided to go back. Hong Kong is where I was born and raised; it's where my journalism career began and I've spent more of my life there than anywhere else. While I felt a natural compulsion to return and make photographs, I wanted to take a different approach.
I decided on a simple studio-style portrait series as a way of providing a slower, more isolated visual narrative of the people involved in this movement.
The only way to really do that was to work with available light against a neutral background and it had to be in the midst of one of the gatherings.
Although I'm very familiar with Hong Kong and the routes people had been using to march and gather, logistically, I was still anxious I had set myself up to fail. However, I worked with a fantastic fixer who recommended we try to take the pictures during a planned anti-totalitarianism rally at the end of September, heading from Causeway Bay toward Admiralty.
Because I needed to be able to set up a backdrop, and potentially break down, very quickly, I brought a cheap, small set of studio poles and backdrop clips. I packed several yards of different coloured translucent fabrics on the off-chance people would want to be fully anonymous - but on the day, I defaulted to the black background.
I'd gone to the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement the night before and felt confident enough people were covering their faces and therefore a sense of anonymity was already being established for those who wanted it.
The start of the march was punctuated with a few skirmishes and rounds of tear-gas but as police retreated and people started marching, we ducked into a side street and quickly set up.
Luckily, it was a reliable and safe spot from which to work, while being in close proximity to the start of the march. Together, we managed to invite 20 people to have their pictures taken.
There were many, many people over the course of the few hours that declined, which is fair enough. I know my little set-up was an odd sight; not to mention the rally was flowing at a pretty good clip and I assume people didn't want to be separated from their friends.
My only directions to participants were to stand straight on or slightly facing the left or right. How they posed was up to them.
Less than a week after I photographed the protesters, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced a ban on masks worn at street rallies, which I think has made the series take on more value. All but one participant wore some kind of mask or face covering.
While I did end up photographing at other rallies, I didn't take the ""studio"" with me again while I was still in town; I felt I'd chanced my arm already and was worried about a situation changing and becoming more dangerous.
While I was in Hong Kong, an Indonesian journalist was blinded in one eye by a rubber bullet, and an 18-year-old protester was shot in the chest after attacking a police officer.
Returning to Hong Kong this time was surreal and at times overwhelming and I have no idea when or how this will all end. All I can hope for is that no-one else is injured and no lives are lost.

"Opinion piece by Prof. David Bellamy
28 June 08
Cows and Sheep May Safely Graze?
As a youngster in a post war London I was brought up on lamb and anchor butter from New Zealand.
My first dabble into TV commercials was with WOOLMARK NZ, in what became a successful attempt to slow down the ingress of synthetic fibre into the carpet market. I still meet sheep farmers around the world who greet me their thanks and a pint of beer.
I still delight in your butter and lamb which I can buy in my local supermarket, the latter at half the price of the local product sold in our village butchers shop.
What a strange world we live in now bombarded with the rhetoric of food miles let alone tourist miles.

Hence I beg leave to put in this plea for the good husbandry of these two ruminants.
Cows and sheep are Mother Nature’s own brand of internal combustion engines. They get their energy by “burning” cellulose, the same stuff wood is made of.
During their life they produce all sorts of useful things; butter, cheeses, curds, dripping, gelatine, hide, horn, yoghurt, lamb, lard, milk, mutton, tallow, whey and wool.
Each one is a solar powered, self building, repairing and regenerating mobile mini supermarket. The solid waste from which is recycled, returning organic compost to the soil.
At the end of their useful lives any potential waste can be turned into heat and power.
Both of these amazing mammals depend on teeming hordes of ever smaller, internal combustion engines, (mini beasts, yeasts and bacteria) that live within their complex stomachs.
Chewing is not enough to crack open the tough cellulose packaging that wrap the goodies in each and every plant cell.
To release the energy rich fuels, (sugars, proteins and fats) stored within the cellulose boxes that make up the grasses and herbs, they need the power of the digestive enzymes of all their internal helpmates.
Without these, all cud chewing ruminants and non-vegetarian humans could not gainfully graze.
Please note even cows and sheep are not strict herbivores because they can and do digest these tiny animals relegating them to the ranks of the omnivores.
Exhaust from these internal combustion engines both large and small contain carbon dioxide and methane and thereby hangs my tale.
The molecules of carbon that make up their flesh, wool, hide, burps and farts is not fossil carbon.
It was sequestered from their pasture rarely longer than a year and most within a few days before their release back into the atmosphere.
Although somewhat modified by human influence they are part of the 97% of the main cycle of carbon dioxide that makes the living world go round. Not the 3% that the global warmers say are tipping the World, towards an omnivore driven armageddon.
Please note that long before the days of New Zealand lamb the world’s paddy fields, termite mounds and rotting organic matter were producing their fare share of greenhouse gasses including methane.
The IPCC reckon there is an annual production of 600 million tonnes of methane of which 25 million tonnes remain in the atmosphere. An increase of 25 million tonnes would raise the temperature by a mere 0.005 of a degree centigrade.
Not much to worry about, especially if you take into account, the fact that since 1999 the rate of increase of atmospheric methane has slowed down dramatically. Surely these ruminants should be left to safely graze.
Unless they are strict vegetarians, I beg the carbon cops not to tax these exemplary carbon trading internal combustion engines that do such wonderful things by chewing the cud.
The green dream of bio fuels has already turned into a nightmare of starvation across the poor world while devastating local biodiversity.
Since the far off days of good old British mutton and horse drawn milk carts, more and more small farmers have gone to the wall of extinction. With ever larger farms worked by machines not people, soils have lost much of their structure and hence their self-draining and nutrient retaining capacity.
In consequence they need massive applications of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides all of which guzzle fossil fuels in their production and application.
The good news is that over the past 25 years farmers both great and small have joined forces with the Queen Elizabeth 2 Trust, DOC, conservation groups and other local and national stakeholders. Together they are working wonders of what I like to call the green renaissance.
Together they are dealing with the many feral plants and animals, while putting their patch back into more bio diverse and hence more sustainable working order.
My own small part in this was when I had the privilege to work with TVNZ and Massey University on a book and TV series called “Moa’s Ark” ready for the Treaty of Waitangi Year.
I also made another famous TV advert “Old Mans Beard Must Go” and was there both at the start and completion of the world boggling mouse proof fence around the mountain-tops of Maungatautari.
My case rests, when it comes to the future of New Zealand butter, beef, lamb, leather, mutton and wool please don’t fart in the face of common sense.

"Social media shook with emotion. Headlines shouted the news. Legal scholars debated the order’s scope. But the most immediate effect of President Trump’s executive order barring refugees from entering the United States and halting entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries could be quantified on a human scale: refugees and other immigrants from those seven countries, some on their way to the United States on Friday when Mr. Trump signed the order, who were no longer able to enter the United States. Here are some of their stories. Hearing of Mr. Trump’s plan to slam the door on Muslim immigrants this week, Mr. Shareef hurried his wife and three children onto a plane in the Iraqi city of Erbil in the early hours of Saturday. They had been cleared to resettle in Nashville  —   a new life that Mr. Shareef considered a great opportunity. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr. Shareef worked as a translator with American officials, and he received death threats. But after the Shareefs arrived in Cairo on Saturday, a   official spoke to Mr. Shareef. “He said they had just received an email from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad,” Mr. Shareef said. “It said we could not get on the flight. ” Speaking by phone from an airport lounge, Mr. Shareef said he had sold the family home and car. His wife had given up her job. His two daughters, 10 and 17, had quit school. He had spent $5, 000 on flights. “I thought in America there are institutions, democracy,” he said. “This looks like a decision from a dictator. I don’t understand. ” “Donald Trump ruined my life,” he said. Ms. Omer, 39, is a green card holder, has lived in the United States since 1993, and graduated from Harvard University. On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan, where she is a citizen, after a research trip for her anthropology Ph. D. at Stanford University. Ms. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers. “I have to do this,” one told her. For five hours they asked about her travels, her academic research and her views on Sudanese politics, which they admitted to knowing little about. At one point, she said, they aggressively patted her down and handcuffed her. They removed the restraints when she began to cry, but the detainees brought in for questioning after her arrived in handcuffs, she said. “For the brief moment I was handcuffed, I couldn’t control myself and I just started crying,” Ms. Omer said. “It was humiliating. I thought I was going to be returned to Sudan. ” After Ms. Omer was released she said she felt like one of the lucky ones. “There are a lot of people being treated much worse or are being sent back,” she said. “If they get sent back to Iraq or Syria it is a    situation. ” Hazhir Rahmandad, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, said his parents who hold green cards and split their time between the United States and Iran, were due back in Massachusetts on Tuesday to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Rahmandad’s twin children. Now they will not travel. Professor Rahmandad set up a Google form for people from countries affected by the immigration order to report and share their experiences attempting to travel to the U. S. “I was so concerned,” he said. By Saturday evening, his spreadsheet had over 200 entries, most of them concerning people from Iran. Mr. Abdi, 30, a Ph. D. student in anthropology at Yale with permanent residency in the United States, said he left the United States on Jan. 22 for Afghanistan, where he planned to do field research for much of the next year. He had participated in the women’s march in Washington the day before. Now, he said he was in legal limbo as he awaited a visa from the consulate of Afghanistan, unable to return to the United States even with a green card and fearful of returning to Iran because of his activism about human rights issues there. Speaking by phone from Dubai, Mr. Abdi said his current visa limits his stay in the United Arab Emirates to about a month. The possibility that green card holders and refugees could be barred from the United States did not occur to him when he left, he said. “We didn’t believe it really, that it was going to be implemented,” he said. “Maybe we were taking the Trump administration less seriously than it is. ” Nada, a Yazidi woman from Iraq, was on her way to be reunited with her husband, Khalas, who lives in Washington. The two of them, their last names not released, were granted special immigrant visas to the United States as part of a program created to help thousands of Iraqis with ties to the United States, according to The New Yorker. Khalas, a former interpreter for the United States Army, was granted his visa in April. Nada’s visa was approved about a week ago, and her passport on Thursday. She was turned away, however, when she arrived at the gate for her flight in Dubai, wrote Kirk W. Johnson, the founder and executive director of the List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies. “The flight crew sent her back,” Khalas texted Mr. Johnson, “saying they got orders that no Iraqis with American visas should be boarded. ” Ms. Assali, 25, a   medical student from Allentown, Pa. said six of her Syrian relatives had arrived in Philadelphia on a flight from Doha, Qatar, on Saturday morning, only to be detained and put on a flight back less than three hours later. The group had obtained   immigrant visas. Ms. Assali said in a telephone interview that her six relatives  —   two uncles, two aunts and two teenage cousins, whom she did not name out of fear of endangering them or their case  —   are Christians who live in Damascus. Her father was on his way to pick up the relatives from the airport when he got a call from a customs official, she said, who said his family would not be leaving the airport. “They told him they’re not coming out, and to just go back. ” Ms. Assali said. “And that it’s confidential and he can’t tell them why. They said it was an issue with their paperwork. ” Mr. Darweesh, a husband and father of three who worked for the United States military in Iraq for about a decade, was detained after arriving at Kennedy Airport on Friday night. He was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20. When he filed for it, he said he had been directly targeted because of his work for the United States as an interpreter, engineer and contractor. Mr. Darweesh was released on Saturday after lawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court seeking freedom for him, as well as for another Iraqi detained at the airport. Speaking to reporters and some protesters who gathered outside Kennedy Airport, Mr. Darweesh called the United States the greatest nation in the world. He said he was thankful for the people who had worked on his behalf. “This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,” he said. “This is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here. ” Ms. Tayari, a resident of the United Kingdom who holds an Iranian passport, was unable to get back to Glasgow, where she works as a veterinarian, from Costa Rica, where she was vacationing, because her flight traveled through New York, according to The Guardian. Ms. Tayari grew up in Italy and told the newspaper that she had never experienced anything like it. She said it might cost her a month’s salary to book a new flight home. “I am destroyed,” she said. “I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on. ” The family members have been living in a refugee camp in Turkey, and were scheduled to fly to the United States on Monday, according to US Together, a refugee resettlement agency quoted in The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. The agency had found an apartment for them to rent with another family of Syrian refugees in Cleveland. Those plans have been canceled after Mr. Trump’s order. “It was going to be really perfect,” Danielle Drake, a community relations manager for US Together, told the newspaper. “I can’t even imagine how the family feels right now. ” Mr. Saravi, a young scientist in Iran, had been scheduled to travel to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship at Harvard to study cardiovascular medicine, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise his research. Then the visas for Mr. Saravi and his wife were suspended, Professor Michel said. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. “This country and this city have a long history of providing research training to the best young scientists in the world, many of whom have stayed in the U. S. A. and made tremendous contributions in biomedicine and other disciplines. ” Mr. Alshawi, who worked for a United States contractor in Iraq, was detained after he landed at Kennedy Airport on Friday. He had flown from Stockholm to New York, en route to Texas to see his wife and son. “He gave his package and his passport to an airport officer, and they didn’t talk to him, they just put him in a room,” his wife, who asked to be referred to only by her first initial, D, told The New York Times. “He told me that they forced him to get back to Iraq. He asked for his lawyer and to apply for an asylum case. And they told him: ‘You can’t do that. You need to go back to your country. ’”"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that imposing a Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme was not justified by the science and was likely to be very costly and disruptive to the lives of all Australians. 
Responding to the draft Garnaut report, the chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, claimed that it is becoming very clear that carbon dioxide is not a key driver of earth’s temperature, and attempts to reduce man’s emissions of CO2 will do more harm than good.

“There is certainly no justification for the premature imposition of any de-carbonisation proposals in Australia – no emissions trading systems, no cap and trade nonsense, no subsidies for converting food to motor spirit, no mandating of fairyland energy proposals, no geo-sequestration and no more carbon taxes. 
“However, if we were forced to choose between all the above unpalatable de-carbonisation alternatives, we would reluctantly support a simple carbon tax on all net direct emissions of CO2 from all industries. This should be accompanied by the IMMEDIATE abolition of all the other state and federal legislated Greenhouse foolishness. As soon as the climate and the science make it clear, even to economists such as Professor Garnaut, that man does not control the climate, we can then easily abolish the silly carbon tax (amid great rejoicing among those who do not dwell in the capital city hothouses).
“The Precautionary Principle so loved by those spreading doomsday stories on everything, suggests that a simple carbon tax is far less risky than grandiose plans to create an expensive and artificial bubble industry based on Carbon Emissions Trading. 
“The immediate effect of cap and trade legislation is the creation of new electronic assets called “permits to emit” with no reality, no separate existence, no asset backing and no intrinsic value whatsoever. Their value depends solely on a politician’s promise that people holding an emissions permit will have a protected position compared to those without a permit from the Carbon Czar. It is a principle Al Capone would have understood and welcomed.
“Immediately the government creates these securities with no substance and the Carbon Bank which stores no carbon, a huge new artificial industry will be created. There will be administrators and auditors, bankers and brokers, barristers and bureaucrats, carbon credit farmers and foresters, lawyers and lobbyists, traders and tax advisers, and all the high paid never ending research jobs in Zero-Gen and Zero emissions.
“To some people, the Greenhouse industry looks like the saviour of Australia after the last coal mine and the last cement plant are closed, the last farm becomes a carbon credit plantation, and the sounds of planes, trains, trucks, tractors and dozers are no longer heard in the land. 
“However, decarbonisation will never create one more roof on a new house, a slice of toast on one plate, a steak on a single barby, a blanket on one bed or a light in one dunny. And the warm inner glow from Canberra will not boil one kettle in Cairns. 
“When the real economy dies, so too will this huge parasitic bubble economy manufactured in Parliament. It will be better for all concerned that it is never created.”

"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy.**
The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors.
The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession.
That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome.
To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors.
Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details.
Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.
""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said.
The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.
Those protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.
Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.
Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record."
"**Has China really banned PewDiePie?**
You would be forgiven for thinking so. After all, several major international news websites have written headlines about the world's most popular YouTuber being ""wiped"" or ""banned"" from the internet in China.
But there is one tiny problem - it did not happen.
Fanpages for PewDiePie still exist on Chinese social media, and a cursory search for his name on Baidu - China's Google - returns 8.28 million results.
PewDiePie himself originally claimed to have been banned in a video on Saturday but he later appeared to make light of the supposed block, suggesting he was not being completely serious.
He joked on Twitter that he had punched a wall in outrage.
""Well boys, we did it,"" he said in Saturday's video, which has been viewed 6.5m times. ""I'm banned from China.""
He continued: ""I spoke about the Hong Kong protests, and showed their leader being mocked for looking like Winnie the Pooh.""
He added searches for his name now bring up no results on certain forums and video platforms.
But did not mention that searches for him on video sites like iQiyi and Tencent Video still return tens of thousands of results.
Chinese authorities have banned any comparison between President Xi Jinping and Disney character Winnie the Pooh since 2017.
Put simply, the government is extremely sensitive about how the president is regarded and seeks to maintain the perception he is loved and praised by the country's 1.4bn population.
The Pooh comparisons were propelled back into the public consciousness in October 2019 when a South Park episode heavily criticised the Chinese government.
The show was subsequently largely made unavailable in China, with any search for it on social media and video websites returning no results.
But this has not happened to PewDiePie: Some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online, such as a Baidu-run forum about him which has removed messages and even prevented people from posting new comments.
But there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.
In China, the general rule for censorship is: if something is too violent, sexualised, or goes against the government's message, it will be banned from the country.
Several manga and anime (Japanese comics and cartoons) are banned for the first two reasons.
Meanwhile celebrities are usually barred for the third reason. For example, Lady Gaga was reportedly denied a Chinese visa in 2016 over her meeting with the Dalai Lama.
With regards to PewDiePie, the censorship of the forum seems to be Baidu acting out of an abundance of caution.
The government has certainly not demanded that the search engine erase mentions of PewDiePie. A search for his name still returns more than eight million results.
A similar search on China's Twitter-like social media site Weibo produces plenty of results, including videos translated by Chinese fans and fanpages.
So what does a ban backed by the Chinese government look like?
Well, consider this search on Baidu for President Xi's daughter, Xi Mingze.
This is what a blanket ban looks like in China: an internet search for the president's daughter produces zero results, as though she does not exist.
One thing to remember is PewDiePie found success on a social media platform which cannot be accessed in China.
YouTube has been unavailable since 2009, so celebrities who gained mass popularity there are not necessarily similarly popular in China. And of course the country has its own massive established base of online celebrities that draws from a huge pool of more than 400 million live-streamers.
So while it is conceivable his comments have attracted censors' attention, PewDiePie simply has not been banned from the internet in China.
He might just not be popular enough for the censors to bother with."

As independent scientists researching atmospheric and climate problems, we — along with many of our fellow citizens -– are apprehensive about the Climate Treaty conference scheduled for Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. This gathering of politicians from some 160 signatory nations aims to impose — on citizens of the industrialized nations, but not on others — a system of global environmental regulations that include quotas and punitive taxes on energy fuels.

Fossil fuels provide today’s principal energy source, and energy is essential for all economic growth. Stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide — the announced goal of the Climate Treaty — would require that fuel use be cut by as much as 60 to 80 percent — worldwide!In a world in which poverty is the greatest social pollutant, any restriction on energy use that inhibits economic growth should be viewed with caution. We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the emerging Kyoto protocol — to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only part of the world community — is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.
More to the point, we consider the scientific basis of the 1992 Global Climate Treaty to be flawed and its goal to be unrealistic. The policies to implement the Treaty are, as of now, based solely on unproven scientific theories, imperfect computer models — and the unsupported assumptions that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action. We do not agree. We believe that the dire predictions of a future warming have not been validated by the existing climate record. These predictions are based on nothing more than theoretical models and cannot be relied on.
As the debate unfolds, it has become increasingly clear that –- contrary to the conventional wisdom — there does not exist today a general scientific consensus about the importance of greenhouse warming from rising levels of carbon dioxide. In fact, many climate specialists now agree that actual observations from weather satellites show no global warming whatsoever–in direct contradiction to computer model results.
Historically, climate has always been a factor in human affairs -– with warmer periods, such as the medieval “climate optimum,” playing an important role in economic expansion and in the welfare of nations that depend primarily on agriculture. Colder periods have caused crop failures, and led to famines, disease, and other documented human misery. We must, therefore, remain sensitive to any and all human activities that could affect future climate.
However, based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions. For this reason, we consider the drastic emission control policies likely to be endorsed by the Kyoto conference — lacking credible support from the underlying science — to be ill-advised and premature.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




The average citizen of Nepal consumes about 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a year. Cambodians make do with 160. Bangladeshis are better off, consuming, on average, 260.   
  
Then there is the fridge in your kitchen. A typical 20-cubic-foot refrigerator—Energy Star-certified, to fit our environmentally conscious times—runs through 300 to 600 kilowatt-hours a year.   
  
American diplomats are upset that dozens of countries—including Nepal, Cambodia and Bangladesh—have flocked to join China’s new infrastructure investment bank, a potential rival to the World Bank and other financial institutions backed by the United States.   
  
The reason for the defiance is not hard to find: The West’s environmental priorities are blocking their access to energy.



Porter’s article announced the release of “An Ecomodernist Manifesto”—a work by a collection of “scholars, scientists, campaigners, and citizens” who “write with the conviction that knowledge and technology, applied with wisdom, might allow for a good, or even great, Anthropocene.”   
  
Sounds interesting.   




The main concept behind the Ecomodernist Manifesto is that “sustainability” is the wrong approach. Porter describes it this way in his article:   




The “eco-modernists” propose economic development as an indispensable precondition to preserving the environment. Achieving it requires dropping the goal of “sustainable development,” supposedly in harmonious interaction with nature, and replacing it with a strategy to shrink humanity’s footprint by using nature more intensively.



Aware of the pitfalls of gross generalities, we’ll offer that the Ecomodernists see technology as humankind’s greatest tool and our way forward rather than inevitably leading to our downfall.   
  
While we think the Ecomodernists are a bit overly optimistic in the pace of development/deployment of new energy technologies, overplay the climate change-related urgency of such development, and see too much involvement of the state, their general take on the issue of humanity’s association with the earth’s environment resonates well. Consider this:   




Modernization has liberated ever more people from lives of poverty and hard agricultural labor, women from chattel status, children and ethnic minorities from oppression, and societies from capricious and arbitrary governance. Greater resource productivity associated with modern socio-technological systems has allowed human societies to meet human needs with fewer resource inputs and less impact on the environment. More-productive economies are wealthier economies, capable of better meeting human needs while committing more of their economic surplus to non-economic amenities, including better human health, greater human freedom and opportunity, arts, culture, and the conservation of nature.



The Ecomodernists recognize that the “modernization process is far from complete” but emphasize that it requires decoupling, rather than re-coupling, with the environment (the latter being the goal of many “sustainable” ideals).   
  
We’re only brushing the surface here, so to really get into the philosophy that they are laying out, you ought to have a look at the whole Manifesto. If nothing else, it’ll be the start of an interesting conversation. For us, it seems to lay out a much better course, although imperfect in some details, for “environmentalism” to follow—one in which the current feeling of pessimism is replaced by optimism (born from history).   
  
Also expressing a disdain for the “sustainability” craze this week is George Will. In his _Washington Post_ column, “’Sustainability’ Gone Mad on College Campuses,” he likens the dedication to sustainability to that of religious fundamentalism (perhaps foreshadowing the pope’s announcement). He writes   




Like many religions’ premises, the sustainability movement’s premises are more assumed than demonstrated. Second, weighing the costs of obedience to sustainability’s commandments is considered unworthy. Third, the sustainability crusade supplies acolytes with a worldview that infuses their lives with purpose and meaning. Fourth, the sustainability movement uses apocalyptic rhetoric to express its eschatology. Fifth, the church of sustainability seeks converts, encourages conformity to orthodoxy and regards rival interpretations of reality as heretical impediments to salvation.



Will’s contempt bubbled over as his column discussed a green-backed push for colleges to rid fossil fuel holdings from their endowments. He astutely points out:   




The effect of these decisions on the consumption of fossil fuels will be nil; the effect on the growth of institutions’ endowments will be negative. The effect on alumni giving should be substantial because divesting institutions are proclaiming that the goal of expanding educational resources is less important than the striking of righteous poses—if there can be anything righteous about flamboyant futility.



Not only will their effect on the consumption of fossil fuels be “nil” but so too will their effect on the course of future global warming, as we pointed out in this tweet (in response to Bill McKibben’s attempt to shame Harvard into divesting from fossil fuels):   






  
  
Will ultimately offers up this modest proposal:   




College tuitions are soaring in tandem with thickening layers of administrative bloat. So here is a proposal: Hundreds of millions could be saved, with no cost to any institution’s core educational mission, by eliminating every position whose title contains the word “sustainability”—and, while we are at it, “diversity,” “multicultural” or “inclusivity.” The result would be higher education higher than the propaganda-saturated version we have, and more sustainable.



Be sure the check out his whole column, here.   
  
And finally, on a lighter note, we came across an--uh--interesting article in FirstPost.com, an India-based news site.   
  
Apparently a team of British researchers (with little else to do?) dug through popular song lyrics to determine how our moods were influenced by the weather (through song) and how climate change may alter this in the future. According to FirstPost.com, here’s what they found:   




Climate change is predicted to intrude into almost every area of life—from where we live, to what we eat and whom we war with. Now music can be added to the list.   
  
That's the unusual idea put forward by British researchers on Tuesday, who say the weather has powerfully but discreetly influenced the soundtrack to our lives. And tastes in songs are likely to change as the climate shifts.   
  
Fancy listening to the Beatles' ""Here Comes The Sun"" when you are grinding out yet another long, sweaty heatwave? ""These assumptions we have about certain weather being good and certain weather being bad, like sun being good—that might change,"" researcher Karen Aplin of the University of Oxford said at a European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna.



The article was headlined “Wonder Why Our Songs Are Getting Worse? It Might Be because of Global Warming.”   
  
That, perhaps, may explain why certain preferences for “oldies"" don't often include disco—after all, the '70s were a relatively cold period!


"
"

Here is an excerpt from a December article in the _Otago Daily Times_ from James Shaw, in which he basically confirms that the climate change rort is really just a cover for his socialist agenda



‘‘Global capitalism is a pain in the neck,’’ he told an audience at the Lakes District’s One Summit last month.



Come at it head on and you’re likely to lose.



‘‘I think that what we need to do is a wee bit of jiu-jitsu,’’ he said. ‘‘And if you know anything about jiu-jitsu, what it says is that a small weedy person, like me, can take an enormous amount of incoming energy and with the flick of the wrist twist it and sit it on its arse. And that’s what we need to do to global capitalism.’’



Hmm, **Green-jitsu** maybe where you block a fist with your face?

Naturally, the Real Clear Science headline actually read…
Greenland Lost 9 Trillion Tons of Ice in Century
Which sounds even more serious than the original headline…

Greenland has lost 9,000 billion tons of ice in a century
One would think that the fact that 99.7% of Greenland’s ice sheet survived the 20th Century might just be more scientifically relevant than a 0.3% loss… But I guess that doesn’t make for a very dramatic headline.
Here’s the math…
First I converted 9 trillion tons to metric tonnes.
9,000,000,000,000 tons = 8,164,662,660,000 tonnes
Then I converted tonnes to gigatonnes.
8,164,662,660,000 tonnes = 8,165 gigatonnes
Then I converted  gigatonnes of ice to cubic kilometers, assuming 1 Gt = 1 km3.
8,165 Gt ~ 8,165 km3
Note: This conversion is inexact because ice is slightly less dense than water.  But it is close enough for this exercise.
Now that I roughly knew the volume of ice loss during the 20th century, I needed to know how much ice volume was still in place. I chose to rely on the USGS and their figure of 2,600,000 km3.
So now I could calculate the percentage of ice volume which survived the 20th century…
The ice volume at the onset of the 20th century should be…
2,600,000 km3 + 8,165 km3 = 2,608,165 km3
Converting to percentage surviving the 20th century…
2,600,000 km3 / 2,608,165 km3 = 0.997 = 99.7%
 
To put the math into perspective, I’m going to actually rely on the SkepScibots…
1 gigatonne of ice is big… Much bigger than an Olympic sized swimming pool.
So, throughout the 20th century, Greenland lost about 8,165 gigatonne ice cubes.  8,165 km3 equates to a 20 km x 20 km x 20 km cube of ice (3√ 8,165 = 20.136565).  That would be one big@$$ cube of ice!
However, it’s not even a tiny nick when spread out over roughly 1.7 million square kilometers of ice surface.  That works out a sheet of ice about 5 meters thick.
 
2,600,000 km3 / 1,700,000 km2 = 1.53 km
The average thickness of the Greenland ice sheet is approximately 1.5 km (1,500 meters).  5 meters is obviously 0.3% of 1,500 meters.
Isopach map of Greenland ice sheet (Wikipedia).  The “Lost Ice Cube” represents 8,165 cubic kilometers of ice.
 
From a thickness perspective, 5 meters looks like this…
 
Radar Cross Section of Greenland Ice Sheet (Source: Columbia University).  Note that even with a vertical exaggeration of 75 x, 5 meters is insignificant.
The red line along the top of the cross section is approximately 5 meters thick. Here is an enlarged view…

While my math may not be exact, estimates of the volume of the Greenland ice sheet vary from 2.6 to 5.5 × 106 km3.  The difference between 2.6 and 5.5 million cubic kilometers of ice is quite a bit larger than 9,000 gigatonnes.  For that matter, GRACE derived estimates of recent (2003-2011) ice mass balance vary widely as do the glacial isostatic adjustments…
For the analyzed period, the ice mass balance of Greenland and the corresponding GIA correction are, respectively, − 256 ± 21 Gt yr−1 and − 3 ± 12 Gt yr−1 (1%) for SM09, − 253 ± 23 Gt yr−1 and − 6 ± 5 Gt yr−1 (2%) for AW13, and − 189 ± 27 Gt yr−1 and − 69 ± 19 Gt yr−1(36%) for Wu10 (table 1). At the regional scale, the ice mass estimates are more dependent on the GIA correction, especially in NE Greenland where the Wu10-GIA correction is the largest portion of the signal measured by GRACE (table 1).
From Sutterley et al., 2014
With ~±10% margins of error in modern satellite measurements of glacial mass balance and GIA accounting for up to 1/3 of the reported ice mass loss, it is truly amazing that a 0.3% reduction in the Greenland ice sheet during the 20th century can be identified with such robustness [/Sarc].

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German national daily Die Welt has a piece by business journalist Holger Zschäpitz on Germany’s sky-high, ever climbing electricity prices.
Hat-tip: Reader Stefan B.
Awhile ago it looked as if prices had finally stabilized. But now Zschäpitz writes that German electricity prices, already among the highest in the world, have jumped once again.
To put the situation in perspective he writes: “Power consumers are now more burdened than automobile drivers” — who are brutally taxed to begin with. In Germany, even in these times of rock-bottom petroleum prices, motorists still cough up some 5 euros ($5.60) every single US gallon for gasoline they buy. Recently, proposals have been made to tax large cars even more, and to massively subsidize electric cars (which would be forced to charge up on the exorbitantly expensive electricity).
According to a recent analysis, writes Zschäpitz, “Consumers are now paying more for their power than ever before” — some 30.27 euro cents per kilowatt hour. Families today are paying 21% more for electricity than they did 5 years ago.
So what is driving the rapid upward price spiral?

Zschäpitz reports that it’s due mostly to the “Energiewende” – Germany’s push away from nuclear and fossil generated power to renewables such as wind, solar and biogas. Also driving the price are the energy price breaks that are granted to big power consumers, and liability costs for offshore wind parks. Moreover Zschäpitz reports that consumers are also forced to pick up the tab for upgrading the power grid so that it is able to handle the wildly fluctuating power supply from wind and sun.
In the meantime, Germany’s CO2 emissions have been rising, and thus consumers are not really getting anything for the massive amounts of money.
To illustrate the distortion gripping the German power market, Zschäpitz tells readers that today only 27% of the power price is made up of “pure raw material costs”. The electricity production cost by itself has in fact “fallen by 25% over the past few years“. However this cost reduction has been offset and more by other feed-in and grid operating surcharges levied as a result of the Energiewende. This leads Die Welt’s Zschäpitz to conclude:
Thus power consumers are now more burdened with state taxes and fees than automobile drivers.”
For relief, power consumers do have the option of switching to private power providers, and doing so is non-problematic, Zschäpitz writes. However one thing is sure: Electricity prices are expected to keep rising.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo understand today’s Green Movement, it is necessary to go back almost a thousand years in history. Prominent television producer and director Martin Durkin does precisely just that in his outstanding recent essay: NAZI GREENS – An Inconvenient History, where he writes of the movement’s “gushing idealization of ‘Nature’”.
Makes us wonder why the current Pope has hitched the Vatican wagon to the green movement. Could he be so misled, or cunning?
Some excerpts:
How can anyone read the Nazi Heidegger, or the writers of the Volk movement, or indeed Mein Kampf, and say, with a straight face, that environmentalism started with Rachel Carson?
And:
Like Nietzsche and the Volkists, Hitler and the Nazis hated the Enlightenment.  They rejected its humanism just as they spurned the human-centered morality of the Judeo-Christian tradition.”
And:

In short, the Volkists and Nazis were green.  In 1934, a year after the Nazis took power, as Professor Thomas Lekan describes, they ‘declared that the Third Reich had ushered in a new era of environmental stewardship … They foresaw a new era of ‘organic’ land use planning that stressed long-term sustainability over short-term profitability.’  The leading Nazi Walther Schoenichen declared that the German countryside was to be purified of the ‘un-German spirit of commerce.’  The same year they passed a law ‘Concerning the Protection of the Racial purity of Forest Plants’, and the following year the wide-ranging Reichsnaturschutzgesetz (Reich Nature Protection Law). “
And:
Of course the green policies of the Nazis, like the policies of the greens today, were riddled with contradictions.”
One of these horrendous contradictions is the large-scale blighting of Germany’s idyllic landscape heritage with industrial wind turbines – now numbering close to 25,000.
Durkin advises:
We should heed the warning of Lukács, that, ‘fascist demagogy and tyranny was only the ultimate culmination of a long process which initially had an “innocent” look’.”
Great essay, one that will certainly rattle the green ideologues to the core. Here we see what these people really are. When we look at some of the German scientists behind the movement (won’t mention names) it’s all crystal clear.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
The press release from the White House, Office of the Press Secretary is here.  It reads:
FACT SHEET: U.S. Reports its 2025 Emissions Target to the UNFCCC
State Department Submits President Obama’s Ambitious 2025 Target to Cut U.S. Climate Pollution by 26-28 Percent from 2005 Levels
To view the INDC submission, click HERE.
Building on the strong progress made under President Obama to curb the emissions that are driving climate change and lead on the international stage, today the United States submitted its target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The submission, referred to as an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), is a formal statement of the U.S. target, announced in China last year, to reduce our emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, and to make best efforts to reduce by 28%.
Last November, President Obama and President Xi – leaders of the largest economies and largest polluters – made the historic announcement of the respective post-2020 climate targets for the United States and China. For the first time, China committed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions, with a commitment to peak emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early, and to increase its share of non-fossil energy consumption to around 20 percent by 2030.  Following that historic announcement, the European Union put forward an ambitious and achievable INDC to cut their emissions 40% by 2030.  And just last week, Mexico announced that it would peak its overall net greenhouse gases by 2026, backed by strong unconditional policies and a new bilateral task force to drive climate policy harmonization with the United States.
With these actions, as well as strong INDCs submitted by Norway and Switzerland, countries representing over 50% of global CO2 emissions have either announced or formally reported their targets. Today’s action by the United States further demonstrates real momentum on the road to reaching a successful climate agreement this December in Paris and shows President Obama is committed to leading on the international stage.
The U.S. target will roughly double the pace of carbon pollution reduction in the United States from 1.2 percent per year on average during the 2005-2020 period to 2.3-2.8 percent per year on average between 2020 and 2025.  This ambitious target is grounded in intensive analysis of cost-effective carbon pollution reductions achievable under existing law and will keep the United States on the pathway to achieve deep economy-wide reductions of 80 percent or more by 2050. The Administration’s steady efforts to reduce emissions will deliver ever-larger carbon pollution reductions, public health improvements, and consumer savings over time and provide a firm foundation to meet the new U.S. target.
Building on Progress
Our leadership at the international level starts at home. In 2009, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were projected to continue increasing indefinitely. When entering office, President Obama set an ambitious goal to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels in 2020.  Throughout the first term, the Administration took strong actions to cut carbon pollution, including investing more than $80 billion in clean energy technologies under the Recovery Act, establishing historic fuel economy and appliance energy efficiency standards, doubling solar and wind electricity, and implementing ambitious energy efficiency measures.
Early in his second term, President Obama launched an ambitious Climate Action Plan focused on cutting carbon pollution, preparing the nation for climate impacts, and leading on the international stage to bring nations large and small to the table to pledge to act on climate change.  In addition to bolstering first-term efforts to ramp up renewable energy and efficiency, the Plan is cutting carbon pollution through new measures, including:
Clean Power Plan: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed guidelines for existing power plants in June 2014 that would reduce power sector emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 while delivering $55-93 billion in annual net benefits from reducing carbon pollution and other harmful pollutants.
Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles: In February 2014, President Obama directed EPA and the Department of Transportation to issue the next phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by March 2016. These will build on the first-ever standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (model years 2014 through 2018), proposed and finalized by this Administration.
Energy Efficiency Standards: The Department of Energy set a goal of reducing carbon pollution by 3 billion metric tons cumulatively by 2030 through energy conservation standards issued during this Administration. The Department of Energy has finalized multiple measures addressing buildings sector emissions including energy conservation standards for 29 categories of appliances and equipment as well as a building code determination for commercial buildings. These measures will also cut consumers’ annual electricity bills by billions of dollars.
Economy-Wide Measures to Reduce other Greenhouse Gases: EPA and other agencies are taking actions to cut methane emissions from landfills, coal mining, agriculture, and oil and gas systems through cost-effective voluntary actions and common-sense regulations and standards.  At the same time, the State Department is working to slash global emissions of potent industrial greenhouse gases, called HFCs, through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol; EPA is cutting domestic HFC emissions through its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program; and, the private sector has stepped up with commitments to cut global HFC emissions equivalent to 700 million metric tons through 2025.

Have you ever wondered if celebrities have a conscience? Whether they consider their impact of their words and deeds in much the way as the common man? Let’s investigate that matter in the context of the raging debate over climate change.
Did you tune into the Live Earth concerts promoted by Al Gore on the catchy date of 7/7/07? No? Well, you certainly heard of them, thanks to the free time given by the media. Concerts on seven continents, headlined by Madonna, Genesis and the Black Eyed Peas. Concerts designed to arouse awareness of the apparent threats of climate change and global warming.

Concerts watched by fewer people, even in the United States, than the Princess Diana Tribute Concert a week or so earlier. Concerts attended by disappointing crowds but lauded by Al Gore, his promoters and the usual suspects in the Hollywood and music industry.
Indeed, not everyone saw value in another headline-grabbing event of this type – Bob Geldof, who organised concerts against poverty and starvation in Africa in earlier times sniffed, ‘We are all f***ing conscious of global warming. It’s just an enormous pop concert or the umpteenth time that, say, Madonna or Coldplay get on stage’. Right on, Sir Bob. In fact, even the youth who were targeted Gore’s media machine were unconvinced of the motives, with many downright cynical.
The issue promoted may or may not be bigger than world poverty, starvation in Africa, or many other issues facing our planet – although I doubt if a starving family in Darfur gives a single thought for Tim Flannery’s worries about the sea rising to swamp multi-million dollar mansions on the coastlines of Florida or Queensland. But, when the hypocrisy of opposing greenhouse gas emissions by consuming large amounts of electricity on stage, and flying to and from events in private jets, is the subject of greater debate than the so-called problem, then the promoters have an issue.
Let’s take Madonna, a serial and successful publicity grabber if ever there was one. Her charity, The Ray of Light Foundation, happened to own millions of dollars of stock in aluminium giant Alcoa, one of the single largest corporate users of electricity in the world; the Ford Motor Company; and Weyerhaeuser, a forestry giant. All these companies are on the radical environmental hit list. When this information came to light, Live Earth founder Kevin Wall’s defence was this: ‘I didn’t see the Fox News Report but Madonna is here today, which shows her commitment.’ So just turning up absolves one’s eco-sins, does it? ‘Today, we’re not focussing on what she or other artists may have done in the past; it is about the future. Whatever is being said, I know that her commitment to this cause runs deep. She is performing for free and has written a new song for us, which I think goes to show that.’
Apparently celebrities can write off their greenhouse gas emissions by giving their services for free, and of course, by writing a nice new, catchy tune.
You and I of course don’t, or soon won’t have it that easy. A breed of radical environmentalists, fronted by Gore, Flannery and others, is beginning to demand we give up many of life’s luxuries and even economic necessities, while they individually continue to consume enough energy to power small villages. Al Gore’s house has been revealed to use 20 times the energy of the average home; who knows what Madonna’s houses chew through in electricity; or the cars and jets she and her entourage use go through in gas and aviation fuel?
Another celebrity eco-warrior is Sting, who reunited with his band Police for the 7/7/07 gig. The same Sting who advertises, according to the leftist British newspaper, The Guardian, ‘the biggest gas-guzzling Jaguar of them all’.
Let’s take a little tour of the wacky world of global warming and climate change publicity… and see what we can discover – a little of the truth for ourselves, perhaps?
Remember, these are demands put forth by celebrities – many of them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of workers in the suburbs of Los Angeles or Melbourne, let alone those struggling to make better lives in Brazil, Burma, South Africa, Cuba or the Ivory Coast. Remember, any amount of taxes or restrictions implemented at their behest cannot truly affect their own lifestyles, while they most certainly will damage yours or mine.
Here are some interesting proposals put forward by celebrities who feel sure climate change is largely driven by human intervention – factories, cars, aircraft, energy consumption and the like.

‘I propose a limitation on the number of squares of toilet paper to be used in a sitting…’ – singer and celebrity environmentalist Sheryl Crow
A ban on cremations, replaced with upright burials in cardboard tubes!
A congestion tax on trucks in New York City (with no viable alternative to move goods such as food in or out) – Mayor Michael Bloomberg
The leading celebrity environmentalist who suggested those who oppose the man-made climate change theory might one-day face ‘a prosecutor in some yet-to-be-formed international court’. You know, a court like Nuremberg (he didn’t need to say). And, by the way, this is no fringe nutcase – it is a direct quote from Tim Flannery, author of a leading text on man-made climate change, The Weather Makers

Okay, let’s agree most of those ideas are just plain silly. The power needed to pump water to your home so you can wash your hands thoroughly after using one or two squares of toilet paper proves that.
With little solid evidence, other than a series of climate models, which vary widely and are subject to massive manipulation to prove a particular point, the world is being railroaded into making a series of changes that may have huge consequences for our economy, and our lifestyles.
Claims are thrown about like confetti – a leading aid agency recently said, with an apparent straight face, ‘between now and 2050 climate change will push the number of displaced people globally to at least 1 billion.’ Note the will, not may; climate change will create 1 billion refugees! Apparently we are expected to simply accept the claim at face value and then… well, what? Turn off our air-conditioning?
How about the demand from a British charity that the US must pay $22 billion a year to help deal with the ‘ravages’ of global warming. How much do you think they propose should be China’s share? Remember, China is now the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Do we hear zero? Correct!
Why would China not be asked to pay? The answer seems quite simple – they are not a democracy, environmental campaigners have no real levers over their government, media or the thinking of their masses. But those same campaigners do have influence over those in America and Europe, so it’s they who must be badgered into what could well turn out to be very bad policy indeed.
The same Tim Flannery mentioned earlier, and who was mystifyingly made Australian of the Year in 2007, has made this claim: ‘I think there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ (Perth in Western Australia is a city of over 1.5 million people and is in the middle of an economic boom). Flannery also said that ‘some time in the next 30 years, we face… rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’ Now, 6 metres is 236 inches, nearly 20 feet of increased worldwide sea levels. It sounds and is scary. One suspects it was meant to sound scary. But, wait, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the touchstone of faith for the world’s leading climate change promoters, projects only 59cm (23 inches, not even two feet) of increased sea levels. What gives here? Deliberate sensationalism by Mr Flannery, or just poor science on his part? Either answer is damning.
Why does the hard-core environmentalist movement seek out hypocrites and the ill-informed to front their views (seriously as they take them)? And why do celebrities seek out opportunities to flash their ‘green’ views at every opportunity. Clearly there is a Faustian bargain here.
But a bargain with the Devil has payback. In this case the environmental movement and the celebrity musos, actors and soft scientists are already beginning to find that payback has come early.
When the green movement allows those compromised by their behaviour (Gore, Madonna, Sting et al) to display their hypocrisy the message itself is damaged, possibly irreparably. When the celebrities make claims that are wrong, irresponsible or just plain hypocritical and are exposed their credibility suffers, possibly irreparably. In fact whether they care, or even know, is a moot point and it is hard to imagine them lying awake at night worrying about that, or much else other than the source of their next dose of that most addictive of drugs – fame.
And for those who wonder if climate change is natural, who wonder if nothing man does to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will alter that, and who wonder if the real reason behind proposed carbon taxes and the like is being left unsaid, the exposure of a few compromised celebrities may be comforting. But it is cold comfort.
Do these celebrities actually have a conscience? Or did they trade that to the Devil as well?

“In 1894, the Times of London estimated that by 1950 every street in the city would be buried nine feet deep in horse manure. One New York prognosticator of the 1890s concluded that by 1930 the horse droppings would rise to Manhattan’s third-story windows.” No Fracking Consensus:
We may now laugh at the above perceived problem, or the additional things as mentioned by Gary Pearse below. But how will people in 50 years from now judge “us”? Will they laugh at our collective inability to see past our noses? Should we approach things differently?
The previous post with September data produced many gems among the over 500 comments. Unfortunately, I cannot use all gems in this post. I intend to use others in later posts. However for now, I will recopy two posts, one by Leo Smith and the other by Gary Pearse.
Leo Smith:
November 7, 2015 at 2:55 am
Robert G Brown is one of the few people I look up to, not because he has solved the problem of Climate (change) but because he accurately understands the almost complete impossibility of understanding it!
Years ago someone said to me that, faced with a problem that you didn’t know how to solve, you must go back to first principles. None of the theories and equations helping? Start from scratch and develop new ones!
Robert G Brown reminds us that the ‘easy’ problems that we can solve with the application of linear differential equations (and in a sense, scientific theories are simply differential equations, like F=ma) have already been solved, and that what remain are the fiendishly hard problems, that, even if we can identify the differential equations that govern system behaviour, are practically incalculable because of the inherent non linearity of multiple terms, all of which affect each other.
In essence this approach – finding the underlying (partial) differential equations – won’t work, not because we get the raw science wrong, but because the integration of those partials over time leads us into sensitivity issues and chaotic behaviours that is essentially the nature of the beast. Larger and larger supercomputers merely extend the size of the area we can predict with some degree of accuracy, from the minuscule to the pathetically small.
And this is why even this brave attempt to identify all the variables, and even establish the correct partial differential equations based upon them will not result in a computer model that accurately predicts the climate.
The only approach that I have ever come across that partially works, is to examine the possible cases and eliminate those that are completely unstable – that is if we consider all possible climates in terms of stability, we will find that huge collections of them are so mightily unstable that should perturbation of the system by e.g. volcanic eruption or meteor strike or even releases of lots of lovely CO2, cause the system to enter such a region, the overwhelming tendency would be to revert back to a more stable region.
That is, we might be able to map climate into zones of possible quasi stability, and zones of impossible instability. If you like instead of working out what the climate will be, we could at least ascertain what it simply couldn’t be. And then leave the rest as ‘what it could and might be’.
This alone is probably what an organisation like the IPCC should be tasked with – what are the possible states of future climate, what are their potential probabilities, and impacts, and how should we meet the challenges – not by attempting to stop them happening, but by identifying the physical and social and economic changes necessary to adapt to them.
In my time beyond engineering as a business man, I learnt a Golden rule. Do not expend effort on attempting to change that which is inevitable, nor attempting to solve that which is – for whatever reason, effectively insoluble: Rather use the techniques of pragmatism – as practised by both engineers, and oddly enough, the military, and consider all the possibilities, do the research or reconnaissance to ascertain which of them are likely, plan accordingly, make tentative steps forward, and as soon as it appears that the situation is not as it appeared to be, change the plan without shame.
In other words, going back to first principles, as a putative agent of government, what the real question is, is not ‘where is the climate going’ but ‘where might the climate go, with what probability, and, given that its unlikely we can in all honesty stop it, what should be a meaningful response that preserves as much of civilisation as is practicable’?
I know that the final answer would be along the lines of :
‘Almost anywhere within a degree or two, a few cm or so of sea level, a few cm or so of rainfall, and indeed along the any of the lines that the historical record have already shown us is certainly possible’ and as to what we ought to do about it, the final answer there would be: ‘be prepared with a contingency fund, to meet whatever Nature sends, but don’t waste a single halfpenny on trying to stop it or second guessing what its going to do, because frankly the mathematics is insoluble to that level of detail’.
And to PROVE that the ‘mathematics is insoluble to that level of detail’ is the first step.
It’s not just a matter of finding the right equations, don’t waste time on that. Because the simpler job is to prove that even if you did find them they wouldn’t actually allow the integration to a realistic and useful prediction anyway.
All we need to do is to have enough of the relevant parameters to show that the problem is chaotic and non linear, calculate the size of computer needed to give an answer in real time, rather than hindcasting, and that will show that all climate science of the sort that is claimed is ‘settled’ is in fact completely useless.
Not that it will change a damned thing politically, because the mathematics to do that would be beyond nearly everyone – especially ‘climate scientists’ who are mainly, at best, third rate alchemists – and as we know, that which passeth all understanding, is in the end a matter of faith to those whom it passeth….
(The above ends Leo’s post.)

Leo, I believe your approach is eminently doable and, in part, is done! How many kinds of weather are there anyway? In the polar regions, what, 2-3, in the temperate zones 5 or 6, and in the tropics 2-3. Empirically it has reached these temperatures, these rainfalls/snowfalls (or lack thereof), these intensities and numbers of storms of a couple of types and the secondary effects – rates of sea-level change, droughts, fires etc. Also some physical, non weather stuff – volcanoes, tsunami, earthquakes, extraterrestrial bolides. We should be spending more money on tracking all the asteroids while we are at it and planning possible things that might be done.
I have a soft hypothesis -actually it might be better termed an axiom- that PREDICTIONS OF DOOMSTERS WILL NEVER COME TRUE. Such predictions are made using linear thinking of the kind discussed here for which a supportive legitimate mathematical expression is impossible. In the case of Malthusian disasters, their predictions are even less possible because they miss out the confounding principal component of human ingenuity in their thinking. Our cities didn’t end up being buried in horse manure (Malthus), the industrial revolution didn’t starve itself out by 1900 because of the shortage of coal (Jevons), we didn’t starve to death by 2000 and run out of mineral resources (Club of Rome, Holdren, Ehrlich) nor did we freeze to death by that date with the imminent man-made new ice age on the way (by the same people). Saudi oil minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani said it best in a 2005 interview with New York Times discussing peak oil: “The Stone Age didn’t end for lack of stone, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.”
The Club of Rome’s 1972 “Limits to Growth” and others by the same group in recent years were totally blown away. We have doubled the 1972 world population and have 7B people living better and longer than the 3.5B of 1972. That there are still apparently well educated persons making such doomster predictions is evidence more of their misfit psychology than the application of sound methods. All these predictions are made by biologists and social scientists whose training and knowledge are linear and more akin to accounting than to creative science. Such disciplines give the air of erudition but they are precisely the least equipped to make such predictions. Knowing the sex rituals of the chameleon, which do not change over a very long time if at all, or counting tiger turds in the jungle to calculate population, are not the kind of skills required to properly attempt to forecast the future of mankind and the planet.
Mention should also be made here of the inevitability of unexpected consequences (themselves arising from the same kind of lack of unpredictability inherent in “doom” and climate science) that have and will abound in any action that might be designed by doomsters to correct the perceived fantasy. Some of their geoengineering ideas are downright scary and definitely not the work of engineers (although I guess you could buy one). These aspects definitely also brand doomster climate scientists as political activists and social scientists.
(The above ends Gary’s comment.)
Before continuing with my regular post, I would like to point out some highlights in the October data and put these highlights into perspective.
The GISS anomaly for October at 104 smashed the previous all time high mark of 97 from January 2007.
However for RSS, its October value of 0.440 was beaten in October 1998 at 0.461. Furthermore, all of the first 10 months of 1998 beat 0.440. In addition, it was beaten for several months in 2010.
UAH6.0beta4 did have its highest October on record at 0.427. However all of the first 9 months of 1998 beat that mark. In addition, it was beaten for several months in 2010.
Hadcrut4 set an October record at 0.811. However this does not beat its all time high anomaly of 0.832 set in January of 2007.
GISS and Hadcrut4 and Hadsst3 will set new records in 2015, however both satellites will not get higher than third place. I am assuming of course that Dr. Spencer is not about to be replaced very soon by you know who.
In the sections below, as in previous posts, we will present you with the latest facts. The information will be presented in three sections and an appendix. The first section will show for how long there has been no warming on some data sets. At the moment, only the satellite data have flat periods of longer than a year. The second section will show for how long there has been no statistically significant warming on several data sets. The third section will show how 2015 so far compares with 2014 and the warmest years and months on record so far. For three of the data sets, 2014 also happens to be the warmest year. The appendix will illustrate sections 1 and 2 in a different way. Graphs and a table will be used to illustrate the data.
Section 1
This analysis uses the latest month for which data is available on WoodForTrees.com (WFT). All of the data on WFT is also available at the specific sources as outlined below. We start with the present date and go to the furthest month in the past where the slope is a least slightly negative on at least one calculation. So if the slope from September is 4 x 10^-4 but it is – 4 x 10^-4 from October, we give the time from October so no one can accuse us of being less than honest if we say the slope is flat from a certain month.
1. For GISS, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
2. For Hadcrut4, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
3. For Hadsst3, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
4. For UAH, the slope is flat since May 1997 or 18 years and 6 months. (goes to October using version 6.0)
5. For RSS, the slope is flat since February 1997 or 18 years and 9 months. (goes to October)
The next graph shows just the lines to illustrate the above. Think of it as a sideways bar graph where the lengths of the lines indicate the relative times where the slope is 0. In addition, the upward sloping blue line at the top indicates that CO2 has steadily increased over this period.
Note that the UAH5.6 from WFT needed a detrend to show the slope is zero for UAH6.0.

When two things are plotted as I have done, the left only shows a temperature anomaly.
The actual numbers are meaningless since the two slopes are essentially zero. No numbers are given for CO2. Some have asked that the log of the concentration of CO2 be plotted. However WFT does not give this option. The upward sloping CO2 line only shows that while CO2 has been going up over the last 18 years, the temperatures have been flat for varying periods on the two sets.
Section 2
For this analysis, data was retrieved from Nick Stokes’ Trendviewer available on his website. This analysis indicates for how long there has not been statistically significant warming according to Nick’s criteria. Data go to their latest update for each set. In every case, note that the lower error bar is negative so a slope of 0 cannot be ruled out from the month indicated.
On several different data sets, there has been no statistically significant warming for between 11 and 22 years according to Nick’s criteria. Cl stands for the confidence limits at the 95% level.
The details for several sets are below.
For UAH6.0: Since January 1993: Cl from -0.018 to 1.669
This is 22 years and 10 months.
For RSS: Since April 1993: Cl from -0.033 to 1.566
This is 22 years and 7 months.
For Hadcrut4.4: Since January 2001: Cl from -0.048 to 1.334
This is 14 years and 9 months.
For Hadsst3: Since October 1995: Cl from -0.001 to 2.010
This is 20 years and 1 month.
For GISS: Since September 2004: Cl from -0.036 to 2.172
This is 11 years and 2 months.
Section 3
This section shows data about 2015 and other information in the form of a table. The table shows the five data sources along the top and other places so they should be visible at all times. The sources are UAH, RSS, Hadcrut4, Hadsst3, and GISS.
Down the column, are the following:
1. 14ra: This is the final ranking for 2014 on each data set.
2. 14a: Here I give the average anomaly for 2014.
3. year: This indicates the warmest year on record so far for that particular data set. Note that the satellite data sets have 1998 as the warmest year and the others have 2014 as the warmest year.
4. ano: This is the average of the monthly anomalies of the warmest year just above.
5. mon: This is the month where that particular data set showed the highest anomaly. The months are identified by the first three letters of the month and the last two numbers of the year.
6. ano: This is the anomaly of the month just above.
7. y/m: This is the longest period of time where the slope is not positive given in years/months. So 16/2 means that for 16 years and 2 months the slope is essentially 0. Periods of under a year are not counted and are shown as “0”.
8. sig: This the first month for which warming is not statistically significant according to Nick’s criteria. The first three letters of the month are followed by the last two numbers of the year.
9. sy/m: This is the years and months for row 8. Depending on when the update was last done, the months may be off by one month.
10. Jan: This is the January 2015 anomaly for that particular data set.
11. Feb: This is the February 2015 anomaly for that particular data set, etc.
20. ave: This is the average anomaly of all months to date taken by adding all numbers and dividing by the number of months.
21. rnk: This is the rank that each particular data set would have for 2015 without regards to error bars and assuming no changes. Think of it as an update 50 minutes into a game.

If you wish to verify all of the latest anomalies, go to the following:
For UAH, version 6.0beta4 was used. Note that WFT uses version 5.6. So to verify the length of the pause on version 6.0, you need to use Nick’s program.
http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0beta/tlt/tltglhmam_6.0beta4.txt
For RSS, see: ftp://ftp.ssmi.com/msu/monthly_time_series/rss_monthly_msu_amsu_channel_tlt_anomalies_land_and_ocean_v03_3.txt
For Hadcrut4, see: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/time_series/HadCRUT.4.4.0.0.monthly_ns_avg.txt
For Hadsst3, see: http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadSST3-gl.dat
For GISS, see:
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt
To see all points since January 2015 in the form of a graph, see the WFT graph below. Note that UAH version 5.6 is shown. WFT does not show version 6.0 yet. Also note that Hadcrut4.3 is shown and not Hadcrut4.4, which is why the last few months are missing for Hadcrut.

As you can see, all lines have been offset so they all start at the same place in January 2015. This makes it easy to compare January 2015 with the latest anomaly.
Appendix
In this part, we are summarizing data for each set separately.
RSS
The slope is flat since February 1997 or 18 years and 9 months. (goes to October)
For RSS: There is no statistically significant warming since April 1993: Cl from -0.033 to 1.566.
The RSS average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.331. This ties it at 3rd place. 1998 was the warmest at 0.55. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in April of 1998 when it reached 0.857. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.255 and it was ranked 6th.
UAH6.0beta4
The slope is flat since May 1997 or 18 years and 6 months. (goes to October using version 6.0beta4)
For UAH: There is no statistically significant warming since January 1993: Cl from -0.018 to 1.669. (This is using version 6.0 according to Nick’s program.)
The UAH average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.244. This would rank it at 3rd place. 1998 was the warmest at 0.482. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in April of 1998 when it reached 0.742. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.186 and it was ranked 5th.
Hadcrut4.4
The slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
For Hadcrut4: There is no statistically significant warming since January 2001: Cl from -0.048 to 1.334.
The Hadcrut4 average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.714. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in January of 2007 when it reached 0.832. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.564 and this set a new record.
Hadsst3
For Hadsst3, the slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning. For Hadsst3: There is no statistically significant warming since October 1995: Cl from -0.001 to 2.010.
The Hadsst3 average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.570. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in August of 2014 when it reached 0.644. This is prior to 2015. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.479 and this set a new record.
GISS
The slope is not flat for any period that is worth mentioning.
For GISS: There is no statistically significant warming since September 2004: Cl from -0.036 to 2.172.
The GISS average anomaly so far for 2015 is 0.82. This would set a new record if it stayed this way. The highest ever monthly anomaly was in January of 2007 when it reached 0.97. This is prior to October 2015 when a new all time record of 1.04 was set. The anomaly in 2014 was 0.74 and it set a new record.
Conclusion
Do you feel we are going about our climate studies in the proper manner? If not, what changes would you suggest?

"UNITED NATIONS  —   The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, issued a stark warning on Friday to allies and rivals abroad, saying in her first remarks at the headquarters of the world body that the Trump administration would hold to account those who do not back the United States. “You’re going to see a change in the way we do business,” Ms. Haley said. “Our goal with the administration is to show value at the U. N. and the way we’ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well. ” “For those who don’t have our back,” she added, “we’re taking names we will make points to respond to that accordingly. ” Ms. Haley offered no further details in brief remarks to reporters, nor did she take questions, before presenting her diplomatic credentials to the secretary general, António Guterres. A former socialist politician from Portugal who took over the United Nations at the start of the year, Mr. Guterres is under pressure to persuade the Trump administration to not gouge the organization and to uphold America’s international obligations, including on climate change. President Trump has dismissed the United Nations as a social club and suggested the United States could cut its funding of the organization’s efforts. His “America first” pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the United Nations about his commitment to international cooperation. The administration’s antipathy toward the United Nations has been sharpened since a Security Council resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley have criticized the Obama administration’s decision not to veto the resolution. And several Republican senators have supported legislation threatening to defund the United Nations unless the Security Council reverses the terms of the resolution, which Council diplomats say would be politically unworkable. The United States is the United Nations’ largest single donor, providing 22 percent of its regular budget, according to the terms of an international agreement that sets a country’s contribution based on its wealth. That assessed contribution pays for operating expenses like the electricity bills at its headquarters and human rights investigations in places like Syria and South Sudan. The United States also contributes voluntarily to other United Nations programs, including those that provide food and blankets to refugees fleeing war zones and that immunize children against preventable diseases. A draft executive order obtained by The New York Times proposes at least a 40 percent cut to those voluntary funds. Some of the provisions in the draft text are redundant, and it is unclear how serious these proposals are, or if they will ever be signed. Current and former officials said Friday that the Trump administration was delaying its plan to issue the order. The money that the United States voluntarily contributes to the United Nations is a little over 0. 1 percent of the total federal budget. Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary, but that idea has never passed muster with Congress. One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration, judging from what Ms. Haley said during her confirmation hearing, is peacekeeping. The United States pays the largest share of the peacekeeping budget  —   about 28 percent  —   but provides virtually no soldiers The threats to cut funding come as China has stepped up its role at the United Nations, increasing its support for peacekeeping and development aid. China also has a veto in the Security Council. “This is a time of strength, this is a time of action, this is a time of getting things done,” Ms. Haley said on Friday, adding that she was prepared to   the United Nations’ efforts. “Everything that’s working we’re going to make it better. Everything that’s not working we’re going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we’re going to do away with,” she said. Her tone was in contrast to a far more conciliatory approach just days ago, when she faced a Senate confirmation hearing. There, she said she did not favor a “slash and burn” approach to American contributions to the United Nations, but she questioned its value to American national interests. “Are we getting what we pay for?” she asked. Ms. Haley, 45, a former Republican governor of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken critics during the campaign, had tried to distance herself from some of what Mr. Trump has said about international diplomacy. She has said she favors continuing sanctions against Russia, for instance, but also cooperation with the Kremlin on counterterrorism. She has said she is concerned about security threats posed by refugees, and while she said climate change was “on the table,” she said she did not favor policies that imperiled business."
"

The United States leads in defense budgets by a wide margin, accounting for 38 percent of the globe’s total defense spending. The defensive umbrella extends all over the world with little benefit to the security of the homeland. Pressing threats such as global health and climate change are changing the notion of what national security means—and these threats have no clear military solution. The rate of U.S. military spending was unsustainable long before the COVID-19 pandemic.



Continuing to divert a large amount of resources towards pre‐​COVID‐​19 military threats siphons funds away from where they are needed most: economic recovery. The pandemic’s economic impact is a sobering reminder of President Eisenhower’s warning on military spending, “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” Inflating the Pentagon’s budget further only weakens other institutions that could make positive contributions to America’s security and well‐​being. To illustrate the tradeoff between additional military spending and public health, the F-35’s $144 million per aircraft price tag could purchase some 2,800 ventilators. Military power is still important for preventing or responding to some threats, but these challenges should be narrowly defined.



Persistent budget pathologies impede innovation. The Department of Defense, for example, abuses its Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding stream by including items in the spending category that are not related to overseas combat missions as the fund is intended. Since 9/11 Congress appropriated $2 trillion through OCO. This allows the Pentagon to skirt legally mandated budget caps; the OCO funding line alone would make it the fourth largest government agency. The DoD reprograms carefully allocated budget lines against legislative intent, recently stripping billions from the department’s base improvement funds to build a wall with Mexico that no one else will fund.



Inflating the Pentagon’s budget further only weakens other institutions that could make positive contributions to America’s security and well‐​being. 



On top of these challenges, the structure of the military requires overhaul. We are long past the time when manpower was the key facet of U.S. military strength, now we need a lean and agile fighting force. The United States should also stop investing in old and outdated systems that do not meet the requirements for modern battle. Premier new systems, such as the F-35 fighter program (the Pentagon had requested $11.4 billion to buy 79 F‐​35s next year) do not meet design goals due to either structural flaws or bureaucratic malfeasance. The Air Force should focus on improving readiness, training, and retention so it can shift away from its recent pattern of doing less with more money.



Ending the forever wars in the Middle East and shifting the Army’s priorities toward long‐​range offense and short‐​range defense will enable the service to get smaller without sacrificing effectiveness. Investing in new long‐​range weapons platforms and mobile missile defense will give the ground service the defensive capabilities it needs to survive as other countries develop their own precision strike capabilities.



The U.S. Navy needs to re‐​think its strategic objectives and shape the force accordingly. COVID-19’s economic fallout will make it impossible to achieve the legally mandated 355‐​ship navy by 2030. The _Columbia_ -class nuclear missile submarine program is useful as a nuclear deterrent, but it will eat up a large share of the service’s shipbuilding budget and potentially crowd out funding for other ships. A distributed fleet architecture based on smaller manned warships, such as frigates, plus a new class of unmanned surface and subsurface vessels, are best suited for meeting future challenges.



The U.S. Marine Corps has a head start on the other services when it comes to finding innovative solutions to their pressing challenges. The service recently released its 2030 force design, which sacrifices several legacy platforms like helicopters and tanks to move the service toward new capabilities like unmanned vehicles and mobile, anti‐​ship missile systems. The Marines will be in a much better position to fight effectively on future battlefields with a lighter, more agile force.



Finally, America’s approach to strategic deterrence also deserves a fresh look. Our current, overly broad definition of strategic deterrence encourages the creation of a nuclear arsenal that prioritizes flexible response options that are both expensive and excessive for preserving strategic deterrence.



The United States is ramping up a nuclear modernization plan that could cost well over $1 trillion over 30 years. The fiscal impact of COVID-19 ought to renew serious debate in Congress about which modernization efforts are necessary, given budget cuts on the horizon. Nuclear modernization should not be discarded entirely, but delaying some programs and reducing others would be prudent steps. One such modernization effort that could be scaled back is the B61-12 nuclear bomb. Malfunctioning parts recently added $600-$700 million on top of the bomb’s $9.4 billion expected total cost. Moreover, the modernization plan calls for a new air‐​launched nuclear cruise missile that U.S. aircraft could launch at long range from their target, making the B61-12 superfluous.



A global health crisis should communicate the need for drastic changes, including how we define threats and what we consider to be normal. The U.S. defense budget was never normal nor built for the defense of the homeland. The time is now to divest from age‐​old ideas of military strength built on manpower and endless spending.

"The conservative radio host Glenn Beck called the Women’s March in Washington an “AstroTurf” rally funded by the liberal billionaire George Soros. He complained that the news media refused to acknowledge this fact. But there’s one news organization he praised as an exception: The New York Times. As evidence, he pointed to a piece by Asra Q. Nomani, a   liberal feminist and Trump voter, who claimed to document the extensive financial ties Soros had to march partners. The conservative website Breitbart News tied the piece to The Times in a prominent headline. And the   site The Daily Stormer wrote about the piece under a headline that referred to Soros as an “International Jew. ” Suddenly, The Times was a   crowd pleaser. Only it wasn’t The Times that ran this article. It was published on a site affiliated with The Times  —   but completely distinct from the paper  —   called Women in the World. The site is part of an events organization founded by Tina Brown (of The Daily Beast and The New Yorker fame). The Times is a business investor in Women in the World and provides the website’s digital platform, but the two have separate editorial operations. None of that was apparent to many readers who wrote in, confused about whether the story was the work of The Times. Here’s one from Susan Kruglinski of New York: It’s easy to be confused. I was. At the top left corner of the website, for example, there is the familiar “T” logo of The New York Times, and the URL has “nytimes” in it. Click the stylized “T” and you’ll be taken to The Times’s website. If you scroll to the very bottom of the Women in the World home page, squint to find the “About Us” link, and click, you’ll be taken to a page that, in the fourth paragraph, explains the relationship between The Times and Women in the World. For the most part, the site publishes news and features about women that don’t seem particularly controversial. This one, which was labeled Opinion, was more ideologically charged and made The Times the perfect foil for conservative news sites. Adam Bryant, who oversees the newsroom’s role in conferences, was sympathetic to the idea that something more might need to be done to make evident the degree to which the two organizations are separate. “As part of the The New York Times’s business relationship with Women in the World, we currently provide the digital platform for them, but we have separate editorial operations,” he said. “We strive to avoid any confusion on the part of our readers, so we are going to look again to see if there is more we can do to explain our relationship to Women in the World in their articles. ” Glad to hear it. Updated 12:12 p. m. January 27, to clarify Soros’s connection to the march."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more CO2-obsessed climate scientists deny the sun’s powerful role in driving climate, the more that other serious scientists are finding out that it is in fact truly The Dominant Player in climate.

The Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestial Physics here has a recent paper where scientists have found a “significant relation” between sunspots and El Niño Southern Oscillation.
Image source: here
This once again indicates that the sun indeed drives climate in a complex and interwoven variety of ways and that the belief that 100 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is in the climate driver’s seat is astonishingly naive.

Unfortunately this paper was not mentioned by the main stream media, and likely will likely be ignored by the CO2-obsessed IPCC, as is the case with so many other papers.
Sincere thanks to reader Rick for bringing it to our attention.
The abstract follows (emphasis added):
The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can explore the information about the related variables. This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability.
This is just the latest paper joining dozens of others showing that the sun is the earth’s only real climate engine.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNational Academy of Sciences (1975): “We do not know what causes…climatic change”
By Kenneth Richard
After having switched from warning the masses in the 1970s about imminent human-caused global cooling to warning the masses in the 1980s about an imminent human-caused global warming , the late Dr. Stephen Schneider suggested that, to avoid “potentially disastrous climatic change,” scientists should consider offering up “scary scenarios” so as to “capture the public’s imagination.”
Dr. Stephen Schneider via Discover, pp. 45-48, Oct. 1989:
On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but — which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broad based support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.”
Notice how Schneider confirmed that an essential element in garnering “loads of media coverage” and “broad based support” is to “make little mention of any doubts we [climate scientists] may have.”  Judging by media attention, this “strategy of advocacy” appears to have worked.  After all, a growing percentage of the populace is now familiar with the claim that we can determine there is a 97% scientific consensus that humans cause climate change by selectively counting (and excluding) abstracts from scientific papers.  In other words, expressing uncertainty or doubt about “disastrous climate change” caused by humans relegates one to classification with the claimed 3% fringe.
It didn’t used to be this way. Back in the 1970s and ’80s, or before there were strong government-sponsored incentives to link human activity to climate changes, it was still quite common for scientists to acknowledge that:
(a) climate parameters are extremely difficult to model because
(b) there are far too many unknowns in the climate system to determine cause and effect with confidence, and
(c) a discernable link between climate change and human activity is extremely difficult to establish.
For example, no less than the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) at one time definitively acknowledged that too little is known about the climate system to understand what causes climatic change. The summary of their position below is taken from the extensively-referenced 1975 NAS paper entitled “Understanding Climatic Change”. (National Academy of Sciences, 1975)
[T]he mechanics of the climatic system is so complex, and our observations of its behavior so incomplete, that at present we do not know what causes any particular climatic change to occur. … What we cannot identify at the present time is how the complete climatic system operates, which are its most critical and sensitive parts, which processes are responsible for its changes, and what are the most likely future climates. In short, while we know something about climate itself, we know very little about climatic change.
Aside from local climatic effects, such as those due to urbanization, these studies have not yet established the existence of a large-scale anthropogenic climatic impact (Machata, 1973). Like their numerical simulation counterparts, such studies are made more difficult by the high levels of natural climatic variability and by the lack of adequate observational data.”
By no means was this expressed climate agnosticism by the NAS rare during that particular time period. Scientists routinely published papers in journals in the 1970s and 1980s that acknowledged a lack of understanding with regard to the main causes of climate change or the inherent limitations in climate modeling. In fact, some scientists described projections of future temperature changes in response to human activities an exercise in “the blind leading the blind.”
Other scientists acknowledged that it is “practically impossible to isolate simple cause-and-effect relationships in the internal workings of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system” or, succinctly, that we “should admit at once that we do not know what are the basic causes of climatic change“.
However, by the 1990s, or with the advent of the the United Nations issuing the first two IPCC reports (1990, 1995), these we-don’t-know concessions by scientists had begun to dissipate. Expressing uncertainty or doubt about the dangerous climatic effects of carbon dioxide has become increasingly taboo.
Even the editor of the journal Science (Marcia McNutt) has herself recently (2015) written that, with regard to human-caused global warming, “the time for debate has ended.”  (Link: here). The uncertainty, doubt, and skepticism have essentially been shooed away, which has paved the way for “scary scenarios” to potentially “capture the public’s imagination” — just as Dr. Stephen Schneider had proposed.
With this contrast between then and now in mind, perhaps it would be interesting to read what scientists used to commonly write in scientific journals with regard to the immense uncertainties associated with climate change. Below  are several prototypical examples from the time period when expressing a lack of understanding about the causes of climate change was still considered acceptable — or before scientific advocacy was normalized.
—–
1. Barrett, 1978
In particular, detection of an anthropogenic influence through statistical analysis alone requires a long run of data of good quality and careful attention to measures of significance. It is most important to avoid the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that a trend of a few years’ duration or less, following some change in human activities, can be attributed to that change even when no sound physical causal relationship is evident. … While one must presume that natural climatic fluctuations result from the operations of the laws of physics and chemistry, it is practically impossible to isolate simple cause-and-effect relationships in the internal workings of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system. This is because all the processes are interconnected by multiple nonlinear positive and negative feedbacks.
2. Fletcher, 1968
What Causes the Global Climate to Change? No one has been able to explain why such climatic variations occur. They seem to be associated with variations in the vigor of the whole global atmospheric circulation, but why the global system varies is still a mystery. It follows that the fundamental problem in the study of climatic change is the development of a quantitative understanding of the general circulation of the atmosphere; and, since three-fourths of the heat which forces the atmospheric motion comes by way of the ocean surface, a quantitative understanding of oceanic heat transport and ocean/atmosphere heat exchange is especially vital. … An adequate theoretical basis has not as yet been developed for explaining the interactions of the global heat engine and for accounting for observed changes in climate. Causal relationships have been obscured by the multitude of factors operating and problems for investigation have often been ill-defined.  … [T]here are so many variables and degrees of freedom in the global system that specific cause and effect estimates in this regard are very uncertain.
3. Hare, 1971
It is discouraging to have to start by admitting that future changes in the atmosphere may be the result of the inherent instability of the atmospheric circulation, and not of environmental changes that we can detect, and perhaps control. … Explaining past climates and predicting future climates are complementary processes.  As Murray Mitchell pointed out, also at Boulder (Mitchell, 1968), we are miles away from explaining the past, whose record is so blurred that there remain open “many degrees of freedom for the construction of altogether new hypotheses.”   He laid stress where I shall place it today — on the view that explaining climatic variation must rest on an adequate theory of existing climate.  Until we can argue backwards and forwards in time from such a secure foundation we shall continue to be the blind led by the blind.
4. Gilchrist, 1983

Unlike some other pollutants introduced into the atmosphere by Man, carbon dioxide is naturally occurring and non-toxic. The direct effect of increased concentrations may be beneficial notably because it will tend to increase the rate of photosynthesis in plants. On the other hand, there may be deleterious effects through its influence on climate but this is still unproven and we cannot be certain whether, on a global scale, it will on the whole be harmful or beneficial. … The problem of determining the effect of increased carbon dioxide on climate is difficult, the more so because there are some essential aspects of the physical basis of climate that are not well understood
5. Catchpole, 1973
Sellers (1965, p. 198) regretted that while ‘the literature has been saturated with theories of climatic change . . . uncertainty is the only thing that is certain’. Crowe (1971, p. 471) conceded that although palaeoclimatology asks straightforward questions about the nature and causes of climatic changes, ‘the answers still largely elude us’. In the same year Flint (1971, p. 789) appealed that we should ‘admit at once that we do not know what are the basic causes of climatic change’.
6. Stewart and Glantz, 1985
[I]n the early 1970s the prevailing view was that the earth was moving toward a new ice age. Many articles appeared in the scientific literature as well as in the popular press speculating about the impact on agriculture of a 1-2°C cooling. … The causes of global climate change remain in dispute. Existing theories of climate, atmospheric models, and actuarial experience are inadequate to meet the needs of policymakers for information about future climate. In the long run, research may lead to reliable forecasts of climate. For the present, however, policymakers have no recourse but to heed expert judgments – subjective and contradictory though they may be – about future world climate and its effects on agriculture and other sectors of the economy.
7. Roberts, 1975
There are, of course, many different ideas about the origins of climate change. Many factors have been looked upon as potential causes: vulcanism, sea surface temperature changes, changes in CO2 content of the atmosphere, oscillations in Arctic ice and sea depth, and atmospheric turbidity changes due to manmade dust or wind-blown soil and sand. These theories, including the solar one, share the difficulty that they have not yet reached the stage where convincing experimental verification is possible.
8. Shutts and Green, 1972
Many theories about climate change are essentially untestable, but we can still develop a consistent model based on understandable physics—in fact the data cannot be interpreted without one. Shutts and Green believe there is some fundamental defect in all present models: it could be something physically improbable, like an unreasonable effect of tiny solar variations. More likely there is a fundamental lack in our appreciation of how very interactive systems behave.
9. Chaston, 1980
Much of the Northern Hemisphere experienced a dramatic upsurge in snowfall during the 1970s as compared with the previoius decades. … Whether the “Snowy Seventies” heralded the dawn of a major cooling trend or is merely a temporary anomaly is highly debatable.  One may ask fifty meteorologists for his/her opinion on climatic change and inevitably receive fifty differing opinions.  This is why meteorology is so exciting: even with relatively advanced computer programs and the complete set of equations of motion of the atmosphere, we are far from truly understanding the mechanics of Mother Nature.
10. Mac Cracken, 1982
Several recent studies have contended that the increase in CO2 concentrations since the start of the Industrial Revolution has led to identifiable climatic warming. Significant approximations and simplifications have had to be made, however, in order to isolate this supposed CO2 effect from the comparably large latitudinal and temporal temperature variations that may have been due to changes in volcanism, solar variability, other potentially identifiable causal factors, or natural fluctuations. To overcome the resulting uncertainties, data bases must be improved, diagnostic analyses and numerical models must more completely treat the spatial and temporal patterns and phase relations of the expected changes, and a careful search for a set of CO2-specific climate modifications must be undertaken.
11. Schneider, 1974
Unfortunately, knowledge of climate theory is still too primitive to trace reliably climatic cause and effect links, and therefore it is argued that large-scale climate modification schemes appear irresponsible.
12. Dyson, 1977
The magnitude of this negative feed-back effect of atmospheric CO2 upon itself depends on many ecological interactions which have yet to be disentangled. The effect could be negligibly small, or it could be as large as 3 x 109 tons of carbon per yr. In summary, there is insufficient evidence to decide whether the carbon content of the biosphere has decreased, increased or remained stationary in response to the manifold human activities of recent decades. There exists a huge literature attempting to assess or to prognosticate the effects of the increasing atmospheric CO2 on the climate of the earth. Such attempts are useful and necessary, but they run into formidable technical difficulties. Even the mean global temperature rise caused by a given quantity of CO2 is subject to great uncertainty: and the effects of CO2 on local and time-variable phenomena (which may be crucially important to agriculture and other human activities) are more uncertain still.
13. Oerlemans, 1982
Conclusion: This estimate is subject to a number of uncertainties. First of all, opinions about the effect of an increasing CO2 content of the atmosphere differ widely. It is generally accepted that a warming has to be expected, but its magnitude is subject to much debate. Even if we did know the effect of CO2 on climate, things would not be much clearer. The global carbon cycle is poorly understood and we are not yet able to predict (given the anthropogenic CO2 input) the content of the atmosphere for next centuries.
14. Meier, 1983
Should we expect a “threat of disaster” (Mercer, 1978) with sea level and climate in the next 50 years? The obvious answer is no; the complex ice/ocean/atmosphere system is not sufficiently understood. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be robust to rapid oceanographic or atmospheric forcing (Whillans, 1978). Unfortunately, we are not even sure whether its grounding lines are currently advancing or retreating, and we certainly do not understand how surges are triggered. Until such understanding is at hand, and atmospheric-oceanographic circulation models are developed that perform well at high latitudes, we can only watch what is happening.
15. Sachs, 1976
This test shows that patterns of climatic change can be resolved with increasingly greater detail but that ‘first causes’ of climatic change remain elusive.
16. Bryant, 1987
Conclusions: The scenario of a CO2-warming globe contains many uncertainties. The warming of the atmosphere is not an established fact, and even if it was there may be no need to invoke increased atmospheric CO2 or other ‘greenhouse’ gases as the cause when such warmings have been a part of our temperature time series historically.  … A common factor underpinning our uncertainties about a CO2-warming atmospheric scenario is that the Earth is not covered adequately with enough data points to evaluate the scenario conclusively.  Even where geophysical time series are available, they are clouded by the inherent fluctuations of their variances.

Federal spending is on a tear. The February budget deal hiked discretionary spending by $300 billion over two years, and rapid growth in entitlement programs continues unabated. The government will spend $1 trillion more next year than it collects in revenue, and rising amounts after that. The gusher of red ink is remarkable given that we are in the ninth year of economic expansion.



Republican control of the House, the Senate, and the White House is failing the test of fiscal sanity. Another trial for policymakers will be a new farm bill, which is on the agenda because some current farm programs expire in September. In his latest budget, President Trump proposed cuts to farm subsidies, but congressional agriculture committees may try to move ahead on legislation devoid of any reforms.



After the 1996 farm bill made reforms, every farm bill since — 2002, 2008, 2014 — went in the opposite direction and increased subsidies. The 2008 bill was so bad that even big‐​spending President George W. Bush vetoed it, although he was overridden by Congress.





Agricultural subsidies distort markets, harm the environment, line the pockets of the rich, and cost billions of dollars.



The 2014 bill ended one major subsidy program but added two new ones — called ARC (Agriculture Risk Coverage) and PLC (Price Loss Coverage) — that have ended up costing billions of dollars more than promised. And the largest subsidy program — crop insurance — now costs $8 billion a year, or double the average cost during the Bush years. All in all, farm subsidies cost taxpayers more than $20 billion a year.



Each farm bill rejiggers the subsidy structure, but the programs have not become any more sensible. Farm subsidies are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do. The average income of farm households in 2016 was $117,918, or 42 percent higher than the $83,143 average of all U.S. households.



Those figures are for all farmers, but federal subsidies are tilted toward the largest and wealthiest farmers — mainly growers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice. New estimates by scholars at the American Enterprise Institute find that 60 percent of subsidies from the three large crop programs (insurance, ARC, and PLC) go to the largest 10 percent of farms. Politicians claim to support small farmers, but the opposite is true.



Many billionaires have received farm subsidies. Looking from 1995 to 2014, the Environmental Working Group found that 50 people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans have received farm subsidies. But today the largest pot of subsidies is laundered through crop‐​insurance companies, a practice that hides the identities of the recipients. However, the Government Accountability Office found that at least four current recipients of these subsidies have a net worth of more than $1.5 billion.



Farm subsidies are unfair to the taxpayers who pay the bills, but they also harm the broader economy. By interfering with market mechanisms, subsidies can induce overproduction, distort crop choice, undermine cost control, and inflate land prices.



To an extent, federal subsidies are capitalized in higher values for farmland, which in turn raises prices for renting farmland. So the ultimate beneficiaries of subsidies are landowners as much as farmers, who are often different people because half of all U.S. cropland is rented.



Farm subsidies harm the environment. They draw marginal lands into production, so areas that might have been used for forests, grasslands, and wetlands are used instead for crops. Since marginal lands tend to have poorer soils or climates, they may require more intense use of fertilizers and pesticides to be productive.



The upshot is that fiscal conservatives, liberals concerned about income inequality, and environmentalists should all line up against another big farm bill. Politically, President Trump does not want to lose support in the farm states, so it is not surprising that his budget promised to “maintain a strong safety‐​net for farmers,” even as it proposed cuts. But why can’t farmers create their own safety nets?



Farming is risky because crop prices and yields fluctuate. But businesses in other industries face big risks as well. Think about the fast pace of change in technology industries, or the large price swings in the mining and energy industries. Businesses in those industries prosper or sink depending on their own skill, planning, and luck without a federal subsidy cushion.



Farmers know they face risks, so they should save when times are good to weather the tougher years when they come along. When corn prices are high, corn farmers should save their excess profits so that when prices fall they can tap their savings. Farmers can also borrow, buy market‐​based insurance, and use financial tools to hedge their risks, such as futures contracts. The problem is that the gusher of farm subsidies has replaced, or crowded out, greater use of such market financial tools.



Diversification is another strategy to reduce risks. Farmers can diversify their crop plantings to reduce risks from fluctuating yields and price changes, and they can diversify their planting locations to reduce risks from adverse weather.



Farm households can, and do, diversify their sources of income to include both farm and off‐​farm revenues. Department of Agriculture data show that three‐​quarters of farm‐​household income today comes from off‐​farm sources. That statistic has been rising over the years, which has promoted greater financial stability. Even though crop prices have been down in recent years, farms continue to generally have low levels of debt and lower bankruptcy rates than other industries.



Farmers do not need federal welfare, and the Trump reforms would cut some of the waste, as would reforms proposed by AEI, Cato, and the Heritage Foundation. Republicans must decide whether to pass another bloated farm bill or stand up to the farm lobbies and extract needed cuts.

Have you ever wondered how our native wildlife manage to stay alive when an inferno is ripping through their homes, and afterwards when there is little to eat and nowhere to hide? The answer is adaptation and old-fashioned ingenuity. 



Australia’s bushfire season is far from over, and the cost to wildlife has been epic. A [sobering estimate](https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/01/03/a-statement-about-the-480-million-animals-killed-in-nsw-bushfire.html) has put the number of animals killed across eastern Australia at 480 million – and that’s a conservative figure.



But let’s look at some uplifting facts: how animals survive, and what challenges they overcome in the days and weeks after a fire.



In 2018, a staff member at Audubon Zoo in the United States accidentally burned pastry, and [noticed something peculiar](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-019-00628-z). In nearby enclosures ten sleepy lizards, or _Tiliqua rugosa_ , began pacing and rapidly flicking their tongues. But sleepy lizards in rooms unaffected by smoke remained burrowed and calm. 



It was obvious the lizards sensed the smoke from the burnt pastry, probably through olfaction, or sense of smell (which is enhanced by [tongue flicking](https://theconversation.com/explainer-why-do-snakes-flick-their-tongues-29935)). So the lizards were responding as they would to a bushfire. 



In Australia, experiments have shown smoke also awakens [Gould’s long-eared bats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938417304419) and [fat-tailed dunnarts](https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/111825/StawskiMatthewsKoertnerGeiser_SmokeAshTorporActivity_PhysiolBehav2015.pdf), enabling their escape from fire.



Animals also recognise the distinct sounds of fire. Reed frogs [flee towards cover](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2002.1974) and eastern-red bats wake from torpor [when played the crackling sounds of fire](https://sbdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Scesny-MS-Thesis-2006-Red-bats-and-fire-detection.pdf). 



Other species detect fire for different reasons. Fire beetles from the genus _[Melanophila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanophila)_ depend on fire for reproduction, as their larvae develop in the wood of burned trees. They can detect fire chemicals [at very low concentrations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2161-4296.2008.tb00424.x), as well as infrared radiation from fires. 



The beetles can detect very distant fires; [one study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/related?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037627) suggests individuals of some species identify a fire from 130km away. 



Once an animal becomes aware of an approaching fire, it’s decision time: stay or go?



It’s common to see large animals fleeing a fire, such as the kangaroos filmed [hopping from a fire front in Monaro](https://www.facebook.com/abcinsydney/videos/3094496487228353/?t=3) in New South Wales a few days ago. Kangaroos and wallabies make haste to [dams](https://twitter.com/matthewjohngill/status/1211986832763707392) and creek lines, sometimes even [doubling back through a fire front](https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/Fulltext/WR08029) to find safety in areas already burned. 



Other animals prefer to stay put, seeking refuge in burrows or under rocks. Smaller animals will happily [crash a wombat burrow](https://media.australianmuseum.net.au/media/dd/Uploads/Documents/38347/ams370_vXVIII_05_LowRes.ffb19ac.pdf) if it means surviving a fire. Burrows buffer animals from the heat of fires, depending on their depth and nearby [fuel loads](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2404417.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A123188cf5406548889c46d62508dae77). 



From here, animals can [repopulate the charred landscape as it recovers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02251). For example, [evidence suggests](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02251) populations of the agile antechinus (a small carnivorous marsupial) and the bush rat recovered primarily from _within_ the footprint of Victoria’s Black Saturday fires.



The hours, days, and weeks after fire bring a new set of challenges. Food resources will often be scarce, and in the barren landscape some animals, such as lizards and smaller mammals, [are more visible to hungry predators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715002086).



[Birds of prey arrive quickly at fires](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3401). [Several species](https://bioone.org/journals/Journal-of-Ethnobiology/volume-37/issue-4/0278-0771-37.4.700/Intentional-Fire-Spreading-by-Firehawk-Raptors-in-Northern-Australia/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700.full) in northern Australia have been observed intentionally spreading fires by transporting burning sticks in their talons or beaks.



[One US study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.3401) published in 2017 recorded a seven-fold increase in raptor activity during fire. They begin hunting as the fires burn, and [hang around for weeks or months to capitalise on vulnerable prey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1987.tb01088.x). 



In Australia, introduced predators can also be drawn to fires. Feral cats have been observed travelling up to 12.5km from their home ranges [towards recently burned](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/153672/2/01_McGregor_Extraterritorial_hunting_2016.pdf) savanna ecosystems, potentially drawn by distant smoke plumes promising new prey.



[A 2016 study](https://bioone.org/journals/Wildlife-Research/volume-42/issue-8/WR15011/Amplified-predation-after-fire-suppresses-rodent-populations-in-Australias-tropical/10.1071/WR15011.full) found a native rodent was 21 times more likely to die in areas exposed to intense fire compared to unburned areas, mostly due to predation by feral cats. Red foxes have an [affinity for burned areas too](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13153). 



So should a little critter hunker down, or begin the hazardous search for a new home?



Perhaps because of the risks of moving through an exposed landscape, several Australian mammals have learnt to minimise movement following fire. This might allow some mammal populations to recover from within a fire footprint.



Native mammals have been found [hiding in beds of ash](https://media.australianmuseum.net.au/media/dd/Uploads/Documents/38347/ams370_vXVIII_05_LowRes.ffb19ac.pdf) after fires. 



Short-beaked echidnas seek refuge and, when finding it, [lower their body temperature and limit activity](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0382), so reducing the amount of food they need for energy. Despite their spiny defences, echidnas have been found more often [in the stomachs of foxes following fire](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/98/3/835/3063279), so staying put in a little refuge is a good move.



Small marsupials such as brown and yellow-footed antechinus also [use torpor to suppress their energy use](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0134) and therefore the need to seek food.



Not all wildlife have adapted to stay put after a fire, and moving in search of a safe haven might be the best option.



Animals might take short, information-gathering missions from their refuges into the fireground before embarking on a risky trek. They may, for example, spot a large, unburned tree that would make good habitat, and so move towards it. Without such cues to orient their movement, animals spend more time travelling, wasting precious energy reserves and [increasing the risk ](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.1958)of becoming predator food. 



Australia’s animals have a long, impressive history of co-existing with fire. However, a [recent study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/brv.12486) I led with 27 colleagues considered how relatively recent threats make things much harder for animals in fire-prone landscapes.



Some native species are not accustomed to dealing with red foxes and feral cats, and so might overlook cues that indicate their presence, and make the bad decision to move through a burned landscape when they should stay put. 



When fires burn habitat in agricultural or urban landscapes, animals might encounter not just predators but vehicles, livestock and harmful chemicals. 



And as this bushfire season has made brutally clear, climate change is increasing the scale and intensity of bushfires. This reduces the number of small refuges such as fallen logs, increases the distance animals must cover to find new habitat and leaves fewer cues to direct them to safer places.



We still have a lot to learn about how Australia’s wildlife detect and respond to fire. Filling in the knowledge gaps might lead to new ways of helping wildlife adapt to our rapidly changing world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif used to often appears on television, radio and speeches all over Germany to spread the word of an impending human-made climate catastrophe.
Hat-tip Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
One of the highlights of Latif’s many appearances was the CO2 “fingerprint” in the atmosphere, which according to Latif is supposed to confirm the greenhouse effect. Up in the stratosphere it is supposed to cool because heat would be trapped by CO2 in the troposphere below. This of course always impressed his gullible audiences.
Profound reversal
However, it now appears that the distinguished German scientist is now changing his mind profoundly. In a recent press release he and his fellow co-scientists in Kiel, Germany, conceded that the cooling is likely more a part of the 60-year PDO ocean cycle.
What follows is the press release from the Kiel-based Geomar research institute dated 26 July 2016:

Middle atmosphere in sync with the ocean
Relationship between decadal variations in temperatures in the Pacific and the tropopause identified.
26 July 2016/Kiel. In the late 20th century scientists observed a cooling at the transition between the troposphere and stratosphere at an altitude of about 15 kilometers. They believed this development in the so-called tropopause was caused by human influences. Climate scientists from Kiel and Bergen (Norway) have now published a study in the international journal Scientific Reports showing that the cooling could also be part of a natural decadal variation which is controlled by the water temperature of the Pacific.
Water plays a major role for our planet not only in its liquid form at the surface. In the atmosphere too, it considerably affects our lives as well as weather and climate. Clouds and rainfall are one example. Water vapor, the gaseous form of water, also plays a prominent role on Earth. It is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, without it the Earth would be a frozen planet. For climate variations, water vapor is particularly important in the stratosphere at altitudes between 15 and 50 kilometers. How much of the gas actually reaches the stratosphere mainly depends on the temperature at the transition between the lowest atmospheric layer, the troposphere, and the overlying stratosphere. This boundary layer is called the tropopause.

 Now scientists of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, together with a colleague from Bergen (Norway), were able to demonstrate for the first time that natural fluctuations in water temperatures of the Pacific – which occur on decadal timescales – are directly related to the temperature of the tropical tropopause. “It has long been thought that human influences already affected the tropopause. However, it seems that natural variability is still the dominating factor,” says Dr. Wuke Wang from GEOMAR, lead author of the study just published in the international journal Scientific Reports.
For their study, the researchers used observations for the period 1979-2013 and also climate models. “We were thus able to extend the study period to nearly 150 years. The model allows us to easily look at both human and natural influences and to separate their impacts from each other,” explains Prof. Dr. Katja Matthes, climate researcher at GEOMAR and co-author of the study.
A well-known climatic phenomenon is the so-called Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). “This natural variation with decadal timescale leads to anomalously high or low water temperatures of the Pacific,” explained Dr. Wang. The PDO influences the climate and ecosystems in the Pacific region and also the global mean temperature of the Earth.
The model simulations show that the fluctuations in water temperatures also affect the wind systems over the tropical and subtropical Pacific. This in turn also alters the air transport between the lower and upper layers of the troposphere, ultimately regulating the temperatures at the boundary to the stratosphere. “We were now able to demonstrate these relationships for the first time,” said Dr. Wang.
Thus, the current study contradicts earlier hypotheses about the temperature variability of the tropical tropopause. As early as in the late 20th century, scientists had seen a cooling trend there which began in the 1970s. They traced this observation back to anthropogenic causes, in particular the increase in greenhouse gases. “However, this assumption was based on a rather patchy data base and simplified climate models. Our study shows that the cooling of the tropical tropopause does not have to be a one-way street but could also be part of a natural fluctuation which extends over several decades,” Professor Matthes emphasized.
This knowledge is also of paramount importance for the general climate research. The temperature of the tropopause decides on the input of water vapor into the stratosphere: The higher the water vapor content in the stratosphere, the higher the increase in surface temperatures. Anthropogenic climate change also has an effect on the temperature of the tropopause, and this effect could become more evident in the coming decades. “Only if we can clearly distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic influences, we can make reliable forecasts for the future development of our climate,” Prof. Matthes summarizes.

This story has legs now, as I predicted in this piece yesterday “The ‘RICO 20 letter’ to Obama asking for prosecution of climate skeptics disappears from Shukla’s IGES website amid financial concerns” the Streisand Effect has been unleashed. Now, instead of explaining why the RICO 20 letter was mysteriously withdrawn from the IGES website after questions began to be asked about the millions of dollars that George Mason’s Jagadish Shukla apparently has received, some of it while apparently “double dipping” against university policy, all the while claiming climate skeptics are the recipients of money that should be prosecuted under the RICO act, we find this curious missive posted in place of the RICO20 letter at the URL where it previously resided:

Source: http://www.iges.org/letter/LetterPresidentAG.pdf
“Inadvertently placed on this web site”? I think not, especially since that URL was the “go to” given in their press release about the letter and referenced in numerous news outlets, without so much as a peep of a correction for over a month while that story ran wild. All of the sudden it was posted in the wrong place?
I call that explanation “BS of the highest order”. He got caught with his pants down, tables have turned, and now its damage control, and badly done damage control at that, since the actions are making the situation with Shukla even more suspect.
Then there’s the apparent nepotism going on with all that public money used to fund Shukla’s climate dreams:
IGES Personnel:
President Shukla, Jagadish
Business Manager Shukla, Anastasia
Assistant Business Manager Shukla, Sonia
Director, COLA Kinter, James
Assistant to the President Shukla, Sonia
Source: http://www.iges.org/aboutiges.html
And, Steve McIntyre had called out one of the signatories, Barry Klinger, over untrue claims in Reckless Misinformation from Barry Klinger and the RICO 20
Klinger has now started a climbdown, screencap of http://mason.gmu.edu/~bklinger/ricoDebate.html below:

Popcorn futures are climbing, and this episode, along with all the many many “follow the money” tentacles it has, may very well become the takedown of organized climate science. The RICO20 has opened a Pandora’s box upon themselves.
As Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. Tweeted:

People that live in Greenhouses shouldn’t cast stones.

Tempranillo (also known as Ull de Llebre, Cencibel, Tinto del Pais and several other synonyms) is a black grape variety widely grown to make full-bodied red wines in its native Spain.[1] Its name is the diminutive of the Spanish temprano (“early”),[1] a reference to the fact that it ripens several weeks earlier than most Spanish red grapes.Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The International Organisation of Vine and Wine has stated it is not concerned about the impact of climate change, at least in the short to medium term.
According to Reuters;
Good news for wine drinkers: a leading international body says grape vines are a hardy little number and can survive climate change, at least over the medium term.
Earlier harvesting, changes in grape varieties and new wine-making processes have already helped counter the impact of the harsher weather hitting vineyards across the globe, the head of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) says.
“Wine producers all over the world have adapted to the changes and the plant has a capacity of adjustment that you can find in no other plant,” OIV Director General Jean-Marie Aurand told Reuters in an interview.
He cited the example of the Canary island of Lanzarote where vines are grown in lava which absorbs overnight dew – virtually the sole water they receive in the summer – and releases it during the day.
In China, he said, more than 80 percent of production acreage is located in regions where temperatures can drop below minus 30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) in winter. Growers cover vines to protect them and uncover them when spring comes.

This kind of broad range of growing conditions seems common. Pick up any vegetable seed packet from your local garden shop, and you will see instructions for growing the plant in a wide range of climatic conditions, in different regions of your country.
Staple crops like Wheat are grown in conditions ranging from Canada and Siberia, on the edge of the Arctic, to the blistering hot Australian Outback.
Warmth loving plants such as tomatoes sometimes have to be started in a greenhouse, when grown in cold countries. On a commercial scale, this is often achieved by covering acres of new seedbeds with plastic.
The successful adaption of rice to a wide variety conditions is even more spectacular. Dr Peter Jennings probably deserves a post of his own – he literally saved millions of people in Asia from starvation, by selective breeding, providing the world with new, high yielding varieties of rice.
Other plants like strawberries thrive in cold England, but they also thrive in subtropical Australia, providing you keep them well watered.
Even coffee bushes can cope with a broad range of environmental growing conditions. There are commercial coffee growers in Australia, who produce coffee in climatic conditions far removed from more traditional alpine equatorial coffee producing countries.
In my opinion, it is no exaggeration to suggest climate scares about food production in a warmer world are nonsense. It is good to see industry bodies like the International Organisation of Vine and Wine starting to push back against such claims.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_—_   
  
This week, as our title suggests, we have a somewhat eclectic mix of articles worthy of your attention (and some that are not). Let’s get started.   
  
In handing down its decision on Monday in _Michigan v. EPA_ , the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was remiss for not considering costs when deciding to (expensively) regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. This ruling was urged in Cato’s amicus brief, and hailed as a victory for “liberty and sound science.”   
  
But the direct impact on the ruling as it pertains to mercury emissions is likely to be slight as most coal-fired power plants have already been modified (or shut down) in an effort to reduce mercury emissions under the EPA’s 2012 regulation. Rather, what is being debated in the ruling’s aftermath is what the implication may be on future EPA actions.   
  
Some have argued the ruling in _Michigan v. EPA_ was “pointless,” while other have argued that it “may be the beginning of the end of the Obama Administration’s climate agenda.” Perhaps the biggest thing that could result would be for the Supreme Court to re-evaluate its decision in the _Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council_ case. This possibility was raised by Clarence Thomas in his concurring opinion on the case. The _Wall Street Journal_ editors picked up on this in their review of the _Michigan v. EPA_ decision and highlight its importance:   




Which is why Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion deserves a larger audience. He makes a provocative case that the Court’s 1984 decision in _Chevron_ _v. Natural Resources Defense Council_ is unconstitutional. Under what has become known as “Chevron deference,” the Court defers to executive interpretations when laws are ambiguous. Justice Thomas writes that this has become a license for the executive to usurp legislative powers that are supposed to be vested in Congress.   
  
“Perhaps there is some unique historical justification for deferring to federal agencies, but these cases reveal how paltry an effort we have made to understand it or to confine ourselves to its boundaries,” Justice Thomas writes. “Although we hold today that EPA exceeded even the extremely permissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we should be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those precedents to make the bid for deference that it did here.”   
  
That’s an especially apt point coming in a year when the Supreme Court seemed to abdicate much of its obligation to police the Constitution’s separation between the executive and legislative power. A future Court ought to revisit Chevron deference in what has become an era of presidential law-making.



Here’s hoping!   
  
And here’s how it can happen. At Cato, your obedient servants have, through the years, purposefully compiled a massive record of public comments on global warming regulation that we have filed as official responses to requests for them in the _Federal Register_. These include our _Addendum_ to the Government’s second “National Assessment” of climate change. It was designed to have a look similar to the federal document, with the cover the exact same material paragraph-by-paragraph, if possible, to make comparison as simple as possible.   




Now, suppose someone files in DC District court over the next EPA insult with regard to global warming, claiming authority because of its “endangerment finding” from carbon dioxide, which, they claim, compels them to regulate it under the Clean Air Act. Turns out that 2009 Finding is largely based upon the second _Assessment_.   
  
In our fantasy world, the plaintiff enters both the _Assessment_ and our _Addendum_ into the record, and, our dream goes, the judge holds them side-by-side and notes the massive amount of science that is missing from the federal report. Perhaps, thanks to Clarence Thomas, he or she might think that the EPA’s purported “science” is clearly an attempt to mislead, and seeing as this is such an egregious insult, upholds the plaintiff _based upon an abrogation of Chevron Deference._   
  
Another interesting post this week came courtesy of Blair King who runs the blogsite “A Chemist in Langley.” King is an avowed lukewarmer and has interesting things to say on a variety of climate-related topics. In a recent post, he takes on the term “Business-as-Usual” which has been co-opted by the climate activists to replace “worst case.” While “worst case” sounds like something which can be dismissed as being very unlikely, “Business-as-Usual” (BAU) sounds like something that is imminent unless things change. But, what is conveniently ignored by the activists using the term is that things _do_ change. Which means things changing is really what BAU represents. BAU is not a static technology, frozen actions case. Instead it is a highly dynamic future filled with new technologies, adaptations, etc.   
  
King points out that BAU and the high end emissions scenarios (RCP8.5) described by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its most recent _Assessment Report_ are _not_ synonymous despite increasing usage as such by those pushing climate catastrophe and regulations to avert it.   
  
There are few folks who call the activists out on this. But the numbers are increasing. Besides ourselves, several recent pieces have appeared (see here and here for example), and King’s piece another welcomed example.   
  
King sets the stage:   




As I describe in my post “Does the climate change debate need a reset? - on name calling in the climate change debate” one of the critical battles in any debate is control over the labelling of the actors. If you can apply the best possible label to yourself and the least agreeable label to your opponent you immediately gain the upper hand. In the climate change debate, the “Business as Usual” label has been used more times that I can count with activists from the folks at Skeptical Science to the Suzuki Foundation, and from the Pembina Institute to 350.org  all finding some way to slip that phrase into their calls demanding immediate action (and of course donations to their cause). As this post will demonstrate, however, the “Business as Usual” descriptor used by the activists in the climate debate is nothing of the sort. Rather it is an artifact from earlier versions of the IPCC reports and was conspicuous by its absence in the most recent (Fifth Assessment) report.



After taking us through the list of reasons why BAU is really not BAU, King concludes:   




Looking at what the activists have labelled the “Business as Usual” scenario we see a slew of assumptions that are anything but business as usual… Similarly when an activist talks about “business as usual” in their sales pitch, it is time to put your wallet back in your pocket.



You really ought to have a look at King’s entire piece.   
  
  
  
And this week, we introduce a new concept in our _You Ought to Have a Look_ series—Look Away, items that are most definitely _not_ worth your time.   
  
Two notable items fall into our Look Away category this week.   
  
The first is a piece titled “Potent Poison Ivy” that appears on the ClimateCentral.org website—a website that spends an undue amount of time spreading worries about climate change. Their poison ivy piece is a good example of this tendency (and a classic example of our Good for Bad; Bad for Good theory). Of the literally 1000s of article in the scientific literature that highlight the benefits that an atmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide has on plants, Climate Central decides to highlight the growth enhancement of _poison ivy_. No doubt, poison ivy does grow better, healthier, stronger, and more productive under conditions of elevated carbon dioxide, _but so do virtually all plants_ —including food crops.   
  
To be better and more fully informed about the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide on plant health, you should visit the wealth of data contained in the website CO2science.org that is run by Cato Adjunct Scholar Dr. Craig Idso. For example, in a recent paper, Craig reviewed the impact of elevated CO2 on the world’s top 45 food crops and found that the yield enhancement to date to be about 10 to 15 percent—a sizeable and significant benefit. Craig expects the crop yield increases to continue to grow as the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration continues to increase as a result of emissions from human activity. We don’t expect finding like these to appear anytime soon at Climate Central.   
  
Another article to look away from comes from the NationalGeographic.org and links shark attacks to global warming. In their post “North Carolina’s ‘Perfect Storm’ for Shark Attacks” National Geographic includes this gem:   




“Clearly global climate change is a reality and it has resulted in warmer temperatures in certain places at certain times,” says Burgess.   
  
As warming is expected to increase, it will likely bring more sharks farther north and entice more people to get into the water, which will lead to more bites.



This is exactly how we scripted it many moons ago, when we wrote a tongue-in-cheek journalist’s guide to linking shark attacks to global warming. We dummied up an article that went like this:   




Shark Attacks on Humans Related to Global Warming!



How best to explain the relationship? ""Well, Katie [Couric], we suspect (and our preliminary research bears this out) that higher temperatures make sharks more active. We already know those same high temperatures send more people to the beach in an effort to cool off. It just stands to reason that the more people there are in the water, the more opportunities there are for shark attack. As global temperatures continue to rise due to fossil fuel emissions, so too will incidents of shark attack. In fact, that drive to the beach is contributing to the problem. People really ought to stay home.""



The similarity to the National Geographic piece is scary! But of course, we weren’t being serious. So, if you really insist on looking into global warming and shark attacks, our article will prove much more entertaining (and pertinent) than the one from National Geographic—so that’s where you really ought to have a look!

"**Two companies with major operations in Hong Kong have revealed the financial impact of violent protests in the City.**
Luxury fashion house Burberry said Hong Kong sales had fallen sharply and would ""remain under pressure"".
Airline Cathay Pacific said the civil unrest had ""been exceptionally challenging, severely impacting demand and operations of the business"".
The anti-government protests have gripped Hong Kong for five months and rattled stock markets.
Burberry said it had seen a ""double digit"" percentage decline in sales in Hong Kong - where it has 10 shops and usually generates about 8% of its sales.
However, its share of sales from Hong Kong fell to 5% in the latest quarter and chief financial officer Julie Brown said the group had been forced to close some stores to keep staff safe, although none had been damaged.
The retailer said it had written down the value of its stores in Hong Kong by Â£14m.
Despite this, total sales across the Burberry group rose 5% in the six months to 28 September. Marco Gobbetti, Burberry's chief executive, said the results were in line with the guidance earlier in the year despite the disruption in Hong Kong, and the retailer's shares climbed 5% in response.
Mr Gobbetti has been taking Burberry further upmarket since he took the helm two years ago and said the new collection from its chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci was generating ""strong double digit growth"".
Cathay Pacific - which is majority-owned by the Swire investment company, while Air China has a 30% stake - said the short-term outlook remained ""challenging and uncertain"".
The Hong Kong flag carrier lowered its profit guidance for the second time in less than a month.
The ""forward bookings outlook remains weak and uncertain"", the airline said, with passenger traffic dipping ""significantly"", particularly for inbound flights from mainland China.
The airline changed its top management in August when its then chief executive, Rupert Hogg, quit after the airline became embroiled in a controversy over the Hong Kong protests.
Cathay Pacific had initially told its staff it would not stop them joining the pro-democracy demonstrations, but days later Mr Hogg warned staff they could be fired if they ""support or participate in illegal protests"".
In Thursday's results presentation, the airline said inbound passenger traffic was down 38% in August and September, and 35% in October. It added it was reducing its fight capacity by 6% to 7% in the coming months.
The carrier is also deferring the delivery of four Airbus SE narrow body planes in 2020 as a result of the downturn in demand.
Luya You, an analyst at broking group Bocom International who attended Cathay's analyst briefing, told Reuters that the management ""didn't rule out more extreme measures - grounding aircraft, severing leases, cancelling orders - if the situation in Hong Kong deteriorates or extends significantly beyond expectations"".
All schools were closed on Thursday in Hong Kong as the territory faced another day of escalating unrest.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform."
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

"**Ethiopia's prime minister has said a military operation against rebel forces in the northern Tigray region is entering its ""final phase"".**
Abiy Ahmed said a three-day deadline given for Tigray's forces to surrender had now expired.
Hundreds of people have reportedly died in nearly two weeks of clashes between the rebels and the federal army. At least 27,000 people have fled to Sudan.
The UN has said a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"" is unfolding.
Getting information from Tigray is hard as there is a virtual communications blackout.
Fighting broke out on 4 November after Ethiopia's central government accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons. The TPLF has denied the attack.
In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive against forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, accusing them of treason. He said that ""the last red line had been crossed"".
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Ethiopia said its forces are marching on Tigray's capital Mekelle after making major military gains, and accused Tigrayans of destroying bridges en route to the city. The Tigrayans say they are defending the town of Alamata, which lies on the road north to Mekelle.
In a Facebook post, Mr Abiy said the operation by the federal forces was nearing a conclusion.
""The final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days,"" the prime minister said.
He thanked TPLF fighters who, he said, had taken advantage of the deadline to switch sides but he did not give a number.
And Mr Abiy added that his government was ""ready to receive and reintegrate our fellow Ethiopians fleeing to neighbouring countries"".
Meanwhile, TPLF adviser Fesseha Tessema, a former Ethiopian diplomat, told the BBC that civilian sites in Mekelle were being bombed by federal forces.
""[The people of Tigray] haven't done anything wrong, they are in their own homes, churches,"" Mr Fesseha said.
The federal government has denied targeting civilians and said that air attacks are aimed at the Tigrayan military.
The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said that ""a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding"" and thousands have been fleeing the fighting.
The agency was ""on stand-by to provide assistance in Tigray when access and security allow"" spokesman Babar Baloch said.
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday last week.
Mr Abiy has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings. The TPLF has denied involvement, saying it will welcome an independent international investigation.
Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority."
"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."

Kudos to President Bush, the first world leader whose administration has pronounced the Kyoto Protocol stone, cold dead. 



It’s about time —- and it’s about mathematics. Kyoto was probably the dumbest international instrument signed by an American chief executive. 



Strong words, but easy to back up with a little primer on climate change. If we continue on our way, doing nothing and with no specific attempt to spread technologies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the earth will continue to warm. Averaging the so called “general circulation climate models” used in the upcoming U.N. compendium on climate gives a 2.2ºC (4 degrees Fahrenheit) warming for the next 100 years. 



When run backwards, most (but not all) of those models “hind cast” too much warming in recent decades. When their mean prediction is adjusted for this fact, and for the scientific truth that a small fraction of recent warming is from changes in the sun, the expected warming in the next 100 years drops to around 1.4ºC (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Several scientists, ranging from those in the service of the British government (whose radical position on global warming resulted in riots last summer), to those in libertarian think tanks, have replicated this calculation and come up with the same answer. 



That’s not a large number, and it is disproportionately distributed into a warming of the coldest winter temperatures. But, even so, what would Kyoto do about it? 



The answer is, nothing. 



At least nothing that could have any discernible impact on how climate influences our lives. Clinton administration scientists answered this one for us: If all of the nations did what they said they would do under Kyoto, the net amount of warming reduced by the year 2100 would be 0.14ºC. That’s 6.4 percent of the average warming of those U.N. models. 



How much does it cost? Estimates range from 1 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP per year. The larger figure assumes very little “emissions trading” between nations, where we could take credit for emissions prevented in, say, Africa, by giving them less emissive technology. Incidentally, our European friends don’t want us to make up the majority of our emissions by doing this humane thing. The cost figure also looms large if we can’t “sequester” our emissions in trees and soils, and are instead forced to raise energy prices. Again, our European allies won’t let that happen, either. So the 3 percent‐​GDP range is the more likely figure. 



If anyone wants to see a microcosm of what Kyoto would bring, look no further than California, except that the lack of energy must also be exacerbated by excessive energy taxes. 



These numbers are well known to the Bush Administration—which needs to get them out in public—and to the environmental press, which never mentions them. 



Think of them in terms of “insurance,” and substitute “your house” for GDP. According to Kyoto, you would pay 3 percent of the value of your property, each and every year. And should your house burn down, Kyoto will reward you with 6.3 percent of its total value. Is that all you get for your money? 



It’s worse than this. Kyoto would probably wreak great harm on the environment. It is well known that the more affluent a society is, the more it protects the environment. Among other things, people have more capital to invest in the development of efficient technology. Taking this capital away in the form of the onerous energy taxes required to promulgate Kyoto has the additional pernicious effect of giving our government a virtually limitless fund to squander, when the investing should be left up to individuals. I have personally lost thousands of dollars on Ballard Power Systems, a fuel‐​cell company, and I drive a gas‐​electric Honda Insight (a great car that really does get 70 mpg). But it is not your responsibility to buy stock or cars for me or anyone else. 



Finally, Kyoto is irrelevant. History teaches us that we cannot anticipate the technological changes of the next 100 years, but we can be sure that what gives us power, and how we move things, will be very different than what runs us today. Compare horse‐​drawn 1900 to Internet‐​driven 2000 for an example. I don’t know what will charge the world of 2100, but I doubt that it will produce a lot of greenhouse emissions, whether or not they are harmful. 



Do the math. Kyoto was a bad deal, whether or not you care about global warming. And it’s a good deal that finally there is a world leader with the courage to tell the truth.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEnergy experts Jürgen Großmann and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt wrote in an opinion piece in Saturday’s hardcopy edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) that renewable energies are expensive, costing 2 to 3 times more than conventional energy.

FAZ: “Worry over transition to renewable energy”
The two German experts warn that any attempt the country makes to reach the target of 45% renewable energy by the year 2025 is tantamount to economic Harakiri.
28 billion euros annually
Already Germany’s budding Energiewende is costing German consumers and businesses 28 billion euros annually, or roughly an average of 300 euros for each household. These costs are driven in part by insanely high leasing costs that wind turbine operators pay to wealthy land owners –  and subsidies paid to growers of corn for biofuel.
Storage technology “prohibitively expensive”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Großmann and Vahrenholt also remind readers storage technologies are “prohibitively expensive” and offer no solution the problem of evening out the highly volatile wind and solar supply.
Sizzling power grids
Another major problem, the two energy experts comment, are the extreme uncontrolled power surges occurring on both sunny and windy days. In such cases the operators of over-fed, sizzling grids are forced to dump surplus electricity into the power grids of neighboring countries, which has the effect of upsetting both their grids and power generation markets. Another peculiarity is that wind park operators are routinely ordered to shut down, yet are paid for the power that never gets produced. German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel once said that other countries think it’s “crazy”.
Großmann and Vahrenholt, both former top energy executives, characterize the demands made by the influential German Greens to shut down the country’s coal power plants as naïve and simply unworkable, and call plans to install large wind parks near the Baltic Sea before constructing transmission lines to take the power to markets “nonsense”.
German reductions would be wiped out in just 3 months
The economics of the German renewables project also border on insanity. Vahrenholt and Großmann remind that all the CO2 reductions that are to be made by Germany would be wiped out by China’s massive growth in just a matter of three months, making all the pain and cost for nothing. China represents 29% of the world’s CO2 emissions, Germany only a paltry 2.5%.
Vahrenholt and Großmann conclude that Germany must return to rationality by getting back on a renewable energy path that is technicaly and economically feasilble, and not one that destroys the environment and economy, as is the case currently in Germany. They point out that Great Britain, Spain, Poland, Denmark and Italy have all scaled back their renewable energy development so as to not further overburden their consumers and industry.

A recent _Science_ article with the catchy title “Classroom Confusion” is as fine a case of political spin as one can find. The study it reports is actually pretty good, but the report is atrocious. There is an important message here, because the topic is climate change, which is arguably the most political scientific debate in history. This is spin over science.





The study is a modest survey of middle and high school science teachers, about 1500 in all, conducted by the Penn State Survey Research Center. Unlike prior surveys, this one involves a lot of selection of respondents and weighting of responses. The goal is to match the small sample to the actual demographics of American education. It is an elaborate and interesting process but this has nothing to do with the questions asked in the survey, which is where the spin comes in.



They apparently ask two kinds of questions. (Strangely, the survey questions are not provided in the online Supplementary Materials.)





Rather than being settled, the question of how much of global warming is due to human activity, and how much is from other causes is still unanswered.



The first are procedural questions. These have do with such things as whether global warming is included in the curriculum and if so, how much time is taken, how much the debate is discussed, etc. The findings are that global warming is widely discussed, but typically for just a few class sessions. This makes sense because the issue is widely known, but the science curriculum is very crowded.



Then there apparently are a bunch of questions about the teacher. This is a bit murky but the focus seems to be how much the teacher knows about the global warming issues and what they think about them. This is where the spin begins.



The problem is that the authors are proponents of the dogmatic view that there is a ‘consensus’ within science, according to which humans are the dominant cause of (dangerous) global warming. The problem with that synthesis is evident in any graph showing global surface average temperature since 1900, shown above.



There’s clearly a substantial warming early in the 20th Century, roughly from 1910 to 1945. This was largely before the major emissions of carbon dioxide, which commenced with the War, so that’s not likely to be caused by human activity. The second period of warming, from the late 1970s through the late 90s is of similar magnitude and certainly does have some characteristics that would largely (though not completely) associate it with emissions, but it cannot be distinguished in magnitude from the earlier warming (Note the spikes in 1998 and 2015 are caused by strong El Niño events. Because of that, it is not clear that the world has indeed resumed warming at the previous rate.)



The bottom line is—given the caveat about 2015—it would appear that as much warming occurred naturally as could be attributed to human activity.



The authors of the _Science_ paper ignore this. When they found that many teachers do not agree and are teaching that a substantial component of global warming may be natural, they went on a bit of a rhetorical rampage, accusing the teachers of being ignorant and confused.



This grossly unscientific behavior is probably explained by the presence of the National Center for Science Education. NCSE is a political activist organization, not a science shop. They are strident proponents of the dogmatic ‘consensus’ view. It appears that NCSE funded this study, plus providing three of the five co‐​authors. So no wonder it is stridently political.



In short, the title “classroom confusion” is a political statement, not a scientific finding. Much of the article is similarly political. Science should not have published this article, because it is not science. The scientific finding is that the climate debate is alive and well in the classroom, as it is in the nation. This is good news.



Not surprisingly, reports have amplified the article’s error. For example, a _Washington Post_ article on this study begins with the title: “How teachers are getting it wrong on climate change.” The very first sentence then claims that the idea that global warming may be a natural process is an “incorrect idea.” It’s very clear from the data shown above that a substantial portion indeed is _not_ because of carbon dioxide emissions.



Rather than being settled, the question of how much of global warming is due to human activity, and how much is from other causes is still unanswered. Teachers who recognize this are hardly espousing an “incorrect idea.”

"MEXICO CITY  —   President Donald J. Trump’s decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, with Mexico’s president publicly canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing back, accusing Mexico of burdening the United States with illegal immigrants, criminals and a trade deficit. Mr. Trump’s push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall brought to a head months of simmering tensions, culminating in a remarkable    between the two leaders. By afternoon, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said the president would pay for the border wall by imposing a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States, which he said would raise billions of dollars. The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations. Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trump’s vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Peña Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to beef up the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before the meeting between the two presidents. Mr. Trump’s action was enough to prompt Mr. Peña Nieto to start discussing whether to scrap his plans to visit the White House, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and he chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” he said. Then on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump fired back, warning that he might cancel the meeting himself if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall. Just before Mr. Trump fired off his Twitter post, the Mexican foreign minister and Mr. Trump’s Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, were preparing to see each other for a scheduled 11:30 a. m. meeting. According to a senior American official, the secretary had been briefed. The appropriate flags had been arranged by the protocol staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Then, just as American officials greeted the minister outside the department’s headquarters in Northwest Washington, the minister received word from Mexico that he was being pulled back, the official said. The meeting never happened. By early afternoon, Mr. Trump said it was the United States that was being treated unfairly. “We have agreed to cancel our planned meeting,” Mr. Trump said in a new conference Thursday afternoon. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the U. S. fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. We have no choice. ” In Mexico, Mr. Peña Nieto had little political room to maneuver. With Mr. Trump’s order to build the wall, the perceived insults Mexico had endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations  —   on matters involving trade, security and migration  —   seemed to be unraveling. Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a “an offense to Mexico,” a “slap in the face” and a “monument to lies. ” Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a “Soviet Mexico” had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace. “It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,” said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. “In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U. S. now we find ourselves in a   war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced. ”"
"**A pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong has been stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.**
In footage posted online, a man is seen approaching Junius Ho with flowers before reaching into a bag - saying he wants a picture - but instead lunging at Mr Ho with a knife.
Mr Ho, who was wounded, and others then wrestle him to the ground.
The stabbing is the latest in a series of attacks on people on either side of the Hong Kong protests.
In July, pro-democracy protesters accused Mr Ho of helping to organise attacks on civilians in Yuen Long station.
Dozens of masked men dressed in white shirts - suspected to be triad gangsters - assaulted pro-democracy protesters and passers-by.
Afterwards, Mr Ho reportedly said the attackers were ""defending their home and people"", but denied any involvement.
He was also seen shaking hands with the attackers and giving them the thumbs-up.
Mr Ho was campaigning for Hong Kong's elections, being held later this month, when a man in a blue t-shirt and wearing a back-to-front baseball cap approached him.
The man apparently said ""everyone has seen your efforts"", before Mr Ho took the flowers.
The ""supporter"" then said ""let me take my mobile out"" before reaching into his bag and stabbing Mr Ho. He was then wrestled to the ground by a group of people, including Mr Ho.
The lawmaker was then seen being taken into an ambulance. Two other people were also reportedly hurt.
Police said a suspect had been arrested, and that all three victims were conscious.
After the attack, Mr Ho released a statement in which he said ""black forces"" were targeting pro-establishment candidates.
""I will remain courageous and fearless,"" he said.
Hong Kong's protests - which started in June - now flare up every weekend, with clashes between protesters and police getting increasingly violent.
Shops and businesses seen as being pro-Beijing are also regularly attacked.
At the same time, attacks on groups and individuals, often away from the main protests, have also increased.
Last weekend, at least five people were injured in a knife attack at a pro-democracy protest in a shopping mall. A local councillor had his ear partially bitten off while trying to stop the attacker leaving.
Last month, activist Jimmy Sham was attacked by a group of five men with hammers.
The Hong Kong Free Press says at least three other candidates in November's elections have also been attacked in recent weeks.
Mr Ho is a 57-year-old lawyer who became a member of Hong Hong's Legislative Council in 2016.
He attended Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2011. However, the university removed the honour last month after pressure online and from politicians.
""Mr Ho's conduct since he was honoured has caused increasing concern,"" the university said.
In 2017 he was accused of saying protesters should be ""killed"" \- but later said his words had been mistranslated - and was also accused of linking homosexuality to bestiality.
After he was accused of supporting the Yuen Long attacks, his office was attacked and his parents' graves vandalised."
"**China's President Xi Jinping has told embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam that the central government has a ""high degree of confidence"" in her, according to Chinese state media.**
There were reports last week of Beijing planning to replace Ms Lam, after months of anti-government protests that have at times crippled Hong Kong.
But Mr Xi reportedly expressed his full support at a meeting in Shanghai.
The protests began against an extradition bill put forward by Ms Lam.
She championed the proposed law, which would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial.
The bill sparked fears Hong Kong's freedoms were being eroded, and led to widespread protests, including one with a reported turnout of close to two million.
Ms Lam eventually withdrew the bill, but protests have continued, with activists demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform.
China's state news agency Xinhua published pictures of the two leaders shaking hands, and reported that Mr Xi had praised Ms Lam for her efforts to quell clashes in the territory.
""The central government has a high degree of confidence in you,"" he was quoted as saying, adding: ""Stopping the storm and restoring order remains the most important task in Hong Kong.""
The wave of protests continued this past weekend, with riot police spraying tear gas into crowds of demonstrators in Taikoo district, a residential area.
On Sunday, in the same district, a man stabbed four people and bit off part of a pro-democracy local councillor's ear, after a political argument about the protests.
With no end to the demonstrations in sight, China's leaders signalled for the first time last week they were prepared to make changes to the way the mainland administered Hong Kong.
Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on the exact nature of the proposed changes.
Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive - currently Ms Lam - is elected by a 1,200-member election committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body chosen by just 6% of eligible Hong Kong voters.
Once a British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China, and rights mainland Chinese citizens do not enjoy, such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But human rights groups say some of those freedoms are being curtailed, and accuse China of meddling in the territory's affairs, citing legal rulings that have disqualified pro-democracy legislators.
Artists and writers in the territory also say they are under increased pressure to self-censor - and a Financial Times journalist was barred from entering Hong Kong after he hosted an event that featured an independence activist.
The Chinese government said in 2014 it would allow Hong Kong voters to choose their leaders from a list approved by a pro-Beijing committee. But critics called the proposal a ""sham democracy"" and it was voted down in Hong Kong's legislature.
In 28 years' time, in 2047, the Basic Law - which grants Hong Kongers their freedoms - expires, and what happens to the territory's autonomy after that is unclear."

To commemorate Henry David Thoreau’s 200th birthday on July 12, the _New York Times_ last week featured an essay by historian Douglas Brinkley based on a complete misinterpretation of one of Thoreau’s most famous quotes: “In Wildness is the preservation of the world.”



Brinkley equates “wildness” with “wilderness,” thereby connecting Thoreau with today’s environmental movement. While that’s a mistake I myself once made, in fact that is not what Thoreau meant at all.



Thoreau used the phrase in an 1851 lecture called “Walking” that was reprinted by the _Atlantic Monthly_ in 1862. The lecture mentions both _wildness_ and _wilderness_ and it is clear they have two different meanings.





Thoreau understood something about government that today’s environmental leaders have forgotten: government itself is the greatest threat to the wildness, the human individuality, and the freedom that Thoreau cherished and most Americans still cherish today.



Thoreau would agree with today’s environmentalists that _wilderness_ is a state of nature, but he uses _wildness_ to refer instead to a state of humanity. The lecture encourages people to be wild, which he equates with “absolute freedom” as opposed to the limited freedom available in a “culture merely civil.”



Brinkley cites a variety of political and environmental leaders, including Theodore Roosevelt, John Kennedy, John Muir, and David Brower, who were inspired by Thoreau in general and this misinterpretation in particular to support government actions creating national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. Yet it is not clear that Thoreau himself would have supported those actions, and it is absolutely clear that he would have opposed many policies promoted by environmentalists today.



This is important because Thoreau understood something about government that today’s environmental leaders have forgotten: government itself is the greatest threat to the wildness, the human individuality, and the freedom that Thoreau cherished and most Americans still cherish today. In their seemingly desperate efforts to preserve things that are often relatively abundant, today’s environmentalists are willing to sacrifice that individuality and freedom.



The whole idea behind wilderness and national parks is to freeze nature in one particular state. Yet Thoreau’s most important scientific discovery was the theory of ecological succession, the idea that ecosystems are continuously changing. As modern‐​day ecologist Daniel Botkin says, “There is no balance of nature, but we keep acting as if there was.”



Where today’s environmentalists regard wilderness as something separated from people, Thoreau saw people as “a part and parcel of nature,” and he valued nature and wilderness not just as ends in themselves but as ways for people to express their wildness or freedom.



Thoreau would have supported private efforts to preserve natural areas, such as the Trustees for Reservations in Massachusetts or Save the Redwoods League in California. Private property is the basis of capitalism, and unlike today’s environmentalists who are often skeptical of capitalism, Thoreau relished it.



“What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery,” he said. “It does not clasp its hands and pray to Jupiter.” In other words, it is wild, and it is more likely that he would admire wild capitalists such as Richard Branson and Steve Jobs than communitarian environmentalists such as David Brower or current Sierra Club leader Michael Brune.



Thoreau was less likely to have supported programs setting aside government land as wilderness, as he was deeply suspicious of government. “Government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of the way,” he said.



He would have absolutely opposed government regulation of private land, such as the Endangered Species Act or state land‐​use laws, aimed at protecting wildlife, scenery, farm lands, or other supposedly public values. Government regulators, he wrote, “deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.” Thoreau well knew what today’s environmentalists have forgotten: that when you give a government power over others in the name of “the greater good,” that government quickly becomes a dictatorship.



So the next time you read, “In Wildness is the preservation of the world,” don’t substitute the term _wilderness_ for _wildness_. Instead, substitute the word _freedom_ and understand that efforts to restrict freedom in the name of some greater good, whether open space, wildlife, or climate, are the greatest threat to the world.

From the “everything is robust” department.
We’ve long noted at WUWT that the word “robust” has seen a significant rise in usage in climate science papers, becoming a favorite word to use when statistical Spackle has been applied to climate data. Now there’s evidence from a new study suggesting that observation is spot-on.

Researchers at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands say that the frequency of positive-sounding words such as ‘novel’, ‘amazing’, ‘innovative’ and ‘unprecedented’ has increased almost nine-fold in the titles and abstracts of papers published between 1974 and 2014. There has also been a smaller — yet still statistically significant — rise in the frequency of negative words, such as ‘disappointing’ and ‘pessimistic’.

Psychiatrist Christiaan Vinkers and his colleagues searched papers on PubMed for 25 ‘positive’ words and 25 ‘negative’ words (which the authors selected by manually analysing papers and consulting thesaurus listings). The number of papers containing any of the positive words in their title or abstract rose from an average of 2% in 1974–80 to 17.5% in 2014. Use of the 25 negative words rose from 1.3% to 2.4% over the same period, according to the study, published in the British Medical Journal on 14 December1.
Rising hype
The most obvious interpretation of the results is that they reflect an increase in hype and exaggeration, rather than a real improvement in the incidence or quality of discoveries, says Vinkers. The findings “fit our own observations that in order to get published, you need to emphasize what is special and unique about your study,” he says. Researchers may be tempted to make their findings stand out from thousands of others — a tendency that might also explain the more modest rise in usage of negative words.

The word ‘novel’ now appears in more than 7% of PubMed paper titles and abstracts, and the researchers jokingly extrapolate that, on the basis of its past rise, it is set to appear in every paper by the year 2123.
…
But Vinkers and his colleagues think that the trend highlights a problem. “If everything is ‘robust’ and ‘novel’”, says Vinkers, then there is no distinction between the qualities of findings. “In that case, words used to describe scientific results are no longer driven by the content but by marketability.”

A BBC story here says the use of the word “robust” has gone up 15000% They write:
Despite working with facts, figures and empirical evidence, the world of science appears to have a growing addiction to hyperbole. Researchers at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands looked at four decades worth of medical and scientific publications, and found a significant upwards trend of positive words. We’ve all heard of those ”ground-breaking” studies or ”innovative” research projects. Dr Christiaan Vinkers – a psychiatrist at the Rudolf Magnus brain centre – was the main author of another ”very robust” report.
This tool used to analyse words, when selected for academic use, shows that indeed, “robust” is a favorite word of science:

And, this Ngram suggests that at least through 2008, the word “robust” has become vastly more popular in books. It’s almost like a hockey stick of robustness:

Very early on in the climate saga, the alarmist activists settled on a clear strategy. “Post-normal science,” they dubbed it. Despite its moniker, it has bugger-all to do with science. What it is, is **naked political activism**. In their own words, it means sacrificing rigorous truth-telling (you know: science) for “policy influence”.



To that end, they endlessly try to scare the pants off the gullible and uninformed. “Offer up some scary scenarios, make simplified dramatic statements,” as pioneering climate alarmist **Stephen Schneider** put it.



One of their favourite scare stories is that “we’re all gonna drown!” Back in 1988, climate doyen James Hansen was predicting that Manhattan would be flooded under ten feet of water within 40 years. Well, we’re three-quarters of the way there, and New Yorkers haven’t broken out the gumboots yet.



It’s no different in Australia.



In Australia, we mostly live near the sea. All along our coastline there is evidence of sea level fall, yes fall.



Where is the evidence for rising sea levels? 



Will you see how much sea levels have risen when you watch the fireworks over the Opera House in Sydney Harbour this New Year’s Eve — or will you see evidence of sea level fall?



Oh, shush, you! This is climate change we’re talking about! We don’ need no stinkin’ evidence!



The best evidence is that global sea level has fallen by at least 2 metres since the the Holocene high stand about 4,000 BC; that is about 6,000 years ago, a time known as the Minoan warm period.



The evidence in rocks and cliff faces all along the Australian east coast is that sea level was about 1m higher in the Roman warm period (year 0), and about 0.5m higher in the Medieval warm period (1,000 AD).



Conversely, it is believed the sea level was lower in the cold periods of 500 AD (Dark Ages) and the Little Ice Age (1,650 AD), maybe both 0.2 — 0.5 metres below today’s level. This last low sea level is particularly important, because it from this base sea levels are perhaps still rising back to average Holocene levels.



Still, despite the Chicken-Little screeching of the climate alarmists – not to mention the [high-handed judgments of globalist UN enforcers](https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-12-11/un-compact-recognizes-climate-change-driver-migration-first-time) – most of the world is stubbornly refusing to drown. Bangladesh, one-time poster-child of we’re-all-gonna-drown, is actually **gaining** land area. The vast majority of islands are either stable or growing. Well-documented sites around Australia, such as the Fort Denison show no sign of slipping under the waves soon.



Even the [Isle of the Dead](http://www.john-daly.com/deadisle/index.htm), in Tasmania, seems not to be the proof of accelerated rising sea levels that it was claimed to be.



But, ignore all that, children. Who are you going to believe? Your lyin’ eyes, or the globalists demanding more of your money?

"HONG KONG  —   You might call it a Noah’s Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2. 5 million from more than 1, 000 interested donors. Randolph Hencken, the group’s executive director, said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year, pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies. “We have a vision that we’re going to create an industry that provides floating islands to people who are threatened by rising sea levels,” Mr. Hencken said. The group’s original founders included Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and prominent supporter of President Trump, although Mr. Thiel is no longer donating to the institute, Mr. Hencken said. Mr. Hencken said that the project’s pilot islands would cost a total of $10 million to $50 million and house a few dozen people and that the initial residents would most likely be   buyers from the developed world. He added that the institute was seeking to build the islands in what would be a nautical version of a special economic zone and that it would showcase innovations in solar power, sustainable aquaculture and   wind farms. The project’s leaders face many hurdles, such as building   systems for the islands and convincing investors to buy property in such an untested environment. Joe Quirk, a spokesman for the Seasteading Institute, said in a 2014 video that the cost of housing on the artificial islands would initially be on par with real estate in London or New York City. But the project also appears to show how the acceleration of climate change has prompted technology entrepreneurs to devise innovative solutions to   problems like rising sea levels. “The oceans are the most ignored part of the planet, so I’m excited by the possibilities which will emerge when you get some of Silicon Valley’s more adventurous souls focusing on the sustainable use of our coastal and marine areas,” Lelei LeLaulu, a development entrepreneur from Samoa who specializes in the Pacific Islands and advises the International Finance Corporation on sustainable business, said in an email from French Polynesia. But the project has critics in French Polynesia and beyond. Alexandre Le Quéré, a radio host at the station Polynésie 1ère, said this month that the Seasteading Institute’s project reminded him of a plan to build artificial islands off the Indonesian resort island of Bali that has drawn heavy criticism amid concern over its projected environmental effects. “One might think the engineers behind Seasteading have responses to these ecological questions,” Mr. Le Quéré said. “Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop skepticism about this slightly crazy project. ” Mr. Hencken said that he expected the project to eventually include dozens of artificial islands and that similar projects could someday be built in other atoll nations or coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels. He added that the cost of housing would decrease as the   island platforms became cheaper to manufacture. “I certainly don’t think this is a project that is exclusively for the wealthy,” he said, adding that his background was in social justice activism. But experts familiar with climate change and the South Pacific said they doubted the project would be feasible on a wide scale in a region with some of the world’s poorest countries. They also wondered whether the money could be better spent on education or health care. “I wouldn’t write it off entirely I just come to these things with a healthy skepticism,” said Matthew Dornan, the deputy director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra. “There is a tendency for very technologically focused solutions to the challenges in the Pacific without any real input from the Pacific Islanders themselves,” he added. Simon Donner, a geography professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who studies the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands, said that the French Polynesia project looked intriguing and that he had no reason to doubt that its backers were well intentioned. But he said the project reflected a cruel reality: The developed world is both responsible for climate change and better able to cope with it. The French Polynesia project would effectively be a “cruise ship,” Professor Donner said. “Meanwhile, the other actual islands in the Pacific are stuck with the impacts of climate change. ” Mr. Hencken disputed that assessment, saying it was unfair to compare his initiative with traditional aid projects. “We’re not taking French Polynesia’s money,” he said. “We’re investing our own money with the hopes of making a direct and indirect benefit to our host. ” The French Foreign Ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the Seasteading Institute’s plan. Recent climate models predict that the world’s oceans could rise five to six feet by 2100, roughly twice the increase reported as a plausible   scenario by a United Nations panel in 2013. Atoll nations in the Pacific are seen as uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise because they are often   and extremely narrow. One of them, Kiribati, has become an unofficial champion of a movement to call global attention to the threat. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Kiribati’s president at the time, Anote Tong, said he had commissioned experts from the government of the United Arab Emirates to study the feasibility of artificially raising Kiribati’s islands as a climate adaptation strategy. But he declined to provide specifics, and subsequent attempts to reach officials in Kiribati and the United Arab Emirates for details were unsuccessful. Koen Olthuis, an architect in the Netherlands whose projects are entirely   said that interest in amphibious construction among developers and municipalities had surged worldwide in the last four years and that floating projects could potentially have an enormous range of beneficial social uses. An early example, he said, is a floating school he designed recently for Bangladesh, where sea level rise threatens   coastal communities. Mr. Olthuis said that the technical challenges of artificial island construction could be resolved and that he hoped the French Polynesia project would succeed. But it was still an open question, he added, what the ultimate goal or scale of such projects should be. “What do we want to save? How much money do we want to spend on it, and what does it bring for those people?” he said. “With billions, you can save 300, 000 people. But you can also take them away and put them in other countries and use those buildings to help people in slums worldwide. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress, Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution. They even took him to court. “We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress,” Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. “We’ve never been against executive action,” said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. “We’re against overreaching, illegal action. ” Mr. Trump’s eager embrace of the executive order  —   he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor’s lead  —   allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out. Many of his major proposals  —   building a border wall, hiring more border and immigration officers, creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally  —   will presumably require funding by Congress, and that is no certainty in the current political environment. The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks. House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch  —   and winning  —   in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution. The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments, health care providers and others. Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it. It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for  —   using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority. But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time, a fact not lost on Democrats. “Congressional Republicans’ hypocritical acquiescence to President Trump’s executive orders is an abdication of their responsibility to govern, especially in light of their vocal opposition to even the most restrained use of executive authority by President Obama,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. But some Republicans are wary too. Even as they welcome the opportunities opened up by having an ally in the White House, some worry that the continued emphasis on executive actions is just another step in the dilution of legislative power. “We need to go back to being the legislative branch,” said Representative Ileana   a Florida Republican opposed to a potential executive order by Mr. Trump that would end a special program allowing younger illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. “We didn’t like this when Obama was doing it, so why should we accept it now?” Other Republicans were hoping the start of a new administration would allow a reset between the executive branch and a legislative branch that has seen its influence steadily erode as lawmakers surrender power and responsibility to the administrative side. Mr. Trump’s broad assertion of executive power could make any rebalancing difficult to achieve, though lawmakers say they intend to keep pushing. “The imperial presidency was not created overnight and it will not be undone overnight,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who is leading an effort called the Article I Project to try to recapture some lost authority for the House and Senate. Mr. Lee and Ms. Strong of the speaker’s office said a good first step in Congress’s reasserting itself would be enactment of a bill passed by the House this month requiring congressional approval of major new rules being pushed by federal agencies. If it could clear the Senate, Mr. Trump has said he would sign it in what would represent a major victory for congressional Republicans trying to rein in the regulatory power of the executive branch. Still, Mr. Trump’s early focus on pushing his agenda through executive actions underscores a fundamental truth of presidencies. New occupants of the White House tend not to surrender power accumulated by their predecessors. They tend to build on it."
"**A former guerrilla fighter who used to jam the communication network of Ethiopian troops, Debretsion Gebremichael is now leading the fight against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government for control of the northern Tigray region, described as the ""womb"" of the nation.**
Mr Debretsion leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party which controls Tigray, and which has fallen out so dramatically with Mr Abiy.
Now married with a young child, Mr Debretsion cut short his studies at the University of Addis Ababa in the 1970s to join the TPLF in its 17-year war against Marxist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime.
He then went on to be a government minister after the Derg had been defeated and replaced by a coalition of parties dominated by the TPLF until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
His close friend and comrade Alemayehu Gezahegn said that after they had both completed their military training in the rugged and mountainous terrain of Tigray and, noting his comrade's technical skills, he suggested to TPLF commanders that Mr Debretsion should be deployed to the ""technical unit"".
For Mr Alemayehu, this was the logical place for Mr Debretsion, as he was a bright, but reserved, ""city boy"" who grew up in Shire, which, in a major blow to the Tigray leader, is now under the control of federal troops.
Coming from an Orthodox Christian family, the Tigray leader was named Debretsion, which means Mount Zion, while his second name is that of his father, Gebremichael, meaning Servant of Saint Michael.
""When he was in primary school, he used to collect old batteries, radios, electric equipment, and fix them. When no-one had electric power in our town, he made a lightbulb for himself from scraps,"" Mr Alemayehu recalled.
Mr Debretsion excelled in the TPLF's ""technical unit"", playing a vital role in developing intelligence capabilities so that the TPLF could eavesdrop on the conversations of the Ethiopian army and jam their radio communications.
""This helped us to win because TPLF freedom fighters knew about enemy movements in advance, and, being jammed, they could not communicate with each other when they were attacked,"" Mr Alemayehu said.
To further develop his skills, Mr Debretsion travelled to Italy on a false passport and returned to set up the TPLF's first radio station - Dimtsi Weyane, meaning Voice of the Revolution.
Another TPLF guerrilla fighter, Measho Gebrekidan, recalled that they used to go to the mountains at night, when the chances of being spotted by government spies were slim, to install antennas.
""One night, he slipped... and it was me and another comrade who saved his life. I always thought that if this had happened, would this radio have been created?"" Mr Measho said.
Now Dimtsi Weyane is part of a multilingual and multiplatform media group based in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, broadcasting TPLF statements about its military confrontation with the federal government.
The media station has broadcast fierce criticism of Mr Abiy, and as the conflict began its signal was jammed, but Dimtsi Weyane was back on air the next day.
Mr Debretsion and Mr Abiy seemed to be friends at the start of the prime minister's time in office in 2018. The Tigray leader even arranged a rapturous welcome for the prime minister in Mekelle.
""Tigray is a place where the history of our country is cooked, and it's the region where foreign invaders [including Italians and Egyptians] had been defeated and embarrassed. In modern Ethiopia, it is the womb of Ethiopia,"" Mr Abiy said in 2018.
For his part, Mr Debretsion hailed the prime minister's peace initiative with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki to end the ""no war-no peace"" situation that had existed between the two countries since the end of their 1998-2000 border conflict.
""[Mr Abiy] travelled to Eritrea and met Isaias. This was impossible for many years. It's a big deal because it is going to give a massive opportunity for the country,"" Mr Debretsion said when the deal was agreed.
But this display of comradeship appears to have masked the tensions that were brewing between the two men.
Mr Debretsion had ambitions to be prime minister himself and lost out to Mr Abiy in the 2018 contest within the ruling coalition.
**You may also be interested in:**
""I told him: 'You are immature. You are not the right candidate',"" Mr Debretsion told the UK-based Financial Times newspaper in 2019.
But his defeat did not come as a surprise, as the TPLF had become synonymous with repression and corruption during its 27 years as the dominant country's dominant political force.
Views about Mr Debretsion's performance when he was working in government are mixed.
His critics say that when he was the deputy head of the intelligence bureau in the 1990s, he was instrumental in spying on opposition figures, and helping to crush dissent.
But his supporters focus on the fact that he transformed Ethiopia's telecommunications infrastructure when elevated to the cabinet, where he served as deputy prime minister and as minister of communications and information technology.
He launched massive projects to expand mobile phone coverage across Ethiopia, though the state kept a monopoly over the industry, and the telecom company has been criticised for internet shutdowns aimed at curbing anti-government protests.
""Most of the power and telecom infrastructure projects were led by him,"" US-based public policy expert Dade Desta said.
""The IT Park that is now in Addis Ababa was his idea [and] his fingerprints can be found in many state-owned projects.""
This includes the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is now at the centre of diplomatic tensions with US President Donald Trump warning that Egypt might ""blow it up"".
The TPLF and the prime minister parted ways when Mr Abiy dissolved the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling coalition of ethnically based parties, to launch the Prosperity Party in 2019, arguing this would help unite the country.
The TPLF refused to join, arguing that Ethiopia's federal nature was a better way to manage the country's deep ethnic divides.
Mr Debretsion returned to Tigray where he was seen as a reformist. He allowed four new political parties to contest the regional election held in September in defiance of the federal government.
""My door is open to everyone,"" he often said.
""We want development; not war,"" was another common statement of Mr Debretsion.
But now, he finds himself at the centre of a conflict that is reported to have killed hundreds of people, forced more than 30,000 people to flee to neighbouring Sudan, and damaged crucial infrastructure - including roads and buildings - in a region with the highest levels of poverty in Ethiopia, according to the UN.
""Mr Debretsion counts this war as a curse,"" Mr Dade said.
But, he added, he expected the TPLF to strongly resist attempts by Mr Abiy to establish a new administration in Tigray.
""They [the TPLF] were in the war with Eritrea, and the struggle against the Derg. So they have enough experience. By its nature, war needs the will of the people to fight, which there is in Tigray,"" Mr Dade said, raising the prospect of a long conflict.
However, Mr Abiy is also confident that he can defeat the TPLF and bring Mr Debretsion, who is facing charges of treason and rebelling against the constitution, to justice.

We all know there are some very unintelligent people roaming this earth. I mean we have a Labour-led coalition for goodness sake so that’s proof positive that there is at least a discernible lack of joined-up thinking going on amongst a large portion of the people we share our space with.



We have people who thought Winston might be a good handbrake to National’s fourth term excesses, and drongoes like has-been actress Rose McGowan who [apologised ](https://pluralist.com/rose-mcgowan-apologizes-iran/)to Iran on behalf of Americans because their Orange Man was so mean to them blowing up their most revered, lovable and most successful General.



But I think they all pale into insignificance when compared with the _‘high number’_ of dimwits who called Auckland emergency services on 111 to let them know that the sky was a bit yellow!



There were so many of these retards that Police had to issue a statement asking people not to call them and to keep the line clear for emergencies only. 



I wonder what sort of response they were expecting? You can imagine how those calls go? 



_Triple One Emergency, do you require Police, Fire or Ambulance?_



Umm, I’m not sure, I just wanted to tell you that the sky looks a bit weird. 



_Ok, ahh, what emergency service do you require?_



Umm, I don’t know what you mean, you need to do something. 



_‘What exactly do you want us to do?_



Umm, I don’t know, I just, Umm, I just thought that you should, you-know, know that the sky is kind of orange. It’s like, I dunno, is it because Trump killed Iran?



So this got me thinking. The people ringing emergency services for this kind of rubbish are probably mostly of voting age. These nincompoops get to have a say in deciding who runs our country. How many votes really should have been discounted and removed from the tally last election due to the voter not being of sufficient intelligence to make an informed choice? How many votes were cast for made-up candidates like Batman, Mickey Mouse or Jesus? 



Surely everyone who shows disdain for the voting process by frivolously wasting their precious vote should be identified and banned from exercising this most important of duties until they can show they are grown up enough to take their role seriously. 



I think a compulsory **“I’m too stupid to vote”** filter should also be required to be added to their Facebook and Twitter pages.



The left of course, think that we should lower the voting age to sixteen! This is utter madness. Hell, I was playing Cards Against Humanity with a 15-year-old this week and she was so immature, she couldn’t even force herself to say the word ‘penis’ out loud, so quite how she was going to be able to digest the intricacies of figuring out who deserves her vote at the next election I have no idea. 



And she is an intelligent kid. I am certain that she is about one thousand times more intelligent than all of these 111 calling numpties put together.



So please, don’t waste your vote this year. And if you look out the window just now and see that the sky is a different colour to last week and think that the good folk at the other end of the 111 line should really hear about it, just go to your bedroom, pop your head under the duvet, and come out again in a few days as everything will be ok and back to normal by then.



Oh, and it’s not caused by bloody climate change, it’s caused by rampant ideological Green fascists who value the lives of gnats over humans. Well, I mean that and arsonists.



Just remember, according to [IQtestforfree.net](https://www.iqtestforfree.net/average-IQ-by-country.html) the average IQ in New Zealand is 98. And half of our population is dumber than that!

"**Ethiopia's human rights commission has said it will send a team to investigate reports of mass killings of civilians in the northern Tigray state.**
The commission, appointed by the government but independent, said it was aware of reports of ""ethnic profiling"" being undertaken in the area.
PM Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement.
The UN human rights chief warned the killings could amount to war crimes.
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera), a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
There have been long-standing tensions between Ethiopia's government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state.
Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military operation against the TPLF earlier this month after he accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops - claims the TPLF also deny. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
The human rights group Amnesty International, said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"" on 9 November.
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
Witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"", Amnesty said.
Getting independently verified information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing the TPLF went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra.
Some witnesses also said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible."

Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski reports at Spiegel on the claim that climate change is the big factor behind the Syria conflict: Syria: scientists dispute climate change as cause of war.
A number of activists and some climate scientists have claimed or suggested that the war in Syria was due to the 2006-2010 drought (caused by man-made climate change, of course).
Fortunately many experts have come out called this claim a rather wild stretch of the imagination. And now even German warmist scientists have come out and dismissed the claim as well, citing a lack of evidence and an array of other factors at play.
The German Climate Consortium (DKK) issued a press release on the subject two weeks ago. According to this press release, Dr. Paul Becker, Vice President of the DWD German Weather Service, reminds that climate change itself is only one of many factors involved in migration and conflict, and that the issue is very complex and needs to be researched more.
Moreover, according to peace researcher Dr. Christiane Fröhlich, results of a survey of Syrian farmers and workers who were hard hit by the 2006-2010 drought showed:

The often claimed causality between drought, migration and conflict outbreak is not tenable. Though the migration of people rose domestically during the drought, neither was the drought the single conflict initiator nor was it ‘climate migrants’ who sparked the protests.”
The press release adds that the conflict was in fact mostly due to bad policies by the Assad regime. Bojanowski adds:
When it comes to who to blame for hunger, the climate argument enables politicians to find guilty parties outside of their countries when in fact they themselves are responsible because of their mismanagement.”
On whether climate change is having an impact on droughts worldwide, The press release adds (emphasis added):
The impact of climate change on the developments with respect to the dangers of drought, according to Paul Pecker, is not statistically significantly verifiable due to the high range of variation in precipitation.”
This is yet another surprisingly reasonable statement coming from a German scientist who has been known to be excessively warmist.
We hope Dr. Becker will also acknowledge the fact that the Sahara region has in fact been greening over the past couple of decades and so climate change is not all bad. In fact history shows that a warmer planet is far more agreeable to life than a cooler one.

It is difficult to debate with those who will not communicate. The climate change examination is no longer about the issue but about the crushing of alternative views. We are all guilty of that from time to time. The first sign of desperation is not being able to withstand the scrutiny of your stance. 



There are only two camps: Alarmists or deniers. This very narrative highlights the pettiness that has dominated this debate. It is much easier to mark those with alternative views with derogatory labels rather than respecting their views but agreeing to differ. 



Whilst my views on man-made climate change are very clear, I’m yet to be convinced that “man” is responsible for the warming or whether “man” can successfully intervene if the planet is warming. There is one very glaring factor that supports my reasoning and that is the calibre of those who refuse to consider opposing views. 



The whole climate change debate is politically motivated right back to Al Gore’s rant and subsequently promoted by the UN, our own COLs and almost all left-leaning political movements. My question is: If the climate change activists are so convinced they are right, why are they so opposed to alternative views been aired? 



We have the absurdity of _**Stuff**_ [refusing to publish](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/stuff-disgracefully-implies-that-disagreement-equals-mental-illness/) any alternative discussion so their way of promoting their “truth” is through **censorship**. We have the UN and our COLs actively [indoctrinating children](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/state-organised-bullying-of-kids/) to promote only one side of the debate. These children are shielded from any information that contradicts the view of the State. In any democracy, this should not be tolerated. 



We have the absurdity of a [Minister for Climate Change](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/minister-only-listens-to-advice-when-it-suits-him/), who leads a Party, which was rejected by 94% of the electorate, issuing “educational” tools into state schools promoting only one side of the issue. This is called a dictatorship. The manipulation of children into representing your advocacy is psychological abuse.



The further you delve into the calibre of those at the coal face of the debate the less credible their argument becomes. They don’t know the truth, nor do I. Almost every prediction of doom has [not materialised](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fails-summary/); therefore may I suggest that the science is rather more restless than settled. 



It is the height of arrogance to suggest the end is nigh, but stupid people can’t separate arrogance from fact. Even the community of [scientists is undecided](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/500-scientists-tell-un-there-is-no-climate-emergency/) on this issue.  
I know Nature is considerably more qualified in managing our climate so I will let her take care of me. The only disappointment I have is that I won’t be around in a hundred years to tell them “I told you so”. But then again, all these activists will be dead also: Which proves that in climate, every cloud has a silver lining.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that mis-guided government policies on global warming were going to cause a crisis in food.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that subsidising ethanol, taxing carbon fuels and covering grasslands and farms with trees would cause massive dislocation of rural industries and shortages and runaway prices for food.

“The ethanol swindle has sucked in many people, but the costs will far exceed the benefits. Demand for ethanol feedstock has already caused massive increases in prices for corn in USA and similar things will happen with sorghum and sugar in Australia. If the current foolish policies persist, these problems will also infect the soy industry, palm oils and other grains.
“Australian taxpayers will subsidise a huge ethanol plant being built at Dalby which will gobble 500 tonnes of grains per day – that is a lot of chook feed.
“Rising prices for grains, sugar and soy will feed through into higher prices for all food produced in farms, feedlots and factories. Beef, lamb, dairy products, chicken, eggs, breakfast cereals, bread and confectionery will all become more expensive, to the detriment of every consumer. The biofuels mania has caused price increases for pasta in Italy, cornflakes in Kansas, tortillas in Mexico and croissants in Paris.
“According to a recent EU report: ‘The current push to expand the use of biofuels is creating unsustainable tensions that will disrupt markets without generating significant environmental benefits’.
“Ethanol contains less energy than is used to produce it. Making alcohol from corn is a good way to make whiskey, but a terrible way to make motor spirit.
“Moreover, to produce one litre of ethanol uses 4 litres of water, so ethanol plants will cause increases in the prices of both food and water.
“Naturally there are vocal beneficiaries of the ethanol boom, but the net cost to the whole community will be negative – it will always be cheaper to produce motor fuel from oil or coal than to use fossil fuels to produce organic fuels via ethanol.
“We should plant our seed corn, not turn it into motor fuel. Burning food for fuel is a very fuelish policy. What do we do as an encore? Pay subsidies to oil companies to produce pizzas from petroleum?
“Even more foolish than subsidising ethanol is the process whereby people are encouraged to evade carbon taxes by planting trees.
“These force fed forests will result in a creeping infestation of woody weeds into land currently producing grass, pastures and crops.
“If some extremists had their way, Australia would become a monoculture of unproductive eucalypts, which are rightly regarded as invasive weeds in other countries. And the rules for carbon credits will probably dictate that they stay there forever, becoming a haven for feral pests and weeds and a magnet for bushfires.
“There is a place for trees in any productive landscape, and previous stupid government policies caused excessive clearing of trees on government controlled leasehold land. But banning all land clearing and subsidising tree planting is just as stupid.
“Farm forestry or wildlife refuges should be allowed to flourish on a fair basis alongside all other land businesses – none should receive discriminatory tax breaks. Well managed grasslands can extract just as much carbon from the air as will tree plantations (unless the trees are harvested and turned into timber houses).
“The final stupid food policy will be carbon taxes, which will push up the already high costs for fuel and power for every farming operation. Soaring prices for diesel, petrol and electricity will escalate the cost of operating tractors, harvesters, trucks, dozers, road trains, water pumps, feedlots, food processing plants and supermarkets. The end result will be seen at every checkout.
“The world has always depended for most of its food on great grasslands of Australia, the savannas of South America, the prairies of North America and the farmlands on the European plain. And the key food resource is the native and domesticated cereals and grasses and the grazing animals that live in harmony with them. Turning these ancient grasslands into forests will have far reaching and costly consequences.
“All of this is justified to calm a world hysteria about the modern era of global warming which started long before man started burning fossil fuels and will continue to rise or fall irrespective of what puny vote-seeking politicians do.
“Despite the recent Ignobel awards to Al Gore, more and more independent scientists are concluding that the facts and the evidence do not support the hysterical claims that the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by mankind will cause runaway warming.
“A Judge in Britain got it right recently when he called Gore’s film a biased political document with eleven specific claims not supported by any evidence.
“Politicians are about to inflict huge Greenhouse costs on the whole community, for nothing.”

"**Thousands of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia's conflict-hit northern region of Tigray have run out of food, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, has said.**
It appealed for urgent access to the region to provide emergency assistance.
Communications and aid access have been blocked since the conflict between the federal army and fighters loyal to Tigray leadership began a month ago.
Nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees are in Tigray. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service.
A lot of focus has been on the tens of thousands who have fled to Sudan from Tigray during the fighting, but there is also concern about these Eritreans.
The UNHCR also said it was ""alarmed"" at unconfirmed reports of attacks and abductions and at the refugee camps.
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced on Sunday that the military offensive in Tigray had ended after federal forces took control of Tigray's capital, Mekelle.
But Debretsion Gebremichael, who leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said fighting still continues and his forces have made some gains.
Concerns about the state of the Eritrean refugees are growing by the hour, the UNHCR said in a briefing in Geneva.
""The camps will have now run out of food supplies - making hunger and malnutrition a real danger, a warning we have been issuing since the conflict began nearly a month ago.
""Our extreme worry is that we hear about attacks, the fighting near the camps, we hear about abductions and forced removals, so this is very important for us to have that access to go and see what has happened over there,"" its spokesman Babar Baloch told journalists.
The UNHCR also called for the protection of all civilians.
Mr Abiy told parliament on Monday that not a single civilian had been killed since the government launched its offensive in early November.
The government has also said it would open up a humanitarian corridor."
"Even if President Trump’s      fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore, there’s a good chance that it will appear, at first, to be a success. But this is a dangerous illusion, the result of companies responding strategically to the new president’s threats. And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions. That’s why it’s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years. Some simple economics can help. Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter to name and shame manufacturing firms planning to relocate some of their production lines overseas. His attacks on Carrier, on Toyota, on General Motors have made their chief executives squirm and, in some cases, have produced what appear to be results. Carrier, for instance, has promised to keep some of the jobs it had planned to send offshore in the United States. Other companies have recycled old announcements of their domestic expansion plans. At first glance, pressuring a handful of companies seems unlikely to have much impact in an economy as large as that of the United States. Imagine that you are a chief executive of a company that has not been a Trump target there are so many companies in the country that the risk of yours being denounced by the president is tiny. At least that’s what the math shows. But the psychological reality is very different. Research has shown that people often overreact to insignificant risks, especially when the risks are so vivid. Just as it is almost certain that you won’t get eaten by a shark this summer, it is a near certainty that the vast majority of companies won’t end up in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs. Yet the fears persist, and people take greater precautionary measures than the actual threat warrants. Moreover, Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously: their personal reputation. Which makes them edgy. So far, the evidence bears this out. There are plenty of anecdotes suggesting that Mr. Trump has executives running scared. Some are hiring communications and crisis managers. Few have been willing to announce the sort of plant closings that might put them in the harsh glare of the president’s spotlight. But this doesn’t mean that Mr. Trump’s tweets have saved jobs. At least not in a lasting sense. To see why not, put yourself in the shoes of a C. E. O. You’re not just deciding whether to send production offshore you also need to decide when to act. This gives you a relatively cheap way to avoid the president’s ire: Mothball your blueprints for the new overseas factory, but don’t burn them. When the political threat passes  —   and, eventually, it will  —   just dust them off and move. If enough companies follow this script over the next couple of years, the number of factory jobs in the United States should stabilize, or even rise. Mr. Trump’s eventual successor may well inherit a manufacturing sector that is superficially stronger, though it will hide an underlying weakness: thousands of C. E. O.s ready to move production offshore. As soon as Mr. Trump leaves the stage, several years worth of   demand for offshoring may erupt, and as these plans are followed and factory jobs return to more normal levels, expect a sharp drop in manufacturing employment. Now imagine what all this will look like to a future policy wonk. Manufacturing jobs seemed to be scarce before Mr. Trump’s tenure, improved while he was at the helm, and then shrank sharply as soon as he left office. It might seem as though his angry tweets actually caused manufacturing to thrive. But it would be a mistake to infer that businesses really perform better when threatened. Rather, the fluctuating jobs numbers reflect the ease with which cuts can be delayed, not prevented. Sure, a delay is, in itself, good news for factory workers who keep their jobs a little longer, but it doesn’t address their   problems. Indeed, many economists, both Democrat and Republican, fear that Mr. Trump’s policy of naming and shaming will hurt the manufacturing sector in the long run. After all, the point of the exercise is to allocate workers and machines based on presidential diktat, not market forces. He is pushing corporate leaders to please the White House, rather than their customers and shareholders. The cost of hiring crisis managers to deal with Mr. Trump raises the cost of doing business just as surely as a tax hike would. By making it more expensive to leave the market, he also creates a disincentive for foreign companies thinking of building plants in the United States. The difficulty with trying to use the bully pulpit to create a lasting change in corporate behavior is that words  —   even a president’s  —   don’t much alter a company’s bottom line. Corporate decisions are driven by the balance of costs and benefits, and the benefits of offshoring are typically large and enduring. Still, for short periods, even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay, not fundamental change. For example, imagine two people who love Cancún and have decided to vacation there if the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway, because the cost isn’t enough to deter them. But if the airfare rises by $100 on Sunday, the day they had planned to go, but was to remain at the original price on Monday, the travelers may well decide to wait a day. So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend, when it’s more expensive, yet there will be no   impact on travel. Temporary policies often look as though they have disproportionately large effects, but they aren’t meaningful. That is the odd truth here: Mr. Trump’s approach may appear to have had a big effect precisely because it’s not viewed as a permanent solution. In fact, the more temporary his   industrial policy is thought to be, the more likely it is that chief executives will delay job cuts until the climate changes. Perhaps corporate bosses are currently pliant because they expect that this storm will pass. But bad economics can be good politics. We may see some spectacular   effects, even if Mr. Trump undermines the   competitiveness of America’s factories. The political upside will be obvious in the monthly employment numbers, while the economic downside will be difficult to disentangle from the   trend of declining factory jobs. Yet we shouldn’t be deluded. C. E. O.s will ultimately move jobs abroad if that’s what it takes to churn out profits."

Green Folly closed forest tracks and gates, expelled foresters and timber-workers and prevented property owners from removing flammable fuel from their own land and adjacent roads, parks and forests. Those responsible for these follies should face Class Action.



Green Folly promotes electric vehicles but not one fire truck, dozer, water bomber, helicopter, ambulance or naval vessel ran on batteries. They all used hydro-carbon fuels – diesel, petrol or avgas. And with so many power lines down, electric toys could not have recharged their batteries anyway.



Green Folly believed that widely scattered wind turbines, solar panels and their spider-webs of transmission lines would continue to produce power in gale-force firestorms and thick smoke. Many will be burnt. Blackouts are inevitable.



Green Folly promotes “green” building materials like timber which adds fuel to fires while using fake CO2 scares to denigrate steel and concrete which won’t burn.



For decades, Green Folly opposed every new dam proposal and wasted stored water on another Green Folly – “Environmental Flows”. Dams were emptied, farmers suffered, towns ran out of water, food prices increased and some fire-fighting water bombers had to take water from private dams.



It was criminal Green Folly that babbled on about “the Climate Emergency” while they sponsored forest conditions that caused agonizing deaths for so many innocents – residents, firefighters, live-stock, koalas and other native animals, birds and insects.



Australia cannot afford any more Green Follies.



Politicians must stop sacrificing Australians on the Green altar.

Our comment primarily concerns the Department of Energy’s (DOE) use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the cost/​benefit analysis of the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Pumps proposed rulemaking. The DOE’s determination of the SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide—two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions. It is also at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses. It is based upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which have little utility because of their great uncertainties. They provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) (whose results were incorporated by the DOE in this action), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnection between climate changes and the SCC value. Further, we show that the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) is not supported by the mainstream climate science.



Until this entire situation can be properly rectified, the SCC should be barred from use in this and all other federal rulemaking. It is better not to include any value for the SCC in cost/​benefit analyses such as these, than to include a value which is knowingly improper, inaccurate and misleading.

"WASHINGTON  —   Just days after President Trump spoke of a “running war’’ with the media, his chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been “humiliated” by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as “the opposition party” of the current administration. “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,” Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday. “I want you to quote this,” Mr. Bannon added. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. ” The scathing assessment  —   delivered by one of Mr. Trump’s most trusted and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency  —   comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration, with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump’s inaugural crowd and the president’s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him. Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News, the provocative   website he ran until August, was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend, when the president said he was in “a running war” with the media and called journalists “among the most dishonest people on earth. ” Mr. Bannon’s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign. Among Mr. Trump’s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office  —   from the description of “American carnage” he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements, immigration and the building of a border wall. Mr. Bannon is one of the strongest forces in an administration with competing power centers. A savvy manipulator of the press, and a proud provocateur, he was among the few advisers in Mr. Trump’s circle who were said to have urged Sean Spicer, the new press secretary, to give a confrontational, emotional statement to a shocked West Wing briefing room on Saturday, when the White House disputed news reports about the size of the inauguration crowd. He shares Mr. Trump’s view that the news media misunderstood the movement that the president rode into office. Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon delivered a broad indictment of the news media as being biased against Mr. Trump and out of touch with the American public. That is an argument familiar to readers of Breitbart and followers of personalities friendly to Mr. Trump, like Sean Hannity of Fox News. “The elite media got it dead wrong, 100 percent dead wrong,” Mr. Bannon said of the election, calling it “a humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there. ” “The mainstream media has not fired or terminated anyone associated with following our campaign,” Mr. Bannon said. “Look at the Twitter feeds of those people: They were outright activists of the Clinton campaign. ” (He did not name specific reporters or editors.) “That’s why you have no power,” he added. “You were humiliated. ” Mr. Bannon spoke in blunt but calm tones, peppered with profanity, and humorously referred to himself as “Darth Vader. ” He said, with ironic relish, that Mr. Trump was elected by a surge of support from “the   hobbits and deplorables. ” The conversation was initiated by Mr. Bannon to offer praise for Mr. Spicer, who has been criticized this week for making false claims at the White House podium about attendance at Mr. Trump’s inaugural, for calling reporters dishonest and lecturing them about what stories to write, and for failing to disavow Mr. Trump’s lie about widespread voter fraud in the election. Asked if he was concerned that Mr. Spicer had lost credibility with the news media, Mr. Bannon chortled. “Are you kidding me?” he said. “We think that’s a badge of honor. ‘Questioning his integrity’  —   are you kidding me? The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work. ” “You’re the opposition party,” he said. “Not the Democratic Party. You’re the opposition party. The media’s the opposition party. ” Journalists reacted with alarm and defiance to Mr. Bannon’s comments. “What country are we living in?” Christiane Amanpour, the CNN correspondent, wrote on Twitter. “We are not the opposition,’’ Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of the nonprofit news organization ProPublica, wrote in an email. “We are part of an essential function in any democracy. ” He added that ProPublica had no intention of “shutting up in response to this or any other president’s demand. ” “We are here to tell the truth and we intend to continue doing so, regardless of how badly some might want us to parrot ‘alternative facts,’” Mr. Engelberg said. Mr. Bannon mostly referred to the “elite” or “mainstream” media, but he cited The New York Times and The Washington Post by name. “The paper of record for our beloved republic, The New York Times, should be absolutely ashamed and humiliated,” Mr. Bannon said. “They got it 100 percent wrong. ” He added that he has been a reader of The Times for most of his adult life."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor going on 3 decades now, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have estimated that the climate’s sensitivity to the doubling of preindustrial levels of CO2 (from 280 ppm to 560 ppm) may range between 1.5°C to 4.5°C due significantly to the assumed “dangerous” warming amplification from positive water vapor feedback.  Despite years of analysis, the factor-of-three difference between the lower and higher surface temperature range thresholds has changed little.  There apparently have been no breakthroughs in understanding the “basic physics” of water vapor amplification to narrow this range further.
The theoretical conceptualization for the surface temperature change resulting from CO2 doubling alone — without the “dangerous” amplification from  water vapor feedback — has also been in use, and unchanged, for decades.  Since the 1960s it has been hypothesized that if preindustrial CO2 levels were to be doubled to 560 ppm, the surface temperature change would amount to a warming of a non-alarming 1.2°C in the absence of other feedbacks.
Below are brief summaries from scientific papers (and the Skeptical Science blog) confirming that the IPCC and models claim doubling CO2 only results in 1.2°C of warming.
IPCC (2001) :
“[T]he radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concentration would be 4 Wm-2. To counteract this imbalance, the temperature of the surface-troposphere system would have to increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of ±10%), in the absence of other changes”
Skeptical Science :
“We know that if the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth’s atmosphere doubles from the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million  by volume (ppmv) to 560 ppmv, this will cause an energy imbalance by trapping more outgoing thermal radiation in the atmosphere, enough to directly warm the surface approximately 1.2°C.”
Gebhart, 1967 :
“The temperature change at the earth’s surface is ΔT=+1.2°C when the present [CO2] concentration is doubled.”
Hansen et al., 1981 :
“The increase of equilibrium surface temperature for doubled atmospheric CO2 is ∼1.2°C.  This case is of special interest because it is the purely radiative-convective result, with no feedback effects.”
Lorius et al., 1990 :
“The radiative forcing resulting from doubled atmospheric CO2 would increase the surface and tropospheric temperature by  1.2°C if there were no feedbacks in the climate system.”
Torn and Harte, 2006 :
“An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration from 275 to 550 ppm is expected to increase radiative forcing by about 4 W m2, which would lead to a direct warming of 1.2°C in the absence of feedbacks or other responses of the climate system”
 
IPCC: Dangerous future warming levels (3°C and up) are caused mostly by water vapor, not CO2
As mentioned, the IPCC authors have claimed that it is primarily due to the conceptualization of positive feedback with water vapor that the surface temperature response is projected  to reach the dangerous warming levels of 3.0°C and up as CO2 doubles to 560 ppm.
IPCC (2001) :
“The so-called water vapour feedback, caused by an increase in atmospheric water vapour due to a temperature increase, is the most important feedback responsible for the amplification of the temperature increase [from CO2 alone].”
In their 4th report, the IPCC acknowledged that humans have little influence in determining water vapor levels:
IPCC (2007) :
“Water vapour is the most abundant and important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. However, human activities have only a small direct influence on the amount of atmospheric water vapour.”
The main reason why IPCC authors have asserted that water vapor will do most of the “dangerous” projected warming, while CO2 will contribute a much smaller fraction, is apparently because the greenhouse warming effect from water vapor forcing is “two to three times greater” than that of carbon dioxide:
IPCC (2013) :
“Water vapour is the primary greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere. The contribution of water vapour to the natural greenhouse effect relative to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) depends on the accounting method, but can be considered to be approximately two to three times greater.”

Even NASA agrees that water vapor and clouds together account for 75% of the greenhouse effect, while CO2 only accounts for 20%.
NASA  :
“Carbon dioxide causes about 20 percent of Earth’s greenhouse effect; water vapor accounts for about 50 percent; and clouds account for 25 percent. The rest is caused by small particles (aerosols) and minor greenhouse gases like methane.”
 
IPCC: Positive water vapor feedbacks are believed to cause dangerous warming
It is curious to note that the insufficiently understood positive water vapor feedback conceptualization is rooted in . . . belief.  Literally.   In the third report (TAR), the IPCC authors actually used the word “believed” to denote how they reached the conclusion that 1.2°C will somehow morph into 1.5°C to 4.5°C of warming due to amplification from feedbacks.
IPCC (2001) :
“If the amount of carbon dioxide were doubled instantaneously, with everything else remaining the same, the outgoing infrared radiation would be reduced by about 4 Wm-2. In other words, the radiative forcing corresponding to a doubling of the CO2 concentration would be 4 Wm-2. To counteract this imbalance, the temperature of the surface-troposphere system would have to increase by 1.2°C (with an accuracy of ±10%), in the absence of other changes. In reality, due to feedbacks, the response of the climate system is much more complex. It is believed that the overall effect of the feedbacks amplifies the temperature increase to 1.5 to 4.5°C. A significant part of this uncertainty range arises from our limited knowledge of clouds and their interactions with radiation.”
IPCC climate sensitivity estimates have been based on hypotheticals, or the belief that water vapor positive feedback will cause another 1.8°C to 3.3°C of “extra” or “dangerous” warming (to reach upwards of 3.0°C to 4.5°C).  CO2 alone only causes 1.2°C of warming as it is doubled from 280 ppm to 560 ppm.  Since when are modeled beliefs about what may possibly happen to global temperatures at some point in the next 100 years . . . science?
IPCC: Water vapor increased substantially since 1970 — but didn’t cause warming
If water vapor is the primary determinant of the “extra” and “dangerous” warming we are expected to get along with the modest 1.2°C temperature increase as the CO2 concentration reaches 560 ppm, then it is natural to ask: How much of the warming since 1950 has been caused by the additional CO2, and how much has been caused by the water vapor feedback that is believed to cause the extra, “dangerous” warming?
This last question arises because, according to the IPCC, there has been a substantial increase in the potent water vapor greenhouse gas concentration in the last few decades.  Specifically, in their 4th report, the IPCC authors claim there has been “an overall increase in water vapour of order 5% over the 20th century and about 4% since 1970“(IPCC [2007]).
Considering its abundance in the atmosphere (~40,000 ppm in the tropics), if water vapor increased by 4% since 1970, that means that water vapor concentrations could potentially have increased by more than 1,500 ppm in the last few decades.  The overall magnitude of this water vapor concentration increase is therefore more than 20 times greater than the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (~70 ppm) since 1970.
But even though the IPCC claims that (a) water vapor will cause most of the “dangerous” warming in the future, (b) water vapor climate forcing is “two to three” times greater than CO2 forcing within the greenhouse effect, and (c) water vapor concentrations have increased substantially since 1970, the IPCC simultaneously claims that (d) CO2 has caused most — if not all — of the warming since the mid-20th century anyway.   In the 5th report, the IPCC’s “consensus” statement reads like this:
IPCC (2013, 2014) :
“It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together.”
For advocates of dangerous anthropogenic global warming (DAGW) projections, the “more than half” CO2 attribution apparently isn’t quantitatively strong enough.  After all, “more than half” could be interpreted as only slightly more than 50%.   To rectify this, Gavin Schmidt  — a primary overseer of NASA temperature adjustments — has calculated that the anthropogenic impact on climate has not  just been “more than half,” but more than 100%.   In a recent RealClimate blog entry, Schmidt  claims that humans have caused 110% of the global warming since 1950 — and that IPCC analysis (found in Fig. 10.5 in IPCC AR5) also supports an anthropogenic CO2 attribution of  “near 100%”.
Real Climate :
“The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar [in Fig. 10.5] (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
 
Conflicting IPCC climate sensitivity feedback suppositions
The IPCC believes that the climate’s overall surface temperature sensitivity to the doubling of preindustrial CO2 ranges between 1.5°C to 4.5°C, with the projected higher warming levels due primarily to amplifying water vapor feedback.  This conceptualization appears to be in conflict with other IPCC suppositions.
On one hand, the IPCC reports have claimed that (a) water vapor is much more potent than CO2 within the greenhouse effect, that (b) the bulk of the 3.0°C and up “dangerous” warming that is believed to occur in the future will be forced by positive water vapor feedback, and that (c) water vapor  levels have significantly increased in recent decades (by 4% since 1970).
On the other hand, (d) water vapor is claimed to have caused right around 0% of the warming in the last several decades.
Summarily, these conflicting explanations or suppositions about what can happen, what will happen, and what has already happened to the climate due to water vapor feedback beg the questions:
Why hasn’t the “dangerous” water vapor warming found in models “kicked in” during the last several decades, when water vapor levels have increased (according to the IPCC)?  
Since it reportedly hasn’t yet, at what point in the future will the “dangerous” water vapor warming projections found in modeling finally show up in the temperature record?
Considering how fundamental climate sensitivity estimates are to climate science, and ultimately to the direction of political policies and energy production and consumption, these questions deserve to be answered . . . with something more substantive than what the IPCC authors have long believed to be true.

Dear Simon,



Many have been saying that there is [no pathway to power for National](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/election-today-would-result-in-a-col-landslide/) at the next election.



I disagree. Here is the track clearly laid out for you to follow.



First read President Trump’s Davos speech. Second, plagiarise the heck out of it for your own use.



Mock the doomsters and show Miss Ardern what real positivity looks like.



Third, explain how under your leadership New Zealand will ride the tsunami of growth, innovation and wealth creation triggered by the growth in the world’s biggest economy.



Next, fix the NZ/US relationship as this is presently an empty space that Miss Ardern has left for you to fill (and for an innovation bonus dividend, as well as claiming the moral high ground, address the [NZ/Israel relationship](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/it-seems-that-for-the-nz-government-jews-are-not-us-israel-snubbed-for-holocaust-remembrance-day/) tool).



Then, having gotten us all excited, lay out real plans to address the housing imbalance, (clue: address supply and population growth). Address the reason why so many are in low wage jobs or are jobless (clue: it’s in social structure and parental control of education). 



Finally, stop wasting money on the impossible demands of the climate alarmists, and halve the size of the Government and its Ministries thereby releasing all those good people to become productive.



Unite the country in the quest to be the best and wealthiest small country in the world and by wealthiest, we don’t necessarily mean as measured by money.



Best of luck.

Our resident _BFD_ ex-science teacher has posed some questions and further experimentation for the brighter students for homework:



Repeat the experiment at home at night.



3\. Does the temperature increase in the jar?  
4\. If not, why not?  
5\. Why does the jar heat up more in the day than at night? 



On the tiny scale of a jar (even a jar ten metres tall), the infrared absorption effects of carbon dioxide are too weak to be measured using just a thermometer. This is true even if the jar is filled with pure carbon dioxide. There are other reasons why this experiment proves nothing at all, but this is the main one.



If you heat an enclosed jar with a lamp, (or the sun) the thermometer inside the jar will indeed heat up relative to the air outside the jar, but this is because the air inside the jar is trapped and cannot mix with cooler, surrounding air. But this has nothing to do with the Earth’s “greenhouse effect”, however. (Yes, it does describe why a plant greenhouse is warmer inside, though.) But, obviously, the earth and the atmosphere around it is not a closed system like the jar.



Will teachers with a brain be prosecuted if they refuse to take part in this charade?

Share this...FacebookTwitterBritish Antarctic Survey: Antarctic Peninsula has been cooling since 1998
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Climate skeptics have been accused over and over again of fabricating the climate warming hiatus of the past 15 years. A poor argument because the hiatus has been established as an area of research on which a number of scientific groups are working.
The latest study on the subject comes from a group of the British Antarctic Survey (Turner et al. 2016) that was published on July 21, 2016, in the journal Nature. It is a study on the warming hiatus of the Antarctic Peninsula. Yes, you heard it correctly – also here it appears there has been a hiatus.
The surprise is justified – as the German media and authorities claim on a regular basis that the Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth.
For example on the website of the German Environment Office Umweltbundesamtes (UBA) of July 23, 2013:
The climate of Antarctica
Antarctica is the driest and coldest continent on earth. Temperatures reach the freezing point in the west during the warmest month of January, otherwise they are far below the mean temperature of -55°C. Also Antarctica is impacted by global climate change and it is foremost warming at the Antarctic Peninsula more than the rest of the world. […] Only a few areas of the Antarctic Peninsula reach temperatures above the freezing point on a regular basis during the summer. However, it is the Antarctic Peninsula on the west side of the continent that is strongly hit by global climate change. No region on earth is currently warming faster. The temperature data of a research station on the Antarctic Peninsula run by Oak Ridge National Laboratory shows an annual mean warming of up to 2°C over the past 50 years. For the entire continent a warming of about 0.12°C per decade has been shown.”
John Turner and his colleagues of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have combined and evaluated the temperature data from various research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using the data it was possible to divide the trend into a warming phase of 1979-1997 and a cooling phase 1999-2014, the latter being the hiatus. The authors even write the result in the title of their Nature study:
Absence of 21st century warming on Antarctic Peninsula consistent with natural variability
Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern Hemisphere1. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers2, disintegration of floating ice shelves3 and a ‘greening’ through the expansion in range of various flora4. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion5, local sea-ice loss6, an increase in westerly winds5, 7, and changes in the strength and location of low–high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections8, 9. Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1% of the Antarctic continent and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.”

Figure: Temperature curve of the Antarctic Peninsula since 1979 (black curve). The red lines depict the linear trends. The gray bars at 1998 mark the trend change from warming to cooling. Source: Turner et al. 2016.
Turner and his colleagues clearly show that a strong natural variability governs on the Antarctic Peninsula and that it goes far beyond the anthropogenic signal. The change from natural warming phases over to cooling phases is a well-known phenomenon that is shown by ice core studies on the climate development over the past 1000 years.
The BAS scientists warn of simplistic views on warming in the late 20th century. In addition to natural variability (ocean cycles) and CO2, here also the ozone hole could have played a role. The main part of the text in the study states:
The recent change in SAT [surface air temperature] trend can be set in a longer-term perspective through examination of regional ice core records. An ice core from James Ross Island, which is close to Marambio station, showed that the region experienced several periods of rapid warming and cooling in the last 1,000 years, and that the warming trend over the last 100 years was ‘highly unusual’, although not unprecedented. However, the period since the late 1970s includes the ozone hole, which is unique in the record.”
The warming rate of the Antarctic Peninsula indeed was high in the late 20th century, however according to ice core measurements, there was a 50-year interval when temperatures rose even faster than 1979-1997:
The Ferrigno ice core from the coast of West Antarctica shows a warming from the 1950s to the early twenty-first century that agrees well with the warming observed at Vernadsky. In the longer term, this record revealed marked decadal variability and, importantly, resolved a 50-year period in the eighteenth century when SATs increased at a faster rate than observed at Vernadsky over the second half of the twentieth century.”
The most important finding of the study: The alleged extraordinarily strong warming of the Antarctic Peninsula in the late 20th century is well within the range of natural fluctuations. The paper states:
Therefore all these studies suggest that the rapid warming on the AP since the 1950s and subsequent cooling since the late-1990s are both within the bounds of the large natural decadalscale climate variability of the region.

From the Department of Obvious Science and the “don’t you have anything better to do with our tax dollars” department comes this pointless study. Gotta love the zinger at the end about the EPA not regulating fireworks emissions (yet). I’d like to see them try, because that might just be the bridge too far for that unaccountable federal agency.
Nationwide study measures short-term spike in July 4 particulate matter
Particulate matter linked to short and long-term health effects
From NOAA Headquarters:
From our nation’s founding, the Fourth of July has been synonymous with fireworks.
While many grew up learning that fireworks can be dangerous to the eyes and hands if not handled properly, fireworks also produce air pollutants, including particulate matter, that are linked to short-term or long-term health effects.
NOAA scientist Dian Seidel and Abigail Birnbaum, a student intern at NOAA, have authored a new study appearing in the journal Atmospheric Environment that quantifies the surge in fine particulate matter -particles that are two and one half microns in diameter (PM2.5) -on July 4, using observations from the 315 U.S. air quality monitoring sites that operated from 1999 to 2013. While scientists have known that fireworks displays produce a surge in fine particulates, the new study is the first nationwide quantitative analysis of the effects.
“We chose the holiday, not to put a damper on celebrations of America’s independence, but because it is the best way to do a nationwide study of the effects of fireworks on air quality,” said Seidel, a senior scientist at NOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory in College Park, Maryland. “These results will help improve air quality predictions, which currently don’t account for fireworks as a source of air pollution. The study is also another wake up call for those who may be particularly sensitive to the effects of fine particulate matter.”
PM2.5 are microscopic particles that can affect health because they travel deep into a person’s respiratory tract, entering the lungs. Both long- and short-term exposures to fine particles are linked to a range of health effects – from coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, to asthma attacks, heart attack and stroke, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children are among those most at risk from particle pollution exposure. For more information on risks, go online to the Environmental Protection Agency at: http://www.epa.gov/airquality/particlepollution/2012/decfshealth.pdf
The new research shows that hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter typically reach their highest levels, when compared to the days before and after July 4, on the evening of July 4. Levels drop back down by noon on July 5, according to the research. On average, the increases are largest from 9-10 p.m. on the holiday. Average concentrations over the 24-hour period starting at 8 p.m. on July 4 are 42 percent greater than on the days preceding and following the holiday.
Increases in fine particulate matter concentrations varied from location to location, due to how close the fireworks were to the monitoring site and variations in weather conditions. At one location, where fireworks are set off in a field adjacent to air quality monitoring instruments, particulate matter concentrations rose 370 percent on the holiday, well above the 24-hour fine particle standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s rules accommodate the tradition of using fireworks on the Fourth of July and at other cultural events, by allowing states to demonstrate that the short-term PM2.5 spikes measured on July 4 and 5 were influenced by fireworks display and should not be used in determining whether an area has violated the agency’s 24-hour PM2.5 standards.
And while the EPA does not regulate fireworks, the agency does recommend that people who are considered sensitive to particle pollution try to limit their exposure by watching fireworks from upwind – or as far away as possible. People with asthma should follow their asthma action plans and be sure to have their quick relief medicine handy.

"Speech by Hon Václav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic. March 4, 2008.
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like first of all to thank the organizers of this important conference for making it possible and also for inviting one politically incorrect politician from Central Europe to come and speak here. This meeting will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the moving away from the irrational climate alarmism to the much needed climate realism.

I know it is difficult to say anything interesting after two days of speeches and discussions here. If I am not wrong, I am the only speaker from a former communist country and I have to use this as a comparative – paradoxically – advantage. Each one of us has his or her experiences, prejudices and preferences. The ones that I have are – quite inevitably – connected with the fact that I have spent most of my life under the communist regime. A week ago, I gave a speech at an official gathering at the Prague Castle commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 1948 communist putsch in the former Czechoslovakia. One of the arguments of my speech there, quoted in all the leading newspapers in the country the next morning, went as follows: “Future dangers will not come from the same source. The ideology will be different. Its essence will, nevertheless, be identical – the attractive, pathetic, at first sight noble idea that transcends the individual in the name of the common good, and the enormous self-confidence on the side of its proponents about their right to sacrifice the man and his freedom in order to make this idea reality.” What I had in mind was, of course, environmentalism and its currently strongest version, climate alarmism.
This fear of mine is the driving force behind my active involvement in the Climate Change Debate and behind my being the only head of state who in September 2007 at the UN Climate Change Conference, only a few blocks away from here, openly and explicitly challenged the current global warming hysteria. My central argument was – in a condensed form – formulated in the subtitle of my recently published book devoted to this topic which asks: “What is Endangered: Climate or Freedom?” My answer is clear and resolute: “it is our freedom.” I may also add “and our prosperity.”
What frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published, that all rational arguments have been used, yet it still does not help. Global warming alarmism is marching on. We have to therefore concentrate (here and elsewhere) not only on adding new arguments to the already existing ones, but also on the winning of additional supporters of our views. The insurmountable problem as I see it lies in the political populism of its exponents and in their unwillingness to listen to arguments. They – in spite of their public roles – maximize their own private utility function where utility is not any public good but their own private good – power, prestige, career, income, etc. It is difficult to motivate them differently. The only way out is to make the domain of their power over our lives much more limited. But this will be a different discussion.
We have to repeatedly deal with the simple questions that have been many times discussed here and elsewhere:
1) Is there a statistically significant global warming?
2) If so, is it man-made?
3) If we decide to stop it, is there anything a man can do about it?
4) Should an eventual moderate temperature increase bother us?
We have our answers to these questions and are fortunate to have many well-known and respected experts here who have made important contributions in answering them. Yet, I am not sure this is enough. People tend to blindly believe in the IPCC’s conclusions (especially in the easier to understand formulations presented in the “Summaries for Policymakers”) despite the fact that from the very beginning, the IPCC has been a political rather than a scientific undertaking.
Many politicians, media commentators, public intellectuals, bureaucrats in more and more influential international organizations not only accept them but use them without qualifications which exist even in the IPCC documents. There are sometimes unexpected and for me unexplainable believers in these views. Few days ago, I have come across a lecture given by a very respected German economist (H. W. Sinn, “Global Warming: The Neglected Supply Side, in: The EEAG Report, CESifo, Munich, 2008) who is in his other writings very critical of the German interventionist economic policies and statist institutions. His acceptance of the “conventional IPCC wisdom” (perhaps unwisdom) is striking. His words:
– “the scientific evidence is overwhelming”;
– “the facts are undeniable”;
– “the temperature is extremely sensitive to even small variations in greenhouse gas concentration”;
– “if greenhouse gases were absent from the atmosphere, average temperature of the Earth’s surface would be -6°C. With the greenhouse gases, the present average temperature is +15°C. Therefore, the impact of CO2 is enormous”;
– he was even surprised that “in spite of all the measures taken, emissions have accelerated in recent years. This poses a puzzle for economic theory!” he said.
To make it less of a puzzle, let me make two brief comments.
As an economist, I have to start by stressing the obvious. Carbon dioxide emissions do not fall from heaven. Their volume (ECO2) is a function of GDP per capita (which means of the size of economic activity, SEA), of the number of people (POP) and of the emissions intensity (EI), which is the amount of CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP. This is usually expressed in a simple relationship which is, of course, a tautological identity:
ECO2= EI x SEA x POP
but with some assumption about causality it can be turned into a structural equation. What this relationship tells is simple: If we really want to decrease ECO2 (which most of us assembled here today probably do not consider necessary), we have to either stop the economic growth and thus block further rise in the standard of living, or stop the population growth, or make miracles with the emissions intensity.
I am afraid there are people who want to stop the economic growth, the rise in the standard of living (though not their own) and the ability of man to use the expanding wealth, science and technology for solving the actual pressing problems of mankind, especially of the developing countries. This ambition goes very much against the past human experience which has always been connected with a strong motivation to go ahead and to better human conditions. There is no reason to make the, from above orchestrated, change just now – especially with arguments based on such an incomplete and faulty science as is demonstrated by the IPCC. Human wants are unlimited and should stay so. Asceticism is a respectable individual attitude but should not be forcefully imposed upon the rest of us.
I am also afraid that the same people, imprisoned in the Malthusian tenets and in their own megalomaniac ambitions, want to regulate and constrain the demographic development, which is something only the totalitarian regimes have until now dared to think about or experiment with. Without resisting it we would find ourselves on the slippery “road to serfdom.” The freedom to have children without regulation and control is one of the undisputable human rights and we have to say very loudly that we do respect it and will do so in the future as well.
There are people among the global warming alarmists who would protest against being included in any of these categories, but who do call for a radical decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. It can be achieved only by means of a radical decline in the emissions intensity. This is surprising because we probably believe in technical progress more than our opponents. We know, however, that such revolutions in economic efficiency (and emissions intensity is part of it) have never been realized in the past and will not happen in the future either. To expect anything like that is a non-serious speculation.
I recently looked at the European CO2 emissions data covering the period 1990-2005, which means the Kyoto Protocol era. My conclusion is that in spite of many opposite statements the very robust relationship between CO2 emissions and the rate of economic growth can’t be disputed, at least in a relevant and meaningful time horizon. You don’t need huge computer models to very easily distinguish three different types of countries in Europe:
– the EU less developed countries – Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain – which during this very period tried to catch up with the economic performance of the more developed EU countries. Their rapid economic growth led to the increase of their CO2 emissions in 15 years (in which they signed Kyoto) by 53%;
– the European post-communist countries which after the fall of communism went through a fundamental, voluntarily unorganizable transformation shake-out and an inevitable radical economic restructuring with the heavy industry disappearing (not stagnating or retreating) practically over night. Their GDP drastically declined. These countries decreased their CO2 emissions in the same period by 32%;
– the “normal” EU, slow-growing if not stagnating countries (excluding Germany where it’s difficult to eliminate the impact of the fact that the East German economy almost ceased to exist in that period) increased their CO2 emissions by 4%.
The huge differences in these three figures – +53%, -32% and +4% – are almost fascinating. And yet, there is a dream among European politicians to reduce CO2 emissions for the entire EU by 30 per cent in the next 13 years (compared to the 1990 level). What does it mean? Do they assume that all countries would undergo a similar economic shock as was experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries after the fall of communism? Now in the whole of Europe? Do they assume that European economically weaker countries would stop their catching-up process? Or do they intend to organize a decrease in the number of people living in Europe? Or do they expect a miracle in the development of the emissions/GDP ratio, which would require a technological revolution of unheard-of proportions? With the help of a – from Brussels organized – scientific and technological revolution?
What I see in Europe (and in the U.S. and other countries as well) is a powerful combination of irresponsibility, of wishful thinking, of implicit believing in some form of Malthusianism, of cynical approach of those who themselves are sufficiently well-off, together with the strong belief in the possibility of changing the economic nature of things through a radical political project.
This brings me to politics. As a politician who personally experienced communist central planning of all kinds of human activities, I feel obliged to bring back the already almost forgotten arguments used in the famous plan-versus-market debate in the 1930s in economic theory (between Mises and Hayek on the one side and Lange and Lerner on the other), the arguments we had been using for decades – till the moment of the fall of communism. Then they were quickly forgotten. The innocence with which climate alarmists and their fellow-travelers in politics and media now present and justify their ambitions to mastermind human society belongs to the same “fatal conceit.” To my great despair, this is not sufficiently challenged neither in the field of social sciences, nor in the field of climatology. Especially the social sciences are suspiciously silent.
The climate alarmists believe in their own omnipotency, in knowing better than millions of rationally behaving men and women what is right or wrong, in their own ability to assembly all relevant data into their Central Climate Change Regulatory Office (CCCRO) equipped with huge supercomputers, in the possibility to give adequate instructions to hundreds of millions of individuals and institutions and in the non-existence of an incentive problem (and the resulting compliance or non-compliance of those who are supposed to follow these instructions).
We have to restart the discussion about the very nature of government and about the relationship between the individual and society. Now it concerns the whole mankind, not just the citizens of one particular country. To discuss this means to look at the canonically structured theoretical discussion about socialism (or communism) and to learn the uncompromising lesson from the inevitable collapse of communism 18 years ago. It is not about climatology. It is about freedom. This should be the main message of our conference.

From YORK UNIVERSITY and the “paging Dr. Peter Wadhams” department…
Northwest passage routes. Stock Image: WikipediaTORONTO, September 29, 2015  – Despite climate change, sea ice in the (NWP) remains too thick and treacherous for it to be a regular commercial Arctic shipping route for many decades, according to new research out of York University.
Prior to this research, there was little information about the thickness of sea ice in the NWP, which meanders through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Yet, next to ice coverage and type, sea ice thickness plays the most important role in assessing shipping hazards and predicting ice break-up.
“While everyone only looks at ice extent or area, because it is so easy to do with satellites, we study ice thickness, which is important to assess overall changes of ice volume, and helps to understand why and where the ice is most vulnerable to summer melt,” says lead researcher York Professor Christian Haas, the Canada Research Chair for Arctic Sea Ice Geophysics.
The research paper, “Ice Thickness in the Northwest Passage“, was published in the journalGeophysical Research Letters .
Haas and his team, including Stephen Howell of Environment Canada, measured first-year and multiyear ice thickness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using an airplane equipped with an electromagnetic induction sounder or EM bird. They surveyed the ice in April and May of 2011 and again in 2015. It is considered the first large-scale assessment of ice thickness in the area.
The surveys found a modal thickness of 1.8 to two metres in most regions of the NWP and mean thickness of between two and three metres. Ice originating from the Arctic Ocean showed a mean thickness of more than three metres on average. Some multiyear ice regions contained much thicker, deformed ice that was more than 100 m wide and more than four metres thick.
“This is the first-ever such survey in the Northwest Passage, and we were surprised to find this much thick ice in the region in late winter, despite the fact that there is more and more open water in recent years during late summer,” says Haas. “This points to the importance of ice transport from the high Arctic and melt processes during the spring season, which critically depend on weather conditions and how they affect the melting of thick ice.”
Although the results were obtained in late winter when no ships travel the route, they will impact how ice break-up and summer ice conditions develop and are currently predicted, and help forecast the opening and navigability of the NWP during summer. It will also affect how sea ice hazards are assessed during the shipping season and provide baseline data going forward.
The NWP, comprised of a series of gulfs, straits, sounds and channels that connect the Beaufort Sea in the west with Baffin Bay in the east, is a much shorter route for moving goods between the Pacific and Atlantic regions than the Panama and Suez Canals. At the moment, this year’s annual summer minimum Arctic-wide ice coverage is the fourth lowest on record, with similar low coverage in the NWP, according to information provided by the Canadian Ice Service.
How climate change will affect the summer ice in the NWP in the future, however, is difficult to predict, says Haas. Further melting could cause more multiyear ice from the Arctic Ocean to drift into the NWP, making it less, not more passable.

Abstract
Recently, the feasibility of commercial shipping in the ice-prone Northwest Passage (NWP) has attracted a lot of attention. However, very little ice thickness information actually exists. We present results of the first ever airborne electromagnetic ice thickness surveys over the NWP carried out in April and May 2011 and 2015 over first-year and multiyear ice. These show modal thicknesses between 1.8 and 2.0 m in all regions. Mean thicknesses over 3 m and thick, deformed ice were observed over some multiyear ice regimes shown to originate from the Arctic Ocean. Thick ice features more than 100 m wide and thicker than 4 m occurred frequently. Results indicate that even in today’s climate, ice conditions must still be considered severe. These results have important implications for the prediction of ice breakup and summer ice conditions, and the assessment of sea ice hazards during the summer shipping season.

Recently I posted here on about 250 papers published in 2015. That post was shared or liked a few thousand times.
Well, the number of skeptic papers seems to be accelerating as already this year there have been almost 50, and it’s only February!
The following lists 48 scientific papers listed show that CO2 climate science is exaggerated and that natural factors are indeed dominant climate forces that will not be tamed by man emitting a trace gas.
These newest findings of course are no surprise to skeptics.
The list below includes the abstracts, where the special points have been emphasized. Two of the papers have been discussed already at NTZ here and here. The papers have been sorted according to categories.
Again do feel free to bring this newest list to the attention of your lawmakers, and ask them if there might be much better things to do with the billions of dollars spent on junk climate measures. It’s becoming crystal clear as to who the real deniers really are.

Solar Influence on Climate

The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can explore the information about the related variables. This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability.

Here, we use diatom assemblages from a marine sediment core collected from the West Greenland shelf to reconstruct changes in sea-ice cover over the last millennium. The proxy-based reconstruction demonstrates a generally strong link between changes in sea-ice cover and solar variability during the last millennium. Weaker (or stronger) solar forcing may result in the increase (or decrease) in sea-ice cover west of Greenland.

The comparison between MDVM reconstructed temperature and the variation of external forcing (solar activity and volcanic activity) is shown in Fig. 5. The smoothed MDVM reconstruction exhibited a general agreement with the variation of the reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI), and the correlation between the two series during the common period 849–2000 AD was significant (r = 0.498, edf = 34, p<0.01). Specially, the records shared high correlation coefficients in the epochs of the solar maximum (i.e. during the Medieval and Modern age), but poor correlation around 1500–1700 AD when the Spörer Minimum and Maunder Minimum occurred. It was similar to some other dendrochronological researches concerning the relation with solar activity. The relatively cold conditions between the two warm peaks around AD 1000 and 1100 seemed to be related to the Oort Minimum.
Therefore, the temperature reconstructions based on the MDVM method agreed well in general with the characteristic variations of the solar and volcanic forcings. It is quite plausible that the long-term climate variations in the past millennium have been largely linked to the periodical solar activity, and people usually look at the Maunder Minimum to explain the LIA. However, some researchers argued that solar forcing probably had a minor effect on the climate change over the past 1000 years, and volcanic eruptions seemed to be an important driver for the climate particularly during the LIA. It was also reported that the abrupt onset of the LIA was likely triggered by a succession of strong volcanic eruptions and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks. According to mainstream opinions, the LIA type events were probably attributed to a combination of solar minima and volcanic eruptions.

Tree-ring-based reconstruction of temperature variability (1445–2011) for the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China
Spectral analyses suggested that the reconstructed annual mean temperature variation may be related to large-scale atmospheric–oceanic variability such as the solar activity, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

The impact of solar activity on tropical Pacific convection during the boreal summer (June-July-August, JJA) has been examined using reanalysis data, revealing a significant lagged (1–2 years) correlation between outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) over the tropical western Pacific and the F10.7 index. The OLR anomaly over the tropical western Pacific and the maritime continent shows a dipole pattern during the 1–2 years following high solar (HS) years. Furthermore, the first mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the OLR with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal removed is similar to the distribution of correlation coefficients between the JJA mean F10.7 index and the OLR with ENSO signal removed. The correlation and composite analyses of the OLR, velocity potential and vertical velocity reveals that this convection dipole pattern shows an eastward shift of the central position of deep convection, as related to the influence of solar activity over the tropical western Pacific. Further analyses show that the evolutionary process of the solar signal in the ocean-atmosphere system over the tropical western Pacific is consistent with the analyses of OLR, velocity potential, and vertical velocity. By modulating vertical air temperature, the solar signal in the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) may contribute to the triggering of a lagged convection dipole pattern.

The reconstructions show a large glacier readvance corresponding with the 8.2-ka cold event and a sequence of eight distinct glacier advances and retreats during the Neoglacial time period bracket between 4300 ± 40 cal. yr BP and AD 1900. … [W]e suggest that deviations in ELA fluctuations between Scandinavian maritime and continental glaciers around 7150, 6560, 6000, 5150, 3200 and 2200 cal. yr BP reflect the different response of continental and maritime glaciers to drops in total solar irradiance (TSI).

[W]e reconstructed the history of typhoon and storm-rain activity only for the interval AD 1400–1900. The record indicates that typhoon frequency throughout the Korean Peninsula varied in response to the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Typhoon variability was likely modulated further by the state of the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) pattern, associated with variation in the magnitude of solar irradiance. During periods of minimum solar activity, such as the early Maunder Minimum (AD 1650–1675), typhoons struck the east China coast and Korean Peninsula more frequently because of a strengthened EASM.

A significant correlation between the solar wind speed (SWS) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the region of the North Atlantic Ocean has been found for the Northern Hemisphere winter from 1963 to 2010, based on 3-month seasonal averages. The correlation is dependent on Bz (the interplanetary magnetic field component parallel to the Earth’s magnetic dipole) as well as the SWS, and somewhat stronger in the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) west phase than in the east phase. The correlations with the SWS are stronger than those with the F10.7 parameter representing solar UV inputs to the stratosphere. SST responds to changes in tropospheric dynamics via wind stress, and to changes in cloud cover affecting the radiative balance. Suggested mechanisms for the solar influence on SST include changes in atmospheric ionization and cloud microphysics affecting cloud cover, storm invigoration, and tropospheric dynamics. Such changes modify upward wave propagation to the stratosphere, affecting the dynamics of the polar vortex. Also, direct solar inputs, including energetic particles and solar UV, produce stratospheric dynamical changes. Downward propagation of stratospheric dynamical changes eventually further perturbs tropospheric dynamics and SST.

Three factors affect substantially the radiation balance in polar regions: surface albedo, surface air temperature, and cloudiness. The surface albedo controls the shortwave energy budget; surface air temperature determines the incoming longwave radiation; cloudiness alters both the solar and the infrared radiative components.

Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality. Climate model simulations show that periods with cold winters and strong seasonality are associated with internal climate variability rather than external forcing. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that the reconstructed extreme climatic conditions during this decade occurred by chance and in relation to the partly chaotic, internal variability within the climate system.

We present a multi-proxy record (pollen, microscopic charcoal, carbon-isotopic composition [δ13C], organic content, and particle size) of the late-Holocene climate change and human impact from central-eastern South Korea. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA), the most recent major climate events, have not been accurately investigated by paleolimnological studies in Korea, mainly due to a lack of undisturbed sediments and indifference to the past climate change. Our pollen records show late- Holocene centennial climate variations characterized by the successive solar minimums of the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton. We find paleoenvironmental evidence for shifting cultivation associated with serious droughts and consequent famines during the early 19th-century Dalton minimum. Our interpretation of human activities is well supported by Korean historical documents describing socioeconomic suffering induced by LIA climate deteriorations.

Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe and Asia. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD, which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China.

Natural Ocean Oscillation

The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is characterized by a horseshoe pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and has a wide range of climatic impacts. While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.

Introduction: The surface climate of the UK and northern Europe is up to 9 degC warmer than it would be if the North Atlantic Ocean did not transport a large quantity of heat northwards to our shores. This unusual warming has been known since sea temperature records were established in the late nineteenth century and was probably well known to the early seafarers in the last two millennia.
Summary: This article has indicated that the North Atlantic Ocean is showing changes in its circulation as represented by the MOC at 26°N in the last 10 years. The changes in the MOC are associated with heat transport which has a direct effect on the upper ocean heat storage northwards of the RAPID array. The event in 2009 caused a cooling of the subtropical ocean between 20 and 40°N but did not appear to influence the region poleward of 50°N. The role of the atmosphere in the changes in the MOC in this region, in particular on interannual and decadal timescales, is still not well understood.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the leading mode of atmospheric circulation variability in the North Atlantic region. Associated shifts of storm tracks, precipitation and temperature patterns affect energy supply and demand, fisheries and agricultural, as well as marine and terrestrial ecological dynamics. Long-term NAO records are crucial to better understand its response to climate forcing factors, and assess predictability and shifts associated with ongoing climate change. A recent study of instrumental time series revealed NAO as main factor for a strong relation between winter temperature, precipitation and river discharge in central Norway over the past 50 years. … Conditioned on a stationary relation between our climate proxy and the NAO we establish a first high resolution NAO proxy record from marine sediments covering the past 2800 years. The [NAO proxy record] shows distinct co-variability with climate changes over Greenland, solar activity and Northern Hemisphere glacier dynamics as well as climatically associated paleo-demographic trends. The here presented climate record shows that fjord sediments provide crucial information for an improved understanding of the linkages between atmospheric circulation, solar and oceanic forcing factors.

Conclusions: The temperatures observed from the different locations within Nigeria between 1980 and 2010 (1983–2010 for Abuja) are compared with the SST from the Niño 3 and Niño 4 regions of the Tropical Pacific while a further comparison of the temperature with the rainfall in Nigeria is also done. This is necessary so as to establish the connections between an ENSO event and the climate patterns in Nigeria. The outcome shows good link between the ENSO events and the Nigerian climate with the strongest agreement coming from the Niño 3 region of the Tropical Pacific. The finding indicates that the primary driver of climate like the south-westerlies that brings monsoon into the country from South Atlantic Ocean, the north-easterlies that lead to Tropical dry climate in the North and the ITCZ, which is sandwiched between the air masses, could be affected by changes in ENSO events. According to the results, the major link between an ENSO event and changes in the temperature and rainfall in Nigeria is associated with shifts in the ITCZ position. An El Niño (La Niña) induced southward (northward) shift in the ITCZ mean position is accompanying by reduction (increase) in the intensity of the mean rainfall in the country while the corresponding mean temperature after an El Niño (La Niña) event will rise (reduce). This is similar to other studies where El Niño induced drought have been reported in Nigeria

Most of flood periods coincided with the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The flood period of 1940–1944 was as long as the most recent one (2007–2011). Wavelet analysis found flood periodicities of 2.5, 52 and 83 years, but only the last one was statistical significant and their occurrence was in phase with the AMO. Logistic regression showed that AMO index was the most correlated index with flood events. In fact, the odds ratio showed that floods were 1.90 times more likely to occur when AMO index was positive. This regression model predicted correctly 64.70 % of flood occurrences during twentieth century using its flood information only as validation data.

The climate variability on Earth is strongly influenced by the changes in the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical oceans. More specifically, the inter-annual climate variability in the tropics as well as extra-tropical areas has large impact due to the anomalous SSTs in the tropical Pacific coupled with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through atmospheric teleconnections. … It is observed that during El Niño years the peninsular region receives more rainfall through enhanced moisture transport associated with anomalous westerly winds from adjoining Seas. The Rossby wave energy propagation in the atmosphere underlies important teleconnections involving ENSO. It is also noticed that there exist a distinct change in the phase of the Rossby wave pattern during El Niño and La Niña years which further causes the shift in the position of the jet stream over the Middle East.

Furthermore, since the end of the 19th century, we find an increasing variance in multidecadal hydroclimatic winter and spring, and this coincides with an increase in the multidecadal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability, suggesting a significant influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. However, multidecadal NAO variability has decreased in summer. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis, we detect multidecadal North Atlantic sea-level pressure anomalies, which are significantly linked to the NAO during the Modern period. In particular, a south-eastward (south-westward) shift of the Icelandic Low (Azores High) drives substantial multidecadal changes in spring. Wetter springs are likely to be driven by potential changes in moisture advection from the Atlantic, in response to northward shifts of North Atlantic storm tracks over European regions, linked to periods of positive NAO. Similar, but smaller, changes in rainfall are observed in winter.

In 2012 the most severe United States drought since the 1930’s occurred, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the climate factors driving droughts. Spatial-temporal analysis of United States precipitation data from 1900 to 1999 indicates that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) primarily modulates drought frequency. … Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3000 BP. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in the AMO as recorded in a proxy record derived from North Atlantic ice-rafted debris. These results indicate that lacustrine-derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and suggest that AMO modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3000 years. Additional studies using XRF-derived element data as a drought proxy are needed to determine the utility of this proxy in non-playa lacustrine systems.

Multiscale evolution of surface air temperature in the arid region of Northwest China and its linkages to ocean oscillations 
The global climate has experienced unprecedented warming in the past century. The multiscale evolution of the warming is studied to better understand the spatial and temporal variation patterns of temperature. In this study, based on the yearly surface air temperature from the gridded CRU TS 3.22 dataset and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), we investigated the multiscale evolution of temperature variability in the arid region of Northwest China (ARNC) from 1901 to 2013. Furthermore, the possible influences on the ARNC temperature change from the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and dipole mode index (DMI) were also discussed. The results indicated that in the past century, the overall temperature in the ARNC has showed a significant non-linear upward trend, and its changes have clearly exhibited an interannual scale (quasi-2–3 and quasi-6–7-year) and an interdecadal scale (quasi-14, quasi-24, and quasi-70-year). Compared with the reconstructed interannual variation, the reconstructed interdecadal variability plays a decisive role in the ARNC warming and reveals the climatic pattern transformation from the cold period to the warm period before and after 1987. Additionally, there were also regional differences in the spatial patterns of change trend in the ARNC temperature at a given time. We also found that the AMO and PDO had significant impacts on the ARNC temperature fluctuation at an interdecadal scale, whereas the DMI had a more important role in warming at the annual scale, which suggests that the importance of oceans cannot be ignored when considering climate change. Our findings deepen the understanding of the temperature changes all over the ARNC in the context of global warming.

Identifying predictability sources of heat wave variations is a scientific challenge and of practical importance. This study investigates the summertime heat wave frequency (HWF) over Eurasia for 1950–2014. … Further analysis suggests that mega-ENSO variations can incite a Gill-type response spreading to Eurasia, while the AMO changes cause eastward-propagating Rossby wave trains toward Eurasia. These two teleconnection patterns together contribute to the large-scale circulation anomalies of the ID mode, and those related to the IA mode arise from the teleconnection pattern excited by mega-ENSO. A strong mega-ENSO triggers subsidence with high pressure anomalies, warms the surface and increases the HWF significantly over northeastern Asia particularly. Likewise, the warm AMO-induced circulation anomalies engender surface radiative heating and HWF growth in most of Eurasian continent except some localized Siberian and Asian regions. The situation is opposite for a weak mega-ENSO and AMO. Those models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) which realistically capture the features of the ID mode can reproduce the AMO-like sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs), while signals resembling mega-ENSO are found in those with favorable capability of simulating the IA mode. On the contrary, these relevant SSTAs linked to the respective modes vanish in the models with little skills. Thus, mega-ENSO and the AMO might provide two critical predictability sources for heat waves over Eurasia.

Forced atmospheric teleconnections during 1979-2014 are examined using a 50-member ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations subjected to observed variations in sea surface temperatures (SST), sea ice and carbon dioxide. … A trend in the leading forced mode is related to ENSO-like decadal variability and dominates the overall observed 500 hPa height trend since 1979. These model results indicate that the trend in the first mode is due to internal variability rather than external radiative forcings.

Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales.
Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change. Most of the southern US decrease has occurred during the cold season that has been dynamically driven by an atmospheric circulation reminiscent of teleconnections linked to cold tropical east Pacific SSTs. Most of the northeast US increase has been a warm season phenomenon; the immediate cause for which remains unresolved.

On the interannual time scale, ENSO and SAM are important, but a large fraction of sea ice variance can also be explained by Rossby wave–like structures in the Drake Passage region. After regressing out the sea ice extent variability associated with ENSO, the observed positive sea ice trends in Ross Sea and Indian Ocean during the satellite era become statistically insignificant. Regressing out SAM makes the sea ice trend in the Indian Ocean insignificant. Thus, the positive trends in sea ice in the Ross Sea and the Indian Ocean sectors may be explained by the variability and decadal trends of known interannual climate modes.

Glaciers and small ice caps respond rapidly to climate perturbations (mainly winter precipitation, and summer temperature), and the mass-balance of glaciers located in western Norway is governed mainly by winter precipitation (Pw). … Complete deglaciation of the Ålfotbreen [glacier] occurred ∼9700 cal yr BP, and the ice cap was subsequently absent or very small until a short-lived glacier event is seen in the lake sediments ∼8200 cal yr BP. The ice cap was most likely completely melted until a new glacier event occurred around ∼5300 cal yr BP, coeval with the onset of the Neoglacial at several other glaciers in southwestern Norway. Ålfotbreen was thereafter absent (or very small) until the onset of the Neoglacial period ∼1400 cal yr BP. The ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) ∼650–50 cal yr BP was the largest glacier advance of Ålfotbreen since deglaciation, with a maximum extent at ∼400–200 cal yr BP, when the ELA [equilibrium-line-altitude] was lowered approximately 200 m relative to today.

Here, we present evidence for glacial retreat corresponding to the MWP [Medieval Warm Period] and a subsequent LIA [Little Ice Age] advance at Rothera Point (67°34′S; 68°07′W) in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. Deglaciation started at ca. 961–800 cal. yr BP or before, reaching a position similar to or even more withdrawn than the current state, with the subsequent period of glacial advance commencing between 671 and 558 cal. yr BP and continuing at least until 490–317 cal. yr BP. Based on new radiocarbon dates, during the MWP, the rate of glacier retreat was 1.6 m yr−1, which is comparable with recently observed rates (~0.6 m yr−1 between 1993 and 2011 and 1.4 m yr−1 between 2005 and 2011). Moreover, despite the recent air warming rate being higher, the glacial retreat rate during the MWP was similar to the present, suggesting that increased snow accumulation in recent decades may have counterbalanced the higher warming rate.

European Middle Ages were an extended period of fluctuating but mostly above-average warm temperatures that by the tenth century had melted the ice sheet of the Arctic Ocean and brought about Viking marine exploration of, and temporary settlement on the eastern shores of North America. Medieval warm climate was punctuated by two short, but extremely cold events. The first was the cold event of 535–6, possibly due to a volcanic catastrophe in the tropics that yielded extensive atmospheric dust veil, followed by a major crop failure through Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and a subsequent terrifying pandemic of the years 541–2, the Plague of Justinian. The second cold event coincided with a prolonged series of major volcanic eruptions on the Southern Hemisphere during 1315–1322. Extensive crop failure during the years 1315–1317 had led, at the same time, to the Great Famine throughout much of Europe.

Here we present the first high-resolution late-Holocene glacier record from the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway. … AMS radiocarbon dating reveals that the lake sediment record covers the last 1200 years, thereby including both the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) and the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA). …We found that both MCA and LIA were periods of substantial glacier variations with respect to the present, with a maximum lowering of the ELA of ~75 and ~85 m, respectively.

Centennial to millennial scale changes in the wider North Atlantic region were accompanied by variations in the West Greenland Current (WGC). During periods of relatively warm WGC, increased surface air temperature over western Greenland led to ice sheet retreat and significant meltwater flux. In contrast, during periods of cold WGC, atmospheric cooling resulted in glacier advances.
We also identify potential linkages between the palaeoceanography of the Disko Bugt region and key changes in the history of human occupation. Cooler oceanographic conditions at 3.5 ka BP support the view that the Saqqaq culture left Disko Bugt due to deteriorating climatic conditions. The cause of the disappearance of the Dorset culture is unclear, but the new data presented here indicate that it may be linked to a significant increase in meltwater flux, which caused cold and unstable coastal conditions at ca. 2 ka BP. The subsequent settlement of the Norse occurred at the same time as climatic amelioration during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and their disappearance may be related to harsher conditions at the beginning of the Little Ice Age.

Compared to single records, this stack represents the mean δ18O signal for northern Greenland that is interpreted as proxy for temperature. Our northern Greenland δ18O stack indicates distinctly enriched [warm] δ18O values during medieval times, about AD 1420 ± 20 and from AD 1870 onwards. The period between AD 1420 and AD 1850 has depleted [cold] δ18O values compared to the average for the entire millennium and represents the Little Ice Age. The δ18O values of the 20th century are comparable to the medieval period but are lower than that about AD 1420. …. The solar activity and internal Arctic climate dynamics are likely the main factors influencing the temperature in northern Greenland. In contrast, we could not find a general cooling effect of volcanic eruptions in our data.

The climate evolution over the last 1400 years was marked by alternating warm and cold phases. Two main climate periods can be highlighted: the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The MWP is characterized by relatively high temperatures associated with low variability (0.34 C ± 0.37). This period occurred between ca. AD 750 and ca. AD 1200. The LIA constitutes a cold period (-0.11 C ± 0.49) from ca. AD 1200 to ca. AD 1900. The end of the LIA seems late using this study, but it is still agree with several references (Millet et al. 2009; Magny et al. 2011; Luoto 2012). In the climate reconstruction provided by Guiot et al. 2010), two particular phases can be identified in this zone. The first (from ca. AD 1200 to ca. AD 1600) is clearly colder than the second. An abrupt warming appears to occur at AD 1600 during the LIA cold period. Before AD 750, the climate appears to correspond to a cold period, whereas after AD 1900, the climate corresponds to a warming period (0.04 C ± 0.49).

Press release (sciencedaily): “Extreme climate changes in the past Ice core records show that Greenland went through 25 extreme and abrupt climate changes during the last ice age some 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. In less than 50 years the air temperatures over Greenland could increase by 10 to 15 °C. However the warm periods were short; within a few centuries the frigid temperatures of the ice age returned. That kind of climate change would have been catastrophic for us today. Ice core records from Antarctica also show climate changes in the same period, but they are more gradual, with less severe temperature swings.”

The stability of modern ice shelves is threatened by atmospheric and oceanic warming. The geologic record of formerly glaciated continental shelves provides a window into the past of how ice shelves responded to a warming climate. …. The timing of ice-shelf breakup is constrained by compound specific radiocarbon ages, the first application of this technique systematically applied to Antarctic marine sediments. Breakup initiated around 5 ka [5,000 years ago], with the ice shelf reaching its current configuration ∼1.5 ka. In the eastern Ross Sea, the ice shelf retreated up to 100 km in about a thousand years. Three-dimensional thermodynamic ice-shelf/ocean modeling results and comparison with ice-core records indicate that ice-shelf breakup resulted from combined atmospheric warming and warm ocean currents impinging onto the continental shelf.
 
Climate Model Uncertainties and the Pause
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0191.1
The authors demonstrate that model estimates of climate sensitivity can be strongly affected by the manner through which cumulus cloud condensate is converted into precipitation in a model’s convection parameterization, processes that are only crudely accounted for in GCMs. In particular, two commonly used methods for converting cumulus condensate into precipitation can lead to drastically different climate sensitivity, as estimated here with an atmosphere–land model by increasing sea surface temperatures uniformly and examining the response in the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. The effect can be quantified through a bulk convective detrainment efficiency, which measures the ability of cumulus convection to generate condensate per unit precipitation. The model differences, dominated by shortwave feedbacks, come from broad regimes ranging from large-scale ascent to subsidence regions. Given current uncertainties in representing convective precipitation microphysics and the current inability to find a clear observational constraint that favors one version of the authors’ model over the others, the implications of this ability to engineer climate sensitivity need to be considered when estimating the uncertainty in climate projections.

Global mean surface temperature (GMST) rising has slowed down since late 1990s, which is referred to as the global warming hiatus. There was another global warming hiatus event during 1940s–1960s. The roles of the external forcing and the natural variability in both global warming hiatuses are explored, using EOF analysis. The first two leading EOF modes of the 5-year running mean global sea surface temperature (SST) reflect the global warming scenario (EOF1) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO)-like natural variability (EOF2), respectively. In observation, PC2 was in its positive phase (eastern Pacific cooling) during 1940s–1960s, which contributed to the previous warming hiatus. In addition, GMST trends are found to be negative during late 1950s and 1960s in most of the CMIP5 historical runs, which implies that the external forcing also contributed to the pause in the GMST rising. It is further demonstrated that it is the natural radiative forcing (volcanic forcing) that caused the drop-down of GMST in 1960s. The current global warming hiatus has been attributed to the eastern Pacific cooling/enhanced Pacific trade winds. It is shown that the PC2 switched to its positive phase in late 1990s, and hence the IPO-like natural variability made a contribution to the slowdown of GMST rising in the past decade. It is also found that the EOF1 mode (global warming mode) of the observed SST features a smaller warming in tropical Pacific compared to the Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic. Such inter-basin warming contrast, which is attributed to the “ocean thermostat” mechanism, has been suggested to contribute to the intensification of Pacific trade winds since late 1990s as well. Global warming hiatuses are also found in the future projections from CMIP5 models, and the spatial pattern of the SST trends during the warming-hiatus periods exhibits an IPO-like pattern, which resembles the observed SST trends since late 1990s.
Cloud/Aerosol Climate Forcing

The Greenland ice sheet has become one of the main contributors to global sea level rise, predominantly through increased meltwater runoff. The main drivers of Greenland ice sheet runoff, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that clouds enhance meltwater runoff by about one-third relative to clear skies, using a unique combination of active satellite observations, climate model data and snow model simulations. This impact results from a cloud radiative effect of 29.5 (±5.2)Wm 2. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, the Greenland ice sheet responds to this energy through a new pathway by which clouds reduce meltwater refreezing as opposed to increasing surface melt directly, thereby accelerating bare-ice exposure and enhancing meltwater runoff. The high sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to both ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds highlights the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to better predict future contributions of the Greenland ice sheet to global sea level rise.
Clouds are known to play a pivotal role in regulating the local SEB [Surface Energy Balance], with competing warming and cooling effects on the surface. … The satellite-based cloud observations allow to estimate the cloud impact on the SEB [Surface Energy Balance]. … The annual mean CRE [Cloud Radiative Effect] of 29.5 (±5.2) W m 2 provides enough energy to melt 90 Gt of ice in the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] ablation area during July and August. … The snow model simulations, which capture the evolution of the GrIS SMB [Surface Mass Balance] from 2007 to 2010, indicate that clouds warm the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] surface by 1.2 (±0.1) C on average over the entire period [2007-2010]. … These results further indicate that not only liquid-bearing clouds but also clouds composed exclusively of ice significantly increase radiative fluxes into the surface and decrease GrIS SMB [Greenland Ice Sheet  Surface Mass Balance]

Future changes in aerosol concentrations will influence the climate system over the coming decades. In this study we evaluate the equilibrium climate response to aerosol reductions in different parts of the world in 2050, using the global climate model EC-Earth. .. Reductions in aerosol concentrations lead to an increase in downward surface solar radiation under all-sky conditions in various parts of the world, especially in Asia where the local brightening may reach about 10 Wm−2. The associated increase in surface temperature may be as high as 0.5 °C. This signal is dominated by the reduced cooling effect of sulphate which in some areas is partially compensated by the decreased warming effect of black carbon. According to our simulations, the mitigation of BC may lead to decreases in mean summer surface temperature of up to 1 °C in central parts of North America and up to 0.3 °C in northern India. Aerosol reductions could significantly affect the climate at high latitudes especially in the winter, where temperature increases of up to 1 °C are simulated. In the Northern Hemisphere, this strong surface temperature response might be related to changes in circulation patterns and precipitation at low latitudes, which can give rise to a wave train and induce changes in weather patterns at high latitudes. Our model does not include a parameterization of aerosol indirect effects so that responses could be stronger in reality. We conclude that different, but plausible, air pollution control policies can have substantial local climate effects and induce remote responses through dynamic teleconnections

A climate study of the incidence of downward surface global solar radiation (SSRD) in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) based primarily on ERA-40 reanalysis [atmospheric radiance data] is presented. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and ground-based records from several Portuguese and Spanish stations have been also considered. … [G]round-based measurements in Portuguese stations during the period 1964–1989 show a tendency to decrease until the mid-1970s followed by an increase up to the end of the study period, in line with the dimming/brightening phenomenon reported in the literature. … [T]he ERA-40 reanalysis shows a noticeable decrease until the early 1970s followed by a slight increase up to the end of the 1990s, suggesting a dimming/brightening transition around the early 1970s, earlier in the south and centre and later in the north of the IP. …. The results show that part of the decadal variability of the global radiation in the IP is related to changes in cloud cover (represented in ERA-40).

Most regions of the world ocean are warmer in the near-surface [0-700 m] layer than in previous decades, by over 1° C in some places.  A few areas, such as the eastern Pacific from Chile to Alaska, have cooled by as much as 1° C, yet overall the upper ocean has warmed by nearly 0.2° C globally since the mid-twentieth century.

During the past five million yrs, benthic δ18O records indicate a large range of climates, from warmer than today during the Pliocene Warm Period to considerably colder during glacials. Antarctic ice cores have revealed Pleistocene glacial–interglacial CO2 variability of 60–100 ppm, while sea level fluctuations of typically 125 m are documented by proxy data. … Our model shows CO2concentrations of 300 to 470 ppm during the Early Pliocene [5 million years ago]. Furthermore, we simulate strong CO2 variability during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. These features are broadly supported by existing and new δ11B-based proxy CO2 data, but less by alkenone-based records. The simulated concentrations and variations therein are larger than expected from global mean temperature changes. Our findings thus suggest a smaller Earth System Sensitivity than previously thought. This is explained by a more restricted role of land ice variability in the Pliocene. The largest uncertainty in our simulation arises from the mass balance formulation of East Antarctica, which governs the variability in sea level, but only modestly affects the modeled CO2 concentrations.

Attributing the observed climate changes to relevant forcing factors is critical to predicting future climate change scenarios. Precipitation observations in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) indicate an apparent moistening pattern over the extratropics during the time period 1979 to 2013. To investigate the predominant forcing factor in triggering such an observed wetting climate pattern, precipitation responses to four climatic forcing factors, including Antarctic ozone, water vapour, sea surface temperature (SST), and carbon dioxide, were assessed quantitatively in sequence through an inductive approach. … Quantified differential contribution with respect to those climatic forcing factors may explain why the observed austral extratropical moistening pattern is primarily driven by the Antarctic ozone depletion, while mildly modulated by the cooling effect of equatorial Pacific SST and the increased greenhouse gases, respectively.

Recent peripheral thinning of the Greenland Ice Sheet is partly offset by interior thickening and is overprinted on its poorly constrained Holocene evolution. On the basis of the ice sheet’s radiostratigraphy, ice flow in its interior is slower now than the average speed over the past nine millennia. Generally higher Holocene accumulation rates relative to modern estimates can only partially explain this millennial-scale deceleration. The ice sheet’s dynamic response to the decreasing proportion of softer ice from the last glacial period and the deglacial collapse of the ice bridge across Nares Strait also contributed to this pattern. Thus, recent interior thickening of the Greenland Ice Sheet is partly an ongoing dynamic response to the last deglaciation that is large enough to affect interpretation of its mass balance from altimetry.

In late winter-early spring 2012, the second Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems Experiment (SIPEX II) was conducted off Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, onboard R/V Aurora Australis. The sea-ice conditions were characterized by significantly thick first-year ice and snow, trapping the ship for about 10 days in the near coastal region. The deep snow cover was particularly remarkable, in that its average value of 0.45 m was almost three times that observed between 1992 and 2007 in the region. … Based on these results, we deduce that lower loss of snow into leads was probably responsible for the extraordinary snow in 2012. Statistical analysis and satellite images suggest that the reduction in loss of snow into leads is attributed to rough ice surface associated with active deformation processes and larger floe size due to sea-ice expansion. This highlights the importance of snow-sea ice interaction in determining the mean snow depth on Antarctic sea ice.

We present climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) as simulated by the global, coupled ocean–atmosphere–land Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a horizontal resolution of ∼1∘ in the past, present and future (1850–2100). CESM correctly simulates present-day Antarctic sea ice extent, large-scale atmospheric circulation and near-surface climate, but fails to simulate the recent expansion of Antarctic sea ice. The present-day Antarctic ice sheet SMB equals 2280±131 Gtyear−1, which concurs with existing independent estimates of AIS SMB. When forced by two CMIP5 climate change scenarios (high mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and high-emission scenario RCP8.5), CESM projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB of about 70 Gtyear−1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet’s edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.

Prydz Bay is one of the largest embayments on the East Antarctic coast and it is the discharge point for approximately 16% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. … The compiled geological data extend the relative sea-level curve for this region to 11,258 cal yr BP and include new constraints based on abandoned penguin colonies, new isolation basin data in the Vestfold Hills, validation of a submarine relative sea-level constraint in the Rauer Islands and recalibrated radiocarbon ages at all sites dating from 12,728 cal yr BP. The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP in the Vestfold Hills and of 8.8 mm/yr between 8882 and 8563 cal yr BP in the Larsemann Hills. The relative sea-level high stands of ≥ 8.8 m from 9411 to after 7564 cal yr BP (Vestfold Hills) and ≥ 8 m at 8563 and 7066 cal yr BP (Larsemann Hills) are over-predicted by some of the glacial isostatic adjustment models considered here, suggesting that assumptions relating to the magnitude and timing of regional ice loss since the Last Glacial Maximum may need revising. In the Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands the final deglacial sea-level rise was almost exactly cancelled out by local rebound between 9411 and 5967 cal yr BP and this was followed by a near exponential decay in relative sea-level.

Near the vent site, the urchins experienced large daily variations in pH (> 1 unit) andpCO2 (> 2000 ppm) and average pH values (pHT 7.73) much below those expected under the most pessimistic future emission scenarios. Growth was measured over a 17-month period using tetracycline tagging of the calcareous feeding lanterns. Average-sized urchins grew more than twice as fast at the vent compared with those at an adjacent control site, and assumed larger sizes at the vent compared to the control site and two other sites at another reef near-by. … Thus, urchins did not only persist but actually ‘thrived’ under extreme CO2 conditions.

Elevated CO2 as a driver of global dryland greening
While recent findings based on satellite records indicate a positive trend in vegetation greenness over global drylands, the reasons remain elusive. We hypothesize that enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2 play an important role in the observed greening through the CO2 effect on plant water savings and consequent available soil water increases. Meta-analytic techniques were used to compare soil water content under ambient and elevated CO2 treatments across a range of climate regimes, vegetation types, soil textures and land management practices. Based on 1705 field measurements from 21 distinct sites, a consistent and statistically significant increase in the availability of soil water (11%) was observed under elevated CO2 treatments in both drylands and non-drylands, with a statistically stronger response over drylands (17% vs. 9%). Given the inherent water limitation in drylands, it is suggested that the additional soil water availability is a likely driver of observed increases in vegetation greenness.

The Sun in March 2016
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Our mother star was once again less active than normal in March. The observed solar sunspot number (SSN) was 54.9, which was about 2/3 of the mean value (82.5) for this month into the cycle. Here’s what the current solar cycle (SC) looks like so far:

Figure 1: The course of the current SC 24 since it began in December 2008, up to March 2016 (month 88) in red, the mean of the previous 23 cycles is shown in blue, and the similarLY (since month 73) behaving solar cycle number 5, which occurred from May 1789 to December 1810, shown in black.
 The accumulated sunspot numbers this far into the cycle are plotted as the anomaly from the mean for each cycle. It shows that the current cycle is one of the weakest on record:

Figure 2: The accumulated sunspot numbers for each cycle, shown as the anomaly from the mean, 88 months into the respective cycle, going back to 1755.

 SC 24 is the weakest since SCs 5, 6 and 7, a time known as the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830). It appears that the current cycle may very well wind up being weaker than SC 7 when it ends. Our sun is a very mediocre star of the spectral classification G2, similar to our neighbor star Alpha Centauri A. That is one of the reasons evolution had enough time to spawn intelligent life. A more active star most likely would not have allowed it due to the powerful solar winds that would “blow away” a planet’s atmosphere.
What follows is a beautiful picture from the Hubble space telescope:

Figure 3: The light blue star inside the “bubble” of dust and gases is very active. Through pressure it generates its stellar winds that shape a sphere that measures 10 light years in size. Near the surroundings of the star a planet with an atmosphere would be inconceivable. Photo source: NASA
So can single super flares (extremely powerful eruptions of a star’s surface) from the sun be excluded? A new study by a team of scientists led by Christoffer Karoff of the University of Aarhus in Denmark concludes: No – something of the sort could in fact happen! There are indications that in the year 775 a flare occurred, one that was much more powerful than anything we could expect in modern times, e.g. Carrington- Event 1859.
A massive explosion on the sun that could be 100 times more powerful is improbable, yet cannot be excluded. If such a flare hit the Earth, things indeed would get very uncomfortable because all power transmission lines would be impacted. Our modern energy and communication networks would be interrupted globally, and for a long time.
The requirement for this? A huge sunspot.
If one did occur, there first would be a warning period. But what precautionary measures could be implemented? Up to now we can only hope to be spared of such a massive solar flare of energy. In a sense the Danish study tells us just how dependent the Earth is on the sun’s power, its electromagnetic radiation, and its magnetic field.

ACT leader David Seymour was dead right when he didn’t pull his punches and described the new New Zealand [climate change curriculum ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/non-satirical-image-of-the-day/)as ‘state-organised bullying of kids’



[…] Seymour, leader of the ACT Party, said he’s concerned the curriculum doesn’t allow for students to debate the science, telling Magic Talk he fears it’s designed to **suppress opposing views.**



“There is a supporting document that is all about how to deal with kids that disagree and one of the things it says is that if you’ve got a difficult kid that disagrees just change the seating plan.”



Seymour was referring to the “wellbeing guide” provided to teachers, which tells them: “With angry or obstructive students (depending on your understanding of them), consider seating plan, offer choices for ways to proceed, or share authority by delegating a student.”



The Epsom MP also criticised an activity in the syllabus called “myth buster role-play” where one student will play the role of an ‘activist’ for climate change and the other a ‘sceptic’. 



“I just think that sort of exercise, given that it doesn’t provide any sort of resource or credence to why people might be sceptical, amounts to state-organised bullying of kids,” Seymour said. 



[…] “I think one of the biggest challenges we have in New Zealand and across the Western world is the ability to have civil disagreement and respect that people have other views,” Seymour added. 



Free speech is under attack in every aspect of our lives now including in education. _Stuff_ will not publish dissenting viewpoints or facts about climate change that counter their world view, and now we have an unscientific New Zealand curriculum that basically tells teachers to isolate students who disagree with the rest of the class!



“What this curriculum does and the supporting document basically says ‘this is the way to think and if anybody disagrees it has built-in strategies for **suppressing their views’.**



[…]The new climate change teaching resource was announced on Sunday by Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Climate Change Minister J **ames Shaw.**



A more accurate job description for Mr Shaw would be **Minister of Green Propaganda.** There is no climate emergency, just a Green gravy train and an agenda to take us backwards.



[…] Seymour said while it’s not a bad thing for students to learn facts about climate change so they can understand what they hear in the news, he said **the curriculum doesn’t allow room for any debate.**



“Let’s do it in a way that actually allows kids to respectfully disagree rather than one that is basically set up to clobber them into a way of thinking, because that doesn’t help them at all.”



[…] Louis Holbrooke [ _sic_ ] from right-wing lobby group the Taxpayers’ Union had a similar view. 



“A student who displays scepticism, instead of being taken seriously, **they’re assumed to be displaying a psychological or emotional reaction to the distressing information,”** he told Magic Talk. 



That’s is just sick! As an ex-high school teacher I can tell you all right now that I would refuse to teach a curriculum that contains falsehoods and unproven science and that tells me to suppress students who want to question and respectfully disagree with the curriculum.



“It’s certainly not teaching them how to think because **there is no room for debate.”**



Shaw said students will be able to disagree, but they will “have to go to town against the entire New Zealand scientific community and suggest that they were wrong”. 



What…a…wanker! The science is settled according to Mr Shaw despite all evidence to the contrary.



Beef + Lamb New Zealand has also criticised the syllabus for advising students to eat less meat and dairy to help save the planet. 



This is not a science curriculum, it is Green propaganda and social engineering. It should be tossed into the wastebasket where it belongs.



[…]You can read more about the syllabus [here](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/01/new-climate-change-curriculum-lessons-on-greta-thunberg-and-dealing-with-scepticism.html).

I hope my esteemed colleague, [Lushington Brady](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/2019-another-year-of-drought-fire-flood-in-australia/), will not mind me invading his patch just this once, but I really felt impelled to comment on the awful situation in Australia at the moment. As our closest neighbours, and the nation that is always first to come to our aid in times of trouble, we owe them as much sympathy and assistance as we can possibly give. I admit that I have been watching in horror as these events have been unfolding, particularly over the last week or so, as an environmental crisis turned into a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people stranded on beaches, with no food or water as supplies had run out. This is Australia we are talking about. It beggars belief. 



But my heart sank as I realised that this was going to be another great opportunity for climate zealots to all screech from the usual song sheet; coal is bad, oil is bad, we have to go back to the Stone Age if we want to save the earth. This is in spite of the fact that Australia only contributes about 1.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions. That doesn’t matter somehow; it is singlehandedly wrecking the planet… and itself.



Being a naturally curious person, I did a bit of research into the history of Australian fires, and it made very interesting reading.



I failed to fall for the climate zealot claptrap, partly because I had read the Bryce Courtenay book, _[Four Fires,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Fires)_ some years ago, and realised that fire has been a part of the Australian landscape for centuries. In fact, the Australian bush needs fire; it is hard for Kiwis to imagine, but, without fire, the bush cannot regenerate. It is all about managing it properly.



But fire management has been in decline now for a couple of decades. Controlled burns and fire breaks have been dramatically reduced or abandoned altogether. (Please note that this is true in New Zealand too; in the hills around the Hutt Valley, the firebreaks, once so prominent a part of the landscape, have disappeared. The next fire that happens up there could be devastating.) This has been the result of a combination of stifling regulations and Green policy. **In a country which behaves like a tinderbox every few years, people are fined for chopping down trees that are too close to their houses.** If ever there was a disaster waiting to happen, this was it.



Here is the saddest part. This bit breaks my heart. We all know that lightning strikes often cause fires in the Australian bush. But that is not the major cause.



The above graph confirms something that I read the other day – that 87% of fires are started as a result of human activity; approximately 40% are deliberately lit and 47% are accidentally lit. Only about 13% of fires start naturally.



In other words, there would be hardly any fires if people were more careful, and if arsonists were strung up and shot. The stupidity beggars belief.



So far this bushfire season, approximately 200 people have been arrested and charged with arson. There has been a suggestion that some of them are climate activists. I don’t know if that is true, but there are few explanations for this. It means that people, knowing the enormous risks, are deliberately causing death, property destruction and burning alive of countless animals and birds all in the name of… climate change. Really?



Remember [those little darlings in East Gippsland](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/taxpayer-funded-media-controlling-the-fires-narrative/) who prevented the scheduled controlled burns from going ahead last September and October because they were worried about the burning of baby birds? Do they know that, apart from many of their neighbours’ homes and lives being destroyed (and possibly their own) that **over half a billion animals and birds have been burnt alive in these fires?**



New South Wales alone has lost over 30% of its koalas, burnt to death on trees caught up in the fires. The stupidity and ecological vandalism here is stunning.



Feel free to feel desperately sorry for those who have lost their homes, their businesses and livelihoods, their pets and livestock and even their lives in this man-made disaster. Feel sympathy also for the firefighters, both professional and volunteer, who risk their lives on a daily basis to control a situation that wouldn’t have happened in the first place, if human beings hadn’t been so careless, or so criminally-minded.



Scott Morrison has now joined the ranks of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson by being one of the most hated politicians on the planet. Yes, taking a family holiday while the fires were raging was a bad look, but he thought better of it and came back, to screaming abuse. Most of it is political, of course. While visiting the affected areas, the media focused only on those locals who refused to shake his hand, while many of the locals were desperate to talk to him about their needs. Politicising a tragedy is a modern-day media strategy, but it is contemptible. Those who need help don’t care which colour the politicians are – they just need help. Promoting political hatred while people’s homes are burning is just sick. 



It is not just Australians who are insulting Morrison, however. The international celebrity circus is out and about, screaming its usual verbal diarrhoea.



When people’s homes are burning, when people are dying or are stranded on beaches waiting to be rescued, is most certainly not the time to talk about climate change. It is the time to talk about rescue, recovery and rebuilding. Darling Bette clearly has no idea that these fires were mostly caused by humans, although that wouldn’t fit her narrative anyway.



I thought I would leave the last word to a couple of Australian climate activists, who obviously want to be the ones to save the world. Apart from being gender-neutral (that in itself probably tells you all you need to know), they feel the need to save the planet and get their message across to everyone by… breaking into Scott Morrison’s house and… [defecating in his pool.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7848777/Climate-activists-brag-trespassing-Scott-Morrisons-home-planned-s-pool.html)



They never got the opportunity to perform their particular circus act in Morrison’s pool, however, as he wasn’t there. It never occurred to them that prime ministers generally live in official residences. It also never occurred to them that prime ministers also have security, and they would never have been able to perform their little double act without being pinned to the ground with a gun at their heads. They would indeed have been crapping themselves then, I suspect… just not in the way originally intended.



Well, I feel safer already, knowing that we have people like that looking out for our interests. Don’t you?



God bless Australia. May God also protect you from idiots. [Jeremy Clarkson](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7852311/Jeremy-Clarkson-sparks-outrage-claiming-God-didnt-want-people-live-Australia.html) may think (tongue in cheek) that Australia is God’s laboratory for failed experiments, but it is also home to about 25 million people. Personally, I love Australia… but it needs to take a much harder line on idiots. If the fires this time have taught them nothing else, it should have taught them that.

There’s a law against shouting “fire” in a crowded movie theatre, based upon the notion that people will believe it and run over each other in the subsequent pandemonium. But when Al Gore recently visited burning Florida, shouted “fire,” and blamed global warming, there was no climate panic. What happened?



For years now, the Gore and Clinton administration has resorted to bathos in its desperation to sell global warming gloom and doom — first in an Earth Day snow job in 1995 and most recently in Florida.



Unfortunately, it hasn’t used very much science as it chases the global warming ambulance. Here’s what I mean:



March 1995. In his annual Earth Day address at George Washington University, Vice President Gore said, “Torrential rains have increased in the summer in agricultural regions.” Gore was referring to a yet‐​to‐​be published paper by federal climatologist Tom Karl, which demonstrated that the portion of total rainfall from two‐ to three‐​inch storms in the United States has increased from 9 percent in 1900 to 11 percent in 1950. That works out to 0.6 inches more rain per year, mainly before the greenhouse effect had changed much. We’ll bet most farmers could use plenty more rain in the summer.



February 1996. On February 5, many locations in the northern United States set their all‐​time records for lowest recorded temperatures on any date. On February 7, President Clinton blamed the cold on global warming. Any scientist in the world will tell you that the first thing that warms up are the very same air masses that set those record cold temperatures. The president is free to say that warming causes cooling, but he can’t veto the first law of thermodynamics.



On February 16, speaking into a raging snowstorm in Pennsylvania, President Clinton blamed global warming. But Atlantic Seaboard snowstorms always come close to being rainstorms because cold air is in such short supply. Warm up the atmosphere a bit and the snow changes to rain. Global warming will cause a blizzard in Washington DC only when hell freezes over.



September 1996. At an administration‐​sponsored “town meeting” on global warming, State Department officials said that the damage from recently landed Hurricane Fran was what you would expect from global warming. The fact is that maximum winds in Atlantic hurricanes have been declining significantly for the last 50 years. 



July 1998. Gore goes down to Florida to announce that the fires “offer a glimpse of what global warming may mean to families.”



April 1997. Speaking about the Red River flood in North Dakota, President Clinton said that “every American has noticed a substantial increase” of similar events “in the last few years.” That flood was caused by the melting of excessive snow. If Clinton’s people had bothered to check, they would have discovered the shocking fact that the warmer the winter is, the less it snows! Further, all the predictions of global warming concentrate their heating in the winter in the middle of continents — that is, places like North Dakota.



September 1997. Vice President Gore dragged a covey of quailing reporters up to Grinnell Glacier, in Glacier National Park, to announce, “This glacier is melting.” All midlatitude glaciers melt in late summer, because daytime temperatures reach their maximum. (It tends to be below freezing at night and in the winter.) But a check of the nearest long‐​term weather station at Kalispell, Montana, would have shown no warming trend in the last 100 years. Even the Park Service’s own literature says that Grinnell started to melt about 150 years ago at the end of the “little ice age.” 



October 1997. Vice President Gore traveled to the oxymoronic “El Niño summit” in California to conflate global warming and the natural temperature oscillation in the tropical Pacific. With him were the Federal Emergency Management folks and just about everyone else needed to shower the California electorate with tax dollars. In the final analysis, El Niño was a tremendous net benefit to the economy of the United States (about $20 billion) because of the lowered fuel costs that accompanied a mild winter.



July 1998. Gore goes down to Florida to announce that the fires “offer a glimpse of what global warming may mean to families.” Somewhat more embarassing is that the total insurance claims to date are a mere $300 million, about 1 percent of those that resulted from a decent Florida hurricane, and more in line with the claims caused by summer’s normal weather variation. 



In a one‐​hour infomercial broadcast by ABC’s Peter Jennings last April, both he and the veep lamented that Gore just can’t seem to communicate to the American people how important global warming is. The usual suspects came up: evil industry, bad people like you and me who don’t want to pay more taxes to stop global warming and people who think network news stories exaggerate things.



But the real reason Gore’s message isn’t resonating has to do with the common sense of the American people. They know that it snows less when it’s warm, that blizzards happen when it’s cold, that El Niño is as natural as prunes — and they know when someone is yelling fire in a crowded greenhouse.

"**Blizzard has placed a 12-month ban on a Hong-Kong-based professional gamer who staged an anti-government protest during a post-match interview.**
Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.
Blizzard said the ban was for breaking tournament rules that players must not offend people or damage its image.
The interview aired on the official Hearthstone Taiwan video stream.
The stream was reportedly cut immediately after his statement and switched to showing adverts.
Hearthstone is played with a deck of virtual cards featuring heroes, relics and spells based on Blizzard's Warcraft titles.
Chung, who plays under the name Blitzchung, has been a regular top-10 player in the Asia-Pacific region since 2015 and has featured in Blizzard's roster of top Hearthstone players.
Many other players have taken now to social media to complain about Blizzard ""caving in"" to China.
Blizzard issued a statement, saying: ""Grandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone e-sports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously.
""While we stand by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our e-sports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.""
As well as the year-long ban and loss of prize money Chung has been removed from the Grandmaster list that made him eligible to take part in top tournaments.
Blizzard said it would also stop working with the two video presenters who conducted the interview.
In a statement given to gaming news website InvenGlobal, Chung said his comments had been ""another form of participation of the protest"".
He added: ""It could cause me a lot of trouble, even my personal safety in real life.
""But I think it's my duty to say something about the issue."""
"The Carbon Sense Coalition (“Carbon Sense”) based in Australia is supporting an International Conference on the Science of Global Warming in New York next week (2-4th March 2008).
This conference, sponsored by The Heartland Institute of Chicago, is co-sponsored by 19 other organisations all over the world including the Carbon Sense Coalition.

The Conference will feature internationally recognised speakers from Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA, Canada and Europe. Carbon Sense has registered 10 delegates from Australia and New Zealand and several other individual delegates and scientists from Australia and New Zealand will attend.
For more information on the Conference see: http://www.heartland.org/NewYork08/newyork08.cfm
The chairman Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this conference would highlight the fact that a large number of eminently qualified scientists all over the world are rejecting the IPCC proposition that human emissions of carbon dioxide have caused or will cause dangerous global warming.
“We compliment Professor Garnaut for acknowledging that the science is not settled and for seeing value in expanding the global scientific effort beyond the IPCC. We urge Professor Garnaut, and Ministers Wong and Garret to attend the New York conference to see the powerful new scientific arguments and evidence that have emerged since the now outdated work supporting latest IPCC reports.”
According to Forbes, “Global warming hysteria will take a cold shower in New York next week”.
A copy of the submission by Carbon Sense to the Garnaut Review can be found at: http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/garnaut-submission.pdf
“There is definitely no “consensus” on man-made global warming even if this were relevant to determining a question of science. In fact, far more scientists have openly rejected the IPCC propositions than are publicly supporting it.
“The Carbon Sense Coalition, supported by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition and other groups and individuals in Australia and New Zealand, recently called on the governments of Australia and New Zealand to set up an Australia New Zealand Royal Commission on the Science of Global Warming (to be known as “The ANZIG Royal Commission” – the Australia New Zealand Inquiry into Global Warming). We strongly believe that establishment of this enquiry should be a recommendation of the Garnaut Review.”
The submission by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition to the New Zealand Parliament in 2006, calling for a Royal Commission can be found at: http://nzclimatescience.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=205&itemid=1
“The interim report released recently by Professor Garnaut makes it more urgent that this independent scientific enquiry should take place.
“Garnaut’s proposal that Australia should target a 90% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 is so extreme that Australians need to take notice what destruction is being proposed in such a cavalier fashion. At one stroke, he could destroy the value of the huge public assets in coal fired power stations, as well as causing a dramatic fall in food production, power shortages and the migration to Asia of much of Australia’s cement, steel, processing and manufacturing industries.
“These people have already brainwashed our children into a state of fear about the future, now Garnaut will guarantee them lives of shortages and poverty. Without coal and oil the world could not maintain the world population, or produce and transport its food.
“Coal fuelled the British Industrial Revolution, and coal-fired electricity cleaned the air of last century’s polluted cities in Europe and America. Coal is still the most reliable and economical source of energy for modern life and is now offering its magic to Asia.
“There is loose talk about how we can simply replace coal by non-carbon sources such as uranium, hydro, wind, solar, bio-energy or hydrogen.
“Of these, only nuclear power has the proven capacity to replace coal, but to do so would require more time, more capital, less political hurdles and cheaper supplies of uranium than are in prospect. There is almost zero prospect that Australia could virtually replace its total carbon based generating capacity with nuclear by 2050.
“Hydro is a good reliable source of energy, but all the best sites are taken or sterilised by World Heritage disease.
“Gas can generate significant power, but it is enormously wasteful to use gas for base load power. Gas should be used for peak power, for standby power for solar or wind energy toys, for transport fuel to reduce our dependence on unstable Arab supplies and as a chemical feedstock. It is too valuable to be wasted on base load power generation.
“Hydrogen does not occur naturally, and is thus not a source of energy – it can be used to store and transport energy if the considerable engineering and economic hurdles are overcome.
There are some ways that can help you, driving there are two or three activities known as Kegel exercise that helps you in managing the vaginal dividers usingv-tight gel review solution.
“Nowhere in the world is wind or solar energy contributing significant base load energy for the simple reason that it is impossible. Neither can supply energy continuously and both supply ZERO power for significant parts of their operating cycle. Both must be supplemented by conventional power sources (such as gas or hydro) ready to start up instantly the wind drops or a cloud passes in front of the sun. Such backup power needs to be the same capacity as the solar/wind facility, thus doubling total generating capacity and making this option an expensive, unstable and wasteful exercise.
“Wind power is useful for pumping water to storage ponds for other use, and solar is useful for heating and storing domestic hot water. Beyond these applications, they will never survive without costly subsidies or mandated shares. No one runs a big city or a steel works solely on solar or wind.
“The only efficient way to harvest the sun’s energy is to use plants such as grass, trees and algae. However, “Biofuel” is a costly con which does more harm than good to energy supplies, energy costs and the environment.”

From the “methane is scarier when it comes from Jack-o-lanterns” department.
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The US Department of Energy has issued a (serious) press release which suggests that Halloween pumpkins contribute significantly to global warming.
To commemorate National Energy Action Month, we’re featuring some scarily effective ways to save energy at home. As cooler weather lurks around the corner, tune in to Energy.gov all week long for ways to save energy and money—and avoid cold weather terrors like energy vampires. We also put together some energy-themed pumpkin patterns to help “energize” your neighborhood for Halloween. Send us photos of your energy-themed jack-o-lanterns via Twitter,Instagram, Facebook or email at newmedia@hq.doe.gov and we’ll share our favorites.
With the passing of Halloween, millions of pounds of pumpkins have turned from seasonal decorations to trash destined for landfills, adding to more than 254 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in the United States every year. This Halloween, think of turning this seasonal waste into energy as a very important “trick” that can have a positive environmental and energy impact.
At landfills, MSW decomposes and eventually turns into methane—a harmful greenhouse gas that plays a part in climate change, with more than 20 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, when MSW is used to harness bioenergy—rather than simply being thrown away—the end result benefits the environment and helps our nation become less dependent on carbon-based fuel. Harnessing the potential of bioenergy allows the United States to generate its own supply of clean energy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It also limits stress on landfills by reducing waste and could ultimately create jobs for manufacturing, installing, and maintaining energy systems.
The Energy Department’s Bioenergy Technologies Office is working together with industry to develop and test integrated biorefineries—facilities capable of efficiently converting plant and waste material into affordable biofuels, biopower and other products. These projects are located around the country and use a variety of materials as feedstocks.
One of them, Fulcrum Bioenergy’s biorefinery in McCarran, Nevada, will use MSW as a feedstock and use gasification and Fischer-Tröpsch conversion technology to produce “drop-in” biofuel for the military.
Fulcrum Bioenergy was one of three companies selected to receive federal investments for commercial-scale biorefinery projects to produce military-grade biofuel that can be directly substituted for petroleum-derived jet and diesel fuel. Another one of these projects, from Emerald Biofuels, will use a different type of waste—fats, oils, and greases—as a feedstock that will be hydro-treated and upgraded at its refinery on the Gulf Coast.
Once in full operation, these two biorefineries will have a combined capacity to produce 92 million gallons of advanced biofuel per year for the military. Fulcrum has since received a $30 million investment from United Airlines and has entered into a long-term jet fuel supply agreement with Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific.
The Energy Department is working to expand waste-to-energy opportunities in the United States, and its partnership with these companies is helping to remove barriers to the commercialization of fuel and power production from waste, including yard and food wastes. It might not be long until the 1.3 billion pounds of pumpkins we produce annually are nearly as important to our energy security as they are to Halloween!

Isn’t it reassuring, that money you would have frittered away on healthcare, education for your kids, saving for your retirement, or just having a good time, has been taken away from you as taxes, so it can be invested wisely on your behalf into defeating the pumpkin climate menace.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGuest author Kenneth Richard has updated the lists of papers that do not support the claimed “climate science consensus” for 2014, 2015 and 2016 (just added). The updated list for 2015 has been posted (see right side bar under “Pages”) and now includes 282 papers.

 IPCC climate reports are emerging as only half reports. Image: IPCC
2014 will be updated soon.
2016 has just been added to the “Pages” side bar.
As the body of evidence refuting climate alarmism continues to balloon, the question of how the IPCC can continue ignoring it becomes ever more glaring. Clearly the IPCC has weighted alarmist papers over those that are not.

660 papers in just over 2 years
Over the last 27 months over 660 scientific peer-reviewed papers have ben published refuting alarmist claims on everything from temperature rise, climate model integrity, droughts, extreme weather events, floods to hurricanes, sea level rise, etc.
Overhauled IPCC is needed
Now is not the time to disband the IPCC, but rather it is time to completely overhaul it and assure it does its task objectively and without an agenda.
Though most of the papers the Kenneth Richard lists support that climate change is happening (it always has) and that human activity appears to be one factor, the alarmist scenarios often trumpeted by the media and IPCC scientists are in fact turning out to be more hype and less reality.
According to Kenneth Richard, who has spent hundreds of hours meticulously analyzing the body of climate science literature, already this year alone (2016) some 133 consensus-skeptical papers have been published.

"**Some Tigrayans in Ethiopia have described to the BBC how they have been harassed, detained or discriminated against since fighting began in their home region on 4 November.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has emphasised that the conflict in the northern Tigray region is against a ""criminal clique"" within the dominant party there, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), but reports from elsewhere in the country suggest there is an ethnic dimension to the crisis.
Tigrayans make up around 6% of the Ethiopia's more than 110 million people and many live outside their regional state.
The government has denied that there has been ethnic profiling and said any action carried out against individuals was for justified security reasons.
Some in the security forces have told the BBC that they have been disarmed and ordered to stay at home.
One of those was a female officer who had been working as a policewoman for more than 20 years, but was once a member of the TPLF, which was originally a militia force.
She said that two days after the fighting began, she received a call from a superior who asked her to report to the office the next day.
On her arrival she was ""ordered to hand over all government property and my firearm"".
She added that some high-ranking officials, who were also Tigrayan, were given the same strict order.
The government has not commented on the allegation that police officers have been disarmed because of their ethnicity.
But speaking about the issue in general, Mamo Mihretu, a senor adviser to the prime minister, told the BBC that ""taking law-enforcement measures based on ethnicity and identity is something that we take seriously and would condemn - this is not acceptable"".
However ""there is a clear instruction to the security agencies to take their measures based on risk and actionable intelligence"", he said adding that it was aimed at ""hardliners - disgruntled and reactionary elements of the TPLF"".
Since coming to power in 2018, the prime minister has tried to emphasise national unity while also respecting the identities and rights of the different groups which govern the country's 10 ethnically based federal states.
But the fallout from this conflict has exposed the difficulties of maintaining that position.
The BBC has also heard from a federal soldier of 14 years' experience who alleged he and others were singled out because they were Tigrayan in what he described as ""shocking"" treatment.
He said he was detained in a warehouse by his fellow soldiers with nearly 90 other Tigrayan members of the armed forces. They had their phones confiscated and were ""treated as prisoners of war"", he alleged.
""It was only the Tigrayans who were disarmed and detained together. So, it's obviously based on our ethnicity,"" added the soldier, who wanted to remain anonymous.
When those detained challenged the people who were holding them ""they said: 'The TPLF attacked our [base in the north] and this order to detain you came from the top'"", he told the BBC.
Among those held were veterans of the TPLF's struggle against Marxist dictator Mengistu Hailemariam, who was toppled in 1991. The TPLF then became the dominant political force in the whole country but say they were sidelined by Mr Abiy when he came to power in 2018
Others were high-ranking military officials, some of whom had spent time in the African Union force in Somalia, he said.
""I had never imagined those people who had relentlessly served the national army and their country would be treated this way.""
He later managed to escape from the warehouse, disguise himself as a civilian and flee to a neighbouring country, from where he spoke to the BBC.
He said that as he was crossing the border, he was careful to hide his Tigrayan accent so as not to arouse suspicion, adding that he fears for the lives of his comrades who he left behind in the warehouse.
Others sources have told the BBC that many Tigrayans, who are either current or former members of the armed forces, have been detained or have had their homes searched, and some put under house arrest.
When asked for comment, Chief-of-Staff Gen Berhanu Jula told the BBC that this was ""a political matter"" and he was not in a position to respond.
This allegation of ethnic profiling is not limited to members of the military and the police.
A Tigrayan civilian, who asked to remain anonymous fearing for her safety, told the BBC that last week a group of armed people, who appeared to be members of the security forces, came to her home, searched it thoroughly, seized bank statements and took away her father, who makes his living as a driver.
She said he was then held for two days and was accused of having ""travelled to Tigray with six million birr ($160,000; Â£120,000) and returning to Addis Ababa with weapons"".
She disputed this and said that his work driving tourists took him all over the country. The accusation has now been dropped.
The issue has also allegedly affected some state-run organisations such as the national carrier Ethiopian Airlines.
Several Tigrayan employees there have been forced to take leave until further notice or work from home, sources at the airline told the BBC. Ethiopian Airlines did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
**More on the Tigray crisis:**
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) recently said that a police officer asked staff at its branch office in the Amhara region to give details of their employees including birthplaces.
The WFP said the information was not available and then confirmed with the regional police that the request was not part of official policy.
The federal government described reports that this was related to ethnic profiling as ""a complete misrepresentation of the event"". It said the police officer was acting on specific intelligence that TPLF ""operatives [were] embedded and active within various local and international organisations within the country"".
It added that the police officer had a list of names and went to the WFP office to see if anyone on the list worked there.
It is clear that the security operation does not only concern what is happening in Tigray itself as the federal authorities are worried about TPLF sympathisers elsewhere.
But people who have spoken to the BBC have said that they have been singled out because of their ethnicity rather than anything they may have done.
If the conflict is short-lived then concerns about ethnic tensions may go away but if it proves to be protracted then there are fears that life for Tigrayans outside Tigray may become more difficult.
Despite seeing the TPLF as a blockage in the plan to achieve national unity, the impact of the conflict could prove to be a major challenge to the prime minister's vision of bringing the country together.
""If there is anything that the government is doing, it's to create a society that emphasises the ties that bind all of us,"" his adviser Mr Mamo told the BBC.
But the conflict in Tigray could threaten that goal."

The Balkans has regained its reputation as a geopolitical black hole. Kosovo recently deployed armored vehicles to arrest ethnic Serbs in the north for alleged smuggling. Ethnic Albanian police, meanwhile, have clashed with ethnic Serb civilians, which Serbian government official Marko Djuric called a threat to stability and peace. Belgrade has put army units on alert. Russia, Serbia’s ally, has criticized Kosovo’s “provocation.”



Germany’s famed Otto von Bismarck once warned that war in Europe would be triggered by “some damn foolish thing in the Balkans.” He was proven right when three decades later, the continent plunged into the abyss of World War I. Out of that conflict emerged what the Germans called Saisonstaaten, or “states for a season”: small, undemocratic, and mostly ethnically based nations that proved vulnerable to rising totalitarian powers. Most were in or near the Balkans.



The Cold War largely froze these national disputes. But once the Soviet Union dissolved, multiethnic Yugoslavia joined it in history’s trash can, and the Balkans again became a fount of conflict.





Geopolitical meddling has failed in that part of the world before. Why should we try again?



However, the extended combat and outside intervention that followed were not inevitable. In 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Alija Izetbegovic accepted the Lisbon Agreement, which would have granted Croats and Serbs the same right of secession as his dominant Muslim community claimed from Yugoslavia. Then at the urging of the U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, Izetbegovic reversed himself and decided on war. Three years of brutal conflict ensued, killing tens of thousands. Ethnic Serbs committed noteworthy atrocities, but so did Bosnian Muslims and Croats.



Washington took a reflexive anti‐​Serb position, supporting anyone who sought to leave a Serb‐​dominated government while denying ethnic Serbs the same right to secede from other regimes. The Clinton administration would not even call the expulsion of 150,000 to 200,000 ethnic Serbs from their ancestral homes in Croatia’s Krajina region ethnic cleansing. Moreover, the U.S. counted as a great achievement bombing the Bosnian Serbs into the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which preserved a multi‐​ethnic Bosnia against the wishes of most Serbs and Croats.



What of Washington’s handiwork today? Bosniak journalist Aleksandar Brezar complained that “this multicultural, multi‐​ethnic project is under serious attack.” But why hold it together with international baling wire and duct tape if so many of its people reject it? (Ironically, Bosnia has not recognized Kosovo, presumably fearful of encouraging secession by the Serb‐​dominated Republika Srpska, which, along with the Muslim‐​Croat Federation, makes up Bosnia.)



Bosnia is no model of nation‐​building. Freedom House rates it as only “partly free,” and notes, “Politics are characterized by severe partisan gridlock among nationalist leaders from the country’s Boniak, Serb, and Croat communities. Corruption remains a serious problem.” Freedom of expression is “limited in practice.” So is religious liberty. The judiciary is weak and “guarantees of due process are inconsistently upheld.”



The State Department’s latest human rights report cites “harsh prison conditions; restrictions of freedom of assembly and expression, and the press; widespread government corruption; [and] crimes involving violence against minorities” and LGBT persons. Human Rights Watch reports similar problems.



American officials took a similarly biased approach to Kosovo, an integral part of Serbia rather than a separate state. The population there had shifted over the years, aided by the anti‐​Serb policy of Yugoslavia’s post‐​World War II dictator, Josip Broz Tito, and the growing ethnic Albanian majority discriminated against Serbs. Then Milosevic played the ethnic card to vault to the top of the Belgrade leadership after Tito’s death.



As the central government took control, the Kosovo Liberation Army arose, kidnapping and executing Serb officials and ethnic Albanian “collaborators,” and bombing police stations and cafés. The group financed itself through drug smuggling and other criminal activities, as well as contributions from the ethnic Albanian diaspora, including in America. The Clinton administration’s special Balkans envoy, Robert Gelbard, described the KLA as “without any questions, a terrorist group.”



The Yugoslav government responded in kind, inflaming resistance. At the Rambouillet conference, Washington attempted to force Belgrade to sign away its independence, granting NATO free transit throughout the entire country to occupy Kosovo. When Milosevic refused, the U.S. initiated a bombing campaign, after which Serbian troops forced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes and committed other atrocities.



Yugoslavia finally agreed to withdraw from Albania, which then was occupied by NATO forces. Led by the victorious KLA, ethnic Albanians kicked out 200,000 or more ethnic Serbs, Roma, and other minorities while allied forces stood by.



Reported Human Rights Watch: “The KLA was responsible for serious abuses…including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state. Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post‐​conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non‐​Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals.” HRW also noted that “widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries…combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities…elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.”



Amnesty International’s Sian Jones reported on the allies’ failure to investigate the abduction and murder of Serbs at the conflict’s end. These acts “constituted a widespread, as well as a systematic, attack on a civilian population and, potentially, crimes against humanity” and “contributed to the climate of impunity prevailing in Kosovo.” A second round of ethnic and religious cleansing occurred in 2004, also on the allies’ watch. Dozens of people were killed; thousands of houses and stores were wrecked; dozens of churches and monasteries were destroyed. Thousands of ethnic Serbs were injured and thousands more were forced from their homes.



Freedom House only rates Kosovo “partly free.” Notes FH, the entity’s “institutions remain weak, and rampant corruption has given rise to deep public distrust in the government. Journalists face serious pressure, and risk being attacked in connection with their reporting. The rule of law is inhibited by executive interference in the judiciary.” Moreover, travel is “difficult for many Serbs.” Property rights “are inadequately enforced in practice.”



The State Department points to human rights problems including “refoulement; endemic government corruption; crimes involving violence or threats of violence against journalists; and attacks against members of ethnic minorities or other marginalized communities, including by security forces.” Other issues include a lack of legal due process and poor prison conditions. Moreover, “many in the government, the opposition, civil society, and the media believed that senior officials engaged in corruption with impunity.”



Yet the Americans and Europeans have insisted on independence for Kosovo while barring self‐​determination for ethnic Serbs, concentrated in the city of Mitrovica, north of the Ibar River. In 2008, Kosovo declared its independence over Serbia’s opposition. Only Russia’s veto blocked Pristina’s membership in the United Nations.



Serbia and Kosovo have since maintained a cold war, with the Serbs in Kosovo’s north resisting Pristina’s rule. The European Union has sought to induce recognition on Belgrade’s part by promising EU membership if they comply, but the Serbs have refused to trade territory for euros and various rounds of talks have failed to make progress. Last November, Kosovars imposed a 100 percent tariff on Serbian goods.



Last month, in an attempt to enforce its legal boundary with Serbia, Pristina arrested alleged smugglers operating in Kosovo’s north. The Serbian government responded with the implicit threat of force. If there are hostilities, it will invite NATO and Russian intervention.



Serbia has its own human rights issues, and no one imagines that it will reestablish its authority over Kosovo. Indeed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic recently acknowledged that his country had to accept that it had lost control of Kosovo. Still, he predicted that a compromise settlement could take years to reach.



There are alternatives to deadlock. Last year, the Kosovo and Serb governments considered land swaps, allowing ethnic Serbs to remain with Serbia while shifting the majority ethnic Albanian Presevo Valley to Kosovo. A similar border adjustment in Bosnia— breaking apart the unloved state— could normalize relations in the face of intractable hostility.



Brussels and Washington appeared supportive of the Kosovo initiative, but Germany did its best to block any territorial shift. Berlin’s malign role goes back to 1991, when it accelerated Yugoslavia’s break‐​up, encouraging the tsunami of violence. After wrecking and creating states with wild abandon, Germans now complain about the precedent of “changing borders.”



The U.S. should remain aloof from the latest Balkan follies. Edward P. Joseph of SAIS recently proposed that the Trump administration “demand” that Kosovo and Serbia “end the cycle of provocation,” “produce a detailed framework” for war crimes prosecutions, “seek the long‐​term basing of U.S. troops” in Serbia, “offer Belgrade a vast upgrade in the military and civil relationship, potentially to the level of strategic partnership,” and provide “both Serbia and Kosovo a generous development package.”



These ideas are frankly mad. The U.S. has nothing at stake that warrants further meddling in this graveyard of good intentions. Nor does Washington have any idea how to fix the region.



Geopolitical social engineering has consistently failed in the Balkans. Forcing antagonistic peoples to live together generated disorder, chaos, violence, and slaughter. If the Europeans have a better idea, let them try it. The Balkans should be their responsibility.

Only science deniers don’t believe in catastrophe
By Kenneth Richard
Now that the latest James Hansen catastrophic sea level rise paper (Hansen et al., 2016) has been affirmed by peer review, it has, according to Slate‘s meteorologist Eric Holthaus, been effectively “canonized.”   In other words, it has become scientifically authoritative.
James Hansen’s Bombshell Warning Is Now Part of the Scientific Canon”
The paper, which has undergone some wording revisions since the original version appeared last July (so that it could be accepted for publication), apparently “concludes” that the polar ice sheets will soon melt catastrophically; this ice sheet melt contribution will in turn result in sea level rise of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years” according to a summation from the same Eric Holthaus:
The study—written by James Hansen, NASA’s former lead climate scientist, and 16 co-authors, many of whom are considered among the top in their fields—concludes that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years.
Putting aside for the moment that (a) Greenland’s vast interior ice sheet has been melting more slowly in recent decades than it has for 95% of the last 9,000 years (MacGregor et al., 2016), or that (b) the West Antarctic Peninsula melted faster during the Medieval Warm Period than it has in recent decades (Guglielmin et al., 2016), or that (c) the northern Antarcitc Peninsula melted 10 times more slowly between 2003-2014 than it did between 1995 and 2003 (Seehaus et al., 2015)…
Or, putting aside that (d) the rate of sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets combined was just 2.3 inches per century (0.59 mm/year) between 1992 and 2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012).
Alas, with inconveniences put aside, Hansen’s claim of 10 feet of sea level rise in 50 years has nonetheless been officially anointed as scientifically authoritative anyway.  Therefore, to deny the conclusions of Hansen’s paper is tantamount to denying climate science. After all, that’s what science deniers do.  They deny canonized climate science like Hansen’s sea level rise forecasts.
To avoid being characterized as a science denier, one effectively must believe that the sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets combined will catapult from the current rate of 0.23 of an inch per decade (Shepherd et al., 2012) to 10, 50, or perhaps 100 times that rate so as to reach 24 inches per decade total sea level rise through the mid-2060s (so that Hansen’s sea level rise estimate of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years” can be realized).
Don’t agree that one should be categorized as a science denier if she or he doesn’t agree with Hansen’s catastrophic melt and sea level rise forecasts?  Well, that immediately begs the question: How many meters (or feet) of sea level rise must one believe in to avoid being labeled a science denier?  If one believes in only 2 meters (~7 feet) of sea level rise by 2100, for example, is that denying canonized climate science?
The IPCC’s last two reports (2007, 2013) confer sea level rise forecasts ranging from a low threshold of 18 cm to a high threshold of 98 cm (between 7 and 39 inches) by 2100.  One would assume, then, that with the scientific canonization of Hansen’s latest paper, the low range IPCC estimates are now effectively in the science denier camp.  If not science denier, how else does one categorize a forecast of just 7 or 10 or 12 inches of sea level rise by 2100?

Specifics are needed here.  After all, no one wants to be called a science denier due to non-belief in authoritative climate science.  So again, how much sea level rise by 2100 must one minimally believe in to avoid being called a science denier now that Hansen’s sea level rise catastrophe paper has been canonized?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Luning and chemist Prof. Fritz Vahrenohlt have recently looked at the so-called climate “Tipping Points” hypothesis, one that is heavily promoted by the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
The idea of the climate irreversibly tipping into something completely different and potentially hostile once certain thresholds are reached is one often put forth by PIK head Prof. Hans-Joschim Schellnhuber, architect of the proposed “Great Transformation of Society“.
============================================
Good bye “Tipping Points”?
By Sebastian Luning and Fritz vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Do you recall the horror reports of imminent climate tipping points?  They are often used to paint doomsday scenarios:


Figure: The tipping elements of the world’s climate, Source: PIK
A requirement is that critical thresholds be surpassed, due to the warming of the planet, and thus lead to a tipping of the climate system. This would be similar to the transition over to a new quality from the piling up of smaller quantities, as postulated by Karl Marx in his 3rd Development Law Of Dialectical Materialism. But there is one problem with this assertion in climatology: even the IPCC models (in the last report the CMIP5 models) aren’t playing along. They are forecasting (at least until 2100) more of a linear, steady development. The proponents of the catastrophe theories in fact use simpler modeling constructs for underpinning their Cassandra proclamations: most of them have been energy balance models showing a “catastrophic” shifting over. However, recent scientific studies have been published and they clearly refute the “tipping” claims. In the case of India’s summer monsoons it is written in the conclusion of a paper by Wiliam R. Boos of Yale University, PNAS:
Thus, outside of a theory that omitted a dominant term in the equations of motion, we know of no evidence supporting the idea that monsoons will shut down in response to anthropogenic forcings. Monsoons may have a strong response to anthropogenic forcings, but current theory and numerical models indicate that this response will be nearly linear.”

In another case concerning the “death spiral of Arctic sea ice” another published paper reached a similar conclusion: simple models exaggerated the possibility of a non-linear tipping point:
This result may help to reconcile the discrepancy between low-order models and comprehensive GCMs in previous studies. Specifically, it suggests that the low-order models overestimate the likelihood of a sea ice “tipping point.”
Authors Till J. Wagner and Ian Eisenman of the University of California also concluded that the non-linearity (collapse) of the AMOC (see our post here) was a mere artifact of an overly simplified model.
In another case depicted in the figure above we can also see that one tipping point theory predicts that from one year to the next only El Nino conditions will prevail in the Eastern Pacific. Look at the following figure: Nino 3.4  shows a trend of zero and the observation of sea surface temperatures has not diverted from the trend.

Figure: Monthly Nino 3.4 index
There’s no need to expect a shift over to some new quality, and thus follow in the footsteps of Karl Marx, who was accurate like no other in his analysis of society. His predictions failed spectacularly!

The UV mechanism
Now Germans Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt present papers on another way the sun impacts climate: UV radiation. Clearly the sun has an entire bag of tricks when it comes to dominating climate on Earth, and we are only at the dawn of understanding.
===================================
Heavenly Teamwork: How UV Radiation Above The Stratosphere Impacts Climate At The Earth’s Surface
By Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P. Gosselin
The sun? It doesn’t have any impact on the climate. At least that’
s what climate alarmism circles believe. A new study from 28 April 2016 appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters once and fore all shakes this view. Scientists have been able to show that changes in solar UV radiation on a scale of months have a clear impact on temperatures at the lower weather atmospheric levels at the tropics. What follows is the paper’s abstract. a paper by L. L. Hood of the Univeristy of Arizona in Tucson:
Lagged response of tropical tropospheric temperature to solar ultraviolet variations on intraseasonal time scales
Correlative and regression analyses of daily ERA-Interim reanalysis data for three separate solar maximum periods confirm the existence of a temperature response to short-term (mainly ∼27 day) solar ultraviolet variations at tropical latitudes in both the lower stratosphere and troposphere. The response, which occurs at a phase lag of 6–10 days after the solar forcing peak, consists of a warming in the lower stratosphere, consistent with relative downwelling and a slowing of the mean meridional (Brewer-Dobson) circulation, and a cooling in the troposphere. The midtropospheric cooling response is most significant in the tropical Pacific, especially under positive El Niño–Southern Oscillation conditions and may be related to a reduction in the number of Madden-Julian oscillation events that propagate eastward into the central Pacific following peaks in short-term solar forcing.”
Thomas et al. even found a solar-regulated temperature in the mesosphere, which he described in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics in November 2015:
Solar-induced 27-day variations of mesospheric temperature and water vapor from the AIM SOFIE experiment: Drivers of polar mesospheric cloud variability
Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are known to be influenced by changes in water vapor and temperature in the cold summertime mesopause. Solar variability of these constituents has been held responsible for 11-year and 27-day variability of PMC activity, although the detailed mechanisms are not yet understood. It is also known that the solar influence on PMC variability is a minor contributor to the overall day-to-day variability, which is dominated by effects of gravity waves, planetary waves, and inter-hemispheric coupling. To address this issue, we have analyzed 15 seasons of data taken from the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The SOFIE data contain precise measurements of water vapor, temperature and ice water content (among other quantities). These high-latitude measurements are made during the PMC season at the terminator, and therefore directly relate to the simultaneous measurements of mesospheric ice. Using a composite data set of Lyman-α irradiance, we correlated the time variation of the atmospheric variables with the 27-day variability of solar ultraviolet irradiance. We used a combination of time-lagged linear regression and Superposed Epoch Analysis to extract the solar contribution as sensitivity values (response/forcing) vs. height. We compare these results to previously published results, and show that the temperature sensitivity is somewhat higher, whereas the water sensitivity is nearly the same as published values. The time lags are shorter than that expected from direct solar heating and photodissociation, suggesting that the responses are due to 27-day variations of vertical winds. An analytic solution for temperature changes forced by solar irradiance variations suggests that if the response is due purely to Lyman-α heating and Newtonian cooling, the response should vary throughout the summertime season and depend primarily upon the height-dependent column density of molecular oxygen.”
Also Ball et al. found a detectable climate impact by solar UV fluctuations in a study appearing in the journal Nature Geoscience of 25 January 2016. Interesting result: The models are unable to reproduce the results. Here’s the abstract:
High solar cycle spectral variations inconsistent with stratospheric ozone observations
Solar variability can influence surface climate, for example by affecting the mid-to-high-latitude surface pressure gradient associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation1. One key mechanism behind such an influence is the absorption of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ozone in the tropical stratosphere, a process that modifies temperature and wind patterns and hence wave propagation and atmospheric circulation2, 3, 4, 5. The amplitude of UV variability is uncertain, yet it directly affects the magnitude of the climate response6: observations from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite7 show broadband changes up to three times larger than previous measurements8, 9. Here we present estimates of the stratospheric ozone variability during the solar cycle. Specifically, we estimate the photolytic response of stratospheric ozone to changes in spectral solar irradiance by calculating the difference between a reference chemistry–climate model simulation of ozone variability driven only by transport (with no changes in solar irradiance) and observations of ozone concentrations. Subtracting the reference from simulations with time-varying irradiance, we can evaluate different data sets of measured and modelled spectral irradiance. We find that at altitudes above pressure levels of 5 hPa, the ozone response to solar variability simulated using the SORCE spectral solar irradiance data are inconsistent with the observations.”
A long neglected link between the solar fluctuations and climate change at the sea surface, troposphere and stratosphere was described by Yamakawa et al. in March 2016 in the journal Quaternary International:
Relationships between solar activity and variations in SST and atmospheric circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere
Relationships between solar activity and variations in both sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation at the time of the solar maximum are presented. The global distribution of correlation coefficients between annual relative sunspot numbers (SSN) and SST from July to December was examined over a 111-year period from 1901 to 2011. Areas with a significant positive correlation accounted for 11.7% of the global sea surface in December, mainly over three regions in the Pacific. The influence of solar activity on global atmospheric pressure variations and circulation in the maximum years was also analyzed from 1979 to 2011. The results indicated that higher geopotential height anomalies tended to appear in the stratosphere and troposphere in the northern hemisphere, centering on around the Hawaiian Islands from November to December, in the second year of the solar maximum. The SST distribution in the Pacific with strong north and south Pacific Highs produced a pattern that resembled teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Central-Pacific (CP) El Niño, or El Niño Modoki (ENM). It is suggested that the solar activity had an influence on the troposphere via not only the stratosphere but also the sea surface.”
Another paper by Reichler et al. appearing in Nature Geoscience already back in 2012 follows similar lines:
A stratospheric connection to Atlantic climate variability
The stratosphere is connected to tropospheric weather and climate. In particular, extreme stratospheric circulation events are known to exert a dynamical feedback on the troposphere1. However, it is unclear whether the state of the stratosphere also affects the ocean and its circulation. A co-variability of decadal stratospheric flow variations and conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean has been suggested, but such findings are based on short simulations with only one climate model2. Here we assess ocean reanalysis data and find that, over the previous 30 years, the stratosphere and the Atlantic thermohaline circulation experienced low-frequency variations that were similar to each other. Using climate models, we demonstrate that this similarity is consistent with the hypothesis that variations in the sequence of stratospheric circulation anomalies, combined with the persistence of individual anomalies, significantly affect the North Atlantic Ocean. Our analyses identify a previously unknown source for decadal climate variability and suggest that simulations of deep layers of the atmosphere and the ocean are needed for realistic predictions of climate.”
The University of Utah issued the following press release:

Stratosphere Targets Deep Sea to Shape Climate:
North Atlantic ‘Achilles heel’ lets upper atmosphere affect the abyss
A University of Utah study suggests something amazing: Periodic changes in winds 15 to 30 miles high in the stratosphere influence the seas by striking a vulnerable “Achilles heel” in the North Atlantic and changing mile-deep ocean circulation patterns, which in turn affect Earth’s climate.
‘We found evidence that what happens in the stratosphere matters for the ocean circulation and therefore for climate,’ says Thomas Reichler, senior author of the study published online Sunday, Sept. 23 in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Scientists already knew that events in the stratosphere, 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth, affect what happens below in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere from Earth’s surface up to 6 miles or about 32,800 feet. Weather occurs in the troposphere.
Researchers also knew that global circulation patterns in the oceans – patterns caused mostly by variations in water temperature and saltiness – affect global climate.
‘It is not new that the stratosphere impacts the troposphere,’ says Reichler, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah. ‘It also is not new that the troposphere impacts the ocean. But now we actually demonstrated an entire link between the stratosphere, the troposphere and the ocean.’
Funded by the University of Utah, Reichler conducted the study with University of Utah atmospheric sciences doctoral student Junsu Kim, and with atmospheric scientist Elisa Manzini and oceanographer Jürgen Kröger, both with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

Stratospheric Winds and Sea Circulation Show Similar Rhythms
Reichler and colleagues used weather observations and 4,000 years worth of supercomputer simulations of weather to show a surprising association between decade-scale, periodic changes in stratospheric wind patterns known as the polar vortex, and similar rhythmic changes in deep-sea circulation patterns. The changes are:
— ‘Stratospheric sudden warming’ events occur when temperatures rise and 80-mph ‘polar vortex’ winds encircling the Artic suddenly weaken or even change direction. These winds extend from 15 miles elevation in the stratosphere up beyond the top of the stratosphere at 30 miles. The changes last for up to 60 days, allowing time for their effects to propagate down through the atmosphere to the ocean.
— Changes in the speed of the Atlantic circulation pattern – known as Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation – that influences the world’s oceans because it acts like a conveyor belt moving water around the planet.
Sometimes, both events happen several years in a row in one decade, and then none occur in the next decade. So incorporating this decade-scale effect of the stratosphere on the sea into supercomputer climate simulations or “models” is important in forecasting decade-to-decade climate changes that are distinct from global warming, Reichler says.
‘If we as humans modify the stratosphere, it may – through the chain of events we demonstrate in this study – also impact the ocean circulation,” he says. “Good examples of how we modify the stratosphere are the ozone hole and also fossil-fuel burning that adds carbon dioxide to the stratosphere. These changes to the stratosphere can alter the ocean, and any change to the ocean is extremely important to global climate.’
A Vulnerable Soft Spot in the North Atlantic
‘The North Atlantic is particularly important for global ocean circulation, and therefore for climate worldwide,’ Reichler says. ‘In a region south of Greenland, which is called the downwelling region, water can get cold and salty enough – and thus dense enough – so the water starts sinking.’
It is Earth’s most important region of seawater downwelling, he adds. That sinking of cold, salty water ‘drives the three-dimensional oceanic conveyor belt circulation. What happens in the Atlantic also affects the other oceans.’
Reichler continues: ‘This area where downwelling occurs is quite susceptible to cooling or warming from the troposphere. If the water is close to becoming heavy enough to sink, then even small additional amounts of heating or cooling from the atmosphere may be imported to the ocean and either trigger downwelling events or delay them.’
Because of that sensitivity, Reichler calls the sea south of Greenland “the Achilles heel of the North Atlantic.”
From Stratosphere to the Sea
In winter, the stratospheric Arctic polar vortex whirls counterclockwise around the North Pole, with the strongest, 80-mph winds at about 60 degrees north latitude. They are stronger than jet stream winds, which are less than 70 mph in the troposphere below. But every two years on average, the stratospheric air suddenly is disrupted and the vortex gets warmer and weaker, and sometimes even shifts direction to clockwise.
‘These are catastrophic rearrangements of circulation in the stratosphere,” and the weaker or reversed polar vortex persists up to two months, Reichler says. “Breakdown of the polar vortex can affect circulation in the troposphere all the way down to the surface.’
Reichler’s study ventured into new territory by asking if changes in stratospheric polar vortex winds impart heat or cold to the sea, and how that affects the sea.
It already was known that that these stratospheric wind changes affect the North Atlantic Oscillation – a pattern of low atmospheric pressure centered over Greenland and high pressure over the Azores to the south. The pattern can reverse or oscillate.
Because the oscillating pressure patterns are located above the ocean downwelling area near Greenland, the question is whether that pattern affects the downwelling and, in turn, the global oceanic circulation conveyor belt.
The study’s computer simulations show a decadal on-off pattern of correlated changes in the polar vortex, atmospheric pressure oscillations over the North Atlantic and changes in sea circulation more than one mile beneath the waves. Observations are consistent with the pattern revealed in computer simulations.
Observations and Simulations of the Stratosphere-to-Sea Link
In the 1980s and 2000s, a series of stratospheric sudden warming events weakened polar vortex winds. During the 1990s, the polar vortex remained strong.
Reichler and colleagues used published worldwide ocean observations from a dozen research groups to reconstruct behavior of the conveyor belt ocean circulation during the same 30-year period.
‘The weakening and strengthening of the stratospheric circulation seems to correspond with changes in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic,’ Reichler says.
To reduce uncertainties about the observations, the researchers used computers to simulate 4,000 years worth of atmosphere and ocean circulation.
‘The computer model showed that when we have a series of these polar vortex changes, the ocean circulation is susceptible to those stratospheric events,’ Reichler says.
To further verify the findings, the researchers combined 18 atmosphere and ocean models into one big simulation, and “we see very similar outcomes.”
The study suggests there is “a significant stratospheric impact on the ocean,” the researchers write. ‘Recurring stratospheric vortex events create long-lived perturbations at the ocean surface, which penetrate into the deeper ocean and trigger multidecadal variability in its circulation. This leads to the remarkable fact that signals that emanate from the stratosphere cross the entire atmosphere-ocean system.'”

An article came out on the AIP Physics Today website about a push from some scientists to formally designate today’s human geological epoch as the “Anthropocene”. Editors of the journal Nature argue that the name “provides a powerful framework for considering global change and how to manage it.” Here is a link:
http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.8107
Here is an excerpt, quoted from an article in Nature:
“Some supporters of the Anthropocene idea have even been likened to zealots. “There’s a similarity to certain religious groups who are extremely keen on their religion—to the extent that they think everybody who doesn’t practise their religion is some kind of barbarian,” says one geologist who asked not to be named.”
Another excerpt:
“Official recognition of the concept would invite cross-disciplinary science. And it would encourage a mindset that will be important not only to fully understand the transformation now occurring but to take action to control it.”
There are some interesting comments in the online discussion. One of them from a poster known as Guest is copied below. I thought it well written and worth sharing.
“When a popular foolishness arises in society one may weep for Reason, or laugh at absurdity. Few take notice of the former, and the proponents of the absurdity are greatly offended by the latter. It is clearly embarrassing to be exposed on the wrong side of Reality, and to have your favourite phantom hazard deflated. Consider crop circles. Even after the perpetrators confessed and demonstrated how they created them, true believers refused the explanation and vilified both the sceptics and the self-exposed pranksters.
Phantom hazards are popular with the fundamentally pusillanimous for the ‘threat’ can be confronted with the (perhaps sub-conscious) realization that there is no physical harm for the believer, but provides a cause of great moral superiority – and not infrequently, a generous income. Politically, phantom hazards are ideal tool for manipulating a trusting population. The threat is what the proponents construe it to be, it will never physically materialize, and victory can be declared at any time it loses its persuasive ability and attendant revenue. The true danger lies in real damage done to society through misapplication of effort and funds, and the theft of personal freedom – in this case ‘to fight climate change’ – previously ‘global warming’.
The arrogance of the political manipulators to pretend that they can organize society to prevent ‘climate change’ speaks poorly of those who would be thought of as ‘leaders’, and brings into question not only their intelligence but also their ethics. We must ask who benefits from this particular phantom hazard – and it certainly is not the general population.
One must admit that, from the perspective of manipulating society, global warming (or ‘climate change’) is a clever tool. This phantom hazard is global. It impacts everyone in the world. And they are not only its victims but also its cause. Brilliant! But dishonest. Such perfidy warrants much more than mere scoff.”

Earlier this afternoon in the Rose Garden, President Obama celebrated the ratification of the Paris Agreement. I had this to say in response:   




President Obama was a bit less than candid in his speech about the adoption of the U.N.’s Paris Agreement. Using realistic assumptions about role of carbon dioxide in climate change, the Agreement will prevent 0.1 to 0.2°C of global warming by the year 2100, not the inflated figure the U.N. gets by assuming all warming since the Industrial Revolution is caused by human emissions of carbon dioxide. Few, if any, climate scientists would defend that. It also assumes that emissions will—without the Paris Agreement—increase much faster than the average increase used in climate simulations. In reality, the UN’s own Climate Panel states only that carbon dioxide is causing more than 50% of the warming observed since 1950, not 1800. Further, the switch from coal to natural gas for electrical generation has already invalidated the UN’s assumptions about the growth of atmospheric carbon dioxide.   
  
  
He is also a bit optimistic about China, which has said it will stop increasing carbon dioxide emissions “around” 2030. This is exactly the time that researchers in Obama’s own Department of Energy said, in 2011, that their emissions would level off due to their maturing economy, and without any explicit policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, best known as “business as usual.”

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The unfolding Greek financial crisis is front page news. The repercussions – bank runs, unsustainable debts, deadlocked creditors – could easily lead to major consequences worldwide. However misconceived the Euro currency was, its downfall will be painful on a global scale.
How much of Greece’s current economic problems were caused by the made Hellenic dash into renewable energy? The answer, unsurprisingly, is most likely quite a lot.
Greece, like many small European economies, has placed a substantial focus on green energy, seeing it as a quick leg up into the big league – an easy way to attract generous funding from rich green neighbours like Germany. On paper it must have seemed a fantastic opportunity – build green energy infrastructure, using a mixture of easy finance and generous grants from Germany and other rich green neighbours, then sit back and profit from selling carbon credits, on the pan-European, or even a global carbon market.
The promised European carbon market never really manifested, thanks mostly to an embarrassing oversupply of carbon credits – a surplus which was created through a combination of domestic overissuing of carbon credits, and through clever gaming of the defects in the Kyoto accord.
The consequences for Greece of this economic miscalculation have been nothing short of tragic. With money in short supply, Greece has been forced to retroactively roll back generous carbon credits, which has undoubtably bankrupted local investors, and which likely contributed to a sense that investing in Greece is unsafe.
I’m not suggesting all of Greece’s financial problems are due to Greece embracing the false promise of green wealth. But the massive misallocation of resources and domestic green wealth destruction can’t have helped. Greece now stands on the brink of defaulting on a $1.73 billion IMF payment – a payment which Greece might have been able to afford, had they not been lured into squandering billions of Euros of borrowed money, on the empty renewable energy pipe dream.

"**Two people are in critical condition after another day of violent demonstrations in Hong Kong.**
A protester was injured on Monday morning when he was shot at close range by a police officer.
He was the third person shot by police since the protests began 24 weeks ago.
Later on Monday a pro-Beijing supporter was doused in flammable liquid and set alight after arguing with protesters, who are demanding greater democracy and police accountability in Hong Kong.
The territory's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, called the demonstrators enemies of the people.
""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen,"" she said.
There were clashes across Hong Kong on Monday between protesters and police, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas. At one point, tear gas was fired in the central business district - a rare occurrence during working hours on a weekday.
The violence also prompted a warning from a senior Chinese newspaper editor at a tabloid published by the state-owned People's Daily.
Addressing Hong Kong police, Hu Xijin wrote: ""You have the backing of not only the Hong Kong and Chinese people, but also Chinese soldiers and the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong,"" Reuters news agency reported. ""They can go into Hong Kong to provide support at any time.""
Monday's violence followed a weekend of vigils and protests after a 22-year-old student protester died on Friday. Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
The protests started in June against a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but have since morphed into wider demonstrations.
The shooting occurred as protesters tried to block a junction at Sai Wan Ho on the north-east of Hong Kong Island. Police confirmed that one officer ""discharged his service revolver"" and that a man was shot.
Footage posted on Facebook showed the officer drawing his gun before grappling with a man at a roadblock. When another man approached wearing a face mask, the officer fired at him, hitting him in the torso. The officer fired twice more, but there were no injuries.
After the shooting, footage showed the 21-year old protester lying with his eyes wide open and with blood around him.
He has undergone surgery and remains in a critical condition, a Hospital Authority spokesman told the BBC.
The police said officers also drew firearms from their holsters in two other places.
But they denied what they called ""totally false and malicious"" reports that officers were ordered to ""recklessly use their firearms"" in Monday's operations.
It was the third time a police officer had shot someone with live rounds. The first incident was during protests on 1 October when China was celebrating 70 years of communist rule. The second case was a teenage boy shot in the leg on 4 October.
**Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent, at the scene**
The pedestrian crossing in Sai Wan Ho, where the young protester was shot, has become a site of considerable tension.
Activists have built barricades across the junction - and when riot police come they face a torrent of abuse from bystanders of all ages.
Blood can still be seen on the street - and next to it graffiti reading ""we shall never surrender"".
Each time the riot police leave, the demonstrators return to erect their barricades again.
Hong Kong's political crisis - now in its fifth month - continues to become more violent.
The unnamed man was doused in a flammable liquid after getting into a dispute with protesters in Ma On Shan, about 20km (12 miles) north of the business district. It is unclear what started the argument, news agency AFP reported.
Video being shared online shows the man, who is wearing green, tell the protesters ""none of you are Chinese"". The protesters respond by telling him to ""go back to the Greater Bay Area"", which is a part of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong.
The man was then set alight in what Chief Supt John Tse said was the ""most shocking incident"".
""The man is now admitted to hospital in critical condition and the case is under investigation by the regional crime unit of New Territories South,"" he told reporters.
Most protests have taken place at weekends, but pro-democracy activists have called out all workers for a general strike on Monday.
Other incidents have included:
Police described the activists as ""radical protesters"", conducting ""extensive illegal acts"" and urged them to stop any actions that threatened safety and obstructed the police.
Several universities have cancelled their classes for the day.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continued and now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police behaviour.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent and in October the city banned all face masks.

Simon Bridges ruling out **NZ First** as a prospective coalition partner has come with mixed public reaction, but approval from many National supporters. Even some non-supporters have voiced their approval of Bridges’ nailing his colours to the mast and ‘get(ting) some guts’ to quote former PM Sir John Key. Heavens, even a [BFD poll](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/02/the-bfd-pop-up-poll-simon-bridges-announcement/) gives his decision around 70% support, on a site where criticism of Bridges abounds.



 _Newshub_ reports that hours earlier **Laurence Yule** when asked his opinion of Peters had said [“Winston is one of the most successful politicians in New Zealand”](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/national-mp-praises-winston-peters-very-successful-just-hours-before-simon-bridges-calls-him-untrustworthy). _Newshub_ editorialise that Yule has “a different view”. I disagree. Yule has an opinion, which National allows their politicians to express.



It is a fact what Yule said. Longevity is a good indicator of success in politics and putting aside how he achieved it, Peters has stuck around for some 40 years and kept his party together. That in itself is a success. Bridges would quite likely agree with Yule on that point.



Yule does not have a different opinion from Bridges. His comment on Peters is quite apart from their decision to ditch NZ First and he likely agrees with Bridges’ decision.



This is something the left, which includes most of the media, cannot comprehend. When you dislike someone, it has to be on a nuclear scale, no room for big picture, nuance, logic, reason or digging down for finer details and complete with personal attacks.



On the surface, successful though Peters may have been to last this long, when we dig down- into the finer details we find it is the way he has done it and the choices he has made that has determined Bridges’ decision. The name ‘charlatan’ has been attached to Peters over the years and for good reason. 



A recent example would be him declaring he was going into ‘good faith’ negotiations with both major parties after the last election whilst surreptitiously [taking a lawsuit](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/403234/bennett-tolley-avoid-financial-damages-in-peters-privacy-case) against two of their MPs. His coming up short with no convictions, having successfully smeared the two women, received very little coverage from the media: more wreckage the politician leaves in his wake from his decades in politics. 



**Editor’s note:**



_The judge is yet to deliver his verdict. Anne Tolley admitted under cross-examination to having discussed Winston’s private super details with a) her staff, b) the ministry, c) her husband, d) her sister. The lawsuit follows the actions of National in leaking as you can’t have a lawsuit without there first being a cause. That cause was National leaking his information. Barry Soper gave evidence that it was National who did it (a National staffer)._



Bridges uses this in his announcement as a reason why they cannot trust Peters, and he has struck a chord with many people who remember this drawn-out 2-year lawsuit. 



**Richard Harman** in a recent [_Politik_ piece](https://www.politik.co.nz/2020/01/24/what-ardern-is-really-all-about/) and left-leaning politicians like Ardern talk about the ‘tribal’ right in a negative way as they oppose nationalism. They ideally would like to leave immigration decisions to bodies like the UN.



May I suggest it is the left who are more fiercely ‘tribal’ and often motivated by fear of disagreeing with the mob. When do you ever see a Labour MP come out in criticism of Ardern or their policies? Rarely. 



We all knew that **Judith Collins** opposed the Carbon Zero Bill for a long time, and that other MPs have been against the party’s status quo on some issues. They have, no doubt, long discussions on issues to reach consensus. MPs are not afraid to disagree as freedom of thought and speech is not just part of their ideology but practised as part of their party’s culture 



Four Republicans opposed voting to stop witnesses in the US impeachment trial. In the end, two absconded. The Democrats all voted in favour, despite talk some were opposed. I believe this will be repeated in the final vote despite talk of some Dems absconding. 



Republican politicians in the early days criticised Trump. (Some, like **Mitt Romney** , still do). Senior Senator **Lindsay Graham** was one. He now is fiercely loyal. They are not vilified for their opinion, apart from Trump’s tweets, which they ignore. It’s called freedom of speech. Their actions show their support for him, all likely voting for his acquittal.



The left fall into line as their rules are more regimented, they are forced by fear and ideology to comply. Like manmade climate change where the left’s ideology is in unison, the science is settled.



The _Newshub_ writer who said that Yule has a “different view” fails to recognise the nuances in this issue. Or they could have been out to create a headline deliberately ignoring the obvious, or are just not very bright. Take your pick.



It’s OK to have personal opinions, particularly if you are on the right of the political divide. However, actions speak louder than words. National have expressed their real feelings and intentions through their actions against a man who has become their enemy, not a potential coalition partner. Bridges has called Peters’s bluff. The stage is set for a dramatic campaign.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service the day after his inauguration to ask why someone from the agency had shared someone else’s Twitter post giving an unflattering comparison of his inaugural crowd, according to Mr. Trump’s deputy press secretary. “It was a, ‘What’s going on?’ type of thing,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said on Thursday evening. “Why is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there. ” During the call, Mr. Trump also asked the National Park Service’s acting director, Michael T. Reynolds, if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd, according to a second person briefed on the Jan. 21 telephone call between the two men. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed outrage toward the news media for what he believes is a deliberate attempt to undermine his legitimacy by understating the size of the crowd that attended his   and speech. One of those instances happened on Inauguration Day, when an employee of the National Park Service used the agency’s Twitter account to share someone else’s post of images comparing the inaugural crowds in 2009 and 2017. The images, originally posted by a New York Times reporter, showed the 2009 crowd to be much larger. Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. ” Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of   television and online audiences. That same morning, before Mr. Spicer’s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him. They connected in the early afternoon, according to one of the people who was briefed on the call and asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. The new president asked for additional photos that could confirm his view of his crowd size. A park service spokesman, Tom Crosson, said he could confirm that a call took place between Mr. Reynolds and the president, but he would not describe the content. The call was first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Reynolds could not be reached for comment. The fact that Mr. Trump sought out Mr. Reynolds to discuss the Twitter message and seek more proof of the size of his crowd during his first full day as president is further evidence of the anxiety that he has demonstrated when people raise questions about the extent of his public support. As a candidate, he frequently commented on the size of his rallies, and when he became   he repeatedly spoke about the magnitude of his Election Day victories in states that few people thought he would win. Some political commentators had speculated that Mr. Trump’s focus on the magnitude of his support would fade once he took office, as the election became less important than the issues facing him. But his frustration about the size of the inaugural crowd is continuing. During an interview with David Muir of ABC News this week, he talked about it, saying: “We had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd  —   I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, ‘Wow.’ And I’ve seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. ” He also walked Mr. Muir over to a panoramic picture of the crowd hanging in a hallway in the West Wing. Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump’s decision to call Mr. Reynolds is a reflection of what his supporters find appealing: his willingness to do something himself when he thinks it needs to be done. “The reason that people like him is because he takes action himself,” she said. “If he sees something that’s an issue, he picks up the phone and directly engages to fix it. ”"
"**""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says.**
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved.
Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week.
Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down.
This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"".
It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict.
Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access.
Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control.
He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"".
The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked.
There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run."

 **Promise** : _Health Funding_



“This will be a government of transformation… **it will restore funding to education and the health systems to allow access for all, it will protect the environment and take action on climate change, and it will build a truly prosperous nation and a fair society, together.”**



 **Failed to deliver** : 



**Elective surgeries have dropped by 6000 under this Government, the first drop in a decade.** In the year to June 2019, 18 of 20 DHBs did fewer elective surgeries than the previous year. 



**Promise:** _Homelessness_



“This will be a government of transformation… **It will lift up those who have been forgotten or neglected, it will take action on child poverty and homelessness** … and it will build a truly prosperous nation and a fair society, together.”



 **Failed to deliver** :



If there was a roof over everyone’s head our largest city, Auckland, wouldn’t have a minimum of 800 people living without shelter – 50 per cent of them living in vehicles. Auckland Council Homeless Count in September 2018 found that there was a minimum of 800 people living without shelter and 2,874 in temporary accommodation.



The same problem exists in other major centres.

"We all know the stereotype: silly millennials, tethered to their phones, unable to accomplish the simplest tasks without scrolling their Instagram feeds, snapping their friends   tweeting inanely. But a Nielsen report released last week shows that Americans from 18 to 34 are less obsessed with social media than some of their older peers are. Adults 35 to 49 were found to spend an average of 6 hours 58 minutes a week on social media networks, compared with 6 hours 19 minutes for the younger group. More predictably, adults 50 and over spent significantly less time on the networks: an average of 4 hours 9 minutes a week. Sean Casey, the president of Nielsen’s social division, said the finding initially surprised him because “the going thought is that social is vastly owned by the younger generation. ” “It’s kind of synonymous,” said Mr. Casey, who wrote the foreword to the report. “When you think of millennials, you think of social. ” Mr. Casey, 46, said that eventually, the finding started to make more sense to him. “At a time when we wanted to be connected, it came out right when we were at the top of our media consumption,” he said. “It’s become second nature to our generation. ” The finding underscores how ubiquitous the smartphone has become. The report, released on Jan. 17, found that in the United States, 97 percent of people 18 to 34, and 94 percent of people 35 to 49, had access to smartphones.   percent of those 50 and older used smartphones, the report found. The   report was based on data from 9, 000 smartphone users and 1, 300 tablet users across the country from July through September. The data was not  . The report also broke out which social networks were most popular on smartphones, finding that Facebook still dominated on mobile, with about 178. 2 million unique users in September. It was followed by Instagram, with 91. 5 million unique users Twitter, with 82. 2 million unique users and Pinterest, with 69. 6 million users. Snapchat, a favorite of younger users, was sixth on the list, behind the professional networking site LinkedIn. Finally, the report looked at   activity on social media, measuring how many times Facebook and Twitter users employed those sites to post about programs they were watching or to interact with others’ posts. Again, in this category, it was Generation X that could not look away from its devices: On an average day, the report found, 42 percent of those interacting with television on Facebook were from 35 to 49 only 40 percent were millennials."
"**The Ethiopian prime minister, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has rejected a request for peace talks as the conflict in Tigray deepens.**
Tigray's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, wrote to the African Union (AU) last week to request talks.
But PM Abiy Ahmed said in a tweet that there would be no dialogue ""until our efforts to ascertain the rule of law are achieved"".
Hundreds have died since the conflict in Ethiopia's northern region erupted.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, following months of worsening tension between Tigrayan leaders and the federal government.
On Friday Mr Debretsion wrote to the AU asking for help. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, on Monday urged the federal government and the Tigray state authorities to engage in dialogue.
But on Tuesday Mr Ahmed said in a series of tweets that he wanted ""to assure Ethiopians again"" that there would be no dialogue until after rule of law was achieved.
He added: ""Our law enforcement operations in Tigray are proceeding as planned: operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended & brought to justice - all of them rapidly coming within reach.""
In other developments:
It is difficult to say but reports indicate hundreds of deaths on both sides.
The national armed forces have killed 550 Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters, the state broadcaster in Ethiopia has said.
The claim has not been independently verified.
In addition, government forces took control of Humera Airport in Tigray, state media reported on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, 17 military personnel, including senior officials, have been arrested, the federal police say.
They are accused of disrupting communications between the Northern Command and the rest of the national armed forces when the Northern Command was attacked last week.
Residents have fled Tigray.
Officials in Sudan, which shares a border with the Tigray region, say at least 6,000 Ethiopians have arrived in the country.
The Sudanese authorities are preparing for a further 200,000 people to cross in the coming days.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The federal government has cut off the phone lines and internet, Alula Solomon, the director of a Tigray media house based in the US told BBC Newsday.
His family, who live in Tigray the border near Sudan, were able to contact him by using Sudanese telephone lines. They have now fled to Sudan.
On Tuesday, Mr Debretsion accused the neighbouring Eritrean government of launching attacks on the Tigrayan state.
The accusation was denied by both the Eritrean government and the Ethiopian national army.
Mr Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea, which began when the TPLF dominated the Ethiopian government. Relations between the TPLF and Eritrea remain extremely bad.
The TPLF was the most powerful bit of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to coronavirus.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
Mr Abiy won the prize in 2019 for his role in resolving the border conflict with Eritrea.
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter border war from 1998-2000, which killed tens of thousands of people.
Although a ceasefire was signed in 2000, the neighbours technically remained at war until July 2018, when Mr Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal."
"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."
"President Trump’s target for economic growth just got a little more distant. The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1. 6 percent last year, shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver  —   a pledge now cited on the White House website. There are plenty of signs of life in the economy. Consumer spending is healthy, and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a   high. Stocks have been surging, and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment. But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent. Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind. While Friday’s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump’s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration’s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016  —   like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses  —   could persist into 2017 and beyond. In particular, lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter, which fell to an annual rate of 1. 9 percent from 3. 5 percent in the prior quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. In 2016, personal consumption  —   which accounts for a majority of economic activity  —   slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment. All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump’s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009. “It would defy gravity,” Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, “It’s simple math. ” At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed’s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation. Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed’s. One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar. What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama’s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed. “It’s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,” said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. “That would be true no matter who is the president. ” The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s. Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation’s infrastructure  —   an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus. Since Mr. Trump’s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018. That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump’s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term. Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2. 4 percent in 2017 and 2. 7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2. 25 percent in each year. “Tax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we’ve had in some time,” he said. But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher. Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth. But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies. While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of   products abroad rises. The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump’s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas. On Friday, the White House announced a manufacturing jobs initiative, naming chief executives like Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical and Elon Musk of Tesla to the as part of the effort, along with labor leaders from the A. F. L. . I. O. The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than   debt in Europe and Asia. “Mr. Trump can’t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,” Mr. Faucher said. “Trade is likely to be a drag on growth. ”"

A scientist / journalist shares his story of a sting operation on the scientific publishing process with frightening results.
Howard Booth writes:
An interesting sting was done on scientific publishing to show how remarkably easy it is to get published despite doing a poor research project (in this case on purpose).  John Bohannon, a PhD chemist and science journalist, was contracted to do a documentary for German television on the poor research in nutrition that produces outlandish claims about diet and dietary supplements.  They conspired to create a research study intended to produce fantastic results, and see how often their poor research would get called out through the entire publishing process.
The study had a terrible sample size, poor quality control, and zero peer review.  They managed to produce factually correct results that made an outlandish claim, write it up, get it published (with their choice of venues as many offered to pick it up), and get it splashed into the media with virtually no challenge to their methodology.  It was picked up by several noteworthy outlets and on track to get picked up by Men’s Health magazine, but no doubt John’s confession of the sting will forestall that.
I know that WUWT is primarily concerned with CAGW, but I thought this was an interesting peek into the terrible state of the scientific publishing process, and the media’s inability to hold scientists accountable.

Portrait of Vladimir Putin, Source kremlin.ru,Author Russian Presidential Press and Information Office
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
h/t DailyCaller – Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that he thinks the Western climate scare is a fraud, designed to restrain industrial development in countries like Russia.
According to the New York Times;
While Western media have examined the role of rising temperatures and drought in this year’s record wildfires in North America, Russian media continue to pay little attention to an issue that animates so much of the world.
The indifference reflects widespread public doubt that human activities play a significant role in global warming, a tone set by President Vladimir Putin, who has offered only vague and modest pledges of emissions cuts ahead of December’s U.N. climate summit in Paris.
Russia’s official view appears to have changed little since 2003, when Putin told an international climate conference that warmer temperatures would mean Russians “spend less on fur coats” while “agricultural specialists say our grain production will increase, and thank God for that”.
The president believes that “there is no global warming, that this is a fraud to restrain the industrial development of several countries including Russia,” says Stanislav Belkovsky, a political analyst and critic of Putin. “That is why this subject is not topical for the majority of the Russian mass media and society in general.”
…
Putin’s scepticism dates from the early 2000s, when his staff “did very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the climate debate”, said Andrey Illarionov, Putin’s senior economic adviser at the time and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington.
“We found that, while climate change does exist, it is cyclical, and the anthropogenic role is very limited,” he said. “It became clear that the climate is a complicated system and that, so far, the evidence presented for the need to ‘fight’ global warming was rather unfounded.”

Its difficult to know what impact Putin’s overt skepticism will have on the Paris climate meeting. The meeting is reportedly already in a lot of trouble, because even our economically illiterate leaders seem to be balking at the prospect of borrowing money from China, so they can gift the principle they just borrowed back to China as climate development assistance, then repay the loan back to China a second time, with interest.
To his credit Putin has no qualms about yanking the chain of climate obsessed Western Politicians. During the recent G20 conference in Australia, when asked why there was a fleet of Russian Warships just outside Australian territorial waters, the Russian embassy replied the ships were there to research “climate change”.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
_\---_   
  
We sign in this week with a look at how this year’s global temperature is evolving as the big Pacific El Niño begins to wane. The temporary rise in global temperature that accompanies El Niño events is timed differently at the surface than it is in the lower atmosphere. Thus, while El Niño-boosted warmth led to a record high value in the 2015 global average _surface_ temperature record, it did not fully manifest itself in the lower atmosphere (where the 2015 temperatures remained well below record levels).   




But now that warmth is being fully felt aloft. The figure below is the satellite-measured global average temperature history of the lower atmosphere as compiled from the University of Alabama-Huntsville (UAH). The El Niño-spiked temperatures are clearly obvious in the first four months of 2016 (the rightmost points in the graph).   






_Figure 1. Global average satellite-based temperatures of the lower atmosphere from January 1979 through April 2016, as compiled by researchers at the University of Alabama-Huntsville._



Dr. Roy Spencer, who along with Dr. John Christy, curates the UAH satellite temperature record, has this to say on his blog regarding what to expect for the rest of the year and how the 2016 annual temperatures may ultimately rank:   




I expect average cooling to continue throughout the year as El Nino weakens and is replaced with La Nina, now expected by mid-summer or early fall. Nevertheless, 2016 could still end up as a record warm year in the satellite record…it all depends upon how fast the warmth from the El Nino dissipates and La Nina sets in.



Early indications are also that global average surface temperature are continuing to feel the effect of the big, but dying, El Niño, and remain elevated into record territory.   
  
So, it won’t be too surprising to be reading headlines the end of the year screaming “2016 Hottest Year Ever”—but it’s probably too much to hope that the authors of the underlying story correctly attribute the cause. But, we’re sure their memory will be jogged, and they’ll be full of excuses, when the La Nina cooling sets in and post-El Nino temperatures drop below record levels in 2017 (and likely many years thereafter).   
  
Next up is a quick look at the updated numbers from the United Nations in regards to just how much global greenhouse gas emissions will be impacted if all nations of the world abide by the emissions reductions scheduled promised in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) that they submitted under the Paris Climate Agreement. There is only a slim possibility that these schedules will be adhered to—for instance, in the U.S., all indications are that we overpromised. Unkept promises aside, the U.N. reports that total global emissions of greenhouse gases will be 55.0 Gt (Metric gigatons) CO2eq (equivalent emissions scaling all greenhouse gas absorption to the value for carbon dioxide) in 2025 and 56.2 GtCO2eq in 2030.   
  
In the figure below, we superimpose those expectations on the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) depictions of business-as-usual (“baseline”) projections described by the IPCC as “projections of GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions and their key drivers as they might evolve in a future in which no explicit actions are taken to reduce GHG emissions.” It should be clear from this graph, that, as we have been fond of saying all along, the sum total of all the INDCs under the Paris Climate Agreement amounts to little more than business-as-usual expectations. But now, to make it look like everyone is “doing something” about climate change, the expected evolution of economic systems is being rebranded as “climate action.” Maybe that makes everyone feel better. In reality, only the US and the EU have proposed significant (and significantly expensive) reductions.

Next we turn to an enlightening piece by a team of analysts at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University examining the cumulative cost of government regulations—and it isn’t pretty. They calculate that that federal regulations retard economic growth in the U.S. by about 0.8% per year—or to the tune of a GDP that is $4 trillion less in 2012 than it would have been absent new regulation imposed since 1980, adding that “[i]f the cost of regulatory accumulation were a country, it could have the 4th largest GDP in the world.” Here is an excerpt from the summary:   




Using a 22-industry dataset that covers 1977 through 2012, the study finds that regulation—by distorting the investment choices that lead to innovation—has created a considerable drag on the economy, amounting to an average reduction in the annual growth rate of the US gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.8 percent.   
  
Federal regulations have accumulated over many decades, piling up over time. When regulators add more rules to the pile, analysts often consider the likely benefits and compliance costs of the additional rules.   
  
But regulations have a greater effect on the economy than analysis of a single rule in isolation can convey. The buildup of regulations over time leads to duplicative, obsolete, conflicting, and even contradictory rules, and the multiplicity of regulatory constraints complicates and distorts the decision-making processes of firms operating in the economy. Firms respond to both individual regulations and regulatory accumulation by altering their plans for research and development, for expansion, and for updating equipment and processes. Because of the important role innovation and productivity growth play in an economy, these distortions have consequences for the growth of the economy in the long run.   
  
Economic growth in the United States has, on average, been slowed by 0.8 percent per year since 1980 owing to the cumulative effects of regulation:   
  
● If regulation had been held constant at levels observed in 1980, the US economy would have been about 25 percent larger than it actually was as of 2012.   
  
● This means that in 2012, the economy was $4 trillion smaller than it would have been in the absence of regulatory growth since 1980.   
  
● This amounts to a loss of approximately $13,000 per capita, a significant amount of money for most American workers.



The gory details are provided in the full report authored by Bentley Coffey, Patrick A. McLaughlin, and Pietro Peretto.   
  
And, finally, before signing off, we want to make sure that if you are looking for _rational_ looks at the allegations of climate change-driven catastrophes in the news this week, you’ll know where to find them. Here is a good story from the A Chemist in Langley blog that throws water on the claims that anthropogenic climate change is behind Canada’s Ft. McMurray fire, and here’s some good background from the New Orleans Geological Society on the myriad of non-climate forces behind the drowning Isle de Jean Charles (telling the story that the _New York Times_ didn’t).   
  
You ought to have a look!

Our comment primarily concerns the use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Agriculture (USDA) in this Preliminary Affordability Determination. The SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide — two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions — at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses, and founded upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which encapsulate such large uncertainties as to provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnect between a climate change and the SCC value. Further, the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) cannot be supported by the mainstream climate science.



Until this situation can be properly rectified, the SCC should be barred from use in this and all other federal rulemaking. It is better not to include any value for the SCC in cost/​benefit analyses such as these, than to include a value which is knowingly improper, inaccurate and misleading.



Consequently, our overall recommendation is to remove any and all analyses in this Preliminary Affordability Determination — Energy Efficiency Standards that make reference to, or incorporate a value of, the social cost of carbon as determined by the federal Interagency Working Group according to its 2013 report.

"**A group of hardcore protesters threw petrol bombs at a police station as violence flared in Hong Kong during a banned march that drew tens of thousands.**
Authorities had refused permission for a march through an upmarket shopping area, citing public order concerns.
But large numbers defied that - and a small group of black-clad protesters later attacked a police station.
Hong Kong has been convulsed by pro-democracy protests for four months.
The unrest in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms, is its most serious crisis since the Britain handed it over in 1997.
At Tsim Sha Tsui police station, officers fired tear gas as the building's gate was set on fire. A water cannon was then deployed to clear the area, which would normally be thronged with Sunday shoppers.
In one controversial incident, a water cannon truck fired powerful jets of blue liquid at protesters outside a mosque.
Police said the water cannon had ""accidentally affected the entrance and front gate"" of the mosque.
The Muslim Council of Hong Kong said the mosque was not targeted by police, whose officers later apologised and helped with the clean-up effort.
Elsewhere, shops and Chinese banks were vandalised. A large blaze, started by protesters, engulfed the store of Chinese smartphone maker, Xiaomi, in the Mong Kok area.
Not all of Sunday's demonstrators engaged in violence. Although the rally was unauthorised, it began peacefully.
The anger of the crowd was partly fuelled by an attack on pro-democracy leader Jimmy Sham earlier this week which left him in hospital. He was set upon by five men with hammers in the Mong Kok district of Kowloon.
On Saturday, another man who was reportedly handing out pro-democracy flyers was stabbed.
In recent weeks, numbers attending protests have dropped from their peak. The movement has seen hundreds of thousands taking part in demonstrations on several occasions.
This Sunday's rally rivalled those numbers, according to organisers, who said around 350,000 people attended. Attendance figures from Hong Kong police are not yet available.
One protester, Daniel Yeung, said Sunday's turnout far exceeded his expectations, adding that ""Hong Kongers won't easily give up their right to demonstrate"".
""The government are now refusing to authorise any peaceful protest,"" another demonstrator named Avery said on Sunday. ""That means anyone who comes out will inherently be breaking the law. So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government is using.""
Originally, the protests were prompted by outrage at a new law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China.
People in Hong Kong are fiercely protective of their legal system and enhanced personal rights, which are governed under an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems"".
But they have grown increasingly concerned that China seeks greater control.
Hong Kong's leader eventually vowed to scrap the extradition bill, but the protest movement has broadened to include four other demands:
Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam is seen by many pro-democracy campaigners as a mouthpiece for Beijing â something she denies.
Ms Lam was forced to abandon her major annual speech in parliament this week after opposition lawmakers heckled her, brandishing banners and shouting slogans.
Her speech, calling for an end to the protests, eventually had to be delivered by pre-recorded video.
US lawmakers, meanwhile, have backed the pro-democracy movement by passing a bill in the House of Representatives supporting them.
American companies, including video game firm Blizzard and the National Basketball Association, have also found themselves embroiled in the political crisis."

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Climate and Health – Lancet: The British medical journal Lancet released what is billed as the most comprehensive study on the relationship between temperature extremes and human mortality. According to the abstract: “Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures.

“Methods: We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature-mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles.
“Findings: We analysed 74?225?200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71% (95% empirical CI 7·43-7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80-90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7·29%, 7·02-7·49) than by heat (0·42%, 0·39-0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86% (0·84-0·87) of total mortality.
“Interpretation: Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.”
The study was financed by the UK Medical Research Council.
These results (that about 20 times more deaths are associated with cold weather than hot weather) are not particularly surprising. For years independent scientists, such as those who participate in the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), have questioned mortality forecasts arising from the work presented by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and its claims of ever increasing temperatures.
The study focused on the temperate regions of the world, where most people live. Also of interest is that sub-optimal temperatures kill far more people than extreme temperatures. This indicates that the government focus on extreme events is misplaced. It is periods of cold or heat that should be the focus of public health officials.
No doubt, some Western governments are not pleased. They have placed enormous resources in “fighting global warming”, now called climate change due to the lack of 21st century warming. The study undermines the existence of many government programs and departments. Without the fear of increased mortality from global warming, taxpayers may begin to question those with political power, who exploit the fear of global warming/climate change.

SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD
THE JACKSON
The voting for SEPP’s annual April Fools Award is over. We thank all those who participated with nominees and votes. The winner of this close race will be announced at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness in Ontario, CA, from July 31 to August 2, 2015.
Climate and Health – USGCRP: As discussed in the April 18 and May 16 TWTWs, the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) released a draft for public review of its upcoming Climate & Health Assessment. The entire document has significant issues, including it is based on forecasts from climate models that have not been validated and it ignores the importance of public health measures in controlling infectious diseases. The study published in Lancet, discussed above, exposes further weaknesses of the assessment by USGCRP.
Figure ES7 of the report gives an estimated ten year (2004 to 2013) fatalities from extreme weather events in the U.S, as prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of the thirteen government entities comprising the USGCRP. The ranking of estimated deaths over the 10 year period from the listed weather events are as follows: Heat Wave, a little greater than 1200; Tornado, about 1100; Hurricane, about 1100; Floods between 700 and 800; Wind Storm, about 500; Lightning between 350 and 400; Cold waves less than 250; and Winter storms less than 250. The USGCRP findings on cold weather deaths are opposite to those in Lancet.
Those who have studied mortality tables for the US would recognize that the reported deaths from cold weather events make no sense – even before the publication of the Lancet report. Lightning kills more people in the US than Cold Waves or Winter Storms? The USGCRP and the thirteen government entities involved should immediately withdraw the report and publicly apologize for its publication, which, of course, will not happen. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy.

Respect: Using a graduation ceremony of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy as the venue, President Obama asserted an “urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change.” There is no issue with the need to adapt to climate change, which has been ongoing for well over a billion years, long before the advent of multi-cell creatures, much less humanity.
In spite of spending at least twenty billion dollars on climate science, this Administration has not significantly advanced our knowledge of the natural influences on climate, as reflected in government publications, such as those by the USGCRP. In short, the Administration is demanding we fight an enemy without understanding it. Yet, one of the maxims of military strategy is: “Know your enemy.”
Given to those who are about to become military officers, trained to be respectful of the Commander in Chief, the speech was more fitting for a political fund-raising event. The President, and his aides, are apparently unaware that respect must be mutual. Such ceremonies should not be considered as political opportunities. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy.

Return of the Iris? A 2001 hypothesis by Richard Lindzen, et al. is making its way back into the literature. The hypothesis was quickly dismissed by the authoritarian Climate Establishment, without being fully considered. The hypothesis suggests that there is a natural response in the atmosphere to a warming, whatever the cause, which reduces the warming – a negative feedback. Such a negative feedback would lessen fears of “run-away” global warming, etc.
The return of the Iris indicates that the Climate Establishment can no longer authoritatively dismiss hypotheses that are contrary to its own beliefs – an advancement in Climate Science. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – The Iris?

Flash-in-the-Pan – Missing Hot Spot Found? Based on highly manipulated data, a paper published in Environmental Research letters asserted that its authors found the missing “hot spot” – an area centered over the tropics at about 10 km in which a warming trend, whatever the cause, is more pronounced than at the surface. [Note: this is different than the temperatures being greater than at the surface.] Like the original hot spot, declared in the IPCC Second Assessment Report, it appears that no one, other than the authors, can find this recently re-discovered hot spot.
What is amusing about the entire affair is that few in the Climate Establishment bothered to report that the “so-called” distinct human fingerprint was missing, at least, until it was re-discovered. Now, will it remain unnoticed and missing, again? See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues.

Number of the Week: $5,000,000,000,000 per year. In the march to Paris for the 2015 (the 21st) Conference of Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) starting on November 30, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) used very creative accounting techniques to declare that fossil fuel subsidies amount to about $5,000,000,000,000 per year.
Of course, there is no accounting of the enormous benefits fossil fuel use provide Western Civilization and humanity. These appear to be beyond the imaginative accounting capabilities of the IMF. See links Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up.

1. Notable & Quotable: President Obama
‘Around the world, climate change increases the risk of instability and conflict.’
WSJ, May 20, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/notable…
From President Obama’s commencement address Wednesday at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.:
Around the world, climate change increases the risk of instability and conflict. Rising seas are already swallowing low-lying lands, from Bangladesh to Pacific islands, forcing people from their homes. Caribbean islands and Central American coasts are vulnerable, as well. Globally, we could see a rise in climate change refugees. And I guarantee you the Coast Guard will have to respond. Elsewhere, more intense droughts will exacerbate shortages of water and food, increase competition for resources, and create the potential for mass migrations and new tensions. All of which is why the Pentagon calls climate change a “threat multiplier.”
Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram. It’s now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East. So, increasingly, our military and our combatant commands, our services – including the Coast Guard – will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready.

2. The Real Denialism
“Climate change” has become an all-purpose excuse.
By James Taranto, WSJ, May 21, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rea…
[SUMMARY: The author brings up some of the key points in the President’s address to graduates of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, in asserting “”the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change.”
He rehearsed the litany of weather disasters supposedly caused by climate change: “more extreme storms,” “deeper droughts and longer wildfires,” flooding of streets in coastal cities. And he went further, blaming global warming for geopolitical problems:
Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram. It’s now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East. So, increasingly, our military and our combatant commands, our services – including the Coast Guard – will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready.
Even if one assumes all these assertions are true, they do not advance a case for urgent action. As the president acknowledged with that initial disclaimer, the chain of causation is just too weak. Global climate change contributes somehow to local droughts, which contribute somehow to instability, which contributes somehow to the rise of Boko Haram and rebellion in Syria (a rebellion, let us recall, for which the president briefly urged U.S. military support back in 2013). The vagueness of the hypotheses make it impossible to evaluate any proposed climate policy as a remedy for the Nigerian or Syrian conflicts.
The most telling assertion in the president’s speech was meant as a throwaway line. Immediately after setting up his some-folks-back-in-Washington straw man, Obama allowed as how “on a day like today, it’s hard to get too worried about it,” the antecedent being “climate change.” It was a cool spring day in New London, Conn.
But of course he does not. As with the weather, he presents “climate change” as a cause of all manner of bad effects but no good ones. In the geopolitical realm, it is an all-purpose excuse when things go wrong. It is logically little different from saying of a disaster, whether natural or man-made, “It was God’s will.” That statement is true if one accepts the underlying metaphysical theory, and it may provide comfort to those who do. But it is not an empirical explanation. It isn’t science.
Now of course weather isn’t the same thing as climate, as global warmists are quick to point out in fair weather. But that’s true of all weather. It is fallacious to attribute bad weather but not good weather to “climate change,” as if every day was idyllic everywhere on preindustrial Earth.
Similarly, if “climate change” is contributing to war and instability, it must also be contributing to peace and stability. Obama boasts of various foreign-policy achievements, such as the “end of the war” in Iraq and the diplomatic openings to Iran and Cuba. Stipulating for the sake of argument that these are in fact favorable developments, the logic of the president’s Coast Guard speech is that he must share the credit for them with all humans whose activities have contributed to climate change.
Obama’s denunciation of those who persist in “denying” global warmism is especially objectionable in light of his own denialism with regard to Islamic extremism. As we noted last August, the president insisted that the Islamic State, which is among the combatants in the Syrian war, “speaks for no religion. . . . No faith teaches people to massacre innocents.” Presumably he would say the same of Boko Haram (whose name means, roughly, “non-Islamic education violates Islamic law].

3. Schoolroom Climate Change Indoctrination
In one assignment, students measure the size of their family’s carbon footprint and suggest ways to shrink it.
By Paul Tice, WSJ, May 27, 2015 [H/t William Readdy]
http://www.wsj.com/articles/schoolr…
SUMMARY: After discussing the framework of kindergarten to 12th grade science education, approved by the National Research Council, the author discussed the ideological nature of the program: “by the end of Grade 5, students should appreciate that rising average global temperatures will affect the lives of all humans and other organisms on the planet. By Grade 8, students should understand that the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels is a major factor in global warming. And by Grade 12, students should know that global climate models are very effective in modeling, predicting and managing the current and future impact of climate change.”
Apparently, the Council is not bothered by the fact that temperatures have not been rising for over a decade, and there has been no empirical relationship established between atmospheric CO2 and global temperatures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Energy Department have their own Climate Literacy & Energy Awareness Network, or CLEAN.
According to the author: Relying on a climate-change curriculum and teaching materials largely sourced from federal agencies – particularly those of the current ideologically driven administration – raises a number of issues. Along with the undue authoritative weight that such government-produced documents carry in the classroom, most of the work is one-sided and presented in categorical terms, leaving no room for a balanced discussion. Moreover, too much blind trust is placed in the predictive power of long-range computer simulations, despite the weak forecasting track record of most climate models to date.
This is unfortunate because the topic of man-made global warming, properly taught, would present many teachable moments and provide an example of the scientific method in action. Precisely because the science of climate change is still just a theory, discussion would help to build student skills in critical thinking, argumentation and reasoning, which is the stated objective of the new K-12 science standards.
For instance: Why has the planet inconveniently stopped warming since the late 1990s even as carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise? How reliable are historical measurements of average global temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels when, before the 1950s, much of the data are interpolated from such diverse sources as weather balloons, kites, cloud observations, primordial tree rings and Antarctic ice bubbles?
How statistically significant is a 1.4-degree Fahrenheit increase in average global surface temperatures since 1880 for a 4.6 billion-year-old planet with multiple ecosystems and a surface area of some 200 million square miles? How dangerous is the current level of carbon dioxide in the world’s atmosphere, when 400 parts per million expressed as a percentage of the volume of the atmosphere would equate to only 0.04% or approximately zero?
Employing such a Socratic approach to teaching climate change would likely lead to a rational and thought-provoking classroom debate on the merits of the case. However, that is not the point of this academic exercise – which seems to be to indoctrinate young people by using K-12 educators to establish the same positive political feedback loop around global warming that has existed between the federal government and the nation’s colleges and universities for the past two decades.

4. Slaking California’s Thirst – if Politics Allows
Israel solved its water woes in five years by desalination. A CEO explains why it took him 10 years to build a single plant near San Diego.
By Allysia Finley, WSJ, May 15, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/slaking…
SUMMARY: The author compares the water situation in southern California with that of Israel, which, by the end of the year will complete “three massive desalination plants in Ashdod, Hadera and Sorek that combined are capable of producing 100 billion gallons of potable water each year from the sea. More such projects are in the works. Next year desalination will provide about half of Israel’s water – not including the roughly 80% of recycled wastewater that goes mainly to agriculture – up from zero in 2004 and about 10% in 2009. The drought ended in 2012, and Israel doesn’t need to worry much about the next one. In a mere five years, desalination has turned a scarce resource into a commodity that may soon be exportable.”
The bureaucratic effort in California is going to cutting consumption, and environmental groups are fighting efforts to build addition desalination plants, even as first plant in Carlsbad is nearing completion.

5. The Hole in the Rooftop Solar-Panel Craze
Large-scale plants make sense, but panels for houses simply transfer wealth from average electric customers.

Link to report: Going Solar in America: Ranking Solar’s Value to Consumers in America’s Largest Cities
By Jim Kennerly and Autumn Proudlove, NC Clean Energy Technology, No date
http://nccleantech.ncsu.edu/wp-cont…
SUMMARY: The author asserts that” Large-scale solar-power prices are falling because the cost to manufacture solar panels has been decreasing and because large solar installations permit economies of scale. Rooftop solar, on the other hand, often involves microinstallations in inefficient places, which makes the overall cost as much as 3½ times higher.”
The reasons for these inefficiencies are multiple, but “well-meaning – but ill-conceived – federal, state and local tax incentives for rooftop solar give back between 30% and 40% of the installation costs to the owner as a tax credit. But more problematic are hidden rate subsidies, the most significant of which is called net metering, which is available in 44 states. Net metering allows solar-system owners to offset on a one-for-one basis the energy they receive from the electric grid with the solar power they generate on their roof.”
“Increasingly, utilities across the country have been calling attention to the problems with rooftop solar. They’ve been urging the pursuit of large-scale solar and other renewables, the moderation of rooftop-solar subsidies, and a restructuring of electric rates to encourage new technologies. They’ve been vilified by armies of PR consultants armed with sound bites about how utilities want to kill solar.”
The cited study, financed by the Department of Energy, claims that in 46 of America’s 50 largest cities, a typically sized solar PV system is a better investment than the stock market. The rating system used in the study ranks New York City and Boston as # 1 and #2 in the US as places to “invest in” solar PV, well ahead far sunnier Oklahoma City (# 48) and Tulsa, OK, (# 49).

I also wonder how this paper would have fared if it had been submitted to Nature Climate Change (consensus enforcing), rather than Nature Geoscience (which seems to do a good job editorially).”

"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Sardar Hussain refused to believe it. He had been orphaned in Afghanistan by a Taliban bomb at age 13. After waiting in limbo for two years, he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees. Mustafa did believe it. He teared up, saying his life was over at age 28. An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip. When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban, Alwia Abdullah, 43, who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children, got a sudden, stabbing pain in her gut, and couldn’t sleep. “We left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,” she said. “So to be discriminated against by a U. S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?” They were among an estimated 110, 000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year. In fact, they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and, after years of waiting, were on the verge of having their hopes realized. Now, all are suddenly, indefinitely waiting again, barred from entry to the United States for at least four months, according to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, with no assurances of what could happen to them next. The order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. ” “We don’t want them here,” he said at the Pentagon. “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. ” The executive order calls for the United States’ annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50, 000, compared with 85, 000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016. Even last year’s figure was dwarfed by the historically high number of displaced people in the world, 65 million, or by the more than 1. 5 million migrants and refugees arriving in European countries since 2014. Mr. Trump’s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival “detrimental to the interests of the United States. ” Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Asked about Mr. Trump’s refugee ban, Stéphane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped “it’s a temporary one. ” He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before. “The U. S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U. N. works with,” he said. Mr. Trump’s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon. For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week. Faten Diab, 34, a former charity worker from Syria, said she had been told that she and her family would be among a relatively small number of Syrians allowed into the United States. Last year, only 10, 000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40, 000 in Canada. Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day. Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple’s    daughter could be heard playing in the background. “We are so, so, so sad,” Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump’s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. “The process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn’t live the application steps in all its difficulties. ” Strictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world’s “huddled masses yearning to breathe free. ” But in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump’s proscribed list. Laith   37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from   militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg. “Please Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,” he said. “Don’t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us. ” Mustafa, the    Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: “I made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity. ” But   militias in his neighborhood discovered what his job had been and accused him of treason. “I was beaten and shot and knifed and eventually came to Lebanon two years ago,” he said, during an interview arranged in Beirut by the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New   legal aid group. After years of interviews and investigation, Mustafa said he was finally told to take his medical examination and now only needed to be given the date for his flight, to California. To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a   Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. “I would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn’t take anything else with me, not even my memories,” he said. Mustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why  —   like most of the refugees interviewed for this article  —   he did not want his full name published. “If I do get rejected,” he said, “I’d regret ever having shaken hands with an American. ” He struggled not to weep. Sardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief. He said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7, 000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday. “We were given a commitment to go there,” he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam. Firas   23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State’s de facto capital. He was still looking for answers. “Is Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?” he asked. “ISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one. ” Sara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats  —   the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television  —   was trying to arrive at answers of her own. “You just wait,” she said. “You see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting. ” After three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly. Now her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration’s   refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted. “The bitter truth,” she said, “is that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn’t have even the slightest idea what it’s like to live as a refugee. ”"

Recall how the effort in the US of some 20 attorneys general to silence climate skeptics backfired. In the story the attorney generals wanted to go after oil companies and think tanks because the scientific views they held differed from their own.

Public domain image
Well, in Europe it is not just a group of activist attorneys general who are calling for silencing dissent, but the EU itself!
According to Deutsche Wirtschaftsnachrichten – DWN – (German Business News), “The EU is planning penalties for parties that do not represent ‘the values of the EU“.
The move is apparently in response to the rising wave of right wing parties currently sweeping across Europe – especially Austria, which saw a right wing figure almost winning national Presidential elections last Sunday. Europe’s established parties are spooked, and they aren’t coping well with growing opposition and voter dissatisfaction. Their latest solution: to punish it.
A number of EU parliament leaders apparently believe that political parties should not provide a platform for citizens to express their dissatisfaction with failing EU policies. The proposal has been floated by the EU socialists, led by EU Parliament President Martin Schulz and Denmark’s Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The aim, according to DWN, is to prevent “rightwing radical or foreigner-hostile” being represented in the EU Parliament.
Of course the exclusion of radicalism always appears to be a noble cause at first glance, but achieving it by regulation as some leading WU parliamentarians are proposing opens up very dangerous doors to abuse. It would be the first major step to dictating speech and opinion, and that on a continent that likes to claim it protects.  The move would be a threat to anyone holding a different opinion on controversial EU issues like energy, fiscal policy, social orientation, economics and immigration.
Skeptics of climate science could be targeted
The proposal reveals the EU’s growing discomfort with the democratically and legitimately led opposition. Brussels is in fact (unwittingly) sending a terrible message: Democracy is okay, but only if you agree with us. That’s arrogance, and it should be no surprise voters are punishing the established politicians by voting against them. These people seem to think dissenters are need of upbringing.

Deny funding to parties
The proposal calls for punishing political parties that don’t conform to EU norms by denying them EU party funding. Parties would only get money if they agreed with the opinions of the money givers.
Fortunately, many established politicians, even Green ones, are able to see the plan for what it is, and are against it. EU Green parliamentarian Nicholas Villumsen told: “That would be like the Parliament imposing penalties against parties with wrong opinions. It is very worrisome that the European Parliament wishes to punish parties for their views,” the DWN quotes.
So it starts. What’s next?
Punishing the Catholic Church for its views on gay marriage and abortion?
The fining of climate “deniers”?
The DWN comments:
In fact such a regulation is very dangerous. It opens the door and gate to pressure opinion. […] In a tense crisis climate, EU critics could be forcibly silenced with such an EU rule. The right to freedom of expression can be suppressed with such a regulation. […]
The enforcement of belief to ‘values’ is undemocratic.
It is the first step to a totalitarian system.”
Obviously for the socialists in power in Brussels, that is precisely the idea. They can’t win the debates on the merits of their arguments, so they resort to the very radical right-wing type authoritarian measures they proclaim to fear and from which we need to be protected.

Uh, oh…It’s about to become more about the people behind the letter, than the letter itself.

Now all we need is a steamy potboiler novel and some internal investigations and it could be Rajenda Pachauri all over again.
The big story at Climate Audit this week (see Shukla’s Gold) is about the twenty authors of the letter demanding that climate skeptics be put on trial, and in particular the man pushing the letter, Jagadish Shukla, seems to be getting quite prosperous with all that Koch Brothers money Oil Money public money he gets sent his way. Steve McIntyre writes:
In 2001, the earliest year thus far publicly available, in 2001, in addition to his university salary (not yet available, but presumably about $125,000), Shukla and his wife received a further $214,496  in compensation from IGES (Shukla -$128,796; Anne Shukla – $85,700).  Their combined compensation from IGES doubled over the next two years to approximately $400,000 (additional to Shukla’s university salary of say $130,000), for combined compensation of about $530,000 by 2004.
Shukla’s university salary increased dramatically over the decade reaching $250,866 by 2013 and $314,000 by 2014.  (In this latter year, Shukla was paid much more than Ed Wegman, a George Mason professor of similar seniority). Meanwhile, despite the apparent transition of IGES to George Mason, the income of the Shuklas from IGES continued to increase, reaching $547,000 by 2013.  Combined with Shukla’s university salary,  the total compensation of Shukla and his wife exceeded $800,000 in both 2013 and 2014.  In addition, as noted above, Shukla’s daughter continued to be employed by IGES in 2014; IGES also distributed $100,000 from its climate grant revenue to support an educational charity in India which Shukla had founded.
But it seems Shukla doesn’t like people looking into that, because the letter seems to have been disappeared from the IGES website. I’ve confirmed this over 24 hours and several search techniques. What was once visible to search engines, is no more:

The original link that no longer works: http://www.iges.org/letter/LetterPresidentAG.pdf

The letter survives on the Wayback Machine here:

And here is the letter as a single image, with page 1 and 2 combined from the PDF:

Bishop Hill notes:
You can imagine the horror on the signatories’ faces when they realised that some very determined people were about to take a close interest in their financial arrangements and those of their colleagues at IGES.
I’m not sure taking the letter down is going to help much though.
The Streisand effect has been unleashed Mr. Shukla, enjoy the ride.

"LOS ANGELES  —   When “Zoot Suit” first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978, little about the production screamed hit. Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to   audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, “Zoot Suit” moved to New York’s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a   version, which was released in 1982. “We had no idea any of this would happen, man,” he said. “It was like this huge explosion. ” On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of “Zoot Suit” begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater’s   season. A fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, “Zoot Suit” features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache) and “The Press,” a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis’s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry’s parents. “I got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,” Daniel Valdez said. “Coming back to it is a little like coming home. ” In the intervening years, Latino playwrights, from Cherrie Moraga to Luis Alfaro, have made their mark on American theater. Karen Zacarias started the Young Playwrights’ Theater in 1995 in 2003, Nilo Cruz became the first Latino to win a Pulitzer for drama. Then there’s   Miranda. But no other Latino play has had the cultural impact of “Zoot Suit,” not to mention its influence on generations of subsequent Latino playwrights. On a recent morning, the cast rehearsed a scene set in a Los Angeles dance hall. Several men wore   trousers, long watch chains dangling from their belts the women sported   tights and sneakers. The men were strutting, the women spinning, but when a rival gang arrived, colorful curses flew, then fists, and before you knew it, the switchblades were out. El Pachuco snapped his fingers, stopping time just as Henry was about to cut his rival’s throat. “That’s exactly what the play needs right now,” he said. “Two more Mexicans killing each other. ” The relevance of this scene in the Trump era isn’t lost on the cast and crew. Much of the play focuses on how   are vilified in the United States as violent criminals and perpetual outsiders  —   “this ain’t your country,” El Pachuco tells Henry early on. “That was part of the reason I felt that I had to be in this production,” said Demián Bichir, the   actor who plays El Pachuco. “There couldn’t be a better opportunity for the arts to respond to so much nonsense and ignorance and stupidity. ” (When not acting, Mr. Bichir, who is Mexican, is an American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador for immigration rights.) For Luis Valdez, mixing the political and the theatrical is nothing new. Dressed all in black, his voice a rich baritone, he recalled the years that led up to “Zoot Suit. ” In 1965, he founded El Teatro Campesino, a theater troupe and “cultural arm” of Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers. The group staged   skits, which he wrote and directed, in halls and on the backs of flatbed trucks. After the troupe left the farm workers’ group in 1967, Mr. Valdez continued to write plays that examined the Chicano experience, including “Bandito!” and “I Don’t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges!” “I call him the father of contemporary Chicano theater,” said Jorge Huerta, who wrote the book “Chicano Theater: Themes and Forms. ” “Not only did he found the Teatro Campesino, the teatro inspired other teatros, an entire movement from the West Coast to the Midwest all the way to the Dakotas. ” In 1977, Mr. Valdez met with Gordon Davidson, who was the director of the Taper then, about creating something for its New Theater for Now series. He arrived clutching a pamphlet about the Sleepy Lagoon murder that he had gotten years earlier from David Sanchez, the founder of the   organization the Brown Berets. “He essentially gave me carte blanche,” he said. Mr. Valdez set to work on the play, combining elements of Aztec mythology (Tezcatlipoca’s    colors, for example, mirror El Pachuco’s zoot suit) prison letters from the defendants culled from U. C. L. A. Library’s special collections department and court transcripts. In one courtroom sequence from the 1982 film, a police officer testifies that pachucos have an “inborn” tendency for violence inherited from “the bloodthirsty Aztecs. ” “I took that from the transcripts,” Mr. Valdez said. “I didn’t invent that stuff. That wasn’t agitprop. ” “The Second Zoot Suit Riot begins,” an ad in a local newspaper declared in 1978. “That was probably hatched right here in this office,” Mr. Valdez laughed. “But there was a rush for tickets, so in that sense, it was a riot. A good riot. An artistic riot. ” The play helped start the career of Edward James Olmos, who played El Pachuco in Los Angeles and on Broadway, as well as in the film. Mr. Valdez soon shifted his focus to movies as well  —   his 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic “La Bamba” was both a critical and   hit  —   but he’s still best known for “Zoot Suit,” which broke Los Angeles theater records for ticket sales during its first run. The Taper, which also hosted the world premiere productions of “Angels in America” and “Children of a Lesser God,” hopes to create a similar buzz this time around. Univision and Hoy sponsored a party at the theater to celebrate the first day of ticket sales, complete with   dancers and live swing music. The AltaMed Art Collection in Los Angeles is lending art that will be on display in the theater lobby. Strong sales have prompted the Taper to extend the show’s   run another week, through March 19 even after adding the additional shows, 35 high school groups remain on a waiting list to see special student matinees. “We do   shows a year, and you can feel the excitement among the staff about having this show rehearse in our building,” said Michael Ritchie, artistic director of the Center Theater Group, which includes the Taper. “You can feel the buzz in the hallways. ” Those hallways aren’t far from many places, historic and infamous, brought to life in the play. Los Angeles’s Hall of Justice, where the young men were tried and convicted, is two blocks away flash points of the riots erupted in the area. “Some of the riots actually took place very near where we’re rehearsing,” Daniel Valdez said. “Temple and Main, right down the street. ” A big difference between this production and the 1978 one is the level of the cast’s experience. “In those days, there weren’t many Latinos looking for a career in theater, so we were working with a lot of   actors,” Daniel Valdez added. “We had people who had never really been onstage. Now, watching the casting calls and the dance auditions, they’re absolutely amazing. ” The nationwide call drew 800 actors for 25 parts, and most cast members have backgrounds in film and TV. Mr. Bichir (“The Hateful Eight,” “Weeds”) a star in his native Mexico before coming to Los Angeles, was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 2011 film “A Better Life” Jeanine Mason, a   actor and dancer from Miami who plays Della, was the youngest competitor to win the Fox series “So You Think You Can Dance. ” Though the play was written in 1978 and set in 1942, Mr. Valdez feels its story is timeless, its themes part of an   historical cycle. He traces lines from the   internment camps to the Zoot Suit Riots, from Black Lives Matter to the vilification of Muslims. “And now the Mexicans are getting it again, thanks to Trump,” he said. “It’s like the closing of a complete circle. ” At a table reading between dance rehearsals, Mr. Bichir and Tom G. McMahon had questions for Mr. Valdez about how to tackle their roles as El Pachuco and the Press. In many ways, they’re more archetypes than people, jumping in and out of the action at will. The challenge, Mr. Valdez said, is finding the human in the trickster spirit. The play presents lots of similar challenges for audiences. “My play has the same relationship to a normal realistic play as a zoot suit has to a normal suit,” Mr. Valdez said. “It’s different. The lengths are longer. There’s more fabric. But it’s very cool! And I think that’s part of the appeal. ”"

If the only tool you have is a hammer, it’s tempting to treat everything as a nail. Thus, most people in the technically‐​oriented Bitcoin community treat the specter of mining centralization as a problem to be solved chiefly by technical means. However, a substantial cause of mining centralization is Chinese government policy, which distorts the digital currency mining market. There are creative arguments that China is violating its international trade obligations. Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.



In international trade, “dumping” is a predatory pricing tactic in which manufacturers from one country export a product to another country at a price either below the price charged at home, or below its cost of production. Dumping seeks to kill off competition in the importing country, so firms in the exporting country can raise prices to supranormal levels.



Something like dumping is recognizable in the world of bitcoin mining, where the advantages Chinese firms have in chip fabrication link up with access to deeply discounted, government‐​provided energy to produce an unusually strong mining industry. As a result, China’s mining community has a high percentage of the world’s hash power, and miners elsewhere, such as KnCMiner in Sweden, have gone bankrupt.



 _Bitcoin Magazine_ recently reported that chip maker and miner, Bitmain, is building a major data center complex in the northwest of China to focus on Bitcoin. Its location, Xinjang, is ideal because of its cold, dry climate and “access to government‐​supported, low cost wind and solar electricity.”



The World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) details what subsidies are subject to challenge by WTO members and on what terms. Cheap, government‐​supplied energy is a subsidy. According to the terms of the agreement it is: (i) a financial contribution; (ii) by a government or any public body within the territory of a member; (iii) that confers a benefit.





Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.



Subsidies must also be “specific.” If a subsidy is widely available, it is presumed not to distort the allocation of resources. But if a government subsidy targets particular companies, sectors of the economy, regions or exports, that subsidy runs afoul of the rules.



China’s hydropower glut almost certainly didn’t originate to bolster a bitcoin mining industry that wasn’t conceivable when the dams were built. But Chinese power subsidizes mining all the same, and it doesn’t just cause economic dislocation. It undercuts Bitcoin’s security. A blockchain system maintained by entities within a single government’s jurisdiction is at greater risk of political manipulation and censorship.



The SCM delineates two types of subsidies: prohibited and actionable. Subsidies designed to directly affect trade and thus adversely affect other WTO members are prohibited. Actionable subsidies are those that may be shown to cause adverse effects to other WTO members. When goods are at issue, subsidies can be challenged either through multilateral dispute settlement, or through countervailing action. Subsidies for services are subject to “consultations,” according to WTO rules. The Trade in Services Agreement now being hammered out in Geneva might be expanded to explicitly bar subsidies for digital currency mining, or data processing generally.



As a category buster, bitcoin and other digital currencies can be a poor fit with the traditional rules governing international trade. Anti‐​dumping law and the SCM apply only to trade in goods. The new bitcoins created with each block are arguably goods, even if they take digital form. The rest of the mining process is best thought of as providing transaction‐​inclusion services for digital currency users. When new bitcoins are no longer being created, mining will be a pure financial and data processing service.



Bitcoin transactions also don’t generally have a “location.” This means inclusion of any particular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is not easily proven to be a subsidized service to a consumer outside China, and Bitcoin transactions within China are subsidized to the same degree as transactions outside the country. Countervailing measures such as tariffs would be very hard to administer.



On the other hand, given the global trade and large proportion of Bitcoin transactions among users outside of China, bitcoins as goods and mining as transaction‐​inclusion services are clearly being provided to consumers outside China. These are exports, even though the precise place of purchase or location of service may be ambiguous.



Bitcoin’s basis in math makes the case for wrongful subsidies much easier. The power consumption bitcoin mining requires and the hash power available to various mining groups is readily calculable, so it’s quite easy to measure the substantial benefits Chinese bitcoin miners enjoy from being given cheap power.



If China were to build transmission lines that delivered energy more evenly across its economy, the argument that it was subsidizing its bitcoin mining industry would evaporate. The Chinese government may have international trade obligations that require it to withdraw the substantial benefit it now confers on its domestic bitcoin mining industry. Technological measures — such as, restraining blocksize limit, or fine tuning to reduce the amount of bandwidth it takes to propagate new blocks — are not the only tools in the Bitcoin community’s toolbox.

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   




Climate change denial in public discourse may encourage climate scientists to over-emphasize scientific uncertainty and is also affecting how they themselves speak -- and perhaps even think -- about their own research.



Lewandowsky and Oreskes fret:   




The idea that 'global warming has stopped' has been promoted in contrarian blogs and media articles for many years, and ultimately the idea of a 'pause' or 'hiatus' has become ensconced in the scientific literature, including in the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).



The _Science Daily_ article continues:   




Recent warming has been slower than the long term trend, but this fluctuation differs little from past fluctuations in warming rate, including past periods of more rapid than average warming. Crucially, on previous occasions when decadal warming was particularly rapid, the scientific community did not give short-term climate variability the attention it has now received, when decadal warming was slower. During earlier rapid warming there was no additional research effort directed at explaining 'catastrophic' warming. By contrast, the recent modest decrease in the rate of warming has elicited numerous articles and special issues of leading journals.   
  
This asymmetry in response to fluctuations in the decadal warming trend likely reflects what the study's authors call the 'seepage' of contrarian claims into scientific work.



And according the Lewandowsky, this is a problem because:   




""It seems reasonable to conclude that the pressure of climate contrarians has contributed, at least to some degree, to scientists re-examining their own theory, data and models, even though all of them permit -- indeed, expect -- changes in the rate of warming over any arbitrarily chosen period.""   
  
So why might scientists be affected by contrarian public discourse? The study argues that three recognised psychological mechanisms are at work: 'stereotype threat', 'pluralistic ignorance' and the 'third-person effect'.   
  
'Stereotype threat' refers to the emotional and behaviour responses when a person is reminded of an adverse stereotype against a group to which they belong. Thus, when scientists are stereotyped as 'alarmists', a predicted response would be for them to try to avoid seeming alarmist by downplaying the degree of threat. Several studies have indeed shown that scientists tend to avoid highlighting risks, lest they be seen as 'alarmist'.   
  
'Pluralistic ignorance' describes the phenomenon which arises when a minority opinion is given disproportionate prominence in public debate, resulting in the majority of people incorrectly assuming their opinion is marginalised. Thus, a public discourse that asserts that the IPCC has exaggerated the threat of climate change may cause scientists who disagree to think their views are in the minority, and they may therefore feel inhibited from speaking out in public.   
  
Research shows that people generally believe that persuasive communications exert a stronger effect on others than on themselves: this is known as the 'third-person effect'. However, in actual fact, people tend to be more affected by persuasive messages than they think. This suggests the scientific community may be susceptible to arguments against climate change even when they know them to be false.



We humbly assert that Lewandowsky, Oreskes, and colleagues have this completely backwards.   
  
When global warming was occurring faster than climate models expected during the 1990s, there was little effort by the mainstream climate science community to look into why, despite plenty of skeptic voices (such as our own) pointing to the influence of natural variability. Instead, headlines proclaimed “Global warming worse than expected,” which fueled the human-caused climate change hysteria (favored by the 1990s White House) and helped build the push for calls to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. But since the late 1990s, there has been no statistically significant warming trend in the highly-cited HadCRU4 temperature record, and both the RSS and UAH satellite records are now in their 21st consecutive year without a significant trend. This behavior contrasted with, and called into question, the veracity of climate model projections. And it was these projections upon which rested the case for a dangerous human influence on the climate. Again, skeptic voices were raised in objection to the mainstream view of climate change and the need for government intervention. But this time, the skeptic voices were accompanied by data that clearly showed that rather than “worse than expected,” climate change was actually proceeding at a quite modest pace.   
  
It was only then, with the threat of losing support for actions to mitigate climate change—actions that a top U.N. climate official, Christine Figueres, described as an effort “to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history” —that the mainstream climate community started to pay attention and began investigating the “hiatus” or “pause”—the words so despised by Lewandowsky and Oreskes.   
  
Through these research efforts, we have learned a lot about the role of natural variability in the broader climate system and how such variability impacts of projections of human-caused climate change (such as through a better understanding of the equilibrium climate sensitivity—how much warming results from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration).   
  
In other words, science has been moved forward, propelled by folks who didn’t take the mainstream climate science at face value, and instead questioned it—i.e., Lewandowsky’s and Oreskes’ “deniers.”   
  
The outcome of all of this is, in fact, the opposite of what Lewandowsky and Oreskes assert has occurred. Rather than “skeptic” ideas “seeping” into science and leading to a false narrative, skeptic ideas instead have spurred new research and therefore new knowledge. Such was not the case when skeptics were being shut out. The only thing different now vs. 20 years ago, is that this time around, the existence of a profoundly inconvenient truth (a “hiatus” in global warming) gave public credence to the skeptics which forced them to be taken seriously by the scientific consensus-keepers. Incontrovertible evidence that threatened to tear down the meme of climate alarmism clearly required some sort of response.   
  
Science is biased not by the inclusion of skeptical voices, but rather the exclusion of them.   
  
In fact, this week, we announced the framework for an investigation into the existence of such bias.   
  
We teamed with Dr. David Wojick to produce a Cato Working Paper titled “Is the Government Buying Science or Support? A Framework Analysis of Federal Funding-induced Biases” we describe:   




The purpose of this report is to provide a framework for doing research on the problem of bias in science, especially bias induced by Federal funding of research. In recent years the issue of bias in science has come under increasing scrutiny, including within the scientific community. Much of this scrutiny is focused on the potential for bias induced by the commercial funding of research. However, relatively little attention has been given to the potential role of Federal funding in fostering bias. The research question is clear: does biased funding skew research in a preferred direction, one that supports an agency mission, policy or paradigm?



An interested reader may want to review the fifteen bias-inducing scientific practices that we identify and compare them with the “three recognised psychological mechanisms” that Lewandowsky and Oreskes assert are at work to see which seem to make the most sense.   
  
Essentially, our project seeks to determine if the dog is wagging the tail. Lewandowsky and Oreskes propose the tail is wagging the dog.   
  
Hopefully, in the not too distant future, we’ll be able to report back what we find in our investigations. We’ll be surprised if we find that exclusionary practices drive science forward more efficiently than inclusive ones!

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
Dr. Roy Spencer introduced the updated and much corrected UAH atmospheric temperature data in his blog post Version 6.0 of the UAH Temperature Dataset Released: New LT Trend = +0.11 C/decade.  The new temperature anomaly data for the lower troposphere, mid troposphere and lower stratosphere are presently in beta form for comment. That is, they’re not official…yet.  I suspect the update will not go over well with the catastrophic-anthropogenic-global-warming crowd.  Links to the version 6.0 beta data are at the bottom of Roy’s post, which also contains a detailed discussion of the updates.  So if you have questions, please ask them at Roy Spencer’s blog through the above link.  This post is a simple data presentation.
The version 6.0 beta temperature anomaly data for the lower troposphere used in this post are here.
In this post, we’ll take a quick look at the new UAH version 6.0 beta lower troposphere temperature anomaly data, comparing it to:

the current UAH version 5.6 data
the RSS lower troposphere temperature data.

But first…
BASED ON LINEAR TRENDS, THE NEW UAH LOWER TROPOSPHERE TEMPERATURE DATA SHOW NO WARMING FOR 18+ YEARS, LIKE RSS 
For Figure 1, I’ve extended the new UAH version 6.0 beta and the RSS lower troposphere temperature anomaly data as far back in time as they could go while showing no warming based on their linear trends.  The new UAH data show no warming for 219 months, and for the RSS data, it’s 220 months.

Figure 1
A QUICK OVERVIEW OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE TEMPERATURE DATA
The following is a reprint of the initial discussion of lower troposphere temperature data from the monthly updates. The most recent update is here.
Special sensors (microwave sounding units) aboard satellites have orbited the Earth since the late 1970s, allowing scientists to calculate the temperatures of the atmosphere at various heights above sea level.  The level nearest to the surface of the Earth is the lower troposphere. The lower troposphere temperature data include the altitudes of zero to about 12,500 meters, but are most heavily weighted to the altitudes of less than 3000 meters.  See the left-hand cell of the illustration here.  The lower troposphere temperature data are calculated from a series of satellites with overlapping operation periods, not from a single satellite. The monthly UAH lower troposphere temperature data is the product of the Earth System Science Center of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). UAH provides the data broken down into numerous subsets.  See the webpage here [version 5.6 data].  The UAH lower troposphere temperature data are supported by Christy et al. (2000) MSU Tropospheric Temperatures: Dataset Construction and Radiosonde Comparisons.  Additionally, Dr. Roy Spencer of UAH presents at his blog the monthly UAH TLT data updates a few days before the release at the UAH website.  Those posts are also cross posted at WattsUpWithThat.  UAH uses the base years of 1981-2010 for anomalies. The UAH lower troposphere temperature data are for the latitudes of 85S to 85N, which represent more than 99% of the surface of the globe.
UAH VERSION 5.6 VERSUS UAH VERSION 6.0 BETA
Figure 2 compares the current version 5.6 UAH lower troposphere temperature anomaly data to the recently released version 6.0 beta. The comparisons start in the Januarys of 1979, 1998 and 2001 and run through March 2015.  The first full year of the UAH lower troposphere temperature data is 1979, while 1998 and 2001 are commonly used as start years during discussions of the recent slowdown in global surface and global lower troposphere temperatures. They are the same time periods we present in the monthly surface and lower troposphere temperature anomaly updates.  See the most recent update here.

Figure 2
Since 1979, the new version (v6.0 beta) of the UAH lower troposphere temperature data show a noticeably lower warming rate than current version 5.6 data.  For the periods starting in 1998 and 2001, the new beta version data show cooling of the lower troposphere based on the linear trends, while the current 5.6 version data show warming.
RSS VERSUS UAH VERSION 6.0 BETA
The warming rate since 1979 for the new UAH data is slightly less than (basically the same as) the lower troposphere temperature anomaly data from RSS. The shorter term cooling rates since 1998 and 2001 are also comparable.  See the graphs in Figure 3.

Figure 3
CLOSING
The RSS lower troposphere temperature data used to be an outlier, showing much lower trends than the surface temperature data and the UAH lower troposphere data. That will no longer be the case with the new UAH version 6.0 data.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRemember how in the late 1990s/early 2000s the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was made to disappear, and it was claimed that it was mainly a local, North Atlantic phenomenon.
Unfortunately for those trumpeting this claim, a comprehensive worldwide survey of scientific literature is now showing that the MWP was in fact a global phenomenon, suggesting large-scale natural cycles are what is really driving the climate.
=================================
Charting the Medieval Warm Period In The Southern Hemisphere
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The plotting of the Medieval Warm Period Map is making good progress. At first the basic idea was the Southern Hemisphere because of the notion that Medieval Warm Period (MWP) could be limited only to the Northern Hemisphere, mainly the North Atlantic, kept popping up. The collection of data for Africa, Antarctica, Australian and Oceania is now finished and it shows that the MWP was prominent.
In South America the data have been recorded foremost in the northwest part. The rest will soon follow.
The online data chart is here. 
The color code is as follows: red = warm MWP, blue = cold MWP, yellow = dry, green = wet. Here the precipitation code is shown only when there is no temperature information.
Over the last weeks the charting has been focused on the Mediterranean region, Arabia and the Caspian Sea. Once these regions are finished, the focus will move to northwards into Europe.
Recently studies from Switzerland and Austria were added. The MWP was uniformly hot and dry in this region:

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Geomar Research Center recently published a press release (see below) concerning the latest on the Gulf Stream. Hat-tip: DkS.
Some leading scientists have claimed that melting Greenland glaciers due to “man-made global warming” will lead to a disruption of the Gulf Stream and cause the North Atlantic region’s climate to change dramatically. However, the latest computer simulations show this scenario may be delayed.
=====================================================
Breathing space for the Gulf Stream
Scientists calculate the fate of the Greenland meltwater
20 June 2016/Kiel. The salinity of the waters around Greenland plays an important role in driving the Gulf Stream. There are concerns that a progressive freshening by the increasing ice losses from the Greenland ice sheet could influence and weaken the current system.
New model calculations conducted by an international research team suggest, however, that a large fraction of this meltwater is effectively removed from the most sensitive areas by swift, narrow boundary currents, delaying the influence on the Gulf Stream. The study is published today in the international journal Nature Geoscience.
Greenland’s glaciers are melting. Recent work by researchers at the University of Bristol found a 50% increase in the freshwater flux since 1990. Due to both enhanced summer melt and calving of outlet glaciers more than 5000 cubic kilometers of extra meltwater have been flowing into the sea, equivalent to a quarter of the volume of the Baltic Sea. The fate of this freshwater is of great importance for the system of ocean currents in the North Atlantic, which is governed by the density of the waters surrounding Greenland. A reduction in the water density especially in the Labrador Sea due an increased influx of freshwater could ultimately lead to a weakening of the current system, including the Gulf Stream.

Using a newly developed computer model, an international team of scientists led by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has now simulated in detail the pathways and effects of the additional meltwater. “The effects of the melting Greenland glaciers initially remain smaller than expected, since a large part of the meltwater is effectively flushed out by fast, narrow currents along the coastline of North America. Thus changes in the critical, northern seas are delayed”, explains GEOMAR researcher Prof. Claus Böning, lead author of the study.
The computer model takes into account the regional differences in meltwater discharge trends and very fine details of the ocean currents. This fine detail allowed the researchers to assess more accurately the influences of the narrow boundary currents and small-scale eddies on the water exchange between the coastal shelf and the deep ocean.
The model calculations showed that more than half of the meltwater is transported southwards along the Canadian coast by the Labrador Current. Less than 20 percent remain in the area between Greenland and Labrador which is critical for the Gulf Stream system. The model suggests that the melting-induced impact on ocean salinity is, to date, only half as large as natural variations measured in the past decades.
However, the simulation also shows a progressive trend in the freshening of the Labrador Sea. “If we project the rise in Greenland melting rates into the future, we expect first noticeable changes in the Labrador Sea in two or three decades”, emphasizes Professor Böning, “in this sense the Gulf Stream may just get some breathing space”. “Meltwater fluxes from Greenland have been accelerating in recent years and if, as seems likely, this trend continues we could see changes in ocean circulation even sooner” explains co-author Jonathan Bamber, Professor at the University of Bristol.

"DURHAM, N. C.  —   As North Carolina State’s star freshman, Dennis Smith Jr.   down Coach K Court one last time on Monday night to put an exclamation point on the Wolfpack’s   upset of the Blue Devils, many sports fans received an opportunity to take up one of their favorite pastimes: hating Duke. For Duke students and supporters, the reaction to the program’s first loss to N. C. State at Cameron Indoor Stadium since 1995  —   before some of them were born  —   was different. “It was a really tough one,” Richard Liu, a senior who attended the game, wrote in an email, “because N. C. State is a team we really should have beaten, especially at home. ” It has been a rare year of disappointments for Duke. The Blue Devils began the season at No. 1 but lost the top ranking before Thanksgiving. At times, they have been without their best player, Grayson Allen (suspended for tripping an opponent) several promising freshmen from their   recruiting class (injuries) and their Hall of Fame Coach, Mike Krzyzewski (lost to a back operation this month, and still out). Those misfortunes, of course, mean it has also been a rare year of schadenfreude for many outside Duke. But perhaps there is something to be said for what Duke offers its fans. At a time when entire segments of the country have retreated into private echo chambers of elation or fear, sports is not a terrible place to try to put oneself in another’s shoes. Call it sympathy for the Blue Devils. “Imagine how you’d feel if you’d gone to school there or if you played there,” said Jay Bilas, an ESPN commentator who played for Duke in the 1980s and later was an assistant coach for the Blue Devils. “Like, it’s a blast. ” It is true that other fan bases  —   almost all of them, actually  —   are more in need of a   . Since 1985  —   the year the N. C. A. A. tournament expanded to 64 teams and college basketball began its climb to the status of national spectacle  —   Duke has been the country’s most successful program, with 12 Final Four appearances and five national titles. In recent years, at least, it has also been the most popular, according to the Harris Poll. Other polarizing teams’ pitches to casual fans are aggressively inclusive witness the Yankees’ rechristening as America’s team after the Sept. 11 attacks or the Dallas Cowboys’ gargantuan Xanadu, ATT Stadium. But Duke, a tidy private university ranked eighth in U. S. News  World Report’s list of America’s top colleges, with a team led by a coach who moralizes about the realities of college basketball even as he benefits from them, seems to revel in its superiority. (One student’s sign at Monday night’s game read, “North Carolina State is the North Carolina State of basketball. ”) The student section at Duke frequently serves as the university’s   chest to a national audience. The Cameron Crazies, filling up the risers on the western side of the arena, are aggressive in trying to knock opposing players  . Sometimes, as when they chant, “You let the whole team down,” after poor plays, they are fair and funny other times, they have pushed the envelope, even crossed lines. When a sign targeted a North Carolina player with the words “J. R. Can’t Reid” in 1988, Tar Heels Coach Dean Smith argued the taunt had racial undertones. When Duke hosted Michigan State this season, one sign mocked the continuing   crisis in Flint, Mich.: “The water tastes better in North Carolina. ” (A Duke basketball spokesman condemned that sign.) Duke students also continue to produce cheer sheets for games that, on one side, contain   dirt  —   opposition research. Monday night’s dirt sheet included the email address of one Wolfpack player, a past criminal charge against another and the suggestion that a third could be taunted for his first name. Michael Schoenfeld, a Duke spokesman, said the university would not “hesitate to criticize things that legitimately deserve criticism,” but he insisted that college students were roughly the same at all colleges and that   vitriol was a response to the university’s athletic and academic accomplishments. “The people who are supporters of Duke and like Duke understand what this university is and can do,” Schoenfeld said, “and that will inevitably create some friction or backlash. So be it. ” The Duke dynamic has been magnified this season with the blossoming of Allen, the team’s most compelling villain in nearly three decades. His infamy outside Durham is equaled only by that of a player so despised that he became the subject of an ESPN documentary titled “I Hate Christian Laettner. ” Allen is a junior whom some pegged as a strong contender for player of the year. But he has provoked public ire by tripping opponents at least three times in the past two seasons. The most recent incident, against Elon on Dec. 21, prompted a   suspension, the loss of his captaincy and a news media firestorm that longtime Duke observers labeled unprecedented. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Bilas said. “It feels different. ” Yet to walk past the   tent city of Krzyzewskiville and into the preposterously tiny Cameron on a January evening is to understand why Duke inspires passion not only among its detractors. “Because Duke is a relatively small school, you feel like you are personally invested in it, because when you see the players around campus, they really feel like classmates,” said Tara Bansal, the student government president. The fact that students will put down stakes  —   up to 100 tents  —   for several weeks for a chance at prime seating inside Cameron (particularly for games against North Carolina) is an indisputable testament to the students’ zeal. One must be zealous  —   and drunk on one’s youth (and perhaps other things)  —   to spend dozens of nights in an unheated tent for the sake of a good view. And although one might scoff at the tent city  —   which, given Duke’s demographics, is sort of like an Occupy Wall Street for, rather than against, the 1 percent  —   tent life is rough. According to byzantine rules, tents must be occupied at all times and are subject to   by line monitors. The only bathrooms are in an adjacent gym. On Monday night, the ground near the tents was muddy. Many of the   city’s denizens could be seen huddled in their canvas shelters reading thick textbooks. “We’ve got ” said Evi Alexopoulos, a freshman whose tent’s rules require her to spend several nights there every week. “Outlets are hard to find. ” Among the rewards, though, are the prime seats in Cameron, which, with an official capacity of 9, 314, is half the size of North Carolina’s Dean Smith Center and significantly smaller than the home arenas of nearly every other college program of Duke’s pedigree and popularity. “There isn’t a bad seat,” said Herb Neubauer, who is known as Crazy Towel Guy for his practice of waving a towel to rile the crowd from his seat in the upper deck. Even so, student attendance is down this season, according to The Duke Chronicle  —   most likely part of a general trend in college sports  —   and loyalties have been tested by the furor over Allen. “I have good friends at Syracuse, so I get bullied,” said Kit Devine, a freshman. “Grayson has been a pretty big deal. ” The season is hardly lost. Duke is   and still in the top 25, although it needs to get healthy, both on the court and on the sideline. Allen needs to return to the attacking style that made him a    . Jayson Tatum, Marques Bolden and Harry Giles, the heralded freshmen who missed time with injuries, need to develop a better feel for the college game. But even the prospect of a disappointing season  —   more drama questions about the longevity of Krzyzewski, who turns 70 next month a lackluster postseason performance despite lofty preseason expectations  —   is unlikely to bring the Cameron Crazies back to sanity. “I get what they’re saying,” Alexopoulos, the   freshman, said of the haters. But, she added, “I wouldn’t question my passion. ”"

Labour, still refusing to face reality after their election drubbing in the UK, are continuing to remain utterly deluded. There are none more deluded than leadership aspirant Rebecca Long-Bailey.



She has [declared that she will stick with the socialist policies](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/rebecca-long-bailey-announces-labour-leadership-bid?fbclid=IwAR1TfISNAeS7QGuvAVbxrvluDEZ2exZuRr2g332hk18Az6YrczplwbceyMI) that were soundly defeated in the election. _The Guardian_ reports on her grand delusions:



[Rebecca Long Bailey](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rebecca-long-bailey) has announced that she is standing to become leader of the Labour party with a stout defence of Jeremy Corbyn’s political programme in the general election.



Widely seen as the favoured candidate of the left of the party, the MP for Salford and Eccles announced her candidacy on Monday night with a piece criticising the party’s election strategy and lack of narrative. She promised to defend policies within the party’s current socialist programme with “unwavering determination” [in the article for Tribune magazine](https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/01/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-socialism).



In the article, she says: **“It is true that one reason we lost the election was that Labour’s campaign lacked a coherent narrative. But this was a failure of campaign strategy, not of our socialist programme.**



Riiight, sure it was.



 **“I don’t just agree with the policies, I’ve spent the last four years writing them. Labour’s green new deal, our plans to radically democratise the economy, and to renew the high streets of towns across the country, are the foundations for an economic transformation that will combat the climate crisis and hand back wealth and power to ordinary people.”**



The green new deal, which she said was “tragically undersold” in the election, would remain at the heart of her programme if she became leader, she said.



 **“The popularity of our green new deal bridges the divides in our electoral coalition, with huge support in the cities and marginals in the south-east too. It should have been a core part of our offer: this is how[Labour](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour) will help you take back control,”** she wrote.



She has also promised not to move back to tactics employed by Ed Miliband on immigration. “Never again will our party put ‘controls on immigration’ on a mug,” she said. “It would be a betrayal of our principles, and of our core supporters and activists.”



If that doesn’t fill you with mirth, then check out what one candidate who has withdrawn and now endorsed Long-Bailey has said:



Ian Lavery, the party’s chairman and former National Union of Mineworkers executive, has dropped out of the leadership race, a source confirmed on Monday night.



Lavery released a statement offering Long Bailey his support. “Having worked with her in the shadow cabinet, I know she has the intellect, drive and determination to take forward and develop the popular, **commonsense socialist policies** that Jeremy Corbyn has championed,” he said. “And after more than a century, it’s about time the Labour party was led was a woman.”



Straight into the **same politics of intersectionality** that was so thoroughly rejected. You’d think they’d learn, but apparently not. I really hope that she wins the leadership battle: the lolz will be tremendous as they continue towards their complete destruction.



And in case you stopped laughing, another article in _The Guardian_ outlines how [candidates are being urged to sign a statement prepared by the unions](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-election-supporters-48-hours-sign-up?fbclid=IwAR1QPzcQxzFtEGlMfI-L-9IfumUIgB0fDxVPsXZDdt4aXC11TwYeytm2lD8) to try to halt job losses amongst Labour staffers affected by the demise of their hapless MPs:



Labour’s main leadership contenders have been urged to join calls for a halt to a party reorganisation that would result in multiple sackings of party staff.



As the timetable for the leadership race was set out, **representatives of Unite and GMB sent a letter to leadership and deputy leadership contenders urging them to sign a statement to stop a clear-out of staff members.**



Leadership contenders Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy and deputy candidate Angela Rayner said they would support the statement. Rebecca Long Bailey, who declared her candidacy on Monday night, has also reportedly offered her support to staff.



The move comes amid reports of significant internal party changes after last month’s calamitous election result. Jeremy Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, are reportedly drafting an overhaul of party structures before he steps down in the spring.[…] 



The decision by Unite and GMB to send the letter to candidates is significant, as **both unions will influence the contest.** Both Murphy and Formby are former senior Unite figures.



The joint union statement reads: “As candidates in the leadership and deputy leadership campaigns we firmly believe that a thorough review should be the duty and responsibility of the next leadership team when a full and frank debate has taken place. It would be a mistake for the party to undertake any steps towards reorganisation of the party until a new leader and deputy leader are in place.”



On Monday night leadership favourite Starmer offered his “wholehearted” support for the letter.



He said: “Hard-working staff need immediate reassurance, not a rushed reorganisation. It’s important any structural changes to the Labour party are undertaken by the new leadership team following a full consultation with staff and trade unions.”



A senior union source said: “How can anyone think it’s a sensible idea to restructure the entire party before a new leadership team is elected? We lost. If the people proposing this restructure had the answers, they’d be in No 10 by now.



“Rushed, politically motivated hirings and firings are part of the problem, not the solution.”



No, union domination is part of the problem, and these unions will be right in the thick of the looming donnybrook over the leadership. Ironically it was the actions of those unions in the leadership battles that caused the problems that Labour is still suffering from.



Just when I thought the day couldn’t get any better I find [Polly Toynbee has an op-ed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/labour-unity-leadership-race?fbclid=IwAR0gBkc8V6d3pNvT25NgLG99o7xO6JW26H3zeRUfJC5tkqnraTGadAYecoA):



 **The public can be badly wrong – but winning requires nationwide success, not narrow segmentation targeting particular voters.** Lisa Nandy’s plea for northern towns is full of excellent local campaigning plans, but a countrywide vision is what wins. Or, in Johnson’s case, a better feint at a vision than the other party.



It may take finely tuned ears to spot the subtle nuances between candidates’ messages, so take the advice of Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson’s grandfather): “Don’t tell me what’s in the motion, lad, just tell me who’s backing it.” Look behind the candidates to see their promoters and Phillips has captured those on the right who, like her, have been most fearless in speaking out truthfully against Corbyn when electoral disaster beckoned – Neil Coyle, Wes Streeting, Margaret Hodge.



Nothing about [Long Bailey’s pitch](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain), as set out in these pages, marks her out as especially far left, with her talk of “progressive patriotism” and no mention of socialism. An impeccable working-class girl made good who became a solicitor by her own efforts, Long Bailey’s problem is her history and her supporters. When hoisted into her seat with the aid of Len McCluskey’s Unite union in 2015, she immediately joined the 36 Corbyn nominators. She was rewarded with rapid promotion to the shadow cabinet, where Corbyn and McDonnell both pushed her as heir apparent.



With a seat on the NEC, she has voiced no objections to a series of inside fixes, not even protesting during the antisemitism row. She voted to back Jon Lansman’s failed “drive-by shooting” attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s post. Though respected for developing the excellent [Green New Deal](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-promises-1m-green-jobs-to-tackle-climate-crisis), which promised good jobs in former manufacturing zones, and though personally well-liked, that silent obedience in the face of backroom skulduggery will drag her down – as will the names of those promoting her, Lansman especially.



Oh dear, it seems bitter infighting is Labour’s short-term future. Toynbee’s statement about avoiding narrow segmentation goes totally against the statement of Ian Lavery.



Labour appear even more hapless and rudderless than at the election. Long may it continue as Boris Johnson gets down to the business of government, and draining Whitehall’s swamp.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s more proof that Germany’s scheme to shift over to renewable energy sources, the so-called Energiewende, is backfiring – this time socially.
German climate alarmist site “Klimaretter” (Climate Rescuer) writes here that Germany’s Energiewende has been unfair to consumers, but a real bonanza for some large power consumers.
Claiming competition disadvantages (and they are indeed real) big power consumers have cajoled policymakers to grant them exemptions from having to pay the renewable energy feed-in surcharges – now at more than 6 euro-cents a kilowatt-hour. The result is that these have ended up being passed on to the poor consumers, who are forced to pick up the huge tab in addition to paying their own surcharge fees.
Klimaretter writes:
Energy-intensive companies in Germany were exempted from paying 3.3 billion euros in 2014 and 3.4 billion euros in 2015 within the scope of the EEG Renewable Energy Feed-In Act.”
That’s about 7 billion – over the past two years, only.

It is estimated that some 2000 German companies were granted exemptions from paying these feed-in charges. One green politician, Julia Verlinden, commented that the way things are now, large power consuming companies are being rewarded for consuming more power. She told klimaretter that “companies even receive incentives to waste as much energy as possible in order to profit from extra discounts.”
In fact Co2 emissions by the German aluminium industry has risen from 733,000 tonnes in 2010 to 821,000 tonnes in 2014, klimaretter reports.
Verlinden adds:
Small businesses, private households or public services have to pay for the gifts to industry.”
This is yet another way the Energiewende has become the largest bottom-to-top wealth redistribution in the history of the planet. Currently German consumers are being burdened with over 25 billion euros annually to subsidize the Energiewende. The big profiteers are banks, Big Wind & Solar, and wealthy land and property owners.
For the extra billions of euros annually, the poor consumers have content themselves with a few theoretical hundredths of a degree less climate warming by 2050.

"**The US National Basketball Association (NBA) has defended free speech amid a row with China over a team executive's tweet in support of Hong Kong protests.**
The tweet posted by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, caused uproar in China and his attempt to backtrack upset American fans.
But NBA boss Adam Silver defended Mr Morey and said the league would ""support freedom of expression"".
NBA games draw huge viewership in China, mainly via streaming platforms.
The Rockets have been popular there since the team signed Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002. Mr Yao now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA).
But Mr Morey's tweet prompted a furious backlash in China, with broadcasters vowing to stop airing Rockets games.
They went further on Tuesday by scrapping plans to broadcast two NBA pre-season games being played in China.
The NBA is just the latest international business to be embroiled in controversy in both China and the US over the Hong Kong protests. But the organisation's strong defence of freedom of expression is unusual.
On Friday, Mr Morey posted a tweet with an image captioned: ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.""
He was referencing months of pro-democracy protests in the territory, which is part of China but enjoys unique freedoms.
Chinese officials and media have reacted furiously to foreign expressions of support for the protesters and accused the West of interfering in Chinese affairs.
In response to Mr Morey's tweet, state-run broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.
On Sunday the CBA suspended co-operation with the team, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning and the club's sponsor in China, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.
On Monday, Mr Morey deleted the tweet and said: ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.""
""I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors,"" he added.
But American fans reacted angrily to his apology, with one tweet saying: ""You shouldn't have to apologise for supporting freedom.""
On Tuesday Mr Silver issued a statement saying: ""The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.""
He later told reporters in Japan that the league would not compromise its values on freedom of speech and was motivated by more than money.
The NBA commissioner said he understood there would be consequences but that ""we will have to live with those consequences.""
He said he would travel to Shanghai on Wednesday and meet the officials to try to ""find mutual respect"". But he recognised that ""this issue might not die down so quickly"".
His defence of free speech in the face of Chinese anger is seen as a bold move, given the potential financial impact for the NBA.
""The vast majority of foreign companies apologize profusely at the first sign of discontent from Chinese consumers, which makes the NBA's response all the more remarkable,"" tweeted Mark Dreyer, an expert on China's sports industry.
Initially the Rockets and the NBA distanced themselves from Mr Morley's tweet. This provoked accusations from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the league was bowing to Beijing.
Former US presidential hopeful - and Rockets fan - Ted Cruz accused the NBA of ""shamefully retreating"" in pursuit of profit.
Mr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey ""call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong"".
Fellow Republican Senator Ben Sasse called the NBA's response ""shameful"".
Democratic presidential hopeful Julian Castro tweeted that the US must ""not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government"".
Also on Tuesday, a Hong-Kong professional gamer was banned by game-maker Blizzard from competing for 12 months for staging an anti-government protest.
Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.
In September, Zara became a target of anger on Chinese social media after some of its Hong Kong stores closed on a day of strike action.
China accused the retailer of encouraging its employees to join the strike but Zara said it was just ensuring its shops were not understaffed if transport was disrupted.
In August the chief executive of airline Cathay Pacific stood down after the company shifted its stance on whether employees could join protests.
And in the same month Versace had to apologise to China after one of its T-shirts appeared to imply Hong Kong and Macau were independent territories."

Icy ebb and flow influenced by hydrothermal activity
Release of magma from beneath earth’s crust plays significant role in earth’s climate
From the UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT
The last million years of Earth’s history was dominated by the cyclic advance and retreat of ice sheets over large swaths of North America. During cold glacial intervals, ice sheets reached as far south as Long Island and Indiana, while during warm interglacial periods the ice rapidly retreated to Greenland. It has long been known that ice ages occur every 40,000 years or so, but the cause of rapid transition between glacial and interglacial periods has remained a mystery.
While conventional wisdom says that this icy ebb and flow is an interaction between the world’s oceans, the ice itself, and the earth’s atmosphere, an article appearing in the Jan. 28, 2016 issue of the journal Science sheds new light on the role that the earth itself may play in this climatological ballet.
David Lund of the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Connecticut and his colleagues have studied hydrothermal activity along the mid-ocean ridge system — the longest mountain range in the world which extends some 37,000 miles along the ocean floor. Their research suggests that the release of hot molten rock, or magma, from beneath the earth’s crust in response to changes in sea level plays a significant role in the earth’s climate. This change is attributed to the release of heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) into the deep ocean.
Lund says, “Mid-ocean range magmatism — the release of molten rock through volcanic vents or fissures — is driven by seafloor spreading and decompression melting of the upper mantle” — the partially molten layer just beneath the earth’s crust.
“This activity is controlled by the rate of pressure release at any given location. There’s clear evidence that when ice sheets grow, sea level lowers and significant pressure is taken off the ocean ridges. This causes melting in the mantle, which should in turn promote the release of heat and carbon into the oceans — and that’s when glacial termination begins — meaning the ice starts to melt. Then, sea levels begin to rise, pressure on the ridges increases, and magmatic activity decreases.”
Well-documented sedimentary records from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) — a mid-ocean ridge extending roughly from Antarctica to the Gulf of California — show evidence of enhanced hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations, the last of which took place about 15,000 years ago.
According to Lund, the southern East Pacific rise (SEPR) has the fastest spreading rate and the highest magmatic budget of any ridge in the global mid-ocean ridge system. Due to its elevated magmatism, the SEPR has over 50 known active vent sites.
He says, “The coincidence in timing between hydrothermal maxima and glacial terminations implies that there may be a direct causal relationship between hydrothermal activity and deglaciation … Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced ridge magmatism, hydrothermal output, and perhaps mantle CO2 flux acts as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size … ”
In this study, core samples from both sides of the ridge axis were analyzed and included radiocarbon and oxygen isotopic analyses of microscopic shells to provide age control for each core. Major and trace element concentrations were determined using x-ray florescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
The EPR results establish the timing of hydrothermal anomalies, an essential prerequisite for determining whether ridge magmatism can act as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size.
###
[Update by Willis] The underlying paper in Science magazine, “Enhanced East Pacific Rise hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations”, is paywalled here. From the magazine:
Searching sediment for climate signals
Sediments on the ocean floor may provide clues about the interplay between ice ages and mid-ocean ridge magma production. Lund et al. present well-dated and detailed sediment records from hydrothermal activity along the East Pacific Rise. The sediments show changes in metal fluxes that are tied to the past two glaciations. Ice age changes in sea level alter magma production, which is manifested by changes in hydrothermal systems. The apparent increase in hydrothermal activity at the East Pacific Rise around the past two glacial terminations suggests some role in moderating the size of ice sheets.
Science, this issue p. 478
Abstract
Mid-ocean ridge magmatism is driven by seafloor spreading and decompression melting of the upper mantle. Melt production is apparently modulated by glacial-interglacial changes in sea level, raising the possibility that magmatic flux acts as a negative feedback on ice-sheet size. The timing of melt variability is poorly constrained, however, precluding a clear link between ridge magmatism and Pleistocene climate transitions. Here we present well-dated sedimentary records from the East Pacific Rise that show evidence of enhanced hydrothermal activity during the last two glacial terminations. We suggest that glacial maxima and lowering of sea level caused anomalous melting in the upper mantle and that the subsequent magmatic anomalies promoted deglaciation through the release of mantle heat and carbon at mid-ocean ridges.
And here is one of their figures, with the original caption:

Fig. 4
Normalized metal fluxes at 11°S compared with EPR bathymetry.
The hydrothermal time series are from the eastern (magenta) and western (black) flanks of the EPR and include (A) Fe flux, (B) Mn flux, and (C) As flux. We normalized each record by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each time series to facilitate comparison between cores with different mean metal concentrations. The results include both discrete samples (thin lines) and time series smoothed with a 20-ky-wide Gaussian window (thick lines) to approximate the resolution of the bathymetry compilation at 17°S (gray lines) (4). Fluxes from 0 to 40 ky are based on the results from Fig. 2; the interval from 40 to 200 ky B.P. is based on results shown in Fig. 3.

"**Students have held protests at a UK university over issues that have sparked violence in Hong Kong.**
Two groups gathered at the University of Reading's campus, one supporting Hong Kong's protesters and another supporting mainland China.
Some eyewitnesses said the atmosphere was ""very hostile"" between the two groups, but others taking part said they had ""peacefully discussed"" issues.
A university spokesman said students had been ""peacefully protesting"".
He added a small group of students who ""had planned to show support for Hong Kong"" had been met by people ""waving Chinese flags"".
He said he was ""not aware of there being any clashes between the two groups"".
However, Abi Jones, 19, said the atmosphere was ""very hostile and very uncomfortable"" and ""people were thinking something was going to break out"".
Protests in Hong Kong started in June against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
**Andre Rhoden-Paul, BBC News**
Students wore yellow helmets, goggles and gas masks - the symbol of resistance to the Hong Kong government's clampdown on protests.
Except these students were thousands of miles away at Reading University.
For them, this gathering was about showing solidarity with their friends back home protesting for Hong Kong's autonomy, and spreading this message to fellow students on campus.
Similarly, students supporting mainland China felt compelled to defend China's position, proudly flying their flag.
Stephen Chan, 24, said the gathering in Reading was to ""raise awareness to students and staff at the university about the situation in Hong Kong"".
He said he and others had promoted the event online and ""then the Chinese students started forming up their group against us"".
Mr Chan said: ""At first we thought they would cause violence so that's why we told security, but now we've peacefully discussed what's been happening in Hong Kong.""
Rachel, who is a supporter of the Chinese government but did not want to give her surname, said she attended the gathering ""to explain myself and my country's position"".
""Most of them are very nice to talk to,"" she added."
"An autocratic leader has won the vote. He has charm, yes, and smarts of a kind, but also a cruel streak. Beatings are frequent, and assassination  —   foreign and domestic  —   has become commonplace. His cultural pronouncements have had a chilling effect on the arts, theater in particular. Take your seat for “Evening at the Talk House,” an   comedy by the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn (“The Designated Mourner,” “Aunt Dan and Lemon”) for the New Group that begins performances at the Signature Center on Tuesday, Jan. 31. Though written years before Donald J. Trump announced his candidacy, and first produced in London in the fall of 2015, the play may strike some as oddly prescient. Set in the course of one night, it eavesdrops on several people who worked together on “Midnight in a Clearing With Moon and Stars,” a fictitious flop from a decade ago. They have gathered for a reunion at a rundown club. As they snack and sip and reminisce, they reveal the brutality of the world outside and the ways that artists can abet it, resist it and ignore it. The London production stoked controversy, with The Independent approvingly describing a “disturbing, balefully hilarious new play,” while many other critics attacked its tone, pace and politics. More than a year later, in the wake of Brexit and the presidential election, that controversy is likely to resonate anew. On the morning of President Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Shawn, who also appears in the play, the director Scott Elliott and the other members of the cast  —   Matthew Broderick, Jill Eikenberry, John Epperson, Larry Pine, Claudia Shear, Annapurna Sriram and Michael Tucker  —   gathered at a rehearsal space to discuss drama as protest and whether or not to invite the president. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is this a political play? MICHAEL TUCKER Yes. It’s other things, too. But it’s most certainly political. JILL EIKENBERRY I felt when I first read it that it was extremely relevant to our situation in this world, in this country. After the election, it felt way more relevant, chillingly relevant. SCOTT ELLIOTT I decided to do it way before the election. Many people say Wally’s a prescient artist, and I’ve seen it. And then all of a sudden on election night, it was this feeling of, oh my God, this play crossed over from fiction to  —   —   EIKENBERRY True. LARRY PINE If the election had gone the other way, this play would still be very relevant. WALLACE SHAWN Plays began as political. The Greek plays were about communities and cities and kings and queens and how a country was run. We went through a brief period in the United States of somehow being so prosperous and secure that we forgot that we lived in the world, and plays were about what was happening in somebody’s kitchen. Have you ever been a part of a play that failed unjustly? PINE Oh God, yes. Every play. SHAWN Most of my projects have been unsuccessful, so I’m a kind of expert on it. Most actors are very courageous people, and my experience is their commitment increases when it becomes clear that the show is not going to get universal approval. It’s an honorable role to be committing yourself to the unpopular play.  Is there anything wrong with apolitical plays, entertainment that simply comforts? CLAUDIA SHEAR I think there’s a place for “Guys and Dolls” until the last splinter of light dies out on the planet. JOHN EPPERSON I never liked that show. But I like “The Unsinkable Molly Brown. ” SHAWN Speaking as someone who has devoted a lot of his life to doing some things that would certainly fit into the category of pure entertainment, that’s how I have lived. I’ve been paid for that. But complacency is a very serious problem. Too much soothing entertainment isn’t good for a person. If you admit that a play or a TV show or a movie can wake somebody up, you have to at least admit that possibly some plays or TV shows or movies might put people to sleep and help them in their quest for total oblivion. Personally, I would rather go to bed and have someone bring me a cup of tea. I don’t have a desire to go out and get arrested or something like that. But it may be necessary. MATTHEW BRODERICK It’s a play it’s not an essay. It’s not like we’re all sitting around saying, “Let’s change the world and its politics while we’re doing it. ” We’re creating a human world. EIKENBERRY And there’s a lot of irony, a lot of funny stuff. That’s another great way to tell a political story. In the play, theater has died out. Is this likely? ANNAPURNA SRIRAM A lot of friends my age don’t go to theater. I have one friend who will probably come, and this will be his second play. His first was another play I did. I definitely wonder what the next generation of theatergoers will look like. SHEAR They’re all outside of “Hamilton. ” BRODERICK When I first did a play, I was absolutely sure that Broadway was dead. And now every time I’m in a play, you can’t get a theater. Your young friends are going to start watching plays at some point. SRIRAM I hope so. If it did die, would that be so bad? BRODERICK I would be fine with that. We would get paid more. TUCKER It would be a great loss. When it works, there’s nothing like it. If there were no theaters, no one could ever say, “I saw that, I was there, that moment. ” EIKENBERRY It’s been around for an awful long time it’s hard to imagine that even this administration could do away with it. People don’t go to church that much anymore. They need collective experience. EPPERSON I thought the election in 2000 would spur people to make more interesting work, but it didn’t seem like it did. And then after   it seemed like audiences wanted   stuff. Maybe this election will make more interesting work. Scott, you said you already have things on your desk. ELLIOTT A lot of screeches. A lot of screams. In the world of the play, assassination has become the norm. Do you feel we’re moving toward a more violent world? TUCKER There’s been slaughter, genocide since history began. But this is different. SRIRAM It’s been going on for a long time, but it hasn’t been as public. SHAWN Under Bush, torture became normal and most Americans accepted it. First they were shocked, and then they accepted it. And sadly, under the very likable Obama, these assassinations have become normal, and people have accepted that. In the case of killing Bin Laden, it was boasted about by apparently nice people. I’m not sure we understand the implications of that yet, the normalization of killing individuals. What does it mean if apparently nice people just go on eating snacks and drinking cocktails and making art while these things are happening? EIKENBERRY That’s the question of the play. SRIRAM I feel grateful in real life just for the privilege of getting to be an actor, that I have the kind of sometimes insane work of putting on costumes and playing pretend, for a living! But what is my responsibility other than just trying to achieve and have ambition and success? SHAWN Our complacency is dangerous to other people. Have you always made it a point to do work that has political dimensions?  TUCKER Most of us don’t have that much of a choice. There are only a few actors who can choose what they want to do. There are actors who are very political who will join or form a company that only does political work. But I’m not much of a joiner. It’s really something that we have to think about individually. EPPERSON I have a list of selfish reasons for doing it, too. My career has been a kind of trap: Performing in female clothing is one trap, and   is another trap. It’s always good for me to do a job where people can realize, oh, he can do something else. BRODERICK But I think we’re going to record all of your dialogue. The reaction to this play in London a year ago was mixed to negative. Will it be received differently now? TUCKER There will be negative responses, too, I imagine. People don’t like to be confronted. EIKENBERRY Wally, do you have a fantasy  —   I think it happened to Sean O’Casey  —   that everyone gets up in the entire audience and starts throwing things at the stage? Would that make you happy? SHAWN I don’t actually enjoy that. Nobody ever says, “I hated your play, because I happen to be very conservative, and I disagree with all of your ideas. ” They say: “You’re a bad writer. We were bored. It’s not a good play. ” What about the “Waiting for Lefty” model, where the audience joins the resistance? SHAWN I’m available. If the audience is inspired to activism, I’m thrilled and I’ll join in, but things don’t really happen quite that way. Our president has a lot of strong opinions on art. How would you feel if he liked this play? BRODERICK That should happen! A fan’s a fan. PINE I don’t think he’s interested in plays. EPPERSON I saw him at a fashion show once. SHEAR I saw him at a party. ELLIOTT He was in one of my plays in the ’90s. This play called “The Monogamist. ” I videotaped prominent New York figures for the scenic transitions. Will you invite him? ELLIOTT Why not? Let him see it. SHAWN I don’t know if it could influence Trump. It’s only 90 minutes long, but he’s one of those people who’s interested in himself, and when the topic goes off of him he becomes bored. We don’t mention him in the play. Maybe we should change that."
"**In recent weeks, mass protests have broken out in countries from Lebanon to Spain to Chile and Bolivia. All are different - with distinct causes, methods and goals - but there are some common themes that connect them.**
While thousands of miles apart, protests have begun for similar reasons in several countries, and some have taken inspiration from each other on how to organise and advance their goals.
Here's a look at the issues at stake - and what binds many of those taking to the streets.
Many of those protesting are people who have long felt shut out of the wealth of their country. In several cases, a rise in prices for key services has proved the final straw.
Demonstrations began in Ecuador last month when the government announced that it was scrapping decades-old fuel subsidies as part of public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit.
Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, who resigned in November following weeks of protests, introduced public works projects and social programmes to tackle inequality when he took office in 2006. Extreme poverty then stood at 38% and had fallen to 17% by 2018.
However, his critics said that in the past two years levels of extreme poverty in Bolivia had again been on the rise.
A hike in transport prices has also sparked protests in Chile. The government blamed higher energy costs and a weaker currency for its decision to increase bus and metro fares, but protesters said it was just the latest measure to squeeze the poor.
As demonstrators clashed with security forces on Friday evening, President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era was pictured dining in an upmarket Italian restaurant - a sign, some said, of the chasm between Chile's political elite and the people on the streets.
Chile is one of Latin America's wealthiest countries but also one of its most unequal - it has the worst levels of income equality among the 36 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Like in Ecuador, the government backtracked and suspended its fare hike in an effort to quell the protests. But the protests continued, growing to take in wider grievances.
""This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,"" one student taking part in the action told Reuters news agency.
Lebanon has seen similar unrest, with plans to tax WhatsApp calls prompting wider protests about economic problems, inequality and corruption.
With debt levels soaring, the government has been trying to implement economic reforms to secure a major aid package from international donors. But many ordinary people say they are suffering under the country's economic policies and that government mismanagement is to blame for their troubles.
""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything,"" said Abdullah, a protester in Beirut.
Claims of government corruption are at the heart of several of the protests, and are closely linked to the issue of inequality.
In Lebanon, protesters argue that while they are suffering under an economic crisis, the country's leaders have been using their positions of power to enrich themselves, through kickbacks and favourable deals.
""I've seen a lot of things here but I have never seen such a corrupt government in Lebanon,"" said 50-year-old protester Rabab.
The government on Monday approved a package of reforms, including slashing politicians' salaries, in an effort to quell the unrest.
People in Iraq have also been calling for the end of a political system that they say has failed them. One of the main points of contention there is the way government appointments are made on the basis of sectarian or ethnic quotas, instead of on merit.
Demonstrators argue that this has allowed leaders to abuse public funds to reward themselves and their followers, with very little benefit to most citizens.
Protests against alleged government corruption have also taken place in Egypt. The rare demonstrations in September were prompted by a call from Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman living in self-imposed exile in Spain, who accused President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the military of corruption.
His allegations that Mr Sisi and his government have been mishandling funds resonated with many Egyptians who have grown increasingly disaffected by austerity measures.
In Bolivia's 2019 presidential election, many voters cited corruption as their biggest concern and blamed Evo Morales for failing to tackle the issue.
In some countries, protesters are angered by political systems in which they feel trapped.
Demonstrations in Hong Kong began this summer over a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China in certain circumstances. Hong Kong is part of China but its people enjoy special freedoms and there is a deep sense of fear that Beijing wants to exert greater control.
Like fellow protesters in Chile and Lebanon, the mass action in Hong Kong led to the withdrawal of the controversial legislation, but the protests themselves continued. Among their demands, protesters now want complete universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and amnesty for demonstrators who have been arrested.
Their tactics have inspired political activists halfway across the world. Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied in Barcelona to express anger over the jailing of Catalan separatist leaders. The separatists were convicted on 14 October of sedition over their role in a 2017 referendum outlawed by the Spanish courts and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Shortly after the sentence was given, people in Barcelona received a message on a popular encrypted messaging service telling them to go to Barcelona's El Prat airport, mimicking a tactic used by Hong Kong protesters.
As they made their way to the airport, a group of youths shouted: ""We're going to do a Hong Kong"", according to local media reports.
Catalan protesters have also been distributing infographics made in Hong Kong that detail how demonstrators can protect themselves from police water cannon and tear gas. ""Now people must be in the streets, all revolts start there, look at Hong Kong,"" one protester in Barcelona told AFP news agency.
In Bolivia, Evo Morales's decision to run for a fourth consecutive term in October angered many voters.
In a 2016 referendum, a majority had voted ""no"" to dropping the limit of term numbers that Bolivians could serve. But Mr Morales's party took the issue to the constitutional court, which abolished the term limits altogether.
Of course, many of the protests that you hear about will have been linked to the environment and climate change. Activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement have been protesting in cities around the world, as they demand urgent action from governments.
The protests have taken place in countries including the US, UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, France and New Zealand. Participants have glued and chained themselves to roads and vehicles, and tried to disrupt busy city centres.
""We have no choice but to rebel until our government declares a climate and ecological emergency and takes the action that is required to save us,"" said Australian activist Jane Morton.
Young people around the world have also been joining weekly school strikes, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Millions last month joined a global climate strike led by schoolchildren, from handfuls of demonstrators on Pacific islands to mass rallies in cities like Melbourne, Mumbai, Berlin and New York.
""We are skipping our lessons to teach you one,"" one sign read.
Earlier this year, Evo Morales faced protests over huge fires which raged in protected eastern areas of Bolivia.
Demonstrators called for him to revoke a decree that authorised ""controlled burning"" to help farmers create bigger plots for crops."
"**Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam said the territory is likely to record negative growth for the year as months of protests have knocked the economy.**
The unrest has disrupted businesses and dealt a particularly heavy blow to the tourism and retail sectors.
The warning comes ahead of preliminary gross domestic product figures due on Thursday that are expected to show Hong Kong entered a technical recession.
That is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
In a briefing in Hong Kong on Tuesday, Ms Lam said the third quarter growth numbers are likely to show that outcome.
To combat the slowdown, she said the city has so far injected more than HK$20bn ($2.6bn; Â£2bn) to support the economy including the transport, tourism and retail sectors.
Ms Lam said the government will deliver more relief measures, without giving specific details.
Her comments follow a similar warning from the territory's Finance Secretary Paul Chan over the weekend. He said it would be ""extremely difficult"" to hit the government's pre-protest forecast of growth of between 0% and 1% for 2019.
""The blow to our economy [from the protests] is comprehensive,"" Mr Chan said.
The demonstrations began over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.
Hong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police using tear gas and protesters storming parliament.
Those protests have led to a sharp decline in tourist arrivals, with visitor numbers expected to have slumped 50% in October.
Retailers have also been hard hit. Some shops have been forced to shorten trading hours, while workers report fears over their safety as well as getting to work.
Mr Chan said in August that retail sales had plunged more than 25% - the biggest monthly drop on record."

The newly published study showed how a downwelling of warm waters deepened the storm’s fuel tank for a rapid intensification toward hurricane status. The results also revealed how hurricane-generated currents and ocean eddies can transport oil and other pollutants to coastal regions.
Tropical storms obtain their energy from the ocean waters below. As a storm moves across the Gulf of Mexico, it may interact with an upwelling of cooler waters from the deeper ocean or, in the case of Isaac, a downwelling inside rings of warm water that separated from a warm-water current, called the Loop Current, that moves through the Gulf of Mexico to join with the Gulf Stream along the U.S. East Coast. As the storm moves forward, ocean temperatures are fueling the storm’s intensity.
UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science researchers, in collaboration with NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, deployed a total of 376 airborne sensors during six NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft flights conducted before, during, and after the passage of Isaac over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The researchers observed a predominant downwelling of water inside these warm-water rings, or eddies, from the Loop Current, which caused its intensification from a tropical storm to a category 1 hurricane just prior to landfall.
“These results underscore the need for forecast models to include upwelling-downwelling responses to improve intensity forecasting and current transport,” said Benjamin Jaimes, an assistant scientist at the UM Rosenstiel School.
“Isaac moved over the region of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill where we observed both upwelling and downwelling processes that can re-suspend hydrocarbons lying on the seafloor,” said Nick Shay, professor of ocean sciences at the UM Rosenstiel School. “This may have resulted in tar balls being deposited on beaches by hurricane-generated currents.”
Tropical storm Isaac gradually intensified in the Gulf of Mexico to reach category 1 hurricane status as an 80 mph (130 km/h) storm, making landfall along the coast of Louisiana. The storm was estimated to have caused $2.39 billion in damage along its track.
###
The study, titled “Enhanced Wind-Driven Downwelling Flow in Warm Oceanic Eddy Features during the Intensification of Tropical Cyclone Isaac (2012): Observations and Theory,” was published in the June 2015 issue of the Journal of Physical Oceanography. The study’s co-authors include: Benjamin Jaimes and Lynn “Nick” Shay of the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science’s Department of Ocean Sciences. BP/Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative to the Deep-C consortium at Florida State University supported the research.

An absolutely basic grammatical error by _Stuff_ sub-editors. Did they not pay any attention at all in English class at school, or were they protesting climate change that day?

You Ought to Have a Look _is a feature from the Center for the Study of Science posted by Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. (“Chip”) Knappenberger. While this section will feature all of the areas of interest that we are emphasizing, the prominence of the climate issue is driving a tremendous amount of web traffic. Here we post a few of the best in recent days, along with our color commentary._   
  
\---   
  
Talk of interference, intimidation, and abridgement of scientific freedom continues to make the news this week—and increasingly is taking the form of pushback against recently announced congressional investigations into sources of scientific research funding.   
  
On Tuesday, the _Wall Street Journal_ ran an editorial offering a “round of applause for those pushing back, providing the bullies a public lesson in the First Amendment.” Highlighted in their coverage were efforts by the Cato Institute, Heartland Institute and Koch Industries condemning attempts to “silence public debate” on climate change. From the _WSJ_ :   




Democrats and their allies have failed to persuade Americans that climate change is so serious that it warrants sweeping new political controls on American energy and industry. So liberals are trying to silence those who are winning the argument. We’re glad to see the dissenters aren’t intimidated.



Also unintimidated by attempts abridge academic freedom is Alice Dreger, professor of Medical Education-Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern University and a historian of science and medicine. Dreger has a new book out titled _Galileo’s Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists and the Search for Justice in Science_ that describes how activists try to intimidate researchers when the activists disagree with the researchers' work.   
  
Roger Pielke Jr. reviews the book for _Nature_. From his blog, leading into his review, Roger describes why he empathizes with Dreger:   




Most academic work is like the proverbial tree falling in the forest, but every so often (and probably more often than many of us would like to think), scholarship becomes the focus of a political battle.   
  
I should know. My review was completed and filed the week before I was targeted with an ""investigation"" by a member of Congress for the audacity of testifying before that august body with the results of peer reviewed, government-funded research, widely accepted as scientific consensus. But even before that, my own career has led me to be sympathetic to Dreger's arguments.   
  
I have lots of experience with personal and professional attacks based on my research and advocacy. For instance, it was one year ago today that I published a piece at _FiveThirtyEight_ on that same research, which prompted a social and mainstream media campaign to have me fired for voicing such heresies. The Guardian, New York Times, Slate, Salon and even the American Geophysical Union all joined the campaign. Unsurprisingly, _FiveThirtyEight_ succumbed to the pressure, explaining ""Reception to the article ran about 80 percent negative in the comments section and on social media. A reaction like that compels us to think carefully about the piece and our editorial process.""   
  
So, scientific consensus vs. Facebook likes - Guess who won?



Dreger herself describes some of the attacks on academic freedom in her post at Retraction Watch titled “Yes, we are seeing more attacks on academic freedom.” She leads with:   




The good news: Policy makers and the public seem to be increasingly taking scientific research seriously. The bad news? People who don’t like researchers’ findings seem to be increasingly coming after researchers and their universities. And some of those people are powerful.   
  
Technically, your university is supposed to protect your academic freedom. In my own university’s faculty handbook, academic freedom is the first topic discussed. But as I’ve learned from my own personal experiences, as well as from eight years studying the experiences of other researchers who have gotten into political hot water, your administration may not always have your back.   
  
Economist Paul Frijters of the University of Queensland in Australia seems to have found this out the hard way.



You ought to have a look at her full post for some rather lurid details.   
  
And from what we can gather, you ought to have a look at her book, too.   
  
Stay tuned. The issue of scientific intimidation is trending—big time. 


"
"Words matter. And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico  —   this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn’t even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump’s habit of speaking in   hyperbole and his tendency to deride any    report as “fake news. ” The words needed to be exactly right. “And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth,” said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. “They’re ‘baseless,’ they’re ‘bogus,’ they’re ‘lies,’ they’re ‘untruths. ’” Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). “This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country,” said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn’t seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims. ” Still, carefully chosen words can capture that. “A whole vocabulary has come bubbling up that would not have been used five years ago,” Mr. Nunberg said in an interview. “People are going to have to sit down and decide: Are we going to want to go over the moral consequences of telling an untruth? The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it’s bogus, baseless or groundless?” Some news organizations used words like “falsely” or “wrongly”  —   adverbs that tend to weaken the impact  —   in framing what the president said. Some used “with no evidence,” or “won’t provide any proof,” or “unverified claims,” or “repeats debunked claim. ” The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word “lie” in the headline. After initially using the word “falsely,” it switched to “lie” online and then settled on “Meeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie” for Tuesday’s print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including “falsehood,” which Chuck Todd, the host of “Meet the Press,” recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s Orwellian phrase, “alternative facts. ” To say that someone has “lied,” an active verb, or has told a “lie,” a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, “a certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive. ” The question of intent has informed National Public Radio’s approach to covering Mr. Trump’s many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country’s intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany. On NPR’s “Morning Edition” on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of “lie” in the Oxford English Dictionary. “A false statement made with intent to deceive,” Ms. Kelly said. “Intent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump’s head, I can’t tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn’t, with facts. ” Michael Oreskes, NPR’s senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that “the minute you start branding things with a word like ‘lie,’ you push people away from you. ” The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides. Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump. In September, when he grandly announced the findings of a yearslong   investigation into what nearly everyone else never doubted  —   “President Obama was born in the United States, period”  —   The Times published a Page 1 article with the headline “Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent. ” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said that he learned of Mr. Trump’s latest comments in a text message from an editor on Monday night. After consulting with other top editors, he decided that the use of “lie” was warranted. For Mr. Baquet, the question of intent was resolved, given that Mr. Trump had made the same assertion two months earlier through his preferred mode of communication, the tweet: “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ” (Nota bene: The tweet actually contains what might be considered two untruths  —   or falsehoods, or erroneous assertions, or bogus claims  —   since Mr. Trump’s victory was no landslide, but among the closer elections in American history.) Mr. Baquet said he fully understood the gravity of using the word “lie,” whether in reference to an average citizen or to the president of the United States. He emphasized that it should be used sparingly, partly because the term carries such negative connotations, and partly so that it does not lose potency. “On the other hand, we should be letting people know in no uncertain terms that it’s untrue,” Mr. Baquet said, referring to the president’s assertion of a   epidemic. “He repeated it without a single grain of evidence, and it’s a very powerful statement about the electoral system. ” Mr. Baquet said that emails from readers seemed split on the appropriateness of the word’s use. Meanwhile, Mr. Benton, of the Nieman Journalism Lab, applauded its use as a noun in the Times headline (“Trump Repeats an Election Lie”) in this construction, he said, “the lie can exist as a reality distinct from the speaker’s intention. ” Over all, the tension between the Trump administration and much of the mainstream media is  —   what’s the word? Troubling, according to Sara Brady, a   specialist based in Florida. She says that a complete breakdown of the already fractious relationship affects everyone. “The media run the risk of being disrespectful to the president of the United States,” she said. “But the problem is: If he doesn’t get called out in some way, we as Americans are never going to know what’s true and what’s not. ” In other words: Words matter."
"**Hong Kong has announced that all schools including kindergartens will be closed on Thursday as the territory faces another day of escalating unrest.**
The Education Bureau announced the unprecedented step on Wednesday, citing safety reasons.
Officials said schools would remain open for children needing supervision.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong also said it would cancel classes for the rest of term after a violent standoff between police and protesters.
The university, one of Hong Kong's most prestigious, saw clashes overnight on Tuesday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked protesters, who in turn started fires and threw petrol bombs.
Clashes then continued in different parts of the city, just hours after a senior police officer said Hong Kong had been pushed to the ""brink of a total breakdown"".
The police decision to enter campuses signalled a shift in strategy, correspondents say, as they have largely avoided clearance operations at schools and universities.
Throughout the night there were chaotic scenes of explosions, smoke, and the firing of rubber bullets. Scores of people were injured, reports said.
""This is not only to defend the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It represents the human spirit of defending political freedom and the rights which should be enjoyed by Hong Kongers,"" one student told the BBC.
Paramedics were treating at least 70 people after the clashes, local media reported, with at least four seriously hurt.
About 142 people have been arrested since Tuesday, raising the total number to more than 4,000 since the unrest started.
In a statement, China's liaison office in the territory said Hong Kong was ""sliding into the abyss of terrorism"", and urged the government to toughen its crackdown.
Images on Wednesday showed students and demonstrators still at the Chinese University (CUHK) campus, some armed with petrol bombs or other weapons including bows and arrows.
Police displayed some of the arrows at a press conference, claiming they could have pierced officers' protective gear.
CUHK is not the only campus involved.
At universities across the city, anti-government protesters fortified barricades and stockpiled food and projectiles on Wednesday, as police said the violence had reached a ""very dangerous and even deadly level"". There are fears more clashes could follow.
In a statement, CUHK said it was shortening the academic term and would not resume classes until 6 January 2020, ""in view of the escalation of social movements across the territory, the continuous disruption to public transport services [and] the severe damage done to facilities"".
Police said they had assisted a group of mainland Chinese students who wanted to leave the campus for safety reasons but were unable to do so due to ""roadblocks set up by mobs"".
Pictures circulated on social media showing a crowd at Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier waiting to board a police boat.
Several other Hong Kong universities, among them Open University and City University, said they had cancelled Thursday's classes.
Many went further and closed for the rest of the week. Baptist University suspended on-campus classes entirely until the end of term on 3 December, saying it would replace some with online sessions.
Protesters called for a third day of strikes with disruption at several metro stations, leading to a morning of long delays and queues.
Activists continued to block roads and build barricades, causing confrontations with police in Yuen Long.
Fresh lunchtime protests in the financial district saw crowds gather to chant slogans. Some black-clad protesters also vandalised a branch of the mainland Bank of Communications.
A session at the city's parliament, known as the Legislative Council, was briefly suspended after opposition politicians angrily questioned the security chief over alleged police brutality.
This week has seen a marked escalation in violence with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities and flashmob lunchtime protests in the financial heart of Hong Kong.
It is the first time in weeks that protests have taken place during weekdays.
Monday's protests followed a weekend of vigils and demonstrations after a 22-year-old student protester died on Friday.
Alex Chow had been in hospital since he fell from the ledge of a car park during a police operation a week ago.
Later on Monday, violence escalated further when a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet and a pro-government supporter was set on fire by protesters.
Hong Kong is part of China but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms.
The bill was withdrawn in September, but the demonstrations continued. They now call for full democracy and an inquiry into police actions.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, and in October the city banned all face masks."
"**Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has been forced to suspend her annual address after being heckled in parliament.**
Opposition lawmakers disrupted the Legislative Council session by shouting and projecting slogans behind her.
After a first interruption, the session resumed only to be interrupted again. It was then suspended - and Ms Lam delivered the address by video instead.
It means the extradition bill - the trigger for months of protests - could not be withdrawn formally.
The bill was suspended in July, but Wednesday's meeting was the first time the Legislative Council (Legco) had resumed since it was stormed by protesters in July, and was the first opportunity to withdraw the bill altogether.
But as Chief Executive Lam was about to begin her speech, opposition lawmakers began shouting and climbing on tables.
They also projected the words ""Five demands - not one less"" on the wall behind her. Since the protests began, they have widened from rallies against the bill to five key demands - including universal suffrage.
Opposition lawmaker Tanya Chan said Ms Lam was to blame for the Hong Kong's troubles.
""Both her hands are soaked with blood,"" she said. ""We hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability. She is not suitable to be chief executive.""
It was the first time a Hong Kong chief executive had been unable to deliver a policy address in the chamber.
Pro-establishment lawmakers condemned the interruption of the session - saying the address was important for Hong Kong's economic future.
After the assembly was suspended, a pre-recorded speech was made available on the Legco website instead.
In the address, Ms Lam stressed her commitment to ""one country, two systems"" - the parallel political system introduced in Hong Kong after British rule ended - and said calls for Hong Kong independence would not be tolerated.
She announced several housing and infrastructure policies, saying housing was the most urgent issue the city faces.
In a news conference after the address, Ms Lam rejected claims that her speech ignored the demands of the protest movement.
But she said it was not the time to consider voting reform, while insisting Hong Kong did have freedom of speech and freedom of the press without Chinese interference.
The developments came just hours after Hong Kong protesters won a show of support from US lawmakers, who passed a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city.
Carrie Lam hoped this moment might signal the beginning of the end for Hong Kong's political crisis.
The cover page of her policy address was bright blue, she said, to represent the clear skies ahead. But the first full session of Hong Kong's parliament since it was stormed by protesters in July was cut short.
Other leaders in other places might have faced them down. But Hong Kong's limited form of democracy doesn't produce that kind of pugilistic politician, able to appeal over the heads of opponents to the public at large.
Which is of course the central point at the heart of the deep divisions splitting this society apart.
The tightly-managed political system seen as a source of stability and strength by supporters - like the ruling Communist Party in Beijing - is seen as a threat and a fundamental weakness for those taking to the streets to argue against it.
Hong Kong is part of China but, as a former British colony, has some autonomy and people have more rights.
The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence.
The government in September promised the bill would be withdrawn once parliament resumed but demonstrations continued.
Demands have since widened into five key demands:
In a conversation with the EU representative in Hong Kong earlier this week, Ms Lam reportedly ruled out even debating universal suffrage in the current climate.
Protests have taken place every weekend over the past month and in every district, causing widespread disruption.
Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.
Ms Lam's address was scheduled just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping said any attempt to divide China would end in ""bodies smashed and bones ground to powder"" - comments seen as an implicit warning to Hong Kong."

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
Kafkaesque is one word that encapsulates the entire Paris Conference. It is defined as:
A nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to, although strongly surreal. With an ethereal, “evil”, omnipotent power floating just beyond the senses.
 
There are insufficient superlatives to describe the disaster that is the UN COP21 Climate Conference in Paris. None of the superlatives are the ones used by the organizers and their lackeys. It is the largest, most political conference ever, based on completely false claims deliberately created in the greatest science deception in history. It will cost more socially in direct damage to individual lives, communities, and social structures. It will cost more in economic damage to jobs, businesses, and industry. In addition, besides destroying lives it will remove freedom and actually cost lives. It will weaken economies preventing resistance to terrorism. This far exceeds any potential damage from terrorism and is much worse because it is self-inflicted (Figure 1). 

Figure 1
Maurice Strong died on the eve of the Paris Climate Conference. They are there because of him. They propose a global energy and environment agenda based on completely false science because of him. I do believe in talking ill of the dead if the evil they created continues after they die. Such is the case with Maurice Strong. Paris is a meeting of global leaders completely conned by the master manipulator – the person who fooled the world. Paris is an Orwellian gathering of people who want to save the planet, but who really want to rule the world in their manner. The French government underscored the Orwellian nature of the meeting with a government directive,
…citing the state of emergency powers and scrapping the human rights convention as justification.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would sympathize with this directive because his father did a similar thing.
The people of Quebec are legally identified in the Canadian constitution as a distinct nation with cultural and language differences from the rest of Canada. In addition, they have their own territory (state), so their desire to become a separate nation-state was well within any of the rules set down by the Treaty of Versailles and the United Nations Charter. Pierre Trudeau used the excuse of two deaths in the struggle by the Quebec separatists (FLQ) to invoke the War Measures Act that took away every citizen’s rights completely. He then used the Canadian military to keep them silent and submissive at gunpoint.
It is not difficult to imagine any of the leaders at Paris using any excuse to take control in a similar manner. Ironically, most don’t seem to realize that the entire objective of the conference is to subjugate and then eliminate them and the individual nation states they represent. Maurice Strong planned this when he set up the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), organized and chaired the 1992 Rio Conference and created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce the false scientific justification.
The most telling analysis of Maurice Strong occupies approximately 20 percent of Elaine Dewar’s book Cloak of Green.[1] The book is classic journalism because Dewar wanted to write in praise of Canadian environmentalists Maurice Strong, David Suzuki and Elizabeth May now Green Party leader and part of the Canadian Paris delegation. Dewar’s research revealed a very different story. She discovered that they were more manipulative, controlling, and with a specific political agenda than any of the people they attacked.
Strong told Dewar that it was necessary to get rid of the industrialized nations. His reason was based on the Club of Rome neo-Malthusian claim that world population was using up all resources at an unsustainable rate. He told Dewar he couldn’t do anything as a politician but at the UN
He could raise his own money from whomever he liked, appoint anyone he wanted, control the agenda.
Dewar concluded after five days with Strong at the UN that:
Strong was using the U.N. as a platform to sell a global environment crisis and the Global Governance Agenda.
Paris is the culmination of Strong’s time at the UN. A meeting built round the greatest deception in history, a deliberately created lie.
John Holdren was a very active part of the Club of Rome and carried Strong’s climate message into the White House as Obama’s science advisor. The message of undermining developed industrialized nations like the US and redistributing their wealth to developing nations oppressed by US imperialism suited Obama’s belief. He took up Strong’s deliberately orchestrated false story for his legacy. He will find out that you cannot create a legacy – history decides.
Vaclav Klaus was the only world leader to explain what was going on. He knew about totalitarian control and destruction. As he explained at the New York Heartland Climate Conference, we have just escaped 70 years of communism why the hell would you want to go back to that? He summarized the situation in a brief book titled, Blue Planet in Green Shackles, subtitled What is Endangered: Climate or Freedom? (Figure 2). 

Figure 2
Obama used his political skills to bring together a disparate group of people whose views and understandings are in absolute conflict. A well informed catholic Pope would not sit down with socialists advocating a dramatic reduction in world population by any means possible, especially abortion. The juxtaposition is exemplified in likely one of the most bizarre images ever. Surrealist Salvador Dali portrayed the crucifixion from a different perspective than anybody else (Figure 3).

Figure 3
At least, it was the most unique before Evo Morales, Marxist President of Bolivia gave a statue to Pope Francis recently (Figure 3).

Figure 4
To make sure the Pope could not just pass off the statue of a crucifixion of Jesus Christ on a hammer and sickle and move on he put the same symbol on the chain around the Pope’s neck (Figure 5).

Figure 5.
Kafka would understand the scenario, but he likely could not have dreamed up such a plot and cast of characters.
John Ralston Saul wrote a book called Voltaire’s Bastards. It used the same device as an earlier play by Dostoevsky. This has a person of great historical influence return only to be shocked by the interpretation and devolution of his ideas. For Dostoevsky, it was Jesus Christ returning in the middle of the Spanish Inquisition and wandering around saying this is not what I intended. Saul has Voltaire come back in today’s world to learn that the Age of Reason and Enlightenment he envisioned is equally distorted. He would have understood one thing about Paris based on his observation that,
Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that all government efforts to stop global warming and cut carbon dioxide emissions were anti-life and against the interests of mankind.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this generation of foolish politicians are the first in history to complain about the beneficial effects that have always accompanied the periodic but short warm eras that punctuate earth’s history.
“The human story is intimately tied to the grand cycles of climate and the Chicken Littles should study these before squawking.

“Distant climate history is well recorded in rock strata, ice cores, tree rings, ancient shore lines, marine sediments, pollen distribution, fossil occurrences, coral reef growth, and carbon isotope ratios. More recent history is abundantly supplemented in clay tablets, cave paintings, rock art, ancient scrolls, inscriptions, historical events and records, monuments and epitaphs, the rise and fall of empires and direct records of temperature, sun spots, river levels, rainfall, droughts, floods, heat waves and bone chilling blizzards.
“Anyone who studies these records will see that eras warmer than today are periodic but short chapters in the earth story. The most recent major ice age ended a mere 11,500 year ago, when the Modern Interglacial commenced. Since then, earth has experienced five warm eras.
“In the first warm era starting about 4300 BC, the Sahara bloomed with plants, forests spread over Northern Europe and Canada and there was sufficient water for irrigation in Arabia. This era ended when blizzards and ice returned for nearly 1,000 years. Another short warm era started about 1450 BC, but was ended by another bout of cold dry weather that caused depopulation in Greece and Turkey and hardship everywhere.
“In the Roman Warm era, starting about 250 BC, the world smiled again and populations grew. But the warmth was cut short by the return of the snows which forced Vikings and Norsemen out of their frozen North to pillage and then colonise warmer southern lands.
“Then we had the Medieval Warm Period, starting about 800 AD, a time of great achievement and prosperity. Farmers moved back into Scotland and Norway, Greenland was colonised and corn was grown. Vineyards produced wine near Manchester, in East Prussia and Norway. Even Tasmania warmed up. Trade and industry flourished and people had surpluses for culture and education. Cambridge, Oxford and Bologna Universities were founded and cathedrals and temples were built at Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame, Canterbury, Cologne, Florence, Castile and Angkor Wat.
“But Jack Frost returned with the Little Ice Age starting about 1300 AD. Famine, food riots and disease again stalked Europe. Glaciers advanced, ice caps expanded, droughts and blizzards became more common and gales wracked Europe (and destroyed the Spanish Armada). Frosts killed orchards, North Sea cod moved south, food prices soared and farms were abandoned. In Scotland and Norway the capitals moved south and villages were abandoned. The Greenland colony perished. During the frigid years of the Dalton Minimum (1790 – 1820 AD) Napoleon’s Grand Army perished in a bitter Russian winter.
“Then in 1860, with no help from men burning coal or oil, earth started to warm again. This continued until 1942. A cooling spell from 1942 to 1976 had the Alarmists worried that the ice was about to return, but warming resumed from 1976 to 1998. Temperatures have been cooling slightly since then, despite the boom in burning of coal and oil.
“Even a casual glance at climate and human history will show that the warm eras like today are far more beneficial for all life than the cold dry eras.
“People prefer warm climates. They do not flock to Alaska, Archangel or Antarctica for winter – they head for Bermuda, the Black Sea or Bali. All over the world, the human race is migrating towards the sun belts – Florida, the Riviera, and Capricornia – very few volunteer to live in Siberia or Patagonia. President Putin voiced what many Russians must think – “a bit of warmth would be welcome here”.
“Moreover, a bit of warmth would vastly increase the land suitable for growing food and fibres. On the other hand, a slight cooling would take much of the farmlands of Canada, Northern Eurasia and New Zealand out of production, and parts of Tasmania and Victoria may have to convert from producing wheat and dairy products to farming caribou or reindeer.
“Warm eras also provide more rainfall because of the additional evaporation from oceans, lakes, snow and ice.
“When warmth and moisture are combined with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the beneficial effects on plant life are multiplied. A doubling of the CO2 content of the air would have insignificant effect on global warming but would have marvellous effects on plant (and then animal) life:

Growth rate of herbaceous plants would increase 30%
Growth rate of forest plants would increase 50%
All plants would be more tolerant of drought and heat
Food production would need less land and less artificial fertiliser
“All of this magic can be achieved by allowing man’s activities to recycle more CO2 and water to the atmosphere. Why then are politicians taxing carbon and encouraging people to waste money on foolish schemes such as trying to bury valuable carbon dioxide in artificial and expensive carbon cemeteries?
“The whole animal kingdom, including mankind, relies totally on plants to survive. Without grasses and cereals on land and plankton in the sea, most of mankind would starve.
“All plants need moisture, warmth, and carbon dioxide to grow and flourish. Why then are we having hysterics because the earth is currently blessed with more than average of these three magic life sustainers?
“Even the dumbest sheep in Australia knows that being warm, watered and well fed is better than being cold, thirsty and starving.”
“Maybe we should give sheep a vote?”

“Knowing and understanding the past is a vital key to the future, and earth scientists can present much of this information in a context that can assist in exposing the truth and misrepresentations of the current “Climate Change” debate.
“It is fact that the vast bulk of the Great Barrier Reef area was exposed land and above sea level, prior to 10,000 years ago, when sea levels were over 70m lower than present. There was no great coral reef there until recently, and Kakadu was probably not a swampy wetland then either.”

If bullshit were rain, then Australia’s bushfires would be doused in an instant by the tidal wave of effluent pouring out of legacy media and social media alike. Much of the most egregious verbal sewage is spewing from the mouthpieces of the green-left, but the right aren’t immune, either, unfortunately.



Take for instance, the response to this report from 7News in Australia.



Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice.



This is true. There have been hundreds of arrests for arson, including in some of the areas most devastated by fire.



Unfortunately, **Paul Joseph Watson** takes this fact and runs just a little too far with it.



Authorities in Australia are working on the premise that arsonists and lightning strikes are to blame for bushfires that have devastated numerous areas of the country, not “climate change” as many global warming alarmists have claimed.



In fact, the police are saying nothing here about climate change. They are simply saying that arsonists are to blame for actually igniting many fires. Whether or not climate change created the conditions that made so much of the country a tinderbox is not something that the police have addressed at all. Certainly, several scientists (including some well situated within the anthropogenic climate change camp, such as Prof. Andy Pitman), have discredited claims that the fires can be blamed on climate change.



But, as Watson rightly observes, that hasn’t stopped many on the green-left from shooting their fool mouths off.



Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.



Earlier this week, **Bernie Sanders** blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.”



However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it.



But, they haven’t said that at all. Whether or not it’s true, Jones is drawing a bow too far.



Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change.



What Watson is referring to here is the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Like El Niño in the Pacific, the IOD is a natural phenomenon – but one which some claim is being exacerbated or made more frequent by the current period of climate change. There is indeed some evidence that “positive” IODs (which are bad news for Australia) may be becoming more frequent and coinciding more often with El Niño events.



That, of course, does not mean that human activity is responsible. But it’s certainly **not** nothing to do with climate change.



In many ways, Watson is probably right: so-called “green tape” (in conjunction with a rare, but naturally-occurring mega-drought), is most likely the proximate cause of the unusual scale and ferocity of these fires, while arsonists are directly responsible for igniting many of them. Just don’t go attributing to “authorities” things that they didn’t actually say.



As Nietzsche said, “He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster”. Just because the legacy media is lying through its teeth doesn’t mean new media can be any more careless with facts.

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"**Gamers are complaining they are unable to delete their Activision Blizzard accounts, as they attempt to show solidarity with an e-sports competitor.**
The US publisher caused controversy by placing a 12-month ban on a player who had voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong on Sunday.
Users say they get error messages when they try to erase their accounts. Some suggest it could be deliberate.
But the firm has indicated a technical problem is to blame.
""There's an issue affecting the site which our engineers are currently addressing... it's a priority for us to have this resolved,"" one of its North America accounts tweeted.
The BBC's request for a comment has not yet been answered.
Some players in Europe have said they are able to cancel their profiles but have raised concerns that they are being asked to first upload government-issued IDs.
The firm has defended this on the grounds that it needs to be sure of their identity as the process cannot be reversed.
Activision Blizzard is behind some of the most popular console, PC and mobile video games, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
Now some players, who have been unable to wipe their accounts, are threatening to tell their banks to block the company from deducting payments.
Protests began after the firm banned professional video game player, Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung.
After playing its Hearthstone online card game at a tournament, Blitzchung had called out in Mandarin, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,"" during a live-streamed interview.
The organisers wrote in a statement that the 21-year-old had broken competition rules and would not receive any prize money.
On 8 October, he was told he would not be allowed to compete professionally at Hearthstone for one year.
The hashtag #Blizzardboycott subsequently trended on Twitter.
And since then, the firm has faced a growing backlash from both customers and some employees.
The Daily Beast news site reported that a small group of workers at the company's Los Angeles office staged a walkout in protest.
The matter has also drawn the attention of US politicians.
The row threatens to overshadow one of the firm's biggest releases of the year - its latest Call of Duty console title - which is due to go on sale on 25 October."

From Washington State University: Closing the Case on an Ancient Archeological Mystery
Solving 4,000-year-old mystery helps WSU archeologist find useful resource for a warmer future
Barley cultivation in Jiuzhaigou National Park hasn’t changed much in nearly 2,000 years. The park is located in the Min Shan mountain range, Northern Sichuan in South Western China. Credit: Washington State University
PULLMAN, Wash.–Climate change may be responsible for the abrupt collapse of civilization on the fringes of the Tibetan Plateau around 2000 B.C.
WSU archaeologist Jade D’Alpoim Guedes and an international team of researchers found that cooling global temperatures at the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a 4,000 year period of warm weather, would have made it impossible for ancient people on the Tibetan Plateau to cultivate millet, their primary food source.
Guedes’ team’s research recently was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Her results provide the first convincing explanation for why the area’s original inhabitants either left or so abruptly changed their lifestyles.
They also help explain the success of farmers who practiced wheat and barley agriculture in the region 300 years later.
Unlike millet, wheat and barley have high frost tolerance and a low heat requirement, making them ideally suited for the high altitudes and cold weather of eastern Tibet. Guedes argues this made the two crops an important facet of subsistence immediately after their introduction around 1700 B.C.
“Wheat and barley came in at the opportune moment, right when millets were losing their ability to be grown on the Tibetan Plateau,” Guedes said. “It was a really exciting pattern to notice. The introduction of wheat and barley really enabled Tibetan culture to take the form it has today, and their unique growth patterns may have played a crucial rule in the spread of these crops as staples across the vast region of East Asia.”
One offshoot of the research: The ancient millet seeds that fell out of cultivation on the Tibetan Plateau as the climate got colder might soon be useful again as the climate warms up.
“Right now, these millets have almost become forgotten crops,” Guedes said. “But due to their heat tolerance and high nutritional value, they may be once again be useful resources for a warmer future.”
An archaeological enigma
At Ashaonao, Haimenkou, and other archeological sites in the Tibetan highlands, researchers for years had noticed a growing trend. An abundance of ancient wheat and barley seeds found at the sites suggested the crops rapidly replaced millet as the staple food source of the region during the second millennium BCE.
The findings were puzzling considering that the scientific consensus of the time was the region’s climate would have actually favored millet, due to its shorter growing season, over wheat or barley.
The conundrum intrigued Guedes so she dove into the agronomy literature to investigate. She found agronomists tended to use a different measurement than archaeologists to determine whether crops can grow in cold, high altitude environments like the Tibetan Plateau. They used total growing degree days or the accumulated amount of heat plants need over their lifetime rather than the length of a growing season.
“My colleagues and I created a new model based off what we found in the literature,” Guedes said. “It revealed that global cooling would have made it impossible to grow millet in the Eastern Tibetan Highlands at this time but would have been amenable to growing wheat and barley. Our work turned over previous assumptions and explained why millet is no longer a staple crop in the area after 2000 BCE.”
Guedes’ work points to climate cooling as the culprit behind the collapse of early civilization on the Tibetan Plateau. Ironically, the region is today one of the areas experiencing the most rapid climate warming on the planet. There are some areas in the southeastern plateau where temperatures are 6 degrees Celsius higher than they were 200 years ago.
Rapid temperature increase is making it difficult for the region’s inhabitants to raise and breed yaks, a staple form of subsistence in the central Asian highlands, and grow cold weather crops, once again endangering their survival.
“So now we have a complete reversal and climate warming is having a big impact on the livelihood of smaller farmers on the Tibetan Plateau,” Guedes said.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called for an end to all government promotion and subsidies for the domestic production of ethanol.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that all taxpayers, all consumers of food and most farmers will be harmed by the creation of an artificial industry producing subsidised ethanol.
“Subsidising the production of ethanol will waste taxes, harm the environment, cause sharply increased costs for everyone in the food chain, and do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or air pollution.

“Many people think that ethanol production will provide wins for the whole community – farmers, the community and the environment. But there is no free lunch.
“As usual with government promotions, the benefits are obvious but the costs are hidden.
“Most of the benefits will go to large corporations set up to harvest ethanol subsidies, and some will trickle down to those growing cereals and sugar cane – they will get higher prices for their products than they would otherwise.
“The majority of farmers will be losers – all those using grains or molasses for supplementary feeding of cattle, horses, chooks, sheep and pigs will see their feed prices increase – this has already happened in America.
“Higher prices for grains and sugar will then pass thru farms, feedlots and factories to show up as rising costs for cereals, bacon, eggs, milk, meat and all sweets – a hidden ethanol tax on every breakfast table.
“In addition, the inevitable government subsidies or tax breaks for ethanol will consume tax dollars, giving higher taxes for tax payers or lower services for tax consumers.
“Then there are environmental costs. We will use heaps of diesel tractor fuel to bring marginal land, either grassland or bush, into a dead mono-culture of cereals or cane. (Professor Ausubel of the Rockefeller University in New York has calculated that each car would need 1-2 hectares of pasture to produce its motor fuel in this inefficient way.) And the excessive cultivation and chemical fertilisers used will reduce the soil organic matter and produce – – – – – more greenhouse gases.
“Then when we burn ethanol in cars, we get the same old dreaded greenhouse gases, water vapour and carbon dioxide – releasing exactly the same amount of these gases as were removed from the environment by the growing plant a few months before.
“Moreover, the cultivation, harvesting, transport and processing of the ethanol inputs adds more pollutants to the atmosphere – in fact, careful energy audits show that there is less energy in a gallon of ethanol than is required to produce it from plant material (see reference below).
“And what do we do in times of drought – burn our cereals and sugar in ethanol cars and import food to eat?
“Finally, who pays for the damage or modifications required to many engines to allow them to use ethanol?
“If people think ethanol can be produced profitably in a competitive market with no tax breaks or subsidies, they should be free to try with their own dollars.
“But taxpayers and consumers should not be forced to subsidise the ethanol industry – any full audit will show that the costs outweigh the benefits.
“If the government wants to increase energy security or reduce the price of motor fuel they should remove all the barriers to exploring for oil in Australia or producing gas or liquid fuels from Australian coals.”

"**Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in two weeks of clashes between the Ethiopian military and forces loyal to the political leadership in the northern Tigray region.**
As the conflict escalates, we've seen continuing attempts to share false or misleading information about the situation.
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appears in uniform talking on a phone in a Facebook post which supports the campaign in Tigray by the Ethiopian army.
There are three photos of the prime minister, and the post has been shared more than 1,000 times.
It was posted in the name of Taye Dendea Aredo, ruling party spokesperson for the Oromia region, but has used a doctored picture.
A reverse image search shows the one of him apparently on the phone is a generic one, which has been used before in stories about the US army.
We traced the original, shown above, to an image database owned by Getty Images.
It was taken in Ukraine in 2017, but has been edited to make the soldier look more like Mr Abiy, with facial hair added in.
We contacted Taye Dendea Aredo about this image. He told us he had not used it, but did not clarify how it got into this particular post.
A video appearing to show an Ethiopian military plane being fired on and then crashing has been widely shared with the claim it was carrying out an attack on the Tigray region.
But this footage is not real, and is from a recording of a military video simulation game called Arma.
There are some clues, such as the unnatural look of the blue background, and that some of the smoke coming from the plane just before it eventually crashes dissipates too quickly in some places.
We traced the original to a war game video on a Japanese YouTube channel.
The versions that have been shared have been edited to remove the start and the ending, where there is a disclaimer in Japanese saying the video is fiction.
Some videos that have been shared also contain an image in the top left of a plane on fire, which is a real image but not from Ethiopia.
We have traced that image to a 2016 report about a Jordanian air force F-16 crash as a result of a technical fault.
There's plenty of sharing of misleading images of attacks or their aftermath.
In some cases they are from other parts of the world and pre-date the current conflict in Ethiopia.
**1.** A Facebook page supporting the federal government's military operation appears to have used an image from Uzbekistan.
It shows a striking photo taken from above of a military plane firing rockets, and has also been used by social media accounts to illustrate what is going on in Tigray.
But a closer inspection of the image shows it has the watermark ""Uz Air Force A. Pecchi"" on it.
Uz stands for Uzbekistan, and A.Pecchi is the photographer Anthony Pecchi. The photographer shared the photo on his own Facebook account in January this year.
**2.** Some online users have used a misleading photo to show the results of an attack by Tigray forces on Bahir Dar in the Amhara region, while others have used it to show an attack by them on Asmara, the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.
The photo being used is actually of an explosion in China's port city of Tianjin in 2015 at a warehouse containing hazardous chemicals.
The BBC covered the story, and one of the images in the piece is exactly the same as that shared in the posts about Ethiopia's conflict.
**3.** A Facebook page has shared a video which the owner says shows missile attacks carried out by Tigray forces against Eritrea's capital Asmara (which they claim is assisting the Ethiopian government in the conflict - a claim it denies).
There were news reports of a Tigrayan rocket attack on Asmara recently, but these images do not show that incident.
The Facebook account put the video on a loop so it kept repeating for two hours, as if it was a live event.
But the video, which has been shared more than 1,000 times, is not from Eritrea at all, and has been taken from video of an Iranian missile attack on a US army base in Iraq in January this year.
The BBC published a story about that incident in Iraq with video, and you can see the same images in that story.

 **Richard Harman** , in his first _Politik_ article of the year, focuses on a very interesting topic, _Facing up to the rise of populism._ He concentrates mainly on the views of David Parker and his concerns on the subject. Harman rightly points out that in Opposition the Labour Party opposed the TPP and then after the 2017 election made a few cosmetic changes and joined the trade grouping. Parker’s view is that trade is a way of defeating the rise of populism which he think is brought about in part by the ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. He argues that while trade deals are often seen to benefit larger companies, e.g. Fonterra, it is beneficial to the country as a whole.



I would agree.



What disturbs Parker is the type of populism engendered by Trump & Johnson. He sees this form of populism as a possible threat to his party and is determined to stop it from taking root in this country. This brings an interesting scenario into play. For a political party to succeed with populism you first need a populist leader. **Labour has one, National doesn’t.** America has one as does Britain. The difference between the two overseas leaders and our one is that the two offshore have the ability to know how to retain the populist vote. Retaining the populist vote is all to do with introducing policies that are relevant to that part of the population and little to do with hugging and dress ups.



Harman says Parker is concerned about the survival of capitalism as it faces a series of direct challenges. What worries him is the rise of populism in the United States and Europe and its attractiveness to the blue-collar voter. Despite Brexit, I presume he lumps the UK in with Europe. He understands that for a traditional working-class party like Labour, that represents an existential threat. His mission, therefore, in politics seems to be to moderate capitalism so that those who might be tempted here to introduce the politics of Brexit or Trump or European nationalism do not get a look in. Apart from ACT, who are the only true right-wing party, who would he be talking about?



There are lessons here for both major parties. Labour needs to look after its working-class vote unlike its namesake in Britain and the Democrats in America whose only aim in life is to fail to get rid of Trump. In the British election, the northern and Midland red wall collapsed due to Labour losing interest in their core support. Labour’s support came largely from the young, the urban and the student voters. That is never enough to win an election. **Trump and Johnson won on creating jobs.** That is the number one priority for workers. Trump has done that and Johnson will do the same in the north of England. Labour here need to cut the Greens loose. The jobs they talk about under their ‘green energy’ nonsense are nothing more than a pipe dream. Anything that currently creates jobs in Taranaki or the West Coast they’re not interested in. Hence Shane Jones’s recent comments.



The lessons here for National are many but I doubt they’ll learn from them. First, make friends with the farmers. You are supposed to be their party. You need to show an independent stance in agricultural, environmental and climate policies. **Stop sucking up to Labour.** Introduce policies that create jobs. Embrace the populism Mr Parker is so afraid of. Do a Johnson. Do a Trump. **Support free speech.** Support responsible gun owners. Start looking like a true right-wing party instead of some wish-washy half pie lefty liberal outfit. But here’s the catch. To achieve the above it helps to have a populist leader.



David Parker is right to be concerned. Both in America and Britain, the working class voted right rather than left. Why? One word – jobs. In America, the workers saw industries fleeing the country and with them jobs. In Britain the workers saw Europe as the problem and therefore supported Brexit and Boris. Parker might want to moderate capitalism but that is the very vehicle for creating jobs. This is the ghastly conundrum for the left. They hate capitalism but know they can’t live without it.



So Parker wants to moderate it. In other words, half in half out. Doesn’t work. Just ask [Harry and Meghan.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/runaway-royals/)

http://www.breitbart.com/killing-40000-poor-people-a-year/
==========================================
The latest story on “green energy” here at the German online FOCUS weekly news magazine actually shocked me.
Europe’s energy policy is, under the bottom line, costing the lives of tens of thousands of citizens – all at the holy altar of “climate protection”. The title of the FOCUS article:
“The grand electricity lie”: Why electricity is becoming a luxury
One of the sickest things about Europe and its disconnected leaders is that often it takes a full-scale disaster to happen before policy gets corrected. Often the scale of the death and devastation becomes known only after the clean-up crews have come in and sifted through the rubble. Think, for example, of Nazism, the Holocaust – or Soviet communism.
In the above named examples the true scale of devastation left behind became clear only after the drunk-on-ideology tyrants were defeated and their legacy finally put in the spotlight.
FOCUS now cites a documentary film which is set to be broadcast this evening on European television station ARTE. The documentary presents how Europe’s electricity prices are spiraling out of control, and the horrible consequences this is having on the continent’s citizens.
40,000 dead from power being shut off
The situation, we are discovering, is far more disturbing than even the earlier worst case scenarios every imagined. FOCUS reports (emphasis added):
In 2014 in Europe there were about 40,000 winter deaths because millions of people were unable to pay for their electric bills – the so-called energy poverty currently impacts about ten percent of all Europeans. In the past 8 years the price of electricity in Europe has climbed by an average of 42 percent.”
7 million German households in energy poverty
FOCUS writes that the poor are the real victims of “socialist” Europe’s clean energy drive. In Bulgaria people see half of their income gobbled up by energy costs alone. In Spain 28 percent of the citizens live in “energy poverty”. In Germany, FOCUS writes, 7 million households are considered to be living in “energy poverty”.

The consequences of energy poverty are profound: tens of thousands of deaths every year, as millions lose their power.
Coming energy-caused mass die-off
Of course one needs to be very careful when describing disasters involving mass-death and bad science. History has seen so many over the 20th century alone. In the current century we have seen already tens of thousands die because they have been denied affordable energy, a product which in any advanced society is (or used to be) considered a fundamental human right, just as is clean water.
How much more unaffordable must energy become, and many more tens of thousands of wintertime deaths does Europe have to witness before the continent’s leaders wake up to the “green energy” folly? There are no longer any excuses. The facts and data are out there, and leaders need to take life-saving action. Refusing to do so at this point borders on gross negligence.
Rising tide of anger
The ARTE documentary reportedly shows how Europe’s citizens, including environmental activists, are becoming more worried and that electricity is now increasingly being called a “luxury product”. FOCUS adds:
Their anger is clearly palpable as indeed governments have deceived and disappointed many citizens, and they cannot cope with the protests.”
As electricity prices spiral out of control and mass, uncontrolled immigration of Arabians continues, Europe is keeping its social power kegs especially dry.
UPDATE: Price development of Germany power prices:

After the German market liberalization of the 1990s, electricity prices for consumers fell and became affordable. But after the enactment of the feed-in act prices rose strongly and now 7 million households are in “energy poverty”. Source: BDEW.

Alex Sen Gupta, a biological scientist, has written an article (reviewed by John Cook) which attempts to defend the validity of climate models which can’t predict the climate.
According to Gupta;
To understand what’s happening, it is critical to realise that the climate changes for a number of reasons in addition to CO₂. These include solar variations, volcanic eruptions and human aerosol emissions.
The influence of all these “climate drivers” are included in modern climate models. On top of this, our climate also changes as a result of natural and largely random fluctuations – like the El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, [IPO] – that can redistribute heat to the deep ocean (thereby masking surface warming).
Such fluctuations are unpredictable beyond a few months (or possibly years), being triggered by atmospheric and oceanic weather systems. So while models do generate fluctuations like ENSO and IPO, in centennial scale simulations they don’t (and wouldn’t be expected to) occur at the same time as they do in observations.

The problem with this claim is that, as Gupta says, the climate models are supposed to take these random fluctuations into account. Climate models are supposed to accommodate randomness, by providing a range of predicted values – the range is produced by plugging in different values for the random elements which cannot be predicted. However, observations are right on the lower border of that range. The divergence between climate models and predictions is now so great, that climate models are on the brink of being incontrovertibly falsified.
As Judith Curry recently said, If the pause continues for 20 years (a period for which none of the climate models showed a pause in the presence of greenhouse warming), the climate models will have failed a fundamental test of empirical adequacy.
This is important, because it strikes at the heart of the claim that climate models can detect human influence on climate change. If climate models cannot model climate, if the models cannot be reconciled with observations, how can the models possibly be useful for attributing the causes climate change? If scientists defending the models claim the discrepancy is because of random fluctuations in the climate, which have pushed the models to the brink of falsification, doesn’t this demonstrate that, at the very least, the models very likely underestimate the amount of randomness in the climate? Is it possible that the entire 20th century warming might be one large random fluctuation?
Nature is certainly capable of producing large, rapid climate fluctuations, such as the Younger Dryas, an abrupt return to ice age conditions which occurred 12,500 years ago. You can’t use climate models which demonstrably underestimate the randomness of climate change, to calculate how much of the observed 20th century warming is not random.
If current mainstream climate models cannot predict the climate, then scientists have to consider the possibility that other models, with different assumptions, can do a better job. It is no accident that Monckton, Soon, Legates and Brigg’s paper on an irreducibly simple climate model, which does a better job of hind casting climate than mainstream models, has received over 10,000 downloads. As every scientific revolution in history has demonstrated, being right is ultimately more important than being mainstream, even if it sometimes takes a few years to win acceptance.
For now, mainstream climate scientists are mostly hiding in the fringes of their estimates. When they acknowledge it at all, they claim that the anomaly, the pause, is a low probability event which is still consistent with climate models. Hans Von Storch, one of the giants of German climate research, a few years ago claimed that 98% of climate models cannot be reconciled with reality – which still, for now, leaves 2% possibility that climate scientists are right.
Is the world really preparing to spend billions, trillions of dollars, on a 2% bet?

A new federal report on school choice has just been released, and it is full of good news about private schooling, except for one thing: its market share is small, and getting smaller. In large part this is because private institutions are competing against schools for which people must pay taxes and are “free” to users: public schools, including charter schools that people often see as private (minus pesky tuition, plus state testing and, often, other intrusive government rules). Still, chartering is better than simply being assigned to a school based on your home address. Which brings us to some highlights:



 **Decreased Government Assignment to Schools**



Add together all the homeschooling, private schooling, charters, and choice among district public schools, and the percentage of families attending an assigned public school has dropped from 74 percent in 1999 to 69 percent in 2016. Still way too high for a free country, but moving in the right direction.





**Private Schools are Safer and Kinder Than Public**



We’ve seen this studied before, but this report again shows that private schools as a whole are safer and have better climates than public schools. As the charts below indicate, private schools are the sites of less gang activity, hate‐​related graffiti, hate‐​related utterances, and bullying than public schools.





**Private Schools are Far More Satisfying on Many Measures**



Whether it’s teachers, academic standards, discipline, staff interactions, or the school overall, parents using private schools are much more likely to be “very satisfied” even than parents who have chosen a public school.





These results would change, at least somewhat, were we to adjust them for family income, race, or other variables. But it is hard to spin this as anything but a positive report for the ability to choose among private schools.

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   The sibling rivalry, at least on the tennis tour, started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters. It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena,   (4)   in a   match that  —   as intrusive as it felt to watch  —   surely drew more attention than any   match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a   moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. “I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a    girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her,” said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. “Such a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: ‘When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer?’ “You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. ” The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10  —   Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova  —   and one current member, the   No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus’s draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players  —   past or present  —   and including only one seeded player: No. 24 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. On Thursday, she had to scrap and come back to win,   (3)     against the powerful unseeded American CoCo Vandeweghe, while Serena cruised past the unseeded Croat Mirjana      . Serena, who already holds a   edge over her sister, could be the fresher player, too, on Saturday. But the psychology remains complex and the fallout unpredictable, even after all these years. “When I’m playing on the court with her, I think I’m playing the best competitor in the game,” Venus said. “I don’t think I’m chump change either, you know. I can compete against any odds. No matter what, I can get out there, and I compete. ” They have not played since the 2015 United States Open, when Serena won,       in a quarterfinal in which Venus attacked, often successfully, from the start but had no answer in the end for Serena’s ultimate weapon: her first serve. It was an intense match in which the big crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed more reflective than fully engaged one in which Serena’s celebration was understandably subdued with her sister across the net, even if their matches are no longer the awkward, constricted affairs of their early years. Saturday’s final in Melbourne could be intriguing on multiple levels, in part because of the Australian public. Venus is viewed here, as elsewhere, as a sympathetic figure: the older sister who has handled the younger’s greater tennis success unselfishly and with dignity. And though both sisters have had to cope with major health problems and family tragedy, with the murder of their half sister Yetunde Price in 2003, Venus is the one whose tennis fortunes dipped more dramatically. A   Grand Slam singles champion and a former No. 1, she did not advance past the third round in any major event in singles from late 2011 to the end of the 2014 season. She was a major star reduced to a minor role, largely because of an autoimmune disorder  —   Sjogren’s syndrome, diagnosed in 2011  —   that sapped her strength and endurance. When Russian hackers breached the World   Agency’s databases last fall, it was revealed that Venus had needed 13   exemptions for drugs in recent years. The retirement questions to which Bartoli referred started during that period. But Venus’s ability to cope with her condition has improved, and after rejoining the top 10 in 2015, she reached the semifinals at Wimbledon last year and then the final here. “She never even thought of the word retire,” said David Witt, her coach and hitting partner of 10 years. “I just think when she got diagnosed, it was a step back, a shock. She’s learned a lot about how to deal with it and her body, how to eat, how to manage it. “There are days she can’t work as hard as she wants to work. Some days it’s maybe not smart to do it because it will then hurt you for two or three more days. Where she is now in her career, she has to listen to her body, and I don’t think she really needs to go out and hit balls for two hours. ” Witt said there were no more    sessions in the   or in time off tour: just one session in the morning and then gym work, primarily sprints, core strengthening and flexibility. “It took her years and years to realize that stretching is important and can keep you healthier,” he said. “The more flexible you are, you’re not going to strain or pull anything. I’ve been with her 10 years, and I think it took seven years to get her to stretch. She likes to do a lot of dancing, and that consists of a lot of stretching and being flexible, so I think that’s helped. ” Her dance skills were in evidence Thursday as she pirouetted after beating Vandeweghe, but what will linger longest in memory were her screams of delight at having conquered an inspired young opponent in a semifinal. It was a moment she described as “just joy. ” “You could really see the happiness on her face,” Serena said. “I’ve been there when she was down and out of it, and back and in it. I’ve been there for all those moments, so I just really was oh so happy. ” As visceral as her reaction on court was, she was nothing but considered in the interview room. “I think why people love sport so much is because you see everything in a line,” Venus said. “In that moment, there is no  . There’s no retake. There is no  . It’s triumph and disaster witnessed in real time. “This is why people live and die for sport, because you can’t fake it. You can’t. It’s either you do it or you don’t. People relate to the champion. They also relate to the person who didn’t win, because we all have those moments in our life. ” This will be Venus’s first major singles final since she lost to Serena in straight sets in the 2009 Wimbledon final, and her first match against Serena in Melbourne since the 2003 final when Serena won her fourth Grand Slam title in a row, having defeated Venus in all four finals. “It’s just amazing,” said Rennae Stubbs, the Australian star who first met the sisters before they joined the tour. “They came onto the scene at age 15 and 16 with the beads and the hair and the exuberance, and here they are: mature, remarkable young women at 35 and 36. No matter what anyone says to me, their story from start to finish is the greatest sports story ever. ” And if the Williamses have taught us anything along the way, it is that the story is not finished until they say it is."

[climatescience.org.nz](http://www.climatescience.org.nz/blog/australian-bushfires-read-what-poet-henry-lawson-wrote-in-1911)



About 30 years ago I was working in Australia on the Kiewa Hydro scheme in the mountains south of the Snowy River. They had a huge potential bushfire problem and devoted a large amount of resources and people to preparing to fight fires. But they told me that the rubbish was building up the forest floor and sooner or later there would be a really serious fire. It happened a few years later and completely burnt out the forest. 



In his book “The Future Eaters”, Tim Flannery pointed out that, for thousands of years, the aborigines used [firestick farming](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/its-ok-to-burn-colonists/) to burn out the understory and encourage new growth. This provided food for the kangaroos on which the aborigines mainly lived. So the whole of the east coast ecology shifted from the pre-aborigine trees to gum trees that could withstand the regular burning. When the white man came, the regular burning largely stopped and more recently the forest managers have been encouraged/instructed to stop regular burning as it was believed to be unsustainable. In fact, **it was sustainable and had been for thousands of years.**



Australia has always had forest fires – for millions of years. Many are started by lightning. What makes these fires so bad is, as the cartoon points out, **the build-up of rubbish** on the forest floor. **A man-made problem.**



In the 1940s I remember smoke from forest fires in Australia. 



The 1943–44 Australian bushfire season was marked by a series of major bushfires following severe drought conditions in the state of Victoria in Australia. The summer of 1943–44 was the driest summer ever recorded in Melbourne until 2002 with just 46 millimetres or 1.81 inches falling, a third of the long-term average.[1]Between 22 December 1943 and 15 February 1944, burnt an estimated one million ha[2], 51 people were killed, 700 injured, and 650 buildings were destroyed across the state.[3] The current bushfires: The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season has burned an estimated 6,300,000 hectares (16,000,000 acres; 63,000 km2; 24,000 sq mi), destroyed over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 houses) and killed 24 people as of 4 January 2020, with a further six missing in the state of Victoria. 



And here are the Australian temperatures in 1896:



But now they say: On Wednesday 18 December, Australia experienced its hottest day on record with an average maximum temperature of **41.9C** (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier. The records they base this statement on do not go back as far as 1896. [Here is the rainfall picture back to 1900](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/history/rainfall/). The 20s and 30s look pretty bad.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Swiss Chocolate Makers are working hard to ensure that a warmer world will still be able to enjoy premium chocolate treats.
According to The Daily Meal;
Swiss Chocolatier Barry Callebaut Creates Heat-Resistant Chocolate to Survive Global Warming
Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut has created heat-resistant chocolate in an effort to expand to more tropical climates.
Other chocolate companies, like Nestlé and Hershey, are also developing heat-tolerant chocolates to sell in warmer regions.
In an effort to introduce its products to new markets, including warmer climates, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut has introduced commercially available heat-resistant luxury chocolate, a new blend that can resist temperatures up to 38 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — four degrees higher than normal.
Read more: http://www.thedailymeal.com/cook/swiss-chocolatier-barry-callebaut-creates-heat-resistant-chocolate-survive-global-warming/122815
As someone who lives on the Southern edge of the Australian tropics, I see this as an important development in food technology. My wife keeps all her chocolate in the fridge, which cuts down space for storing beer fresh vegetables. If this new kind of chocolate can be stored outside of the fridge, it will reduce pressure on me to buy a bigger fridge, which will help save the planet.

"**Aid agencies are calling for an immediate temporary ceasefire in northern Ethiopia to allow aid to reach civilians affected by fighting.**
The UN wants humanitarian corridors set up after two weeks of conflict between Ethiopia's military and forces backing the leadership in the Tigray region.
Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in the clashes.
On Friday Ethiopia's government said it had captured the city of Aksum and the town of Adwa.
The government said that forces battling its military in both areas had ""surrendered"".
However, the claims have not been independently verified and information is difficult to confirm because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
Aksum is one of the largest cities in the Tigray region and the mountainous town of Adwa is also considered strategically important.
Earlier this week, central government forces seized two other towns in Tigray - Shire and Raya - and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his army was advancing on the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle.
Ethiopia has so far rejected calls for talks over the crisis, seeing its operation as internal ""law enforcement"".
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election due to coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two sides. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed Ethiopia's border into Sudan and the UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
The refugees arriving in Sudan, the majority of whom are believed to be children, are hungry and frightened, aid agencies say, and an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
A researcher for the human rights organisation Amnesty International in Ethiopia, Fisseha Tekle, said the conflict must be conducted in accordance with international law, which requires the protection of civilians ""including access to humanitarian services"".
""As much as possible, human rights organisations, like Amnesty, should be given access to monitor the human rights situation,"" he said.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."

UPDATE: Repaired a few typos.
How often do we see this happen—a press release about a scientific study states or suggests that global warming was the cause of a factor being studied, when the paper itself doesn’t come to that conclusion…and/or the data contradict it?
An example crossed my desk yesterday. (Thanks, Anthony.)
The closing paragraph of the press release Why are seabirds abandoning their ancestral nesting grounds in the Gulf of California? from the University of California, Riverside reads(my boldface):
Increased frequencies of abnormally warm waters in the Gulf of California, possibly as a result of globally warming oceans, coupled with extremely high fishing pressure, are delivering a combined blow to the legendary productivity of the Gulf of California, forcing seabirds to fly away in search for more suitable environments, even if that means abandoning their ancestral nesting grounds and moving into highly transformed industrial landscapes such as the San Diego Saltworks or the LA Harbor Container Terminal.
That’s odd.  The paper that’s the subject of the press release doesn’t come to the conclusion that global warming is causing the migratory practices of the studied sea birds.
The press release is about the Velarde et al. (2015) paper Warm oceanographic anomalies and fishing pressure drive seabird nesting north.   The abstract reads:
Parallel studies of nesting colonies in Mexico and the United States show that Elegant Terns (Thalasseus elegans) have expanded from the Gulf of California Midriff Island Region into Southern California, but the expansion fluctuates from year to year. A strong inverse relationship between nesting pairs in three Southern California nesting areas [San Diego saltworks, Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, and Los Angeles Harbor (1991 to 2014)] and Isla Rasa in the Midriff (1980 to 2014) shows that terns migrate northward when confronting warm oceanographic anomalies (>1.0°C), which may decrease fish availability and hamper nesting success. Migration pulses are triggered by sea surface temperature anomalies localized in the Midriff and, secondarily, by reductions in the sardine population as a result of intensive fishing. This behavior is new; before year 2000, the terns stayed in the Midriff even when oceanographic conditions were adverse. Our results show that terns are responding dynamically to rapidly changing oceanographic conditions and fish availability by migrating 600 km northwest in search of more productive waters.
The conclusions of Velarde et al. (2015) are (my boldface):
In conclusion, three factors seem to be playing a role in the range changes of nesting Elegant Terns. (i) The success of conservation measures in the tern’s nesting grounds both in Mexico and California has allowed an increased population growth of the species, and the exponential increase in the Isla Rasa colony in particular seems to be pushing reproductive pairs onto new nesting grounds in California. (ii) Superimposed on this systematic and continuous expansion, there is a pulse-like variation in local SST conditions in the Midriff, which seems to drive nesting pairs to emigrate toward California when surface seawater in the Midriff is too warm, the thermocline is too deep, and fish availability is poor. (iii) The decision by seabirds to abandon their traditional nesting grounds in the Midriff is compounded by the fishing effort during the previous season, which further increases the proportion of Elegant Terns migrating away from the Gulf of California.
Besides an overall growth of nesting Elegant Terns in Isla Rasa and southern California colonies as a result of successful conservation efforts, since year 2000 whenever Elegant Terns have confronted poor oceanographic conditions, indicated by high SST (>1.0°C) anomalies in the Midriff, breeding pairs have abandoned Rasa, a behavior that is further augmented by high sardine fishing effort and landings in the Midriff. This oscillatory migration dynamics between distant nesting sites suggests that Elegant Terns can make fast decisions and dynamically adapt to rapid changes in the global environment. The adequate maintenance of a healthy fish community in both the Gulf of California and the Pacific is an important priority that will help support healthy seabird communities, as well as healthy marine ecosystems in general and sustainable fisheries.
“[P]ulse-like variation in local SST conditions” and “high SST (>1.0°C) anomalies in the Midriff” do not equate to global warming.  In fact, the data provided by Velarde et al. contradict the press release.
The January to April sea surface temperature anomaly data for the years of 1983 to 2014 are provided in the Supplementary Material for Velarde et al. (2015).  See their Table S3 Oceanographic data. I’ve plotted their data for the Midriff of the Gulf of California and Baja California’s Pacific coast at the same latitude.  See Figures 1 and 2.  Both show cooling since 1983, based on the linear trends.

Figure 1
# # #

Figure 2
Note: as far as I can tell from the paper, the data for the Midriff of the Gulf of California is for the 1 deg latitude by 1 deg longitude grid of 29N-30N, 114W-113W.
CLOSING
It’s sad when claims made in a press release are not supported by the conclusions of the paper its advertising, even sadder when data supplied as part of a scientific study contradict that press release.
Shouldn’t truth-in-advertising laws also apply to press releases for scientific studies?
As a result of the false claims made in the press release, it has been picked up by alarmist mainstream media outlets. Examples:
ScienceWorldReport—Climate Change: Seabirds are Abandoning Ancestral Nesting Grounds in California.
The findings reveal that warm waters may be the cause behind these shifts. This, in turn, could be a result of globally warming oceans.
Zee News—Sea-level warming forces seabirds to abandon nesting grounds.
The reason for the migration is to be found in global warming.
Oy vey!!

"TEHRAN  —   As Iranians woke on Saturday to the news that none of them would be able to enter the United States for at least 90 days, on the orders of President Trump, panic reigned. They were turned back from flights to the United States in Tehran and in the major transfer hubs of Istanbul and Dubai. Some of those who arrived in the United States after midnight, when the decree went into effect, were held or deported, rights groups and airline representatives said. No one, not passengers, airline representatives or even United States border control officials, seemed to know how to interpret the executive order that went into effect at midnight on Friday. Under the new policy, refugees, immigrants and almost anyone from seven countries deemed to be hotbeds of terrorism are banned from the United States for 90 days, pending a review of policies. Officials are just interpreting the directive by themselves, said one representative for an international airline who was based in Tehran. He said the airline did not know if Iranians could fly to the United States or not. On Saturday, three international airlines shuttling passengers between Iran and the United States  —   Emirates, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways  —   had stopped allowing Iranians with visas or even permanent residence cards to board their planes. The Qatar Airways office in Tehran confirmed that all Iranian passengers without United States passports were stopped from flying to the United States on Friday evening and sent back to Iran. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everybody boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Holders of green cards, which confer the right to live and work indefinitely in the United States, received conflicting information about whether or not they would be permitted to return to the United States. But on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security clarified the executive order, saying it applied even to permanent residents from the seven   countries named in the ban: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. “It will bar green card holders,” Gillian Christensen, the Department of Homeland Security’s acting spokeswoman, told Reuters. Many were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything,” he said. It is unclear how many Iranians have green cards, but experts say the number runs into the hundreds of thousands. In an online survey tracking entry challenges, two out of 112 passengers holding green cards said they were not allowed into the United States, but the reasons were unclear. Card holders can be barred, for instance, if they owe back taxes. Others spent years preparing to study in the United States only to see their plans abruptly thwarted on Friday. About 4, 000 Iranians are granted study visas to attend American universities each year, often after a long and complicated process that can take years. Shadi Heidarifar, a philosophy student just admitted to New York University, said in a message on Twitter that she had spent three years trying to apply to universities in the United States. “I had to work to save money, gather documents. The application fees were so expensive that a whole family could live for a month” on them, Ms. Heidarifar wrote. When she was accepted recently, she was over the moon. “But now my entire future is destroyed in one second. ”"

But now China Central Television says it will ""immediately suspend"" plans to show the LA Lakers-Brooklyn Nets games.
""We believe that any comments that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech,"" the station said on its social media account.
It added that as well not showing the pre-season matches it would ""immediately investigate all co-operation and communication involving the NBA"".
The matches are due to take place in Shanghai on Thursday and Shenzhen on Saturday.
Meanwhile, a publicity event at a Shanghai primary school, at which Nets players and executives were set to appear on Tuesday afternoon, was cancelled two hours before its scheduled start. No explanation was given for the cancellation.
In a statement on Monday, the NBA described Mr Morey's comments as ""regrettable"" and acknowledged he had ""deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China"".
It added: ""We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force.""
However, on Tuesday NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared to back the Houston coach. He told a Chinese news agency that his organisation wanted to make it clear that ""Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression"".
Mr Silver added: ""I accept that it is also Chinese government's and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.""
In response to criticism of the NBA's initial response to the incident, Mr Silver added in a statement: ""I recognise our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for.
""Over the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.
""It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.
""However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""
NBA games draw huge numbers of viewers in China, with millions watching games primarily through streaming platforms. In May this year, the NBA opened its largest store outside North America in Beijing.
The new NBA season starts on 22 October."

Ocean algae will cope well in varying climates, study shows

From the UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH
Tiny marine algae that play a critical role in supporting life on Earth may be better equipped to deal with future climate change than previously expected, research shows.
Scientists investigated the likely future impact of changing environmental conditions on ocean phytoplankton, a microscopic plant that forms the basis of all the oceans’ food chains.
Phytoplankton is important for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while generating much of the oxygen needed to sustain life on Earth.
The study grew phytoplankton at the high carbon dioxide levels predicted for the year 2100 and beyond. The algae was allowed to evolve through 400 generations, with some exposed to varying levels of CO2 and some kept at constant CO2 levels.
Researchers found that phytoplankton exposed to fluctuating CO2 levels was better able to cope with further changes in conditions, compared with algae grown in stable CO2 levels. The finding suggests that populations of the algae will adapt more to the varied conditions expected in future than was previously thought based on experiments at stable conditions.
Scientists found however that the algae developed in changing CO2 conditions evolved more and were smaller than those grown in stable conditions. These factors may impact on how well marine animals can feed off phytoplankton, and how efficiently the algae is able to take carbon out of the atmosphere and sink to the deep ocean. Plankton in some regions of the ocean may evolve more than others under global climate change, because some regions of ocean are currently more variable than others.
The studies, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society B, were supported by the Royal Society, the European Commission, and the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance.
Dr Sinead Collins, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, who led both studies, said: “Predicting how populations of ocean algae will respond to changing ocean conditions is difficult, but these results suggest that populations from highly changeable environments are better placed to deal with additional environmental change than previously suspected.”

Guest opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
The Daily Caller headline said, Russia’s Putin Says Global Warming Is ‘A Fraud.” What Putin is doing and saying is nothing new. He always knew that the IPCC climate was wrong he simply changed his political position as the situation dictated. Soviet and latterly Russian climatologists are far better than most in the west. I know Chinese climatologists are their equals because I worked with both.
Experience
I worked with several Soviet climatologists during the Cold War. It began when I wrote a chapter in a book titled Climate Since AD 1500.  The editor had chapter authors review other chapters. One that I was assigned titled “Documentary evidence from the USSR” by E. P. Borisenkov reported on the value of the Russian Chronicles. I became very familiar with the work of Mikhail Budyko, who essentially changed the approach from synoptic climatology to energy budget climatology.   His work was influential to current climate science. Ironically, the editor was Phil Jones, who gave me my only mention in the leaked emails. In May 2008, he wrote,
“PPS Our web server has found this piece of garbage – so wrong it is unbelievable that Tim Ball wrote a decent paper in Climate Since AD 1500.”
Michael Mann commented,
p.s. As for Tim Ball, he is so completely discredited (with having lost that lawsuit involving him lying about his academic credentials) that nobody but those truly in denial would even bother reading his tripe. see e.g.
http://www.desmogblog.com/node/1272
I do find it an amusing curiosity that he actually has a chapter in Bradley and Jones.
Probably best kept a secret!
The problem is I didn’t lose a lawsuit and the paper that published the false academic credentials, The Calgary Herald, published a correction and apology. Consider the source of Mann’s information. Besides, we now know who published the real garbage?
Different Approaches and Conflicts
During the Cold War, most Soviet science publications were not available until a significant change occurred when Jewish scientists who escaped from the Soviet Union set up translation services in Israel. In approximately 1990 a divergence in climate science emerged between Eastern block countries and the West. The Soviets believed climate was cyclical, the sum of a multitude of cycles. The challenge was to identify them and how they interacted. Cyclical climate events pervaded Russian thinking particularly since the publication of Nikolai Kondratieff’s 1926 article titled “Long Waves in Economic Life.” The concept of climate cycles has flourished in economics and stock market prognostications ever since. Michael Zahorchak’s book “Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles” is a good example. The western view revolved around Chaos Theory that weather was unpredictable beyond a couple of days because of randomness; Lorenz and the butterfly. This created an ongoing contradiction for AGW proponents. If you can’t forecast accurately for a few days, how can you be so certain about 50 and 100-year forecasts?
The fascinating thing about the east-west scientific, intellectual and philosophical difference is that it was interpreted as political and ideological. It wasn’t, and Putin’s position is a manifestation of the difference. What is fascinating is his recognition that the IPCC and Kyoto was a political agenda to suppress development, except that he believes it is only applied to developing countries. In fact, it was designed to promote equal and limited development by weakening developed nations and minimally improving developing nations. All this comes after the developed nations paid for their sins and the money went to the developing nations who suffered. It takes a communist to recognize an attempt at one-world government. Putin is not opposed to this as long as Russia is in control.
Another illustration of the Russian position occurred when Lord May used science societies to promote the IPCC global warming agenda. He began with the UK Royal Society and used their prestigious status to persuade other national societies to manipulate public perception with public statements. Most societies conformed, an issue that is still a contention for many, as Professor Emeritus Hal Lewis’s resignation from the American Physical Society illustrated. One group, the Russian Academy, resisted the propaganda move under the leadership of climatologist Professor Yuri Izrael. At a United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) conference at Exeter University titled “Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change,” Professor Izrael and Andrei Illarionov paid the price for their actions. As Benny Peiser reported,
After two days of relentless barrage of doom and gloom predictions at the Met Office conference on “Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change” I decided that enough is enough. The unmitigated exposure to prophecies of imminent ice ages, looming hell fire, mass starvation, mega-droughts, global epidemics and mass extinction is an experience I would not recommend to anyone with a thin-skinned disposition (although the news media couldn’t get enough of it). But such was the spectacle of pending disaster that anyone who dared – or was allowed – to question whether the sky is really about to fall on us (and there were at least half a dozen of moderate anti-alarmists present), was branded a “usual suspect”, a slur hurled against Andrei Illarionov (Putin’s economic adviser) by the IPCC’s Martin Parry.
Peiser reported that after Professor Izrael presented his paper
The Russian scientist was immediately and disrespectfully admonished by the chair and former IPCC chief Sir John Houghton for being far too optimistic. Such a moderate proposal was ridiculous since it was “incompatible with IPCC policy”. Clearly, the Met Office meeting was setting the tone for the next IPCC report.
It was deeply upsetting to witness the ill-mannered and discourteous way in which both Professor Izrael and Dr Illarionov were mocked during the debates by many delegates and IPCC officials.
This is the same UKMO that get weather and climate forecasts wrong so often they lost their contract to the fellow public agency the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
Putin’s Climate Representative
Putin was always opposed to Kyoto and the so-called science behind it. He sent his economic advisor Andrey Illarionov on a world tour explaining what was wrong with the science. A copy of his Washington 2004 PowerPoint presentation is available here. After the tour Putin’s political situation changed.
The Kyoto Protocol needed ratification by enough countries that produced 55% of the CO2. When the US refused to participate, Russia was the only country left at the time producing enough CO2 to keep Kyoto going. Illarionov finished his world tour returned to Russia and a month later Putin announced he was going to ratify Kyoto. Illarionov resigned. Some argued that Putin gained more by selling emission credits. Putin explained the realities of his action. His goal was to double Russia’s gross domestic product, and he believed this was more achievable through membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
The fact was that several nations, mostly European, effectively blackmailed Putin by telling him they would not support his application for Russia’s membership in the WTO. Illarionov explained what went on before he left the stage. Putin considered that membership more valuable than the Kyoto deal at the time. Here is that view artfully suggested by a Polish commentator. 
Another popular hypothesis links ratification with EU support for Russia’s WTO accession. Although high-ranking officials such as Foreign Affairs Minister Igor Ivanov and Energy Minister Igor Iusofov denied this allegation, President Putin himself hinted at it, when saying: “The EU has met us halfway in talks over the WTO and that cannot but affect positively our position on the Kyoto Protocol.” It is not clear, however, whether Russia’s delay was part of a strategy to bargain with the EU, or whether the Kremlin “just” took advantage of its special position to come closer to WTO membership—which was one of the main aims of Putin’s presidency.
Now it is to Putin’s economic advantage to oppose the Kyoto replacement the Green Climate Fund (GCF).
Will Putin Contribute To The Green Climate Fund?
At the Conference of the Parties (COP)16, they introduced the Green Climate Fund with the World Bank as the interim trustee. In September 2015, the European Union and South Korea committed to making the GCF a major part of the Paris COP.
SONGDO, 17 September 2015 – Meeting on the occasion of their Eighth Bilateral Summit, the heads of the Republic of Korea and the European Union stressed the need to tackle climate change and confirmed their resolve to play their part in concluding a successful universal climate agreement in Paris later this year.
The three leaders affirmed their ambition to “make the Green Climate Fund fully operational and the main operating entity of the financial mechanism” under the UNFCCC for the Post-2020 climate regime.
Despite this, many are not paying.
Friends of the Earth International today demanded that developed nations provide the Green Climate Fund with the resources they pledged to it in 2014, warning that the contributions made so far are alarmingly low.
Thousands will go to Paris with over half of them Non-Government Organization (NGO) people. They will push an agenda that Putin knows is completely unnecessary. As the French mathematical society, SocietedeCalculMathematiqueSA wrote in a recent paper that Putin will know about titled, “The battle against global warming: an absurd, costly and pointless crusade.”
There is not a single fact, figure or observation that leads us to conclude that the world‘s climate is in any way ̳disturbed‘. It is variable, as it has always been, but rather less so now than during certain periods or geological eras. Modern methods are far from being able to accurately measure the planet‘s global temperature even today, so measurements made 50 or 100 years ago are even less reliable.
Concentrations of CO2 vary, as they always have done; the figures that are being released are biased and dishonest. Rising sea levels are a normal phenomenon linked to upthrust buoyancy; they are nothing to do with so-called global warming. As for extreme weather events – they are no more frequent now than they have been in the past.
It is built on the false science created by the IPCC to support the political objective of Agenda 21. German Physicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Plus explained why too many scientists don’t understand. They never read what the IPCC said.
“Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data—first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it.” ”Scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob.”
Russian scientists know what the IPCC said. Because of them Putin knows that the climate science of the IPCC is wrong. He knows it because Soviet and now Russian climatologists practice open science, which is ironic in a political system that is supposed to be controlling. He also knows the IPCC is designed to use climate for political goals because he does it better than most. As the say, it takes a thief to catch a thief. How much money will Putin contribute to the Green Climate Fund?

"By Peter Wales
When the popular media refer to “Global Warming”, or more recently “Climate Change”, both with Capitals, so You Know How Important It Is, they mean a combination of three related theories. These are:

The Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.
This is happening because of human activity.
This is a bad thing.

None of these things can be shown to be true.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist and geologist Axel Bojanowski at the online German Spiegel news weekly comments on the drive by activists to proclaim an “Anthropocene” age because they claim that man has so much altered the planet and is adding a new geological layer in doing so.
It all stems from accusations that man has altered the surface of the earth, its biodiversity, the oceans and atmosphere through its activity, and that this is becoming visible in the earth’s most recent geological layer.
But Bojanowski writes that a number of leading experts are calling such claims erroneous. In the subheading he writes:
Activists, artists and scientists are calling for the heralding of a new age – man has profoundly altered the planet. They’re wrong.” 
He writes that these experts view the newly proposed geological designation as “a momentous error and unacceptable influence on research by political activists. It’s the story of a large misunderstanding.”
Already policymakers and leaders are scrambling to adopt the new designation and thus enact laws accordingly, he reports. And why not? A number of scientists and everywhere the media are already using the term.
Even the Scientific Advisory Council to the German government, WBGU — headed by PIK alarmist Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber —  liberally uses the term. There is a push to officiailly declare the “Anthropocene” as a geological age. Bojanowski reports that seven years ago 37 scientists began a working group charged with searching out geological evidence to support adopting the “Anthropocene” age: the Anthropocene Commission.
According to the Spiegel journalist, the commission, headed by Jan Zalasiewicz of the University of Leicester, will attempt to convince three geological commissions to adopt the age, which supposedly started at about 1950. Journal “Science” has already presented the first results, the Spiegel journalist writes.

But Bojanwski adds that a large number of experts are calling the move “bad science” because it does not meet any of the strict geological scientific standards one typically uses for establishing geological periods.
“Sloganeering in science “
Bojanowski cites James Scourse, ocean geologist at Bangor University in Wales, who says the term is “misleading and useless” and that Earth is shaped by factors well beyond the control of man. Other experts like Whitney Autin of Suny-College in New York and John Holbrook of Texas Christian University call the discussion an esoteric debate, claiming, Bojanowski reports, that today there’s a “tendency towards sloganeering in science” which lead to “dubious terminology” like “Anthropocene“.
“Career promoter”
Spiegel journalist Bojanowski writes:
From the perspective of critics, the Anthropocene concept violates almost every scientific rule.
He then quotes geologist Sven Egenhoff of Colorado State University:
The Anthropocene mode has only been able to emerge because scientists from other fields have been piling on behind the term. To the contrary, the real experts, i.e. those who specialize in earth layers, see nothing there. The Anthropocene serves as a career promoter for scientists in outside fields.”

November 30, 2015 – Today, on the first day of the United Nations’ twenty-first conference of the parties (COP-21) taking place in Paris, a new book emphatically rejects claims of a “scientific consensus” on the causes and consequences of climate change.
The authors are three prominent climate scientists affiliated with the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). The book is titled Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming: The NIPCC Report on Consensus.
About the Book
“Probably the most widely repeated claim in the debate over global warming is that ‘97% of scientists agree’ that climate change is man-made and dangerous,” the authors write. “This claim is not only false, but its presence in the debate is an insult to science.”
With these words, the authors begin a detailed analysis of one of the most controversial topics of the day. The authors make a compelling case against claims of a scientific consensus. The purported proof of such a consensus consists of sloppy research by nonscientists, college students, and a highly partisan Australian blogger. Surveys of climate scientists, even those heavily biased in favor of climate alarmism, find extensive disagreement on the underlying science and doubts about its reliability.
The authors point to four reasons why scientists disagree about global warming: a conflict among scientists in different and often competing disciplines; fundamental scientific uncertainties concerning how the global climate responds to the human presence; failure of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide objective guidance to the complex science; and bias among researchers.
The authors offer a succinct summary of the real science of climate change based on their previously published comprehensive review of climate science in a volume titled Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science. They recommend policymakers resist pressure from lobby groups to silence scientists who question the authority of IPCC to claim to speak for “climate science.”
About the Authors
CRAIG D. IDSO, Ph.D., a climatologist, is one of the world’s leading experts on the effects of carbon dioxide on plant and animal life and is chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.
ROBERT M. CARTER, Ph.D., a paleogeologist, is emeritus fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs in Australia and author of Climate Change: The Counter Consensus (London: Stacey International, 2010).
S. FRED SINGER, Ph.D., a physicist, is president of the Science and Environmental Policy Project and founder of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC).
About NIPCC
The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) is an international panel of nongovernment scientists and scholars who have come together to present a comprehensive, authoritative, and realistic assessment of the science and economics of global warming. Whereas the reports of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn of a dangerous human effect on climate, NIPCC concludes the human effect is likely to be small relative to natural variability, and whatever small warming is likely to occur will produce benefits as well as costs.
NIPCC is sponsored by three nonprofit organizations: the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP), and The Heartland Institute.
This volume, like past NIPCC reports, is edited and published by the staff of The Heartland Institute, a national nonprofit research and educational organization newly relocated from Chicago to suburban Arlington Heights, Illinois.

"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. had a job offer for Nick Young, a veteran Washington transit officer: Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat. The clandestine work would be “a lot sexier” than his current job, Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him. And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good. Mr. Young turned him down. But it would not be the last time he would see the F. B. I. agent. Last August, five years later, Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency, Metro, where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him. “You probably don’t recognize me, do you?” Ryan, whose beard was now thicker, asked him. “Oh, I recognize you,” Mr. Young said. This time, the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State  —   a case built, in a twist, by an informant who posed as a   terrorist fighter. The prosecution of Mr. Young, the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State, offers a revealing look at the F. B. I. ’s shadowy    efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists. President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to “annihilate” the militant group. Mr. Young’s case also poses a challenge to the F. B. I. ’s expanding use of undercover operations to identify Islamic State sympathizers inside the United States who might travel overseas to help the terrorist group or commit “lone wolf” attacks at home. His lawyer claims that the F. B. I. entrapped him, with undercover operatives popping in and out of his life for at least six years. To law enforcement officials, however, Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears: a longtime officer, with access to sensitive facilities, who they suspect was “radicalized” to support Islamic extremism. He is charged with providing “material support” to the Islamic State, in the form of $245 worth of Google Play gift cards. The authorities say he gave the gift cards to a Muslim friend named Mo  —   in reality, an undercover informant  —   to support recruitment for the terrorist group. Before now, very few American suspects linked to the Islamic State have spoken out. But in three and a half hours of interviews from jail, Mr. Young, a convert to Islam, portrayed himself and many other American Muslims under investigation as victims of religious persecution. He accused an “overzealous” F. B. I. of “manufacturing” the case. “I know for sure I wouldn’t have been targeted if I was an evangelic Christian or a Sikh or a Hindu or something,” said Mr. Young, 37. “I’m not a terrorist,” he added. “Seeing these horrible allegations and the way they’re trying to paint me, it’s just a nightmare. ” Officials at the F. B. I. and the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. In general, the F. B. I. said in a statement, the investigative techniques used in such national security cases “are subject to vigorous oversight and require us to use the least intrusive means possible. ” The F. B. I. has moved aggressively since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 to identify suspected extremist supporters inside the United States, opening hundreds of investigations and generating convictions from Brooklyn to Southern California, often against young Muslim men. Mr. Trump has declared that the country must do more to confront what he calls “radical Islamic terrorism,” including the possibility of expanding surveillance and intelligence operations, creating a “registry” of American Muslims, and reviving torture as an interrogation technique. While Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on some of those proposals, they have worried some civil liberties advocates, who say they are eager to see whether the Justice Department and the F. B. I. seek to expand their investigative powers still further in domestic terrorism cases. Mr. Young sees himself as a pawn in that broader fight. He acknowledges holding passionate views about the Middle East and the “slaughter” of Syrians by the government of President Bashar  . On breaks from the transit agency, Mr. Young traveled to Libya twice in 2011 with body armor to join rebels fighting the Qaddafi regime. “I didn’t kill anyone while I was there,” he said, laughing, but “I got shot at a lot. ” He insisted that he had never supported terrorists. He plans to take the witness stand at his trial, an unusual tactic for a terrorism suspect. “Nick doesn’t have anything to hide,” said Nicholas D. Smith, one of his lawyers. As he waits for his trial date, he sits in a rural jail in Warsaw, Va. reading science fiction occasionally, with “The Jerry Springer Show” sometimes playing on a television in the background. “My brain’s turning to mush,” he said. He said the jail had denied him access to Muslim prayer sessions. But the conditions are far better, he added, than the solitary confinement he was placed in for 23 hours a day for months after his arrest. That ordeal, he said, has caused lingering panic attacks and other problems. Unlike the bulk of the Americans charged with supporting the Islamic State, Mr. Young is not accused of plotting violence or trying to travel to the Middle East to fight with the group. He said he was under investigation for so long, it was almost inevitable that the authorities would find a way to charge him. “At the end of the day, the crime I’m being accused of  —   a crime of sending gift cards  —   it would be laughable if it wasn’t really happening,” Mr. Young said. He declined to explain the gift cards, citing a pretrial order that restricts what he can say about documents in the case. But he said his explanation would come out at his trial. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, dozens of terrorism defendants caught in undercover stings have claimed in court that they were illegally entrapped into saying or doing incriminating things. None have succeeded. Judges have given the Justice Department wide latitude in using undercover stings in terrorism cases. “You almost need a perfect case” to prove entrapment, said Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, “and that’s difficult to find. ” Still, several legal analysts said Mr. Young might have a legitimate shot, because of the unusual elements of the F. B. I. ’s yearslong undercover investigation. They point out that even an    charge that Mr. Young faces is based on his statements to agents about a fictional F. B. I. investigation into the whereabouts of a   Islamic State fighter who never existed. Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F. B. I. ’s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque. The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to   charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of “South Park” over the show’s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F. B. I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates. He continued working as an armed officer patrolling   subways and bus lines. He said F. B. I. agents  —   Ryan and a second agent  —   had met with him twice in 2011 to recruit him as an informant. Mr. Young said he found the idea of becoming an informant distasteful. The F. B. I. said in a court affidavit that he had used stronger language in a conversation with one of the bureau’s undercover informants, saying that if he were ever betrayed by one, “that person’s head would be in a cinder block” at the bottom of a lake. Based on wiretaps and statements from informants, the F. B. I. reported that Mr. Young had made a number of other incendiary and perhaps even threatening comments over the years about Muslim informants, F. B. I. investigators and “kaffirs”  —   or nonbelievers. Mr. Young acknowledged that he could have used “a little  ” in some of his private remarks. But he said he had never meant them to be taken literally. “Everyone’s capable of saying stupid, blustery things,” said Mr. Smith, his lawyer. Some F. B. I. officials pressed to bring criminal charges against Mr. Young years ago, but the Justice Department rebuffed them because of an apparent lack of evidence that he was involved in supporting terrorism, according to law enforcement officials. It was not until 2014 that Mr. Young crossed the line into supporting terrorism, the Justice Department now alleges. That was when he first met Mo, a Middle Easterner who said he was a military reservist, at a mosque where he prayed. Mr. Young said he had suspected early on that Mo might be an informant because of his strange mannerisms. But his concerns eased, and the two became friends, meeting at a Starbucks or elsewhere. Mo later told Mr. Young that he was thinking of traveling to Syria to join the Islamic State, prosecutors said. While Mr. Young sometimes appeared to offer Mo advice on how best to avoid government scrutiny if he went to the Middle East, he also told him at times that he did not need to join the terrorist group  —   at least not then, according to the F. B. I. ’s account. “There is no one with a gun to your head that is counting down,” he told Mo in a conversation recorded in October 2014. Such statements, said Mr. Smith, his lawyer, show that “the government is really grasping at straws here. ” Prosecutors are acting on “really more of a hunch that he might commit crimes in the future,” he said, “and they can’t prove it. ”"

1. Trends in Extreme Weather Events since 1900 – An Enduring Conundrum for Wise Policy Advice
It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change. The disconnect between real-world historical data on the 100 years’ time scale and the current predictions provides a real conundrum when any engineer tries to make a professional assessment of the real future value of any infrastructure project which aims to mitigate or adapt to climate change. What is the appropriate basis on which to make judgements when theory and data are in such disagreement?
The compilation of temperature records are a source of problematic methodology of a kind not seen elsewhere in science. Under the umbrella term of “homogenisation”, there now seem to be a growing myriad of post-hoc adjustments to the original raw data that all seem to go in one direction, namely to increase the overall rate of global warming. This happens even on official websites. The total change is often somewhat greater than the 0.8-1ºC rise over the 20th century that is agreed by most people, critics or not. This is exemplified by data in Figure 4. This makes the problem of dispassionate engineering assessment almost impossible to achieve. Hansen (1981) wrote : “A remarkable conclusion from Figure 3 is that the global temperature is almost as high today as it was in 1940.” It is not clear now why this should be remarkable, although at the time, the rise in temperature from about 1975 had cancelled out some of the cooling since 1940 in the then available data. At the time, he [Hansen] showed 1980 temperatures were about 0.15ºC cooler than 1940. Now, NASA shows 1980 temperatures about 0.2ºC warmer than 1940. They have made a relative shift of +0.35ºC, and the adjustment represents ~40% of the century variation. The lesson from this is that the data integrity for claiming extreme events needs to shown to be of the highest order, and that the results claimed do not depend on the data manipulation itself.”

2. Quantification of the Diminishing Earth’s Magnetic Dipole Intensity and Geomagnetic Activity as the Causal Source for Global Warming within the Oceans and Atmosphere
Quantification of the Diminishing Earth’s Magnetic Dipole Intensity and Geomagnetic Activity as the Causal Source for Global Warming within the Oceans and Atmosphere
Quantitative analyses of actual measurements rather than modeling have shown that “global warming” has been heterogeneous over the surface of the planet and temporally non-linear. Residual regression analyses by Soares (2010) indicated increments of increased temperature precede increments of CO2 increase. The remarkably strong negative correlation (r = -0.99) between the earth’s magnetic dipole moment values and global CO2-temperature indicators over the last ~30 years is sufficient to be considered causal if contributing energies were within the same order of magnitude. Quantitative convergence between the energies lost by the diminishing averaged geomagnetic field strength and energies gained within the ocean-atmosphere interface satisfy the measured values for increased global temperature and CO2 release from sea water. The pivotal variable is the optimal temporal unit employed to estimate the total energies available for physical-chemical reactions. The positive drift in averaged amplitude of geomagnetic activity over the last 100 years augmented this process. Contributions from annual CO2 from volcanism and shifts in averaged geomagnetic activity, lagged years before the measured global temperature-CO2 values, are moderating variables for smaller amplitude perturbations. These results indicated that the increase in CO2 and global temperatures are primarily caused by major geophysical factors, particularly the diminishing total geomagnetic field strength and increased geomagnetic activity, but not by human activities. Strategies for adapting to climate change because of these powerful variables may differ from those that assume exclusive anthropomorphic causes.

3. Reassessing the Climate Role of Carbon Dioxide
The authors evaluate the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “consensus” that the increase of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere is of anthropogenic origin and is causing dangerous global warming, climate change and climate disruption. They conclude that the data do not support that supposition. Most of the currently accepted scientific interpretations are examined and the given impression that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will increase the earth’s surface and/or air temperature is questioned. New insight is offered drawing a conclusion that no additional warming is possible due to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Acceptance of that IPCC paradigm is incurring costly and draconian efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, tax such emissions and replace fossil fuel combustion by alternative energy systems whether such alternatives will achieve the desired results or not. The totality of the data available on which that theory is based is evaluated here, from Vostok ice core measurements, to residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere, to more recent studies of temperature changes that inevitably precede CO2 changes, to global temperature trends, to the current ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, to satellite data for the geographic distribution of atmospheric CO2, to the effect of solar activity on cosmic rays and cloud cover. Nothing in the data supports the supposition that atmospheric CO2 is a driver of weather or climate, or that human emissions control atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, CO2 is not a pollutant, but an essential ingredient of the Earth’s ecosystem on which almost all life depends via photosynthesis. This paper rejects the new paradigm of “climate science” and asserts that the traditional, century old meteorological concepts for the factors that control weather and climate remain sound but need to be reassessed.

Australian bushfires are seasonal and as predictable as the sun rising in the east given favourable climatic conditions. The bushfire season in New South Wales and South Australia peaks in summer and autumn, meaning the worst may be yet to come. 



“The greatest danger occurs after the dry winter and spring. The worst conditions occur when deep low-pressure systems near Tasmania bring strong, hot and dry, westerly winds to the coastal districts. 



The end of the fire season is determined by the onset of moister conditions, sometimes the result of a tropical cyclone developing near the Queensland coast.”



Periods of drought create the perfect environment for fires whipped into uncontrollable fiery maelstroms by strong southeast to northeast winds, fires started by arson or dry lightning strike.



“In some parts of Australia lightning is the main source of bushfire ignition. The winds during thunderstorms can make it hard to predict the behaviour and movement of a bushfire.



Large fires can also create their own thunderstorms known as pyrocumulonimbus. They can cause erratic more intense and dangerous bushfire behaviour.”



The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires have so far, destroyed more bush and wildlife than previous fires but killed fewer people. MSM and the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology blame this year’s catastrophic fires on climate change,[ but rural landowners disagree.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/dickheads-cost-lives/) They blame the Greens’ influence on government policy restricting the cutting of wide fire breaks around homes and forbidding the removal of a buildup of flammable undergrowth in the bush.



According to the Greens, dead trees are a valuable animal habitat not to be disturbed. One hopes the Greens are sufficiently disturbed by the estimated half a million dead animals in the current fires as a result of their “environmentally friendly” policies. The Aborigines are much better at protecting wildlife and restricting bushfires than the Greens because they [“used fire for many thousands of years to ‘care for country’. The fires were a tool that encouraged the growth and extent of grasslands to enhance hunting, reduced levels of fuel, and kept vegetation from becoming dense and hard to walk through.”](https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/history-and-incidents/past-bushfires)



Suitable conditions mean more of Australia is alight in the 2019-2020 fire season. As at 5 January 2020 [an estimated 6.3 million hectares are destroyed with over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 houses), and 25 people have died with a further six missing in the state of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season). Thankfully fewer lives are lost to date than in previous fires but much more bush and wildlife is being destroyed.



Some notable Australian bushfires: 



Last week the South Island was shrouded in smoke from the Australian fires and on Sunday mid-afternoon Auckland had an eerie “cloud” cover which darkened the day – a very small taste of our Aussie neighbour’s darkness. The uninformed [dialled 111](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/are-people-really-this-thick/) and MSM surmised on the concept of an apocalypse. They were momentarily distracted from their current favourite doom and gloom subject of the Don’s desire to start world war three.



On _TV1 News at Six_ on Sunday night, Laura James said, _“There seems to be **no record** of smoke from fires in Australia reaching New Zealand before,”_ despite _Stuff_ reporting **in March** that Smoke from Australian bush fires had reached New Zealand.



A _BFD_ reader, after being suitably unimpressed by the MSM claim that this was the first instance of Australian bushfire smoke shrouding New Zealand, researched _Papers Past_. 



Thanks to our reader we can enlighten the MSM and tell them to put this in their pipe and smoke it – this year’s Australian bushfire smoke covering New Zealand is **not** a New Zealand first and nor is it an example of worsening climate change. This clipping from the infamous **1939 fires** confirms a similar occurrence.



Australian bushfires were reported in New Zealand regional newspapers **as far back as 1894.** You can access these articles by clicking on [this link](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&query=bush+fires+australia&snippet=true), this [link](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=bush+fires+australia) and this [link.](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=smoke+bush+fires+australia+auckland)



Our BFD reader captured [New Zealand articles recording Australian heatwaves](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=heat+wave+australia), some occurring over a century ago. [The temperature in Eucla, New South Wales](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZTIM19121219.2.76?items_per_page=10&query=heat+wave+australia&snippet=true) was 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius, on December 18, **1912.** But [Australia’s highest maximum temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Australia) was recorded in South Australia as 50.7 °C (123.3 °F) at Oodnadatta on 2 January **1960**.



So much for global warming.

"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."

Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1638 by Justus Sustermans. Source Wikipedia
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Does a Christian owe their first loyalty to the Pope, or to God? If your conscience tells you one thing, and the Pope tells you another, which path should you follow?
Galileo followed his conscience. Even when given a direct order by the highest authority in Christendom, to recant his opinion that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, he chose conscience over obedience, divinity over temporal authority – until he was threatened with unspeakable pain.
I am not saying the church is always wrong. Most of the time, the church is a force for good. The moral authority which is the Christian church helped to create the modern world. The concept of a single god, a god of love rather than hate, a universe of order, in which the forces of chaos were chained in the abyss, gave the philosopher monks the peace to pursue their research into the innermost workings of creation – and the faith to believe that creation was orderly enough to be explored.
However, a papal encyclical which demands action on climate change would be tantamount to an accusation that people who doubt the urgency of addressing climate change are evil – are cynically exploiting the doubts of others, for their own selfish ends. Yet surely true evil is condemning millions to live their lives in endless drudgery, by denying them the opportunities inexpensive energy and affordable food might bring, on the basis of the flimsiest of evidence – defective models and failed predictions.
I do not doubt the sincerity of the Pope. I don’t even doubt the sincerity of most alarmist climate scientists. But sometimes scientists get it wrong. There was once another group of people who thought they were right – that the world was on the brink of a catastrophe which only their statistical models could foresee, that mass cruelty was the only path to salvation. Their sincere blindness almost plunged the entire world into darkness. The one regime which embraced this dark vision, even after others finally rejected it, is now a byword for evil. Yet arguably, those who believed were simply accepting the scientific consensus of the day.
The lesson is, or should be, that if you demand the infliction of unspeakable cruelty on a vast number of people, as many climate scientists, green politicians and activists in my opinion demand, with their vehement opposition to affordable energy, you had better be sure of your facts. You better have more evidence that such an abomination is an inescapable necessity, than a set of models which fail, again and again, to demonstrate plausible predictive skill.
If you believe in a creator, one day you will face, not the pope, but your creator. On the day of judgement, the opinion of the pope will count for nothing. All that will matter is whether you lived a principled life, and stood up for what mattered. Even if this sometimes means disobeying the instructions of the Pope, just as Galileo once did.

Guest essay by Patrick J. Michaels
Day after day, year after year, the hole that climate scientists have buried themselves in gets deeper and deeper. The longer that they wait to admit their overheated forecasts were wrong, the more they are going to harm all of science.
The story is told in a simple graph, the same one that University of Alabama’s John Christy presented to the House Committee on Natural Resources on May 15.
The picture shows the remarkable disconnect between predicted global warming and the real world.
The red line is the 5-year running average temperature change forecast, beginning in 1979, predicted by the UN’s latest family of climate models, many of which are the handiwork of our own federal science establishment. The forecasts are for the average temperature change in the lower atmosphere, away from the confounding effects of cities, forestry, and agriculture.
The blue circles are the average lower-atmospheric temperature changes from four different analyses of global weather balloon data, and the green squares are the average of the two widely accepted analyses of satellite-sensed temperature. Both of these are thought to be pretty solid because they come from calibrated instruments.
If you look at data through 1995 the forecast appears to be doing quite well. That’s because the computer models appear to have, at least in essence, captured two periods of slight cooling.
The key word is “appear.” The computer models are tuned to account for big volcanoes that are known to induce temporary cooling in the lower atmosphere. These would be the 1982 eruption of El Chichon in Mexico, and 1992’s spectacular Mt. Pinatubo, the biggest natural explosion on earth since Alaska’s Katmai in 1912.
Since Pinatubo, the earth has been pretty quiescent, so that warming from increasing carbon dioxide should proceed unimpeded. Obviously, the spread between forecast and observed temperatures grows pretty much every year, and is now a yawning chasm.
It’s impossible, as a scientist, to look at this graph and not rage at the destruction of science that is being wreaked by the inability of climatologists to look us in the eye and say perhaps the three most important words in life: we were wrong.

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
It’s been a few weeks since the U.N.’s Paris Climate Conference (COP21) ended. Mainstream media from around the globe praised the impotent agreement, as though anyone expects political promises to be kept. The COP21 agreement reminded me of the proverb A promise is a comfort for a fool.
Fantasy headlines read:

This is the end of fossil fuels (CNN)
Historic Paris climate pact puts world on green path (TheHindu)
COP21 Delegates vote to adopt historic deal (EuroNews)
COP21: President Obama celebrates Paris deal that ‘transformed the US’ (Independent)

There are many more.
But one headline made me laugh out loud. It still makes me smile. It was penned by none other than SkepticalScience’s Dana Nuccitelli, whose article was posted at his home blog SkepticalScience and at TheGuardian two weeks ago. His headline read:
The Paris agreement signals that deniers have lost the climate wars
Mr. Nuccitelli needs to ask himself why the U.N.’s climate agreement is non-binding…why the “shalls” were replaced with “shoulds”…why the teeth of the agreement were extracted…why commitments became empty promises. (See proverb above.) Answer: Republican members of congress—who Mr. Nuccitelli would most assuredly classify as deniers—would never have ratified an agreement that actually commits the United States to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
I have yet to find another post-COP21 headline that made me laugh as hard, though the Independent’s “COP21: President Obama celebrates Paris deal that ‘transformed the US’” came in a close second.

"Sea Ode Two
We think with each succeeding year
Our worries are a new idea
And chicks who think the sky is falling
Keep cropping up at rates appalling.
“Hold your breath” you hear them shout
“And never let your methane out”.
While the sheep are ruminating
Here’s some facts for contemplating.
Man’s CO2 (not many may know)
Is swamped by every live volcano.
Most chlorides come from nature’s stack
To blame us then is pretty slack.
The ozone hole down south of us –
Yawns right above Mt Erebus!!!
The sea will rise, the sea will fall
There’s nothing surer – after all.
That’s what was in days of yore
And will be for ever more
Despite our presence; and our fate
Is micro in the macro, mate.
This greenhouse panic now it’s clear
Is nothing more than atmos-fear.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis morning, even here in the North German lowlands, close to sea level, snow fell as temperatures hovered near the freezing point.
Currently many Germans are struggling under snow, ice and cold as winter terminates spring for the time being. The cause: a low pressure centered over the Baltic Sea pumping in cold polar air through Europe.

Winter transforms Germany’s Thuringia Forest into a winter wonderland today. Massberg webcam photo 11.07 a.m.
Newsite Thuringia Antenne here writes that winter has returned and will stick around for awhile, reporting of icy roads, accidents and cold. Meteorologist Dominik Jung of www.wetter.net forecasts 5 to 10 cm of snow across wide regions of Germany, especially Bavaria and Thuringia.

The Rheinbrücke at Rees had to be closed for over an hour and a half early this morning due to accidents from icy conditions, the RP Online reports here.
Sub-zero temperatures were recorded at a number of weather stations throughout Germany this morning.
In the northeastern state of Saxony Bild national daily reports by video of a snow chaos as travelers struggle with an “enormous snow mass” as roads become impassable from the snow and snow plows are unable to keep up. The snow is expected to stay at elevations over 400 – 600 meters, wetter.net reports.
Much of Europe is forecast to remain cold at least for the next 7 days, as the following chart shows negative temperature anomalies:

 In his viedo forecast from this morning, meteorologist Jung says for now, “Spring is nowhere in sight.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s more fallout from the climate-religious attempts to suppress a scientist who dares to offer alternative ideas to global warming dogma.
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne here.

On Augsut 16, 2016, in the German Wirtschaftswoche (Business Week) Cora Stephan looked at the dubious attempts to suppress and censor science.
Climate science that does not fit the global narrative
[…] No significant increase in the global mean temperature has taken place, a point that was even conceeded by climate scientist Mojib Latif, who is a follower of the greenhouse hypothesis. Yet no one is about to allow his research institute to be busted up, and especially not our ‘climate pope’ [Hans-Joachim] Schellnhuber. Also the ‘climate chancellow’ is well aware of the papal announcement of a climate catastrophe. The call on the guilty conscience of man is and remains a helpful instrument for rule in the sense of: if you do not do what you are told, then the world will come to an end. That not only works on children. No matter what ‘climate skeptics’ may tell us, with a bit of creativity every doomsayser brings reality in harmony with the theory. And the theory says that it is mankind that is causing a climate catastrophe with its emissions of CO2. Climate chancellor Angela Merkel here is infallible – even if recently she has had other things to worry about. […] Climatologists apparently attempted to suppress the publication of propositions [Zharkova’s]. They even refuse to exchange controversial ideas. Such behavior causes scientists to turn into religious warriors who feel automatically compelled to regard divergent opinions as blasphemy because articles of faith may never be falsified. What is correct? In all cases productive doubt, and always: The free exchange of ideas and hypotheses, the disentanglement of politics, morality and science. However foremost: the unconditional freedom of science.”

"**US lawmakers have supported Hong Kong protesters by passing a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city.**
The bill - which still needs to pass the upper house, the Senate - would mandate an annual review, to see whether Hong Kong had sufficient autonomy from the rest of China to justify its special trading status.
The lower chamber also approved stopping tear gas exports to Hong Kong.
On Monday, Hong Kong protesters took to the streets to support the US bill.
The bill passed by the House of Representatives - which was introduced in June as Hong Kong's protests took hold \- says Hong Kong enjoys ""unique treatment under US law"".
""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system,"" it says.
""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law.""
Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland.
The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests.
And it says anyone ""responsible for abducting and torturing people for exercising internationally-recognized human rights"" should be barred from the US - and have sanctions imposed.
The bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats and was passed by a ""voice vote"" in the House of Representatives, meaning a recorded vote was not needed.
""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world,"" said house speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat, said: ""The house just sent a strong message to the people of Hong Kong: we stand with you in the fight for democracy and justice.""
The so-called ""PROTECT Hong Kong Act"" is designed to stop US exports of non-lethal crowd control weapons, such as tear gas and rubber bullets.
The bill says such items have been used ""unnecessarily and disproportionately"" by Hong Kong police.
It also needs to be approved by the Senate.
Lawmakers also approved a non-binding resolution recognising Hong Kong's relationship to the United States, which condemns Beijing's ""interference"".
After the bill was passed, Beijing called for Washington to ""stop meddling"".
""We express our strong indignation and firm opposition to the US House of Representatives' insistence on passing the so-called 'Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act',"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.
China's relationship with the United States would be damaged should the bill become law, the spokesman added.
Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement.
The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets.
Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing.
The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality."

The Middle East has turned hostile to Christians and other religious minorities. The Iraqi Christian community has been devastated. Syria’s civil war loosed the murderous Islamic State on Christians and others. Libya’s disintegration opened the nation to IS fighters bent on killing anyone of the wrong faith.



Also at risk are Egypt’s Copts, who make up about ten percent of that country’s population. Coptic Christians predate Islam and played an important role in Egypt’s development. But they long suffered from discrimination and persecution.



Under dictator Hosni Mubarak the U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty “poor” and noted that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.” Moreover, explained State, the government “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.”



At times state‐​controlled media and -funded mosques encouraged violence. Attacks on Copts were common and perpetrators rarely were prosecuted. Indeed, victims sometimes were arrested too. The government also failed to respond seriously to the kidnapping of Christian girls who were forced to marry Muslims.



Even when the authorities did not actively persecute Copts, observed Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity.” As elsewhere in the Middle East, converts and Baha’is tended to be most at risk. Reported William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law: “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment—including imprisonment and sadistic torture.” Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy blamed Mubarak’s regime “for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Understandably, Mubarak’s overthrow led Copts to hope for a freer and safer Egypt. But President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood failed to accept checks on executive authority, accommodate political opponents who feared centralization of power, and reassure those who feared the Brotherhood was determined to Islamicize Egyptian society. Indeed, violent attacks on Copts increased.



Morsi was not the only culprit. Responsible for many incidents were Salafists, who emerged as allies of the army against the Muslim Brotherhood. Moreover, reported the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, after the revolution “military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators.” In one infamous case the military, then headed by Gen. Abdel Fattah al‐​Sisi, shot down more than a score of Coptic protesters. As a result, USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern.



Three years ago al‐​Sisi overthrew Morsi and eventually became president. While the previous Coptic Pope Shenouda III was controversially connected to Mubarak, Pope Tawadros II publicly supported the coup and subsequently called al‐​Sisi a “hero.” Coptic film critic Joseph Fahim said the revolt “was a renewal of hope, a promise of a secular Egypt where political Islam will never have a say again. The then‐​field Marshall Sisis was no mere military leader; he was the great savior.”





Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have few good options.



Alas, secular saviors rarely keep faith with Christians. This case was no different. The military used extreme brutality—killing hundreds of demonstrators on the streets of Cairo—to maintain control. But the church remained as vulnerable as it was visible, and found itself targeted by angry Islamists because of its high profile support for the military. Dozens of churches were destroyed. A priest at the Church of Two Saints in Alexandria, Father Mina Adel, told Breitbart that “Most of our people are afraid” and many were leaving.



In January al‐​Sisi celebrated Christmas at a Coptic service and promised to rebuild churches that had been destroyed. He apologized for past inaction: “This year everything will be fixed,” he said. Some Copts, including in the U.S., appeared to take al‐​Sisi at his word and believed he would act as defender of the church.



So far, however, the government has delivered more promises than actions. Mina Thabet of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms complained that al‐​Sisi was no liberal and “doesn’t care about religious freedom.” Certainly he evidenced no interest prior to assembling support for the coup.



Nor is the only problem attacks on churches (which have diminished). Egypt’s blasphemy law is frequently deployed against Christians. In fact, the government never stopped targeting Copts. Fahim pointed out in July 2014: “Copts, too, are not safe from the new government’s oppressive measures. Two weeks ago, a 23‐​year‐​old Coptic teacher was sentenced to prison for six months for insulting Islam. On June 23, a Christian convert reporter was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly reporting false information about discrimination against Copts. The following day, a 29‐​year‐​old Copt from Upper Egypt was given a five‐​year prison sentence for liking a Facebook page put up by a group of Christian converts—so much for the secular utopia we conjured in our imagination.”



The State Department’s most recent religious freedom report, from 2014, noted that Egypt’s government did not recognize conversion from Islam, prosecuted people for religious defamation and blasphemy, and failed to respond to attacks on Christians. “Accountability for previous sectarian crimes was uneven,” noted State. Moreover, “The government failed to prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minority groups, which fostered a climate of impunity.”



Last year’s USCIRF annual report concluded: “the Egyptian government has not adequately protected religious minorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians and their property, from periodic violence. Discriminatory and repressive laws and policies that restrict freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief remain in place. Egyptian courts continue to prosecute, convict, and imprison Egyptian citizens for blasphemy, and new government initiatives to counter atheism emerged during the year.”



Those who commit sectarian violence generally are not convicted, leaving conditions for Copts “precarious.” Baha’is and Jehovah’s Witnesses are banned, while anti‐​Semitism is rife. Blasphemy cases are on the upswing. Most cases are brought against Sunni Muslims but, noted the Commission, “the majority of those sentenced by a court to prison terms for blasphemy have been Christians, Shi’a Muslims, and atheists, mostly based on flawed trials.” In February four teenage Copts were sentenced to five years in prison for a video directed against the Islamic State but treated as an attack on Islam. At the end of March the court upheld a three‐​year sentence against the poet Fatma Naoot for “contempt of religion” and “insulting Islam.”



Indeed, al‐​Sisi may be consciously using ostentatious state piety to maintain power in a society in which social hostility runs high against religious minorities. In reporting on the conviction of Naoot, who, ironically, had supported al‐​Sisi, the _Washington Post’s_ Sudarsan Raghavan explained: “there have been more religious‐​based convictions during President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s time in office than under the Islamist government the former general replaced two years ago.” Film director Ama Salama argued that “What happened with Fatma Naoot would have never happened under the time of Mubarak, or under the time of the revolution, or under Morsi.”



Even if Copts believe they remain safer under al‐​Sisi, they may have sold their liberty birthrate for what turns out to be a mess of security pottage. With the al‐​Sisi government instituting its own reign of terror, the Coptic Church appears to be on the side of the oppressors. Fahim contemplated Cairo’s urban massacre, which was bloodier than Tiananmen Square: “The Coptic Orthodox Church watched the bloodshed and did nothing.” And that was just the beginning.



Copts live in the same unfree society as everyone else. Fahim wrote two years ago: “more than 40,000 arrests have been made since Morsi’s overthrow, journalists have been prosecuted, artists have been censored, opposition voices have been violently silenced, dissented politicians have been witch‐​hunted, the Mubarak regime has successfully reassembled itself, institutional corruption has grown more rampant, the country has descended into further chaos and fear has become the prevailing sentiment of the day.”



Today the government targets all critics, including many who opposed Mubarak. In fact, the regime outlawed the April 6 democracy movement which organized protests against the previous dictator. Some activists received lengthy terms for participating in similar demonstrations against al‐​Sisi. TV host Wael al‐​Ibrashi originally supported the military but recently told the _Wall Street Journal_ that the Mubarak “apparatus” is using violence to return to power.



The State Department’s 2015 human rights report on Egypt is a depressing read: “The most significant human rights problems were excessive use of force by security forces, deficiencies in due process, and the suppression of civil liberties. Excessive use of force included unlawful killings and torture. Due process problems included the excessive use of preventative custody and pretrial detention, the use of military courts to try civilians, and trials involving hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on an individual basis. Civil liberties problems included societal and governmental restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press, as well as on the freedoms of assembly and association.”



The human rights group Freedom House recently judged Egypt to be “not free” and getting worse. The group cited “the complete marginalization of the opposition, state surveillance of electronic communications, public exhortations to report critics of the government to the authorities, and the mass trials and unjustified imprisonment of members of the Muslim Brotherhood.” In the name of fighting terrorism journalists who contradict the government face fines and arrest.



Many people simply disappear. Explained Khaled Mansour, a writer and former executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights: “Security officers kidnap individuals they believe are activists, force them to provide information or testify to wrongdoing, and deny for days, weeks or months that they are keeping them in custody. Some of those kidnapped are then taken to court—or released—while the whereabouts of others remain unknown.” The security forces appear to be largely unaccountable, perhaps even to the government.



To be so detained is said to be going “behind the sun,” a phrase dating back to the dictatorship of Gamal Abdel Nasser, since anyone looking for you may go blind. Last year Human Rights Watch documented several cases of “enforced disappearances.” Public attention in Egypt focused on student Esraa al‐​Taweel, who was kidnapped along with two male friends and taken to the headquarters of state security, where the two men were tortured into confessing to violent activity.



The latest case to embarrass the government involves 28‐​year‐​old Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was investigating Egyptian labor unions. He disappeared in January; his mutilated body, which sustained the sort of torture typically inflicted by the security forces, was discovered several days later. The government initially blamed his death on a car accident, but later claimed he was murdered by a newly discovered criminal gang, whose members all happened to be killed at a police checkpoint.Finally, Cairo currently is engaged in a systematic campaign to shut down organizations which simply report on government abuses. Scores of domestic and international NGOs engaged in documenting human rights violations reportedly are under criminal investigation. Last month the government sought to freeze the personal assets of Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid, founders respectively of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Arabic Network for Human Rights Information.



Another human rights advocate, Negad al‐​Borai, had been detained and threatened with criminal charges. The regime also launched legal attacks on the women’s organization Nazra for Feminist Studies and the anti‐​torture Nadeem Center. The Working Group on Egypt, whose members include leading neoconservatives such as Robert Kagan and Elliott Abrams, warned that these efforts are part of the “Egyptian authorities’ campaign to crush the last remnants of Egypt’s independent civil society and human rights community.”



Two years ago I was a member of a delegation of lawyers who visited the Nadeem Center. We met with co‐​founder and psychiatry professor Aida Seif al‐​Dawla, who told us that torture was more pervasive then than at any point during the Mubarak era. Security personnel acted with complete impunity. Last year, reported the organization, the government abducted 464 people, caused the death of nearly 500 detainees, and tortured at least 676 people. Since February the government has been attempting to shut down the center. Seif al‐​Dawla told the Associated Press: “The problem now is that you cannot predict what can put you in jail or not.”



In short, Egypt is scary for anyone who dissents. People disappear and die. Prison conditions are harsh. Judicial verdicts reflect political demands. Journalists are punished for expressing independent opinions. Academic freedom is restricted. Human rights organizations are harassed and closed. Official corruption has spread. Security forces act with impunity.



Unfortunately, sustained repression has only encouraged radicalization and more terrorist attacks. Which raises questions about the stability of al-Sisi’s rule. In April public protests erupted over the gifting of two islands to Saudi Arabia, apparently in exchange for financial “aid” received. Egyptians unwilling to turn out on behalf of democracy demonstrated against this public prostration before Riyadh. Rumors of military dissatisfaction with al‐​Sisi abound.



In the end Coptic Christians could end up more vulnerable than ever. The al‐​Sisi dictatorship does little to protect them and his promises of aid remain unfulfilled. Yet the Coptic Church has tied itself to his rule, which grows ever more repressive. If he falls, Copts again could find themselves targeted, but this time by a much wider proportion of the population.



Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have few good options. Unfortunately, Coptic reliance on Egypt’s al‐​Sisi increasingly looks like a bad deal. He is delivering little of the secularism that was supposed to accompany his dictatorship. Worse, his brutal repression violates Christian principles and risks triggering another revolution, one in which Copts might find themselves to be targets. Now is the time to search for a new approach that doesn’t sacrifice national liberty for sectarian security.

"**Anti-government marches in Hong Kong have ended in rioting, with attacks on government offices, a metro station and businesses with ties to mainland China.**
Police used water cannon, tear gas and truncheons, reportedly removing masks from demonstrators they arrested, and a number of people were injured.
Tens of thousands of protesters had turned out in the rain, spurred to act by a ban on wearing masks at rallies.
The controversial ban was upheld by the High Court on Sunday.
It was introduced by chief executive Carrie Lam who invoked powers dating back to colonial rule by the British.
Sunday's protests were fuelled by both the mask ban and the use by police of live bullets against protesters, which left two people injured this week.
A wave of rioting in Friday led city metro services to shut down but they had partially resumed on Sunday.
Demonstrators fear that democratic rights are being eroded in the semi-autonomous territory under Chinese rule.
The protesters' aim was to make clear their utter contempt for the emergency law banning face masks and almost all covered their faces, the BBC's Robin Brant reports from Hong Kong.
Police watched as protesters moved peacefully, chanting ""Hong Kong resist"" as they walked through the heart of the city, but after a few hours officers moved to end the disruption.
Tear gas canisters were fired on the crowd from police on walkway bridges above. Video shows small groups being targeted by charging officers on the ground.
Many shops were again closing early on Sunday evening in anticipation of more trouble, our correspondent says.
Among incidents on Sunday:
Many more people turned out for the new marches than on Saturday, when a small march was held in the aftermath of Friday's rioting.
""I'm not sure how many more chances we'll get to fight for freedom,"" said Hazel Chan, 18, who was wearing a surgical face mask when she spoke to the BBC near a road block on the city's Rodney Street.
""I don't think it'll have a big impact on the government's stance but I hope we gain international attention and show the world we won't get used to this evil law.""
Fellow demonstrator Riley Fung, 19, said: ""I don't have much confidence in protests because the government has ignored our demands even when millions came out.""
But she continued to protest, she added, in order to express herself.
**By Helier Cheung, BBC News, Admiralty, Hong Kong**
Despite the pouring rain, the mood was defiant. Thousands of protesters joined the unauthorised march, wearing masks despite the emergency law, blocking and marching down roads, and chanting slogans such as ""Hong Kong revolt"" and ""stand with Hong Kong"" in Cantonese and English.
Despite the clear defiance of the law, there were hardly any police to be seen in the first few hours. Protesters set up a road block, dug up bricks, and tied banners condemning the government onto flyovers.
Then, seemingly out of nowhere, several tear gas canisters were fired. Tensions flared further as a convoy of dozens of police vans suddenly emerged - protesters shouted ""the water cannon is coming"" and ran down the streets. Within an hour or so, the roads were open again - and the protesters had seemingly melted away.
Ms Lam vowed on Saturday to prevent further violence, saying: ""We cannot allow rioters any more to destroy our treasured Hong Kong.""
She justified the law against masks as a response to the demonstrators' ""extreme violence"" which was, she said, endangering Hong Kong's public safety.
A second legal challenge to the mask ban, which was brought by opposition legislators, was rejected by the High Court.
The legislators had argued that the prohibition was unconstitutional because it denied the rights of free expression and free assembly.
Over the months, clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent.
On Tuesday, police shot a protester with a live bullet for the first time, wounding an 18-year-old, who was allegedly attacking a police officer.
On Friday, a boy aged 14 was shot in the leg with a live round in Yuen Long, a town to the west of the city.
A plain-clothes police officer with an unmarked police car was later set upon by rioters in the same area but officials did not link the two incidents, the South China Morning Post reports.
Hong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.
It has a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that guarantees it some autonomy, and its people certain freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.
But those freedoms - the Basic Law - are only enshrined until 2047 and it is not clear what will happen then."
"The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens. In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf  —   who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses  —   expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses   language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here. ” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12. 30 a. m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words,   throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first   with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a   marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul. ”"
